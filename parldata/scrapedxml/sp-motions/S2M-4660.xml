*S2M-4660 Chris Ballance: Combat Stress—That the Parliament praises the ongoing work of the charity, Combat Stress, in helping ex-servicemen and women who suffer from mental ill-health, including the work of staff at Hollybush House in Ayrshire, the only residential centre in Scotland for soldiers suffering from combat trauma and stress; notes the charity’s increased workload in recent years due to the Gulf, Bosnian, Afghanistan and Iraq wars; notes the questioning of a former soldier over the tragic recent murders of four members of the same family in Newcastle; notes Combat Stress’s newly launched campaign to raise £150,000 to continue providing specialist therapies for psychologically wounded veterans in the coming months, and urges the Scottish Executive to do everything possible to support Hollybush House to ensure that war veterans receive the treatment which they need and deserve.
