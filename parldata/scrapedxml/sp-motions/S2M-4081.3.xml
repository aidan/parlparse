*S2M-4081.3 Eleanor Scott: Agriculture Strategyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4081) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "and approves" to end and insert "and considers that this commitment should be underpinned by specific targets; further supports transparency and regulation in a food supply chain which empowers farmers through fair trading relationships; acknowledges the central role of public procurement in delivering the strategy; notes with concern that planned budgets to support organic farming are inadequate to develop its key role in Scottish agriculture, and rejects the technology of genetic modification as economically and environmentally unjustifiable."
