 *S1M-1558# Mr Adam Ingram: Restoring Prosperity in Cumnock - Doon Valley—That the Parliament notes with concern the lack of progress made by successive governments in creating access to jobs and prosperity for the people of Cumnock and Doon Valley; believes that the average houshold income in Cumnock and Doon Valley, reported at £16,500 compared to the UK average of £23,200, illustrates the failure of these governments’ economic policies designed as they are to meet the needs of the South East of England; welcomes the recent announcements by the Scottish Executive to increase funding for the fight against poverty and deprivation in Cumnock and Doon Valley by the East Ayrshire Coalfield Area Social Inclusion Partnership and to establish a better Neighbourhood Services Fund for the area; recognises, however, that to transform rather than ameliorate living standards requires substantial public investment in infrastructure and increased support for expansion and development of new and existing businesses in the Ayrshire economy, and urges the Scottish Executive to seek the transfer of currently reserved powers with regard to economic policy so that jobs and prosperity can be restored to areas such as Cumnock and Doon Valley.
