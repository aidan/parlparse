 *S2M-3391u Christine Grahame: Common Good Funds - Where are They?—That the Parliament notes the existence of many local common good funds, such as those in Peebles and other Borders towns, comprising movable and heritable property and revenues but notes that there is often no comprehensive inventory of those assets which might not even be insured; notes that these often have considerable monetary as well as historic value; notes further that there are recorded instances of disposals of common good assets which should not have occurred, and considers therefore, as a first step, that the Scottish Executive should require local authorities to provide, as soon as practicable, a publicly accessible inventory of those common good assets in their stewardship.
