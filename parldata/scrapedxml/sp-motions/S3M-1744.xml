 *S3M-1744 Bill Wilson: Arms Shipment to Zimbabwe and Interference in a Country’s Internal Affairs—That the Parliament welcomes the statement by the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU), that it would be "grossly irresponsible" to allow a shipment of Chinese weapons through to Zimbabwe and that "the South African government cannot be seen as propping up a military regime"; applauds South African dock workers for refusing to unload the ship bearing the weapons; is in agreement with the government of China that "one of the most important principles is not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries" but is of the opinion that providing the present government of Zimbabwe with the means of thwarting the democratically expressed wishes of its people would constitute unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of another country and that China’s longstanding support of Mugabe’s brutal and anti-democratic regime also constitutes such interference; believes that the actions and statements of SATAWU and the Southern Africa Litigation Centre are representative of the wishes of the majority of the people of Zimbabwe, and calls on all governments, but particularly those of the countries of Southern Africa, to do what they can to ensure that the wishes of these people be respected and assist the peaceful transfer of power to a democratically elected government.
