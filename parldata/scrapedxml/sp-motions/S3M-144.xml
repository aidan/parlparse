*S3M-144 Liam McArthur: Orkney and Shetland Junior Inter-Countyâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the junior inter-county associations from both Orkney and Shetland on the occasion of their 60th anniversary; recognises the very positive impact that the inter-county competition has had in developing sporting achievement among young people in the islands; welcomes the opportunities that it has provided for building ties and friendships between the communities in both Orkney and Shetland, and applauds the tremendous efforts of the many volunteers over the years who have done so much to make the Stuart Cup not only possible but a continuing success.
