*S3M-6102 Stuart McMillan: Inverclyde Schools Community Space Programme—That the Parliament welcomes the Community Space Programme artwork by pupils at St Columba’s High School, Gourock, and Notre Dame High School, Greenock, which is on display at the Tramway, Glasgow, between 25 March to 5 April 2010; notes that the pupils from both schools were asked to create places where people of all ages could meet, mix and play and that they chose four areas of land in Inverclyde that they would like to change for the better; further notes that Stand, an award-winning design-based company, worked in collaboration with the pupils to create their designs and that the exhibition was also sponsored by Inverclyde Council and Ballyconnelly Group, which is an Inverclyde-based property development company; acknowledges the hard work of all the pupils, from both schools, to create their designs, and looks forward to their talented work being recognised by members of the public who visit the Tramway.
