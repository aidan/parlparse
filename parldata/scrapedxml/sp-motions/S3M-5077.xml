*S3M-5077 Bob Doris: Glasgow Labour Silences Those Who Speak out against Organised Crime—That the Parliament expresses concern that the Labour-controlled Glasgow City Council appears to be gagging opposition councillors to prevent them from speaking out within the council against organised crime by refusing to allow a motion to be put forward in the names of Councillor McAllister and Councillor Greene; considers that the motion in question was to have been debated on Thursday 29 October 2009 at a full meeting of Glasgow City Council and would have allowed debate in relation to safety concerns at the Applerow Motors MOT testing centre in Lambhill in Glasgow, which was the scene of a gangland-style shooting in 2006; further considers that the motion would have exposed the lack of action by the Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis, on this matter and the inability of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to deal with such matters; is disappointed that Glasgow’s Lord Provost, Bob Winters, has called the motion not competent or relevant, and believes that this is an example of the Labour party attempting to talk tough on crime but in reality attempting to silence those who are trying to take a stand and effect real action against organised criminals.
