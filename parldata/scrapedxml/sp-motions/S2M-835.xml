*S2M-835# Shona Robison: Hepatitis C Ex Gratia Payment Scheme-That the Parliament notes that the ex gratia payment scheme for people infected with hepatitis C from NHS blood or blood products will now be administered through a UK-wide scheme; regrets that there has been a delay of over a year in establishing this scheme due to protracted negotiations between the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government; believes that the scheme is flawed as it does not include payments to the relatives of those who have died from hepatitis C, and further believes that the Executive should reconsider the level of payments and the exclusion of family members from the ex gratia payment scheme. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Christine Grahame*, Rob Gibson*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Nicola Sturgeon*, Stewart Stevenson*
