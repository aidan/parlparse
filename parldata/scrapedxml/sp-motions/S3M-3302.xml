 *S3M-3302 Hugh O’Donnell: BBC and the Gaza Appeal—That the Parliament condemns the decision of broadcasters to refuse to provide air time to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeals in relation to the humanitarian disaster in Gaza; believes that this is a breach of their moral obligations, which will contribute to the suffering of the civilian population of Gaza, and calls on all politicians and civic persons to withdraw their cooperation with these broadcasting organisations until they meet their moral obligation to respond to humanitarian disasters like the one in Gaza.
