*S3M-8187 Annabel Goldie: Greenock Telegraph’s IRH campaign shortlisted for Scottish Press Award—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that the Greenock Telegraph’s campaign to save the League of Hospital Friends charity tea bar at Inverclyde Royal Hospital has been shortlisted for a Scottish Press Award; notes that the "Tele" is one of only five newspapers nominated in the Campaign of the Year category and is competing against titles including The Scottish Sun and the Evening Times; recalls that the Save the IRH Tea Bar campaign rallied people across Inverclyde against the closure of the popular venue, which has raised over £1 million for the hospital, and its proposed replacement with a corporate-style coffee shop; recognises local campaigners for gathering 20,000 signatures and convincing NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to rethink its plans; commends the Greenock Telegraph for the crucial role that it played in giving a voice to the grassroots campaign and helping to inspire its readers to action; regards campaigning journalism as the heart and soul of local newspapers and believes that it strengthens democracy and civil society, and wishes the Greenock Telegraph team all the best for the big night.
