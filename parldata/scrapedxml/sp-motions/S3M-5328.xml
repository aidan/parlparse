 S3M-5328# Claire Baker: 40 Years of the Open University—That the Parliament congratulates the Open University on its 40th year; recognises the key role that Harold Wilson and Jennie Lee played in developing the Open University; supports the positive work that the university does in Scotland as an accessible and innovative way for people to fulfil their ambitions for lifelong learning and social mobility, providing learning opportunities to the widest possible range of people and contributing to Scotland’s economic development; notes that it is now the United Kingdom’s largest university, teaching almost 200,000 students a year and, since opening in 1969, it has helped over two million people realise their potential; notes the central role that part-time higher education, such as that delivered by the Open University, has to play in supporting upskilling and reskilling in Scotland’s workforce, and considers that appropriately resourced part-time flexible learning has the potential to make an even more significant contribution to supporting Scotland’s skills agenda and to promoting educational opportunity and social justice.  Supported by: Jackie Baillie, Richard Baker, Rhona Brankin, Marlyn Glen, Patrick Harvie, Elizabeth Smith, Mr Frank McAveety, Bill Butler, David Whitton, Ms Wendy Alexander, Kenneth Gibson, Cathie Craigie, Patricia Ferguson, Karen Whitefield, Hugh Henry, Jamie Hepburn, Liam McArthur, Elaine Smith, Robin Harper, Jack McConnell, Pauline McNeill, Mary Mulligan, John Park, Jim Tolson, Murdo Fraser, Marilyn Livingstone, Sarah Boyack, Gil Paterson, Des McNulty, Trish Godman, Helen Eadie, Jim Hume
