 * S2M-1638 Christine Grahame:Hidden Treasure—That the Parliament, in recognition of the historic and political significance of the “Arniston” stone, a 400- year-old lintel that was salvaged by Robert Dundas in the 1800s from the original Scottish Parliament, where it had formed part of the façade, and has been returned to the Parliament, its original home, by the current owner of Arniston House, calls for it to be moved from its current inconspicuous location to a place of significance above the public entrance for all to see.
