*S3M-3465 Christina McKelvie: Calman Threat to Students in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the views expressed on university and student funding in the first report of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution that "further devolution would almost certainly affect the functioning of the UK as a single social unit" and its invitation of further views on the policy context of higher education; is concerned by the clear implication that differing systems in this area are damaging and should be avoided; welcomes the positive dialogue existing between the Scottish Government and Scottish university principals; notes, by contrast, the introduction by the UK Government of £3,000 per year top-up fees and much higher levels of state-sanctioned student indebtedness to fund higher education; considers the Calman position to pose a direct threat to students at Scottish universities, and believes firmly that the Scottish Parliament should continue to have responsibility for the funding of universities and student support.
