*S2M-1940.4 Robert Brown: A Better Deal for Pensioners—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "welcomes the progress made by the Scottish Executive in ensuring a better deal for pensioners through the introduction of free personal care, a national free off-peak bus scheme and a free central heating and insulation scheme; recognises that pensions policy is reserved to the UK Government; believes that the UK government’s policy on pensions has failed as nearly 2 million pensioners are missing out on the pension credits that they are entitled to and deserve due to demeaning and unworkable means-testing, and further believes that the state pension must be reformed to ensure that everyone has a decent income in retirement by implementing the Liberal Democrat proposal for a Citizen’s Pension, initially for those over 75, with entitlement based on residency and not National Insurance contributions, restoring the link between earnings and pensions, making older pensioners better off by £25 per week for single pensioners and lifting one million UK pensioners out of means-testing."
