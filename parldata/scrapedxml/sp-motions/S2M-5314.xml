 *S2M-5314 Robin Harper: Balloon Ban—That the Parliament congratulates Shetland Islands Council on banning the release of balloons because of the severe environmental damage which they cause, particularly to marine life, but also to cattle, birds and land mammals when ingested, and calls on the Scottish Executive and the rest of Scotland’s local authorities to work together towards an outright ban on balloon releases throughout Scotland, other than for scientific purposes.
