*S3M-2854 Jackie Baillie: Mindroom—That the Parliament notes that Scottish learning difficulties charity Mindroom has launched a major campaign aimed at securing more integrated support for children and adults with learning difficulties; notes the research indicating that more than one-in-six children has a recognised learning difficulty and calls for greater medical and statistical research in this area; strongly supports Mindroom’s focus on integrating support for people with learning difficulties under three pillars, namely, assessment and diagnosis, research and development, and education and training; believes that the creation of centres combining these facilities under one roof represents a potentially revolutionary way of supporting people with learning difficulties and their families, and would welcome creation of the world’s first such Mindroom in Scotland, allowing Scotland to take a global lead in promoting integrated support for those with learning difficulties. Supported by: Karen Whitefield*, Ross Finnie*, Des McNulty*, David Whitton*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Bill Kidd*, Robin Harper*
