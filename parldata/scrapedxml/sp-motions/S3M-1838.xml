*S3M-1838 Linda Fabiani: International Framework—That the Parliament recognises the importance of ensuring that Scotland is competitive in an increasingly globalised society; agrees that creating the conditions for talented people to live, learn, visit, work and remain in Scotland is crucial to helping to deliver the goals of growing Scotland’s population and economy in a sustainable way, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s International Framework as a means to extend, focus and align the actions and policies of the government and public sector partners to these ends.
