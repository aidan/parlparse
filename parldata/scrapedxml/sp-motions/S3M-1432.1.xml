*S3M-1432.1 Kenny MacAskill: Protecting Scotland’s Children—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1432) in the name of Paul Martin, leave out from "the crucial role" to end and insert "that appropriate utilisation of DNA samples and fingerprints can play an important role in identifying offenders but that it is vital to strike the right balance between prosecuting criminals and protecting the innocent and notes the review that the Scottish Government has commissioned from Professor James Fraser; recognises the extensive powers already available to the police in monitoring sex offenders and ensuring public safety, and notes the Scottish Government’s liaison with the Home Office as disclosure pilots progress in four English police areas and the Scottish Government’s proposal to monitor the outcomes of these pilots to determine what lessons there might be for Scotland, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s proposal to write to the Convener of the Scottish Parliament’s Justice Committee to report progress on each of the 33 recommendations made by the Justice 2 Sub-committee report J2SC/S2/06/R1."
