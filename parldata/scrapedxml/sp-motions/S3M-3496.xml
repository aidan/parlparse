*S3M-3496 Jackie Baillie: Keeping Services Local at the Vale of Leven Hospital—That the Parliament regrets the recommendations being presented to a meeting of the board of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that, if accepted, will result in the removal of the 24/7 anaesthetics service and consequent transfer of coronary care and treatment for strokes, gastrointestinal bleeds and epileptic seizures from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; further regrets the recommendation to close the Christie Ward, which provides invaluable inpatient acute mental health services to the local community; strongly considers that the views of the local community will have been totally ignored if these recommendations are approved by the board; further considers that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has failed to integrate health services properly in this area; believes that as many inpatient services as possible should be delivered at the Vale of Leven Hospital but considers that insufficient attention has been given to a reconfiguration of services north of the river based on a revised catchment area and including access to the Golden Jubilee National Hospital; further notes that the recommendations to the board are not keeping services local, as promised by the Scottish Government, and therefore calls on the board of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to reject these proposals, to retain 24/7 anaesthetics and the Christie Ward at the Vale of Leven Hospital and to reconfigure services to be delivered north of the river. Supported by: David Stewart*, Ross Finnie*, Paul Martin*, Dr Richard Simpson*
