*S2M-921 Robin Harper: Asthma in Scotland-That the Parliament notes with great concern the recently published research by the Global Initiative for Asthma indicating that Scotland has the world's highest incidence of asthma in children; further notes that National Asthma Campaign Scotland estimates that the condition costs Scotland Â£194.9 million per year and that 3.5 million asthma sufferers in the UK say that traffic pollution aggravates their condition; further notes the lack of definitive research establishing the causes of asthma and that tackling the issue has focussed on treatment of symptoms rather than addressing root causes, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to invest in further research in order to establish why Scotland suffers such high rates of asthma and how the causes of this can be addressed.
