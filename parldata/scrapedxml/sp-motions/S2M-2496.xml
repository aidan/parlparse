*S2M-2496 Mike Watson: Glasgow City Council’s Gaelic Education Provision—That the Parliament welcomes Glasgow City Council’s decision to relocate the Glasgow Gaelic School and Nursery Class to a refurbished building on the site of the former Woodside Secondary School; recognises that this is in response to the continuing increase in demand by parents who want their children to be educated in the medium of Gaelic; notes that the new Glasgow Gaelic School will provide education for pupils aged 3 to 18 on an incremental basis; further notes the appointment of a Head Teacher, Depute Head Teacher (Primary) and Depute Head Teacher (Secondary) to oversee the organisation of the school for commencement in August 2006, and believes that this positive development, following the establishment of Bòrd na Gàidhlig in 2003 and the introduction of the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill in the Parliament, will help secure the future of Gaelic, part of Scotland’s cultural heritage.
