 *S3M-6113 Bill Kidd: A New Start for Nuclear Disarmament—That the Parliament welcomes the signing of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by US President Obama and Russian President Medvedev, which, once ratified by lawmakers in the US and Russia, will see a reduction in the number of deployed nuclear warheads possessed by both powers to no more than 1,550; considers that this treaty provides a clear and practicable starting point for further reduction of nuclear stockpiles globally, with a view to achieving a world completely free of nuclear weapons, and believes that this agreement presents an opportunity for all political parties, ahead of the 2010 Westminster election, to state their positions on what it considers to be the immoral and wasteful renewal of Trident.
