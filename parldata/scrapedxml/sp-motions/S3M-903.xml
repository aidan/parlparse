 *S3M-903 Bob Doris: CSV Scotland’s Dare to Care Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of CSV Scotland’s Dare to Care campaign which asks people to make time to end child poverty; backs its aims of showing how volunteering can make a difference in the fight to end child poverty; encourages organisations to register for this scheme and take advantage of the £50 grant available; urges every MSP to identify a local group and support it to take part in the campaign; recognises not only the valuable contribution that volunteering makes to good causes but also to the personal development of volunteers; notes with deep regret that one in four children still live in poverty, and looks forward to achieving the historic 2020 target to end child poverty in Scotland.
