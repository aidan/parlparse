*S2M-4693 Shiona Baird: Jet Skis and Dolphins in the Firth of Tayâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern that the dolphin colony in the Firth of Tay has been subjected to harassment by some jet ski users; commends the efforts of Dundee City Council to address this problem; recognises that harassment of marine mammals and swimmers need not be taken as representative of the behaviour of jet ski users as a whole, and further notes that an E-petition on jet ski use is available for signing on the Parliament website until 25 August 2006 at http://epetitions.scottish.parliament.uk/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=98.
