*S1M-3071 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Anti-TNF Drugs for Rheumatoid Arthritis-That the Parliament welcomes the recent decision by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to approve the use of anti-TNF drugs as being cost-effective in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in England and Wales; recognises the difficulty patients in Scotland have had in accessing such drugs, to the extent that more patients in Leeds are prescribed anti-TNF drugs than in the whole of Scotland; urges the Health Technology Board Scotland to move speedily in order to endorse the NICE approval, and in the meantime asks the Scottish Executive to implement the Scottish Prospective Evaluation of the Clinical Effectiveness of TNF Alpha Inhibitors in Rheumatoid Arthritis (SPECTRA) protocol so that patients in Barrhead, Neilston and elsewhere in Scotland with severe rheumatoid arthritis who are in constant pain are not denied treatment that could radically improve their quality of life.
