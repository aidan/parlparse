*S2M-3290 Tommy Sheridan: Disingenuous Liberal Democrats—That the Parliament regrets the inability of the Liberal Democrat Group to provide a member to participate in the detailed scrutiny of the Council Tax Abolition and Service Tax Introduction (Scotland) Bill during either of the two Local Government and Transport Committee meetings at which the Bill was considered and believes that, in light of the Liberal Democrats’ widely trailed concern over the fairness of council tax, their failure to send a member or their substitute to the committee exposes the disingenuous nature of their concern and demonstrates that they have no intention of voting to abolish the council tax if it compromises their position in the coalition, which they will always prioritise over the interests of millions of pensioners and low-paid workers hammered by the unfair Tory tax.
