*S1M-1305 Mr Sam Galbraith: National Cultural Strategy—That the Parliament recognises the strength and breadth of cultural activity in Scotland and the important contribution it makes to Scotland’s economy and to the quality of life of people throughout Scotland; considers that public support and encouragement of cultural development should be guided by a framework which widens opportunities to participate, promotes education in and through culture and supports and celebrates excellence in all areas of cultural activity, and therefore welcomes the publication by the Scottish Executive of Creating Our Future, Minding Our Past, Scotland’s first National Cultural Strategy.
