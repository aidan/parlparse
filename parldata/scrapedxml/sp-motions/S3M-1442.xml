*S3M-1442 Peter Peacock: Cuts in Highland Council Services—That the Parliament deplores the planned cuts in vital council and voluntary sector services being made by Highland Council as a result of the SNP government’s priorities for spending; notes that these cuts are taking place at a time when the Scottish Government has the largest budget for public services since devolution and twice that which Donald Dewar had only a few short years ago; further notes in particular that Highland Council plans to build up financial reserves while cutting services and shedding jobs; questions whether the single outcome agreement with Highland Council to deliver SNP manifesto commitments will now do so, in particular with regard to class-size reductions, and urges the SNP government and SNP/Independent-led Highland Council to reverse the planned cuts.
