*S3M-4629 Elaine Smith: Concern at UCU Report on Education Cuts—That the Parliament expresses alarm at figures in a report by the University and College Union that state that around 280 jobs are at risk in universities in Scotland; is concerned by the Scottish Government’s failure to make higher education a funding priority, thus losing the momentum provided by the investment of the previous administration; notes that around 5,000 students will be affected, with losses hitting the full range of institutions; considers that this is not simply a fight for lecturers’ jobs but part of a much bigger fight for the Scottish education system and the struggle to widen access for all, particularly the most marginalised groups, and considers that the Scottish Government should now urgently invest in this sector, especially at this time when there is overwhelming evidence that adults faced with redundancy are returning to higher education to facilitate career change.
