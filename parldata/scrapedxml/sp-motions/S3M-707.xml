*S3M-707 Roseanna Cunningham: NHS Tayside’s Hand Hygiene Campaign—That the Parliament recognises the good work of NHS Tayside’s Hand Hygiene Campaign aimed at tackling the unacceptably high incidence of healthcare-associated infections which kill 5,000 people every month in the United Kingdom; deplores the high cost of treating such infections which amounts to £1 billion per year, a sum which could build ten large hospitals; agrees that hand hygiene is the most effective method for preventing cross-infection in the healthcare setting; commends the campaign’s approach of raising public awareness, providing resources to GPs and reaching diverse demographic groups such as minorities, travellers and blind people by using specialised media such as a "glow" box, and endorses the campaign’s aim of raising awareness among NHS staff and the public as to the importance of effective hand hygiene.
