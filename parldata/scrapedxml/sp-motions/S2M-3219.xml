*S2M-3219# John Farquhar Munro: Future of Crofting—That the Parliament recognises the importance of crofting to the social and economic life of the Highlands and Islands and wishes to see the continuation of sustainable crofting communities; shares the concerns of crofting communities, such as those in Skye and Lochalsh and throughout the crofting counties, regarding the threat to crofting communities from the lack of action by the Crofters Commission over the decrofting of land and sale of crofts, and from absentee crofters and dereliction; believes that crofting tenancies should not be sold on the open market which is currently allowing local people to be outbid by those with no understanding of, or long-term commitment to, crofting and the crofting community, and further believes that if this continues it will, in a generation, lead to the end of crofting in everything but name.
