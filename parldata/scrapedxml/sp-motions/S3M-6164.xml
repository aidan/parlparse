* S3M-6164 Jim Tolson: Eating Out with Coeliac Disease—That the Parliament recognises that people with coeliac disease have an autoimmune disease for which the only treatment is a lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet; considers that 59% of people diagnosed with coeliac disease are most concerned about the lack of safe, gluten-free options offered when eating out; urges chefs and caterers to reap the benefits of this untapped market, estimated to be worth at least £10 million a year in Scotland, by providing safe, gluten-free choices; considers that the availability of the gluten-free option should be as prevalent as a vegetarian option on menus, and commends and supports Coeliac UK for its campaign to make eating out easier for people with the condition, which aims to significantly improve their quality of life and will create more business for the hospitality sector.
