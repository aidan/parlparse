*S3M-697 Nicol Stephen: Support for Democracy and Freedom in Burma—That the Parliament welcomes representatives of the opposition movement in Burma to the Scottish Parliament; expresses its support for their campaign for freedom, justice and democracy in Burma; believes that all countries that share those values should put maximum pressure on the army generals at the head of the Burmese regime; notes that Burma has been heavily criticised by the United Nations for its crackdown on anti-government protests last month and the deaths and suffering caused to unarmed civilians; is therefore outraged that the First Minister of Scotland’s most recent communication with the Burmese junta has been to ask for its help and support for his campaign for observer status at the United Nations; further believes that the First Minister could have avoided this shocking situation if he had followed the agreed concordat with the Foreign Office and had discussed his letter to Burma with it before the letter was sent, and furthermore places itself firmly on the side of the protestors in Burma and condemns the junta, all that it stands for and any attempts from the First Minister to seek favour with it. Supported by: Tavish Scott*, Liam McArthur*, Jeremy Purvis*, Jim Tolson*, Mike Pringle*, Jim Hume*, Alison McInnes*, Jamie Stone*, Iain Smith*, Robert Brown*
