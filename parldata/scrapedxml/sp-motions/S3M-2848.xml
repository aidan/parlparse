*S3M-2848 Peter Peacock: Winning through Unity—That the Parliament warmly congratulates Barack Obama on his election as 44th President of the United States of America; believes that his election represents, in the words of the Prime Minister, "a moment that will live in history as long as history books are written" and is a watershed event in the history of the USA, parts of which experienced racial segregation within living memory; admires President-elect Obama’s campaign, which placed emphasis on unity over division, and believes that his election is testament not only to himself as an individual, his party and all those who have supported him in his campaign, but also to the achievements of a non-violent civil rights movement, which has inspired other struggles against injustice and helped to transcend divisions in countries around the globe; further believes that President-elect Obama shares the values of progressive politics in Scotland and the United Kingdom, and looks forward to engaging constructively with his administration for the betterment of our respective countries and the wider world.
