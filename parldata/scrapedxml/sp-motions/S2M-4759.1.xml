*S2M-4759.1 Mr Brian Monteith: Castle Tioram—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4759) in the name of Donald Gorrie, leave out from "encourages" to end and insert "believes that Historic Scotland should recognise that it is in the best interest of the maintenance and restoration of Scotland’s built heritage that the owners of its abandoned ruins, piles of boulders and desolate rubble that were once great houses, keeps, towers and castles of ancient Scotland be allowed to develop them for use as domestic homes or for commercial use; notes that many historic buildings were in fact constructed from the ruins and plundered rubble of older buildings, that a cultural icon such as Eilean Donan Castle, restored in 1912, is in fact far more modern than many people realise and believes that if Historic Scotland had existed then the castle would still remain in ruins; welcomes the large-scale investment in, and commitment to, the use of authentic materials and traditional methods of building construction by owners of ruins such as Castle Tioram, and urges Historic Scotland to encourage such investment, rather than to obstruct it, by suggesting workable and sympathetic architectural treatment so that ruins may be revived, boulders liberated from the moss and rubble reassembled into attractive homes and buildings of interest."
