*S3M-6968 Bill Kidd: Coalition Pile the Pressure on the Poor—That the Parliament expresses concern that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, is planning to cut a further £4 billion from welfare spending in addition to the £11 billion already announced by the UK Government and is of the view that positive measures to help the long-term unemployed are preferable to that of loading further punitive measures on to the most vulnerable in society.
