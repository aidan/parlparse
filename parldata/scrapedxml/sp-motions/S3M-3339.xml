*S3M-3339 George Foulkes: Stop SNP/Lib Dem School Budget Cuts—That the Parliament recognises the level of concern expressed by parents, teachers and children about the SNP/Lib Dem run City of Edinburgh Council’s proposal to impose a further 2% cut in school budgets; believes that this will strain an already diminished budget resulting in cuts to the number of frontline staff and resources, such as books, computers, stationary and support services; questions why the SNP/Lib Dem council consistently chooses to cut the services of the youngest, oldest and most vulnerable people in Edinburgh; notes that the Labour group in the council fully costed an alternative budget proposal that would reinstate the 1.5% cut from last year’s budget, reject a further 2% cut and increase the schools’ budget for the financial year 2009-10, and strongly urges the SNP/Lib Dem councillors to drop their proposal for a 2% cut at decision time on 12 February 2009 and vote through Labour’s proposal that aims to restore pride in our education system and allow teachers to teach and children to learn. Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm*, Jackie Baillie*
