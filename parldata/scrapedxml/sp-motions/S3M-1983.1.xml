 *S3M-1983.1 George Foulkes: Scotland’s Oil Wealth—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1983) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from "the recent study" to end and insert "the current high International price of oil at around $135 per barrel but also notes that in the last decade alone the price has fluctuated significantly from the current high to as low as as $9; believes that, notwithstanding the current high price of crude oil, basing an economy and the funding of public services on such an erratic commodity whose supply is determined principally by a Middle Eastern cartel would be economically illiterate; regrets the typically obtuse characterisation by Scottish nationalists of fellow Scots who do not favour splitting the United Kingdom into separate states but who rather believe the interests of Scottish people are best served by retaining their influence in one of the world’s largest economies as "in thrall to their bosses in London", and considers that the Barnett Formula guarantees Scotland a higher proportion of revenue per head of population than south of the border and that far from having "no faith in the Scottish people" the pro-Union parties have every confidence that they will make the correct decision with regards to Scotland’s constitutional future in clear and stark contrast to the SNP."
