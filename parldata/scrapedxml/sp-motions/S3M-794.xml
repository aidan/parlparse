*S3M-794# Shirley-Anne Somerville: Domestic Abuse in Lothians—That the Parliament recognises the need to end violence against women; notes that the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence campaign will run from 25 November (UN International Day of Action to Eliminate Violence Against Women) until 10 December 2007 (International Human Rights Day); notes that domestic abuse remains both widespread and under-reported in Scotland and that research indicates that victims suffer episodes of abuse up to 35 times before they call the police; further notes that 60% of recorded domestic abuse incidents in Lothian and Borders are known to involve repeat victimisation; welcomes the pilot project being run by Lothian and Borders Police in East Lothian to improve the service provided to victims of domestic abuse with the aim of reducing repeat victimisation through working with partner agencies to provide help, support and prioritise the safety and protection of victims when reporting crimes, and looks forward to this pilot leading to a more effective response to domestic abuse throughout the force’s area.
