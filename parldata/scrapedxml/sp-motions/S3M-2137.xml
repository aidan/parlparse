*S3M-2137 Michael McMahon: Living and Dying with Advanced Heart Failure—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Living and dying with advanced heart failure: a palliative care approach, by the Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care with the support of British Heart Foundation Scotland and the Scottish Government; notes that people with heart failure have a worse prognosis and poorer quality of life than many cancer patients and that 50% of advanced heart failure patients die within a year of diagnosis, many of them suddenly and unexpectedly; believes that uncertainty around prognosis should not be a barrier to people with advanced heart failure, or those with any other condition, receiving appropriate palliative care; is concerned that, despite the recommendations of the CHD and Stroke Task Force in 2001 that provision needed to be made for palliative care for advanced heart failure, too many of these vulnerable patients are still not getting the care they need at the time that they need it most, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure that its forthcoming palliative care strategy and the refreshed CHD and Stroke Strategy explicitly address the needs of patients with conditions other than cancer, like advanced heart failure, and take account of the report’s recommendations.
