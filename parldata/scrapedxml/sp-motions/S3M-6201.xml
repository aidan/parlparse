* S3M-6201 Christine Grahame: NHS Borders and Out-of-hours Services, Getting it Right—That the Parliament notes the commendation of the achievement of NHS Borders in providing out-of-hours healthcare highlighted in the Health and Sport Committee’s Report on out-of-hours healthcare provision in rural areas, published on 23 April 2010, which commended "the achievement of NHS Borders in developing a model that both is attractive to doctors and delivers an out-of-hours service in an area with challenging geography. Although mindful that no one model can be expected to work across Scotland – indeed, the Committee would caution against any such attitude – the Committee urges other NHS boards to examine NHS Borders’ innovative approach when seeking to develop stable and sustainable out-of-hours solutions in their own areas in the interests of avoiding and reducing fragmentation of services" and congratulates NHS Borders on this achievement.
