 *S3M-7618 Willie Coffey: Hey, I’m Alive, a True Story by Louise Hunter—That the Parliament, further to motion S2M-3334, commends the continuing efforts of the West of Scotland Branch of Ataxia UK in supporting people affected by Ataxia, including people with the condition, their families, carers and friends; recognises in particular the efforts of Louise Hunter of Kilmarnock, a copy of whose booklet, Hey, I’m Alive, has been made available to all MSPs; considers that the booklet describes very clearly and with much good humour the difficulties that Louise has faced as someone with Friedrich’s Ataxia, including in securing a proper diagnosis of her condition, which manifested itself from a very young age and was initially diagnosed as cerebral palsy; further considers that, despite experiencing considerable discrimination, Louise has made great personal efforts and received support from many organisations and individuals, including her former school, James Hamilton Academy, and Margaret Jamieson, former MSP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, who assisted in securing sponsorship for publication of the booklet, and is pleased to endorse the sentiment of Louise’s favourite saying, you are never fully dressed without a smile.
