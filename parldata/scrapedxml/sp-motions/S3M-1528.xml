*S3M-1528 Jim Tolson: Fife Council’s Migrant Workers Survey—That the Parliament commends the decision of Fife Council to undertake the largest ever study into migrant workers in Scotland; acknowledges that almost 1,000 workers took part in the survey which was carried out to try to improve services for the growing migrant community; notes that half of migrants in Fife either had a degree or undergraduate qualification, but over 70% of them did not use these skills in their current jobs, and calls on the Scottish Government to conduct a national study to ensure that migrants across Scotland are using their skills to their full potential.
