 *S3M-879 Robert Brown: United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child—That the Parliament notes the 18th birthday of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which guarantees the rights of all children and young people in Scotland to fulfil their potential; believes that all children and young people in our society, but particularly children with a disability or additional support needs, face a number of barriers in realising these rights, for example to be included, to achieve their promise and to access leisure and recreational activities as well as other core services; supports the work done by the Cross Party Group on Children and Young People to raise awareness and consensus in the Parliament around this issue; urges the Scottish Government to listen to, and actively involve, children and young people in the development and delivery of educational, social, leisure and health services, and believes that it is the Scottish Government’s responsibility to research the extent and reasons for such barriers and that the voices of children and young people with additional support needs should form a central part of the inspection processes that these services undergo.
