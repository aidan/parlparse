*S2M-4507 Ross Finnie: Climate Change—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Changing Our Ways: Scotland’s Climate Change Programme as a serious response to a serious challenge; notes the identification of the Scottish Share of carbon savings from devolved policies across the United Kingdom and the setting of the first ever Scottish Target to exceed that share; welcomes the commitment to report annually to Parliament on progress on implementing Changing Our Ways and, in the longer term, to submit the programme to an independent audit; recognises the importance that must be accorded to adapting to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, and agrees that mainstreaming climate thinking, through the carbon proofing of new policies and measures and through communication, is vital to ensuring an effective climate change response.
