*S2M-3567 Christine Grahame: Pringle of Scotland and the Declaration of Arbroath—That the Parliament notes the decision of Pringle of Scotland to withdraw a range of T-shirts containing lines from the Declaration of Arbroath because they perceived them as "anti-English"; notes that the sentiments articulated within this document were in the context of the day an expression of resistance to tyranny, oppression and imperial ambition directed towards the people of Scotland; recognises that the declaration is a founding constitutional document establishing for all time in Scotland conditional monarchy and the sovereignty of the people and that it was the basis for the Declaration of American Independence; congratulates officials of the Parliament who recently exhibited the Declaration of Arbroath and maintain a copy on public display, and therefore urges Pringle of Scotland to reconsider its decision and to recognise in so doing the international significance of the Declaration of Arbroath.
