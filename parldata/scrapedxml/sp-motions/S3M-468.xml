*S3M-468 Jackson Carlaw: EU Climb-down on Imperial Measures—That the Parliament notes with great pleasure EU Industry Commissioner, Gunter Verheugen’s, statement that "there is not now, and never will be, any requirement to drop imperial measurements"; welcomes the European Commission’s decision finally to concede defeat in its campaign to make the use of traditional British imperial measurements illegal by accepting that they can continue to be used alongside metric measurements indefinitely, and encourages the commission to go one step further by allowing British businesses that wish to trade in traditional imperial measurements alone the flexibility to do so without fear of criminal prosecution and, in so doing, illustrate the desire to turn back from its present existence as a meddlesome, over-centralised, bureaucratic super state in the making to become a collection of independent sovereign nation states that trade freely with one another and co-operate on issues of mutual interest, which is what the United Kingdom was promised when joining the European Union in the first instance.
