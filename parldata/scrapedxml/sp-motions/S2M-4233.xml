*S2M-4233 Colin Fox: Defeat of "First Job Contracts"â€”That the Parliament congratulates French unions and students in defeating government plans to introduce "First Job Contracts" intended to attack the employment rights of young workers and make it easier to sack them; recognises that their highly significant victory came after three months of intensive debate, demonstrations and strikes, and believes that the job security, wages and the 35-hour week which French workers successfully defended this week will be envied by hundreds of thousands of Scots who are hired and fired at will and will especially interest those former employees of Motorola, Continental Tyres and Lexmark who will note the severe penalties facing companies in France who "up sticks" and move away to cheap labour areas.
