*S2M-4837 Tommy Sheridan: Hands Off Cuba—That the Parliament notes the passage from the recently released report of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba (CAFC) from the Bush administration in Washington which states "For reasons of national security and effective implementation some recommendations are contained in a separate classified annex"; also notes CAFC’s demand for $80 million in the next two years, followed by $20 million in each successive year, to facilitate the destabilisation of Cuba and overthrow its socialist government; condemns the interference by the United States of America in Cuba’s internal affairs over the last 47 years and its ongoing, deeply damaging and illegal economic blockade of the island; recognises and applauds the record of the Fidel Castro’s government in developing a free health and education system admired worldwide, eradication of illiteracy, improvements in life expectancy, huge reductions in poverty and unmatched international aid and assistance programmes, and demands that the USA keeps out of Cuba and insists on tackling disgraceful health inequalities and poverty in its own backyard and not in undermining socialist governments in Cuba, Venezuela or Bolivia.
