*S1M-3528# Mr Duncan Hamilton: Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Route—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the events surrounding the provision of the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service from Gourock to Dunoon; further notes that the decision by the Scottish Executive to limit the route to a passenger-only service removes competition and choice, creates a private monopoly from public money, invites a challenge by the Office of Fair Trading which almost inevitably will lead to a complaint to the European Commission and ignores the Scottish Executive’s own report from Deloitte and Touche in 2000 which warned that the subsidy under the Public Service Obligation would have to be nearly five times higher on a passenger-only service; is profoundly concerned at the adoption of the catamaran-type vessel, the "Ali Cat", on the route and the serious doubts raised both locally and amongst maritime experts with regard to the suitability of such a craft on this route; condemns this precipitous action in advance of the conclusion of the Scottish Executive’s own consultation on the future of the Caledonian MacBrayne network, and believes that an immediate public inquiry into all aspects of this decision should be conducted. Supported by: Richard Lochhead*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*, Ms Sandra White*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Fiona Hyslop*, Irene McGugan*
