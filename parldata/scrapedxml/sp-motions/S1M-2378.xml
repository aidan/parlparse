 *S1M-2378 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow's Museums—That the Parliament welcomes the initial findings of Scotland’s National Audit of museum and gallery collections, premises and public services - Interim Report, October 2001 by the Scottish Museums Council that a third of the artefacts and priceless works in Glasgow City Council's collection have international importance and that over half of those works are of national or regional importance; believes that these findings confirm that museums and galleries in Glasgow make a significant contribution to the Scottish economy, and calls for new discussions between the Scottish Executive and Glasgow City Council to consider how to address the imbalance in funding between museums in Glasgow and the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh.
