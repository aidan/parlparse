 *S3M-7199 Margaret Curran: Closure of Lightburn Hospital—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed closure of Lightburn Hospital in the east end of Glasgow and the relocation of services to both the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Stobhill Hospital; considers that this proposal will cause difficulties for many people in the wider east end of Glasgow who rely on this local healthcare facility, resulting in lengthy journeys by often unsuitable public transport; believes that local rehabilitation healthcare facilities are important in ensuring a more effective recovery; considers this a reversal of the Scottish Government’s policy presumption against centralisation, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene to prevent the closure and disposal of this hospital.
