*S2M-2228 Christine Grahame: Population and Poverty—That the Parliament notes the link between poverty and population decline, as cited by the Office of National Statistics; notes that independent Ireland’s population will increase to a level higher than that of Scotland by 2019; notes that Ireland’s increase in population has been made possible through a combination of steady economic growth together with reducing the number of people living in consistent poverty, which in Ireland has fallen by two-thirds since 1994; notes that by 2040 Scotland’s population will have fallen by half a million from current levels and will be heading towards population levels not seen since the days of the Highland Clearances; notes that poverty is a significant factor in Scotland with Scots having the shortest life-expectancy in western Europe; notes that our pensioner population will increase from 950,000 to 1.2 million in the next 25 years, and congratulates Ireland for creating the necessary social and economic conditions which effectively tackle poverty as well as bringing sustainable population growth and economic stability.
