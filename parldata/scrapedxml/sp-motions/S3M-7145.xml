 *S3M-7145 Mary Mulligan: Parliament Congratulates Bathgate’s IndyCar Champ—That the Parliament congratulates Bathgate’s Dario Franchitti on becoming the IndyCar motor racing champion for 2010; notes that this is the third IndyCar title that he has won in the last four years; further notes that Dario is also the reigning Indianapolis 500 champion and is only the fifth driver in history to win the Indianapolis 500 and IndyCar titles in the same season; believes that he is an exemplary role model for Scotland’s aspiring sports stars, and considers that Dario Franchitti joins a distinguished list of Scottish racing drivers such as Jim Clark, Sir Jackie Stewart and David Coulthard, who it believes have honoured Scotland on the race track with their skills and sportsmanship.
