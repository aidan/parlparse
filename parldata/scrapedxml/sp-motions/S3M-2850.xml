*S3M-2850 Robin Harper: Hen Harrier Survival in Lothian and Borders Region—That the Parliament notes the latest figures for hen harrier survival in the Lothian and Borders region, showing that, although the region should be supporting at least 50 breeding pairs, only two pairs were observed this year, producing probably only two or three fledglings; expresses concern that this shows that current policy is not being translated into action, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate urgently why the breeding population of hen harriers has collapsed in this area and to ensure that sufficient wildlife crime detection and enforcement resources are available throughout Scotland to adequately protect our rural wildlife.
