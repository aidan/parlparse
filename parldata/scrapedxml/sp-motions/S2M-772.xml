*S2M-772# Sarah Boyack: Access at Haymarket Railway Station-That the Parliament notes with concern that Haymarket Station in Edinburgh does not have full access to platforms or other facilities; further notes that the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 which refers to access to services will come into force in October 2004; recognises that a vast number of stations across Scotland have limited, poor or no access for people with disabilities; understands that Haymarket Station is Scotland's busiest railway station; notes that during the weekend of 17 to 19 January 2004 Waverley Station will be closed for the replacement of signalling and that Haymarket Station will be used as the main station for the capital; commends the joint discussions of the City of Edinburgh Council, Network Rail, Scotrail and Transport Initiatives Edinburgh in order to work together proactively to find a solution to this problem, and believes that the Scottish Executive and the Strategic Rail Authority must prioritise transport investment to ensure that all rail passengers have equal access to services.
