 *S3M-6747 Mary Scanlon: The Westray Wifeâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the boost in tourism and increased revenue for businesses in Westray, Orkney which has been reported in the last year; notes that much of this success can be attributed to the discovery of the 5,000-year-old Neolithic object, known as the Westray Wife, which was discovered last August and which is now displayed in the Westray Heritage Centre; further notes that visitor numbers at the Westray Heritage Centre have increased from 700 in May to June 2009 to 1,700 in the same period this year while this 3.5 cm by 3 cm carving has been on display; further welcomes the fact that this Neolithic object has been shortlisted for a British Archaeological Award and, since its discovery at the Links of Noltland, this earliest carving of a human figure found in Scotland has been seen by over 100,000 people, and wishes business and islanders on Westray continued success in the future.
