*S3M-5141 Jim Tolson: Guide Dog Puppies in the Scottish Parliament—That the Parliament congratulates the work of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association and the 300 volunteer puppy walkers across Scotland who look after and socialise guide dog puppies to the stage where they can go on to train as guide dogs; also notes that the Parliament welcomes groups of puppy walkers and their pups into the building to enable further development of these socialising skills and so that the puppies can experience different environments, and hopes that other public buildings, institutions and businesses will also welcome guide dog puppies into their establishments for similar training exercises.
