*S1M-3557 Christine Grahame: The First Police Force-That the Parliament notes that established, co-ordinated and paid police forces were first established in Scotland from 1800 onwards, some 29 years before the Peelers in London; further notes that in 1800 a Bill was promoted by Glasgow Town Council seeking powers to establish a regular police force in the city that, once enacted, led to a parade of the Glasgow Police Force for duty in the Laigh Kirk Session house; notes that police forces followed in Edinburgh in 1805, Paisley in 1806, Greenock in 1810, Aberdeen 1818 and Dundee in 1824; notes that John Graham, a Glasgow merchant, became the first Superintendent of Police in 1862 and that, contrary to British history books, therefore, Sir Robert Peel in London was not the founder of modern policing, and urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to commemorate this fact and the loss of many police officers' lives in the line of duty over these centuries in a suitable manner in the new Scottish Parliament building.
