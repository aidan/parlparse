*S3M-528 Mr Frank McAveety: Securing and Maintaining Funding for Glasgow’s Sporting and Cultural Activities—That the Parliament recognises the role that the city of Glasgow has played in showcasing the best of Scottish sport, culture and entertainment; welcomes recent success stories of the city, including the international reputation of the newly refurbished Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and the hosting of the 2007 UEFA Cup Final; recognises the potential that hosting the 2014 Commonwealth Games affords not only Glasgow but Scotland as a whole, and calls on the Scottish Government to acknowledge the need for additional metropolitan funding for the city of Glasgow to ensure that it has the resources required to enable it to meet the challenges coming from other cities from small nations across the world and to continue as a city that provides the best in sport, culture and entertainment for generations to come.
