*S3M-5272 Bill Kidd: Referendums on Independence in Catalonia—That the Parliament notes that, on 13 December 2009, more than 140 towns throughout Catalonia will hold referendums on the question: Do you agree that Catalonia becomes a social, democratic and independent state of right, member of the European Union; welcomes the right of the Catalonian people to express their views on this important subject despite the stated intention of the Spanish Public Prosecutor’s Office to appeal against all of the 208 referendums that will take place; believes that the right to self-determination as enshrined in the United Nations Charter is, without question, a fundamental human right that should not be denied, and hopes that the Spanish Government will work constructively with the Catalonian Government with respect to the wishes of the people of Catalonia.
