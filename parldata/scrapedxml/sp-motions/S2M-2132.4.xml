*S2M-2132.4 Chris Ballance: Iraq—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from "it is in the best interests" to end and insert "the only way forward for peace and justice in Iraq is for the British and US governments to request the United Nations to bring in a peacekeeping force made up of soldiers from countries which did not support the invasion to replace British and US troops immediately, in order to allow civic society to re-establish itself in Iraq, and calls on the Scottish Executive to launch an inquiry into the physical and mental health of Scottish soldiers returning from Iraq and to prepare for an anticipated increase in combat stress-related conditions by increasing its support for the charity, Combat Stress, and its Hollybush House appeal."  Supported by: Patrick Harvie*, Mark Ballard*
