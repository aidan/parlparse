*S1M-3149.2 Roseanna Cunningham: Alternatives to Custody-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3149) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "regrets the failure of the Scottish Executive adequately to develop a range of high quality alternatives to custody which fit the changing pattern of offending behaviour across Scotland; recognises the importance of programmes which are well-resourced and available across every jurisdiction in Scotland, and believes that a greater element of restorative justice should be introduced into the Scottish criminal justice system whether dealing with adults or young offenders."
