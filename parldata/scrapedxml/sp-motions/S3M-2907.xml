*S3M-2907 Sarah Boyack: Scotland’s Tribute to One of the Most Influential Scientists of All Time—That the Parliament welcomes the James Clerk Maxwell statue, produced by Alexander Stoddart and to be unveiled on 25 November 2008 in George Street, Edinburgh, by the Presiding Officer of the Parliament; recognises that Clerk Maxwell is one of the most influential scientists of all time with his work laying the foundations for the modern technological society that we live in today; congratulates the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the many donors who made the monument possible; believes that it is right that there should be public recognition of the achievements of Clerk Maxwell in the city of his birth, and hopes that wider appreciation of the works of great Scottish scientists and engineers will inspire new generations to seek to follow in their footsteps.
