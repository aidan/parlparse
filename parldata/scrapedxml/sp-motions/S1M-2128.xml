*S1M-2128 Mr Adam Ingram: City Status for Ayr—That the Parliament congratulates South Ayrshire Council and The Ayrshire Post on their campaign to achieve city status for Ayr to mark Her Majesty the Queen’s Golden Jubilee year; recognises that Ayr has all the attributes of a modern city including a thriving business and commercial community, a rapidly growing international airport, high quality and wide-ranging education and training infrastructure and an outstanding environment enhanced by a recent £40 million investment to clean up its seafront, as well as a rich heritage, not least in its association with Robert Burns whose famous description "Auld Ayr wham ne’er a toon surpasses for honest men and bonnie lasses" is as relevant today as ever, and believes that city status would be a well deserved accolade for the South of Scotland’s major population centre.
