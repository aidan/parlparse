*S3M-3617 Irene Oldfather: Snaring in Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern that it is now a full year since the previous Minister for Environment announced his intention not to ban snares but to create further regulations to govern their use; recognises that the proposed regulations have not yet appeared; considers that, even with regulation, the continued use of snaring will subject thousands of Scotland’s animals every year to distress and suffering, including disembowelment, mutilation and death by slow strangulation, which is unacceptable and could not legally be inflicted on domestic animals; also considers that indiscriminate trapping methods such as snares exact a heavy toll of non-target animals including wildlife, pets and farmed animals; is concerned that snares are still used to catch protected mountain hares; recognises that the Scottish Executive consultation on the future of snaring in 2006 elicited a more than two-to-one majority in favour of an outright ban on snares and that a poll commissioned in October 2008 showed that 79% of the Scottish public thought that snares should be banned, and therefore fully supports the campaign by Advocates for Animals, the League Against Cruel Sports and other wildlife organisations in calling for urgent action including a complete ban on snares in Scotland.
