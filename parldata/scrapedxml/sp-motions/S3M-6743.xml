*S3M-6743 Brian Adam: No to EU intervention in North Sea Oil and Gas Industry—That the Parliament regrets the comments from EU Commissioner for Energy, Günther Oettinger, calling for a drilling moratorium across the EU, including the North Sea, and a European system of regulatory control following the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico; believes that the oil and gas industry in Scotland, in cooperation with the UK Government and trade unions, has developed strong health and safety regulations, which put it in a better position than counterparts from elsewhere in the world, and believes that an EU body to provide regulatory control would be an unnecessary expense that would offer little or no benefit to national government, oil companies or the taxpayer and that the European Commission should stop any idea of such a power grab immediately.
