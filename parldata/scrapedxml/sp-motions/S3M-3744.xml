*S3M-3744 Cathy Peattie: Post Bank—That the Parliament welcomes the proposal for a new post bank to be run as part of the post office network that was launched on Tuesday 17 March 2009 by a coalition of trade unions, businesses, pensioner and pressure groups and charities; notes that the proposed model would strengthen the role of the post office network making it more viable, creating new job opportunities and securing its role for the future; further notes that it would mark a return to the form of relationship banking abandoned by our biggest banks and ensure a stable source of finance in the heart of communities that could provide financial services to three million people still not using banks, including the most disadvantaged people, pensioners, people who live in very remote rural areas and the many small businesses that are looking for alternative sources of finance, of which two out of five would consider banking with a post bank; recognises that the post office network is a unique national resource on which communities, businesses and individuals depend, and believes that setting up a post bank provides a unique opportunity to answer both concerns around secure and equitable finance and the future of the post office network.
