*S1M-2604 Alex Neil: Treatment of al-Qaeda Prisoners of War-That the Parliament, while utterly condemning the terrorist activities of al-Qaeda, deplores the refusal by the United States of America to classify Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners as Prisoners of War, thus denying their basic human rights as set out under the Geneva Convention, and recognises that this kind of action could lead to further acts of terrorism and is ultimately detrimental to any attempts to reduce the threat of terrorism around the world.
