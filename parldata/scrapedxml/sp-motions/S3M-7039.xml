*S3M-7039 Bill Butler: Vote for Sport—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Sports Alliance’s Vote for Sport pledge campaign, which calls on every MSP to recognise the unique role, value and potential of sport in Scottish society and to act as a Scottish sporting champion throughout their term in the Parliament; believes that, during the next four years, both the London Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow will provide significant opportunities for Scottish sport to unite communities and inspire the nation, and encourages MSPs from across the chamber to sign the pledge.
