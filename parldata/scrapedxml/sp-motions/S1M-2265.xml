*S1M-2265 Michael Russell: 2009 Ryder Cup Bid-That the Parliament notes with disappointment the failure of the Scottish bid to host the Ryder Cup in 2009 and the negative impact this will have on tourism, the economy and Scottish sport and calls on the Scottish Executive to (a) make available to the Parliament, copies of the full working documents and proposals for the bid and an analysis of the reasons it believes the bid failed, and (b) co-operate fully with any inquiry into the matter which may be undertaken by a committee of the Parliament.
