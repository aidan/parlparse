*S3M-485 Ted Brocklebank: Scotland Leads the Way on Green Business Scheme—That the Parliament congratulates the 35 Scottish hotels, from a UK list of 50, that have been named as the most eco-friendly hotels in Britain for their environmental approach, such as introducing energy-saving light bulbs, waterless urinals, recycling and a purchasing policy backing local produce; notes in particular that three of the 35 hotels achieving gold awards under the Green Tourism Business Scheme are to be found in St Andrews, and therefore commends the Fairmont, Rufflets and New Hall hotels for their efforts to promote a green approach to business.
