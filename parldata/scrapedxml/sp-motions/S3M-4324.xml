*S3M-4324 David Whitton: Bishopbriggs Victory—That the Parliament congratulates the players and coaches of the under-15 and under-18 football teams of Bishopbriggs Academy in East Dunbartonshire on "doing the double" by achieving the rare feat of winning both Scottish Schools Shield finals in the same season; particularly congratulates the under-18 team on winning the Senior Shield by four goals to two against St Mungo’s High School, Falkirk, after a thrilling final at Hampden Park, and acknowledges the role of the Bank of Scotland, the main sponsor of the Scottish Schools Football Association (SSFA), whose backing has meant that over 140,000 young people have benefited from one of the three football programmes, Soccer One, Midnight League and Shield Competitions, run in partnership with the SSFA and the Scottish Football Association, in addition to the Bank of Scotland’s support for the international squads run by the SSFA.
