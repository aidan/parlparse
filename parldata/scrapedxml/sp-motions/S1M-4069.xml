*S1M-4069 David Mundell: Chapelcross - The World's Oldest Operational Nuclear Power Station-That the Parliament notes that the Chapelcross Power Station will, from the start of April, be the longest serving nuclear power station in the world; further notes that Chapelcross has provided a safe and reliable supply of electricity to the south of Scotland since 1959 and regrets that it will cease generation no later than 31 March 2005; believes that the engineering and scientific accomplishments of designing, building and operating Chapelcross and Calder Hall were the 20th century equivalent of the Forth Rail Bridge or the invention of the steam engine and congratulates the management and workforce on their skill and dedication in operating successfully the Calder Hall and Chapelcross power stations for a combined total of more than 90 years; further notes the fudge and delay inherent in the Government's energy white paper, and believes that the success of Chapelcross would be best recognised by the early commissioning of a replacement nuclear power facility on the same site. Supported by: Mr Murray Tosh*, Alex Fergusson*, John Scott*, Phil Gallie*
