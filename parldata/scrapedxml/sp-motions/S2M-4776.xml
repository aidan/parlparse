*S2M-4776 Patrick Harvie: Fingerprinting of Schoolchildren—That the Parliament is deeply concerned that children in some Scottish schools are required to submit to fingerprinting to access school libraries; notes that school libraries have managed to function for generations without needing to treat schoolchildren like criminals; believes that children should be taught in an environment which respects their autonomy and privacy and, indeed, encourages them to hold their civil liberties in high regard, and urges Scottish schools to reject the use of fingerprint systems.
