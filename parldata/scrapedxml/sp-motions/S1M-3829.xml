*S1M-3829 Brian Fitzpatrick: Centenary of James McNeill Whistler (1834 - 1903)—That the Parliament commends the hard work and efforts of all of the people associated with the events taking place at The Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, to mark the centenary of the death of James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903); notes that, while Whistler only visited Scotland once, he had strong links with the country through his family and the influence of his work, most notably on the Glasgow Boys; further notes that one of the world's most important collections of Whistler's work is held at the Hunterian Art Gallery and was presented to the University of Glasgow by Whistler's heir, Rosalind Birnie Philip, in recognition of his Scottish links and the conferral of an honorary degree on him in 1903; applauds the sterling efforts of all concerned in securing the return to Glasgow on loan from the Musée d'Orsay, for the first time in half a century, of Whistler's most famous work, Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1: Portrait of the Painter's Mother (1871), and in explaining the significance of the painting for Whistler, its acquisition by the Musée du Luxembourg in 1891 and its continuing life as an icon and inspiration for satirists, cartoonists, copyists and others; commends the work of the Centre for Whistler Studies at the University of Glasgow in preparing an edition of the 10,000 letters in the Whistler correspondence, highlighting his contacts with artists, critics, dealers, models, patrons, publishers and many more and demonstrating that he was known as much for his sharp wit as for his art during the half-century from 1855 to 1903, and is encouraged by the support lent by LloydsTSB Scotland for a range of Whistler 2003 exhibitions and events as part of a Glasgow-wide festival running throughout the year. Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone*
