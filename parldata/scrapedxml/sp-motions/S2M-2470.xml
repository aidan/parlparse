*S2M-2470# Tommy Sheridan: Support for Strike on 23 March 2005 Against Pensions Robbery—That the Parliament notes the UK Government’s proposals to attack the pension rights of millions of public sector workers through raising the retirement age from 60 to 65 and replacing final salary schemes with inferior "career average" or "defined contribution" schemes; believes that these pension proposals represent an unprecedented attack on public sector workers and will result in increased poverty and illness among millions who already try to survive on low wages and inadequate pensions; notes that the average pension level in local government amounts to only £3,800 a year and that the Government’s proposals will make matters worse not better, and accordingly declares its full support for the one-day strike action on 23 March 2005 planned by public sector unions in opposition to New Labour’s pensions plunder and robbery.
