*S2M-1450# Jackie Baillie: NHS Argyll and Clyde's Clinical Strategy Review-That the Parliament rejects the inadequate and short-sighted proposals expressed in Shaping the Future, the clinical strategy for NHS Argyll and Clyde, and specifically its proposals to close both the Dumbarton Joint Hospital and the Helensburgh Victoria Infirmary and to further downgrade the Vale of Leven Hospital while centralising services at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) in Paisley; notes that, in a recent consultation held by Jackie Baillie MSP and John McFall MP with nurses, consultants, voluntary groups and the local community, 88% of those who responded said that they wanted services delivered north of the river Clyde; agrees that travelling long journeys to reach suitable health care should be the exception and not the rule; further notes with concern the apparent lack of detailed regional planning in arriving at these proposals, and therefore considers that these proposals should be rejected and that local services should be maximised as the first priority and thereafter, for those services that cannot be delivered locally, that serious consideration should be given to the use of Gartnavel Hospital and the Golden Jubilee Hospital.
