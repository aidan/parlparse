*S3M-4652 Bill Kidd: Crysis? What Crysis?—That the Parliament notes that the UK government’s Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston is currently recruiting for an engineering virtual reality specialist to utilise serious gaming for training nuclear weapons scientists; considers that the job advertisement in question indicates that the AWE is particularly looking for someone with modification and level-creation experience of 3D terrain games and provides the example of Crysis, a first-person shooter game in which the player skirmishes with, among others, North Koreans and extraterrestrial enemies, and believes the conflation of the fantasy world of gaming with the realities of nuclear war, in this way, to be representative of the UK Government’s scant regard for taking nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament seriously.
