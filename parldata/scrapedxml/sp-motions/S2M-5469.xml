*S2M-5469 Carolyn Leckie: Victory to the PCS—That the Parliament welcomes the resounding and determined vote of Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) members for strike action; considers that they have been dignified in the face of immense provocation by a government that is systematically dismantling public services, jobs, terms and conditions and decimating communities through the withdrawal of vital services to the most vulnerable groups in society; believes that PCS members should not be forced to resort to such action and that even at this late hour the government and employers should enter into meaningful negotiations concerning all of the many issues at the heart of this dispute and seek to reach agreement with the PCS on securing the future of jobs, public services and the communities that rely on them, and calls on all elected members to exert the strongest pressure on the Westminster Government and the Scottish Executive to deliver that end and stands in solidarity shoulder to shoulder with PCS members in their struggle. Supported by: Rosie Kane*, Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
