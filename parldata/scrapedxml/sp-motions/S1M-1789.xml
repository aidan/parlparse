 *S1M-1789# Johann Lamont: Lord Abernethy ruling on rape—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the recent ruling by Lord Abernethy that sex without a women’s consent is not rape unless the attacker uses force or the threat of force; believes that women have the right to be protected in law from those who seek to have sex with them without their consent; believes that there are serious ramifications in such a ruling for the willingness of rape victims to report the crime and on the attitudes of men who abuse or seek to abuse women; considers that this ruling raises significant issues about the current training for judges dealing with such cases, and, given the Scottish Executive’s commitment to the zero tolerance of violence to women and its commitment to the support of the victims of crime, urges the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Social Justice, in conjunction with the Executive’s equality unit, the appropriate committees of the Parliament and in consultation in particular with women’s organisations and victim support groups, to review the legislation on sexual assault and rape in order to ensure that the law offers real protection and support to anyone who suffers sexual assault or rape. Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan*, Mr Gil Paterson*
