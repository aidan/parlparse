 *S2M-561 George Lyon: Community Development of Renewable Energy-That the Parliament notes Scotland's massive renewable energy potential; recognises the genuine concerns of local communities about the proliferation of wind farm planning applications; believes that the Scottish Executive must ensure that the potential benefits to the long-term sustainability of our remote and rural communities from community and crofting-owned renewable energy developments are realised, and therefore calls on the Executive to support Highlands and Islands Enterprise in their efforts to develop a Highlands and Islands community energy company to support communities in developing their own wind turbines and other renewable energy projects.
