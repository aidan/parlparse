*S3M-8067 Cathy Peattie: Centenary of International Women’s Day—That the Parliament welcomes the many events being organised throughout the world to mark International Women’s Day on 8 March 2011, including the event in the Parliament on Saturday 5 March, celebrating A Century of Aspirations, Achievement and Advancement; notes that the first International Women’s Day was held on 19 March 1911, with over a million women and men attending rallies campaigning for an end to discrimination and for women’s rights to vote, hold office, work and training; notes also the publication in 1911 of Bread and Roses, which has become an anthem for the international women’s movement; considers that there are still many aspects of women’s rights, representation and welfare that need to be addressed through a gendered policy approach, including the gender pay gap, the underrepresentation of women in senior positions in the public and private sectors and as elected representatives, and with regard to the provision of violence-against-women support services, and reaffirms its support for International Women’s Day and its commitment to tackling discrimination, implementing the gender equality duty and securing equality for women throughout Scottish society.
