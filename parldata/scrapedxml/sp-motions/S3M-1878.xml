*S3M-1878 Joe FitzPatrick: Universal Infant Pneumococcal Vaccination—That the Parliament welcomes the news that, between October and December 2007, 96.4% of children in Scotland received primary vaccination against invasive pneumococcal disease, compared with 89.1% in England; notes that in the 18 months since the vaccine was introduced there has been a marked fall in the number of invasive pneumococcal infections in paediatric practice and in the associated morbidity and mortality; encourages healthcare professionals and parents to address the issue of 1-in-10 children not currently receiving a booster, thus making them vulnerable, and agrees with the Minister for Public Health that this high uptake of the vaccine "is a reflection of the commitment of health professionals, voluntary bodies and most importantly the commitment of parents" to the protection of Scotland’s children against this killer disease.
