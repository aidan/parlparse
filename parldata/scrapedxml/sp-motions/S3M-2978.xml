 *S3M-2978 Bashir Ahmad: Zimbabwe’s Cholera Epidemic—That the Parliament notes with concern the rising cholera-related death toll in Zimbabwe; expresses its worry that the actual figure may be as high as 3,000, as reported on 27 November 2007 by a senior official in Zimbabwe’s Health Ministry, and, as Oxfam has reported, a further one million Zimbabweans are at risk; expresses further concern that Robert Mugabe’s regime is reportedly silencing health workers and restricting access to the huge number of death certificates that give the cause of death as cholera-related; believes that, with Harare’s Central Hospital officially closed, the situation is dire, and calls on the international community to step up pressure on Zimbabwe’s president to allow international aid and medicine to enter the country.
