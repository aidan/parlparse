 *S3M-1225♦ Christine Grahame: Heart at Risk Screening for Young Sportsmen and Women—That the Parliament notes that cardiomyopathy, a thickening of the heart muscles, grows undetected at the body’s fastest growing time, the teenage years; further notes that apparently healthy teenagers can suffer from this condition and that the condition kills a large number of teenagers annually; commends the work of Scottish HART (Heart at Risk Testing), a Borders-based national charity which researches into all heart diseases, especially cardiomyopathy, raises funds for a mobile screening unit which, with trained staff, will test the health of all young Scottish athletes, campaigns for defibrillators, researches all forms of heart disease, raises funds for mobile screening of young people and families at risk and has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to put monitoring equipment into sports centres, swimming pools and youth facilities across Scotland, and considers that the advantages and practicalities of providing screening for young people who, because of family history or the nature of their activities such as strenuous competitive sport, may be at risk of an early, sudden and preventable death, should be investigated through a pilot scheme, possibly in the Scottish Borders.
