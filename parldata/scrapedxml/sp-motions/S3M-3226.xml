S3M-3226 Mike Rumbles: First Minister Must Set the Record Straight—That the Parliament notes the answers given by the First Minister to Tavish Scott MSP on Thursday 8 January 2009 in the Chamber (Official Report, c. 13822) regarding funding for the Scottish Inter Faith Council (SIFC); notes that the First Minister stated that funding was "resolved"; notes that the convenor of the SIFC has indicated that the matter was not resolved at the time of the First Minister’s statements; believes that the First Minister therefore misled the Parliament and that he should make a statement clarifying and apologising for this position; believes that the precedent has been set in previous sessions of the Parliament that the correct action for a minister who has, even inadvertently, misled the Parliament is to return to the Parliament as soon as possible to correct the inaccuracy and apologise, and that the Presiding Officer should play a constructive and appropriate role in ensuring that this happens.
