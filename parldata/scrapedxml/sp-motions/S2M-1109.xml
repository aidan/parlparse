*S2M-1109 Jackie Baillie: Gynaecology Services in NHS Argyll and Clyde-That the Parliament is dismayed at the action of NHS Argyll and Clyde in failing to sustain gynaecology services at the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals; notes that contingency arrangements will be in place from 29 March 2004 for all in-patient admissions to be centralised at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH), Paisley; recognises that this will place intolerable pressure on existing services at the RAH and, in turn, will lead to longer waiting lists; further recognises the difficulty for patients north of the river to access services in the RAH due to lack of direct public transport and the cost of that transport; notes that the ambulance service is currently struggling to cope with the additional journeys to the RAH, despite the substantial recent increase in investment; further notes the impact that changes will have on allied services at the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals, and considers that it is inappropriate to pre-empt the outcome of the clinical strategy review in this way. Supported by: Mr Duncan McNeil*
