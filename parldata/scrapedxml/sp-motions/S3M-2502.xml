*S3M-2502 Murdo Fraser: Bannockburn Battlefield—That the Parliament observes the importance of the Battle of Bannockburn in Scottish history, where Robert the Bruce led a significant Scottish victory against the English in the Wars of Scottish Independence in June 1314; believes that Scotland’s historic battlefields are important to Scottish history and that the sites must be protected as a memorial to the men who fought and died in the battles as well as allowing future generations to visit the sites and learn more about Scotland’s past; notes the concerns of the National Trust for Scotland that the Bannockburn battlefield may fail to qualify for Historic Scotland’s planned inventory of battlefields as too much housing has already been allowed on and around the historic site, and considers that the battlefield site has already been subject to enough development and that it now requires protection to stop any future development.
