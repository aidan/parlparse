*S3M-4392 Johann Lamont: Human Rights in Turkey—That the Parliament welcomes the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against Turkey for failing to prevent the murder of a woman whose daughter had informed police that she believed herself and her mother to be at risk; recognises the significance of this first ruling by the ECHR against a state for failing to protect a woman from domestic violence, and calls on all agencies in Scotland involved in delivering services to those at risk of domestic violence to respond by taking prompt and effective action when they receive reports from victims or potential victims that they believe themselves to be at risk of domestic violence.
