*S3M-2107 Claire Baker: The Scottish Government’s Welcome U-Turn—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government’s u-turn on its final demand for over £5 million worth of debt from around 2,500 postgraduate students; believes that postgraduate students have been put through needless grief due to government incompetence; notes that the Scottish Government’s original position was that continuing to allow deferment was not possible due to "accounting procedures"; welcomes the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning’s response to political pressure and bad headlines; believes that this demonstrates that where there is political will the Scottish Government can seemingly find a way; further believes that the Scottish Government should therefore similarly u-turn on proposals for a local income tax that will hit over 55,000 full-time students, on changes to means testing for current students that will reduce government support for up to 17,000 students previously assessed as being from single parent families and on £12 million of efficiency savings from the student support budget over the next three years.
