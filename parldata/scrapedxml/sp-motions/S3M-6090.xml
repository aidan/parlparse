 *S3M-6090 Stuart McMillan: Extra Resources for Primary Schools in Inverclyde—That the Parliament welcomes the news that Inverclyde Council is to target £225,000 at primary schools in its most deprived communities; notes that the council is to reduce class sizes and expand breakfast clubs by allocating funding in the February budget for 2010-11 to schools with a high free meal entitlement; further notes that five extra teachers will be deployed in Newark Primary in Port Glasgow and King’s Oak Primary School in Greenock, which will allow another 120 pupils to be educated in class sizes of 18 or under in P1 to P3; notes, however, that the SNP group at Inverclyde Council proposed eight new teachers rather than the five on which the council decided, and acknowledges that the Scottish Government, through the concordat, extended the entitlement to free school lunches to pupils whose parents or carers are in receipt of both maximum working tax credit and maximum child tax credit from August 2009 and that this action was of benefit to approximately 44,000 pupils across Scotland.
