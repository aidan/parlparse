*S3M-2453 Mr Frank McAveety: Congratulations to Team GB, Especially Scotland’s Athletes—That the Parliament congratulates the athletes from Team GB who have performed incredibly well in the 2008 Beijing Olympics; recognises the commitment and togetherness of Team GB in its pursuit of sporting excellence; commends the achievement of 47 medals, including 19 gold medals; congratulates Chris Hoy on his achievement of three gold medals and on being the first British Olympian in 100 years to win three gold medals in a single games; considers that calls for a separate Scottish Olympics team from the First Minister are divisive and unnecessary, and calls on the First Minister to spend more of his time finding resources to invest in sport and facilities in Scotland rather than depending on the legacy of the previous Labour/Liberal Democrat administration and to listen to the Scottish Olympians, such as Chris Hoy and Allan Wells, on how best to support Scottish athletes in the future.
