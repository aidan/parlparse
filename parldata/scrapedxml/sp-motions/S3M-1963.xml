*S3M-1963 John Park: New Rights for Agency Workers—That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement that will see agency workers gain the same workplace rights as permanent workers after 12 weeks in employment; believes that this will provide fairness for workers, while retaining flexibility for employers; notes that this equal treatment means the same working and employment conditions, including pay, holidays, overtime, breaks, rest periods, night work and duration of working time; further notes that these rights will be in addition to the existing rights that all workers currently enjoy, including the national minimum wage, 24 days holiday, statutory maternity pay, protection under anti-discrimination law and health and safety rules for adequate rest breaks at work; considers that this will be a positive step towards preventing bad employers from exploiting temporary workers and using agency workers to undercut the wages of permanent employees, and looks forward to the UK Government introducing this legislation in the autumn of 2008 and the benefits that it will bring for the 140,000 agency workers in Scotland.
