*S1M-3018# John Young: The Links Between Domestic Violence, Child Abuse and Animal Abuse-That the Parliament recognises the groundbreaking research by the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies at the University of Edinburgh into non-accidental injury (NAI) in companion animals which showed parallels with NAI suffered by children; welcomes the work already done by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, through its "First Strike Scotland" campaign, to raise awareness of the links between animal abuse and violence towards humans; considers that the Scottish Executive should commission research into (a) the correlation between domestic violence, child abuse and animal abuse and (b) therapeutic programmes to address children's abuse of animals, and believes that a protocol for the reporting of such incidents should be introduced across all respective agencies.
