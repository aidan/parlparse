 *S3M-4709 Bill Kidd: Business and Human Rights—That the Parliament welcomes the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre’s launch of the world’s only online portal for all materials relating to the work of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative on business and human rights, Professor John Ruggie, www.business-humanrights.org/SpecialRepPortal; echoes the sentiments of Professor Ruggie that the portal represents a global town-hall meeting, where everyone can be heard and participate in the strengthening of the international human rights regime as it relates to business; believes that through tracking the human rights impacts of 4,500 companies in over 180 countries the resource centre provides an invaluable tool in the monitoring and development of human rights in the global business world, and hopes that this innovative approach will serve to further highlight and improve human rights issues throughout the world.
