*S3M-6909 Robert Brown: Holyrood Secondary School Fair Trade Groupâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Holyrood Secondary School in Glasgow on attaining the status of a fair trade school; notes that fair trade issues have been integrated into the curriculum throughout the school; believes that this has raised awareness of fair trade amongst staff, parents and pupils, with fair trade activities taking place throughout the year and culminating in the Fair Trade Week in September 2010; welcomes the work of the Holyrood Fair Trade Group, which began the Holyrood Malawi project in 2006, sending over 2,000 much needed school backpacks to children in Malawi, and has since funded several trips to the country to build and refurbish classrooms, and applauds all the pupils and teachers involved, particularly teacher Claire Wilson, on their achievements, and wishes them and the group the very best and continued success for the future.
