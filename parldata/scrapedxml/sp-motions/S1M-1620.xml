*S1M-1620 Irene McGugan: Robert Fergusson—That the Parliament recognises the significant contribution of the 18th century poet Robert Fergusson to Scotland’s literary heritage; notes that he continued the revival of writing in the tongue of Lowland Scotland, which Allan Ramsay (1684-1758) began in the years following the Treaty of Union; notes that this revival in turn was taken up by Robert Burns, who had all but given up writing poetry until he read Fergusson’s work and found it inspirational and that in 1768, after his visit to Edinburgh, Burns commissioned a headstone for Fergusson’s hitherto unmarked grave in Canongate Kirkyard, a material symbol of his gratitude to the young makar; further notes that later Robert Louis Stevenson gave instructions that the stone should be repaired and re-inscribed because of the debt he also felt he owed to Fergusson, and commends the "Friends of Robert Fergusson" for their efforts to raise funds for the erection of a "people friendly" statue in Edinburgh’s Royal Mile to commemorate this poet whose importance to Scottish literature, and particularly to poetry in Scots, cannot be overstated.
