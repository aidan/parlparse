 *S3M-4798 Des McNulty: The Thistle Travel Card—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of the Scottish Government to discontinue funding for the Thistle Travel Card that was previously available to people who require help with public transport due to age, a learning or physical disability or other condition affecting their confidence or competence in knowing what bus or train to get on and where to get off, being able to count out the correct fare or understand timetables and travel announcements, all of which create barriers to such people being able to use public transport; notes that the scheme was supported by the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland (MACS), which advises ministers on the transport needs of disabled people and by the Confederation of Passenger Transport; regrets that the demise of the Thistle Travel Card will seriously impact on the mobility and quality of life of an estimated 120,000 people with learning disabilities and other communication difficulties, and notes that this is the same group of people who get only the lower rate mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance, which means that they do not qualify as eligible under the Scotland Wide Free Bus Travel Scheme for Older and Disabled Persons because of the decision made by the Scottish Government not to extend eligibility after its recent review of the scheme.
