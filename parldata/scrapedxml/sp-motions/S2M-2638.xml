 * S2M-2638# Shiona Baird: OFT Failure to Protect Farmers—That the Parliament notes the publication of the Supermarkets Code compliance audit by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT); further notes the continuing control by just four supermarket chains of over 75% of the UK grocery sector and recent allegations that one of these, Tesco, caused the delay in the publication of the OFT audit; regrets that the OFT audit does not recommend the appointment of an independent ombudsman to ensure the proper enforcement of The supermarkets code of practice, despite its previous report finding that a “climate of apprehension” was preventing complaints being made by farmers for fear of being de-listed and other reprisals; expresses its concern that the situation for farmers remains bleak, with many going out of business each year due to supermarkets’ exploitative practices; notes the invitation by the OFT for further evidence to be submitted by 31 May 2005, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its influence to ensure that The supermarkets code of practice is extended and properly enforced throughout the entire supply chain and that farmers are adequately supported and protected to make complaints.
