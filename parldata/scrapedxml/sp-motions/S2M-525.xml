 *S2M-525# Bill Butler: Glasgow Crossrail Scheme-That the Parliament recognises the benefits of introducing the proposed Glasgow Crossrail scheme in respect of both the local and national rail network; notes that the scheme would help to provide a fast, effective rail service into the city centre; appreciates that the crossrail scheme would help to open up Glasgow Airport to the whole of Scotland in conjunction with the proposed Glasgow Airport rail link and allow improvements to Ayrshire and coastal services to be implemented along with projects in the Central Scotland Transport Corridor Studies document, including the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link; is aware of the value for money and cost efficiency of the Glasgow Crossrail proposal with the need to construct only a minimal amount of new track; acknowledges the potential of the scheme to encourage more commuters to move from car to rail transport, and believes that the Scottish Executive should progress this proposal as expeditiously as possible. Supported by: Paul Martin*, Pauline McNeill*, Mr Duncan McNeil*, Janis Hughes*, Karen Whitefield*, Scott Barrie*, Cathy Peattie*, Dr Sylvia Jackson*
