 *S3M-2434 Rob Gibson: Grid Connection Charge Scandal—That the Parliament condemns the announcement by the UK Government that it is to stop subsidies for renewable energy developments in Orkney and Shetland and its comment that there is only a marginal case for keeping them in the Western Isles; believes that this move will place a real question mark over Scotland realising its full renewable energy potential in tidal, wave and wind power; recognises that with this new policy the UK Government is making it less attractive to set up renewable schemes away from the south east of England, which will adversely affect Scotland’s remote and rural economies; further believes that this announcement will not lead to a reduction of carbon emissions, and therefore calls on the UK Government to rethink its decision.
