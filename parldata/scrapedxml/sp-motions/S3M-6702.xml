*S3M-6702 Willie Coffey: Gargieston Primary Has the Right Chemistry for Success—That the Parliament congratulates the team from Gargieston Primary School, Kilmarnock, on its success at the recent Salters’ Festival of Chemistry held at the University of Glasgow and which aims to help promote the appreciation of chemistry and related sciences among young people; considers that, during the last eight years, over 20,000 students have experienced the fun of practical chemistry through the Salters’ Festivals of Chemistry; further congratulates the Gargieston pupils on beating off competition from secondary schools in winning the Salters’ Challenge, in which teams undertake a practical scientific activity for which they are given no opportunity for advance preparation; recognises that this year’s success follows the schools’ second place in the University Challenge at the Salter’s Festival in 2008 and expresses its appreciation of the work of Head Teacher Christine McLean and the staff of the school in developing the scientific knowledge and understanding of the pupils.
