*S2M-4789 Colin Fox: Condemnation of US and UK Governments—That the Parliament, on the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, notes the US Senate report which concludes that there was in fact no connection between Al Qaeda, the organisation responsible for the outrage, and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein; notes that another of the alleged reasons for the illegal war in Iraq, namely that Saddam was responsible for the 9/11 attacks or was acting in conjunction with Bin Laden, has been exposed as being utterly bogus; believes that the slaughter of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of innocent Iraqis, which followed the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans on 9/11, means that both the US and UK governments stand condemned in the eyes of the peoples of the world, and supports the Time to Go protest outside the Labour Party conference in Manchester on 23 September 2006, organised by the Stop the War Coalition and others demanding the immediate withdrawal of UK troops from Iraq and opposing any US attempts to attack Iran.
