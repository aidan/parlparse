*S2M-903 Christine Grahame: Fostering-That the Parliament notes the shortage of foster carers, currently standing at 650 in Scotland, and the need to encourage greater recruitment; recognises the excellent work done by the Fostering Network in highlighting the problems facing foster children and their carers and the work they do in conjunction with local authorities to improve the prospects for both the children in need of foster care and those who wish to foster, and accordingly urges the Scottish Executive, as part of its ongoing work with the Fostering Network, to provide practical assistance in publicising and promoting recruitment in this most important vocation.
