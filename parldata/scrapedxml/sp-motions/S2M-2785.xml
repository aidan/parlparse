 *S2M-2785# Carolyn Leckie: Birth Rate and Poverty—That the Parliament is extremely concerned that, according to Professor Michael Crawford, the incidence of low birth weight has increased since the 1970s and that in some areas of Glasgow the incidence is 14%; acknowledges that the single biggest risk factor for low birth weight is poverty; is appalled that, when government tells us that the economy is buoyant and the wealthy have more than doubled their wealth since 1997, the incidence of low birth weight in Scotland is at levels associated with the poorest countries of the world; condemns successive governments for failure to prevent this humanitarian catastrophe, and believes that the health consequences for future generations will be dire unless aggressive action is taken to redistribute wealth and eradicate poverty. Supported by: Eleanor Scott*, Rosie Kane*, Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Colin Fox*
