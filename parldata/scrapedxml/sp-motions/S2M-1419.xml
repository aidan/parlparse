*S2M-1419 Shiona Baird: Crisis FareShare-That the Parliament recognises the valuable contribution made by the two existing Crisis FareShare projects in Scotland, whose network of volunteers collects and redistributes surplus fresh food from manufacturers and retail outlets to centres and shelters for homeless people; notes the direct benefits of these projects in providing nutritious food to homeless people while helping to minimise food waste and its subsequent disposal to landfill sites; recognises the additional benefits of such schemes in allowing resources to be diverted into vital counselling, resettlement and other support services and in encouraging homeless people to gain social contact and new skills by participating as volunteers; commends the scheme as an excellent example of socially and environmentally responsible partnership between food manufacturers and the voluntary sector, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make a firm financial commitment to ensure the continuation of existing projects and the further development of fareshare initiatives across Scotland.
