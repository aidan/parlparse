 *S3M-2358 Christine Grahame: Public Ownership not Private Profiteering—That the Parliament notes with deep alarm the decision by Centrica/British Gas to increase gas prices by a further 35% and electricity prices by a further 9%; notes that Centrica has just recorded half-yearly profits of just under £1 billion; considers that, in an energy-rich nation like Scotland, it is a disgrace that our already fuel-poor communities have among the highest energy bills in Europe; considers further that the regulatory system for energy producers is failing, as is the concept of a competitive energy market; also considers that while all households will be affected the increases will, in particular, leave many of the most vulnerable at risk of suffering and even death, and, given the clear national interest and obligation to protect vulnerable people in our society, urges the Scottish Government to press HM Government to bring into public ownership the entire UK energy-providing sector and make the strongest possible representations to European partners to do likewise and decouple gas prices from the spiralling oil price.
