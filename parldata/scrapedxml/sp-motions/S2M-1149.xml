*S2M-1149 Rosie Kane: Sellafield Clean Up-That the Parliament condemns the continued refusal of the Westminster Government to allow full safety inspections at Sellafield; further condemns the fact that the Westminster Government has consistently failed to allow EU inspectors to ascertain whether or not the 1.3 tonnes of plutonium, currently stored at Sellafield, has ended up in nuclear weapons; notes the decision of the European Commission to extend the deadline for a clean up plan to 1 June 2004, and calls on the Westminster Government to open up all of its nuclear facilities to EU inspectors.
