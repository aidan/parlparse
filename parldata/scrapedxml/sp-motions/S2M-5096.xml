*S2M-5096 Bruce Crawford: Future of Remploy—That the Parliament believes that the work currently being carried out by Remploy, which provides disabled workers with opportunities to work with support and dignity while learning first-class skills in manufacturing goods, is extremely valuable; notes with concern the potential impact that the Department for Work and Pensions’ review of future business options for Remploy may have on the Remploy network; further believes that the 5,000 disabled workers in the 83 Remploy factories across Scotland, England and Wales should have the choice between working in a fully integrated environment or a supported environment if that is the best option for them, and asks that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Scottish Executive review their procurement procedures to include Remploy, where appropriate, on the list of contactors for goods or services so that they are provided with every opportunity of having a sustainable future.
