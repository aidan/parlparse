*S3M-5186 Jackie Baillie: Living Wage Outrage—That the Parliament condemns SNP-controlled West Dunbartonshire Council for voting down a motion that would have introduced a living wage of £7 an hour for its poorest workers; understands that the motion proposed by Labour councillors called on West Dunbartonshire Council to follow the example of Glasgow City Council and implement a living wage of £7 an hour for the 200 staff who earn less than this amount; notes that the cost of implementing this policy would be approximately £140,000 per year, less than half of the cost that the council was reported to be considering paying its outgoing chief executive earlier this year, and calls on Scottish ministers to support the Scottish Living Wage campaign, unlike their SNP colleagues in West Dunbartonshire.
