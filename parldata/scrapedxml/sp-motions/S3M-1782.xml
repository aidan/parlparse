*S3M-1782 Irene Oldfather: Congratulations to Eglinton Country Park—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that an award of £345,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund has been granted to North Ayrshire Council to undertake vital repair work on the B-listed Tournament Bridge in Eglinton Country Park; notes that the bridge was built as a point of access for the last great medieval tournament in Britain in 1839; recognises that it is vital that structures such as this are maintained for the benefit of the general public, schools and the local community, and agrees that the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has awarded over £497 million in grants since its inception, has played an important role in ensuring the future of many of Scotland’s historical buildings and monuments.
