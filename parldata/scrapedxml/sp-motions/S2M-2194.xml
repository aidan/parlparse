*S2M-2194 Christine Grahame: Health Indicators Report 2004 and Link with Poverty in Scotland’s Communities—That the Parliament notes Health Indicators Report – December 2004 – A Focus on Children, published on 20 December 2004 by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, which makes clear the link between deprivation and the rise in the rate of still births and neonatal death; further notes the link made in the report between deprivation and the rate of teenage pregnancy, together with the link between anxiety and depression amongst children and teenagers and communities experiencing poverty; urges the Scottish Executive to recognise officially the link between socio-economic deprivation and adverse pregnancy outcomes and the rises in the expected rate of still births and neonatal death, specifically in the Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Lothian, Fife, Grampian, Lanarkshire, Greater Glasgow and the Highlands as well as the link between anxiety and depression and poverty in these communities, and calls on the Executive to increase socio-economic prospects for these areas through greater investment and concentration of resources and to close the opportunity gap which is resulting in poorer health and poorer futures for Scotland’s children and young people.
