*S1M-2405 Mr Lloyd Quinan: Chickenpox Vaccineâ€”That the Parliament notes the current anxiety caused by the contentious MMR vaccine and possible links to autism; rejects the possible introduction of the chickenpox vaccine combined with the MMR vaccination, and further notes the insensitivity of the action of the UK Department of Health in Whitehall in introducing another live vaccine when there has been a call for single vaccinations due to the controversy and possible damage the triple MMR vaccine may have caused.
