*S2M-3249 Mr Mark Ruskell: Protection of Australian Old Growth Forest and Sustainable Timber Certification Standards—That the Parliament condemns the ongoing unsustainable and socially repressive practices of Gunns Ltd in respect of their forest operations in Tasmania; further condemns Gunns’ persistence in pursuing legal action against environmentalists and environmental groups; questions the legitimacy of the Australian Forestry Standard (AFS) as a reliable and credible certification of sustainability on the grounds that it permits the conversion of native forests for monoculture plantation, permits the use of 1080 poison (sodium monofluoroacetate) to kill native Australian wildlife, permits the use of high intensity burns of logged areas as standard practice, permits the destruction of old growth and high conservation value forests and permits habitat destruction that directly threatens biodiversity and the survival of listed endangered species; notes calls for a boycott of AFS products and Tamar Ridge Wines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gunns Ltd, and calls on the Australian and Tasmanian Governments to pursue World Heritage listing for recognised World Heritage value forests and to protect old growth and high conservation value areas for current and future generations and to note that the Forest Stewardship Council provides an internationally-recognised standard for timber certification upon which its own AFS could be based.
