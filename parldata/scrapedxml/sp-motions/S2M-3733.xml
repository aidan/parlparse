*S2M-3733 Frances Curran: Support Mehmet Tarhan—That the Parliament supports and sends solidarity to Mehmet Tarhan, a gay Turkish conscientious objector, who was sentenced to four years’ custody in a Turkish prison for "refusing orders in front of the (military) unit"; is gravely concerned that Mr Tarhan has been on hunger strike for a month in protest at being brutally beaten and cut by prison officers; notes that he has refused to join the army and is one of the 350,000 to 500,000 draft refusers in Turkey, many of whom are Kurds who refuse to join the army which attacks Kurdish people in the south east; notes that in June 2005 a judge offered to release Mr Tarhan on the grounds of his homosexuality, which he refused; is extremely concerned that the "evidence" demanded by the military to prove homosexuality includes an anal examination; demands an end to the torture of Mehmet Tarhan, and further demands his immediate release from the Turkish army.
