*S2M-2176 Ms Sandra White: St Peter’s Primary Eco Schools Award—That the Parliament congratulates the headmistress, staff, pupils and parents of St Peter’s Primary school in Partick, Glasgow, on the attainment of a Green Flag award from the Eco Schools project; notes that this award was gained by St Peter’s for having successfully implemented each of the seven elements designed to ensure that the school’s environmental improvement programme runs smoothly and efficiently, and believes that all other Scottish schools should follow the fine example set by St Peter’s and those other schools that have implemented improvement to school and community environments and apply for Green Flag status.
