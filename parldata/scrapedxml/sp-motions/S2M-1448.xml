*S2M-1448 Mr Duncan McNeil: NHS Argyll and Clyde's Draft Clinical Strategy-That the Parliament notes the publication of NHS Argyll and Clyde's draft clinical strategy, which proposes to move in-patient and emergency services from Inverclyde Royal Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) in Paisley; expresses concern that the RAH, which is already struggling to cope with the increased numbers of patients that it is required to treat as a result of previous centralisation exercises, will be even more severely stretched; condemns the denial of access to NHS services for people in Inverclyde, Largs, Dunoon and beyond, and calls on the NHS board to consider alternative options which may be brought forward for dealing with the real external pressures it faces.
