*S3M-2613 Alison McInnes: Impact of Rising Fuel Costs on Community Transport Organisations—That the Parliament recognises the vitally important work that many thousands of volunteer drivers undertake in taking patients to and from hospitals, GP surgeries and day centres; notes that the increasing cost of fuel is putting many of these services at risk as the fuel allowance for volunteer drivers remains at 40p per mile while the cost of fuel has escalated; is concerned about the impact on local health services if volunteer drivers can no longer afford to help their communities; welcomes the cross-party support at Westminster for the petition to ask HM Revenue and Customs to raise the rate at which it permits charities to reimburse volunteer drivers from 40p to 50p per mile for their fuel costs, and urges the Scottish Government to work constructively with the UK Government to ensure that Scottish interests are fully represented.
