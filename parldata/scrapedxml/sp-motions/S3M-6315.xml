*S3M-6315 Kenneth Gibson: Olympic Games Consequentialsâ€”That the Parliament believes that the clear principles upon which the framework for funding the devolved administrations in the United Kingdom is based have not always been satisfactorily applied; further believes that the Barnett consequentials resulting from the regeneration spending associated with the 2012 Olympics are an example of this, and calls on the UK Government to release the Barnett consequentials due from the Olympics to the Scottish Government, Welsh Assembly Government and Northern Irish Executive at the earliest opportunity.
