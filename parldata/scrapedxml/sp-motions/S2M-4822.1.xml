 *S2M-4822.1 Richard Baker: Graduate Debt—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4822) in the name of Ms Sandra White, leave out from first "which" to end and and insert "and notes that the SNP’s incoherent proposals to cancel all existing and historic graduate debt would cost nearly £1.7 billion while creating not one extra place at college or university and contributing nothing to the quality of teaching and research at our academic institutions; challenges the SNP to recognise that a £100 million spending commitment would be woefully inadequate to fund its policy; recognises that contributions to the graduate endowment are used to fund the Scottish Executive’s student bursary scheme which has been increased in this session of the Parliament, and asks the SNP to confirm whether it is standing by its muddled policy and, if so, what public services it will cut to fund it or whether it is going to come clean with students and admit that the policy cannot be implemented."
