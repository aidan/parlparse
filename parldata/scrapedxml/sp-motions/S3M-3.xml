*S3M-3# Iain Smith: Relocation of St Andrews Post Office—That the Parliament expresses its concern about the plans to close a number of Crown post offices in Scotland and relocate them in branches of WH Smith; opposes the proposed closure of the post office in St Andrews; recognises that the existing post office already finds it difficult to cope with the volume of customers and that St Andrews has a unique population with a high level of students, many from overseas, and the tourist trade, both of which suggest the need to retain a full range of post office services that can only be provided by a full Crown post office; believes that the premises of WH Smith are inadequate to cope with the addition of the post office business, and considers that the Post Office should hold genuine consultation with the local community and businesses in St Andrews before progressing further with this proposal. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Jim Tolson*, Hugh O’Donnell*
