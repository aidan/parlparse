*S2M-3218 Mr Mark Ruskell: Stop Climate Chaosâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Stop Climate Chaos, the coalition of environment, development and faith organisations which has been formed to tackle climate change; acknowledges the strength of concern about climate change which exists within many organisations in the voluntary sector; believes that effective international action to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases across all sectors is urgently required, and urges the Scottish Executive to act without delay to ensure that all its policies are climate proofed.Supported by: Shiona Baird*, Mark Ballard*, Patrick Harvie*, Robin Harper*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Chris Ballance*, Mr John Swinney*
