 *S3M-5955 Robin Harper: Savage Cuts of Cultural Coordinatorsâ€”That the Parliament notes that, by the end of this month, it is likely that only eight out of 32 local authorities will still have cultural coordinators in post; notes that 80 of the present 100 cultural coordinators may lose their jobs in the next financial year; considers and regrets that, as usual, the first cuts fall on culture, in particular school music instruction, art and drama; believes that these cuts are disproportionate and will adversely affect the proper development and wellbeing of young people, and urges this and future governments to enter into more robust outcomes agreements with councils in the future to protect the vision of a fully rounded education provision across Scotland.
