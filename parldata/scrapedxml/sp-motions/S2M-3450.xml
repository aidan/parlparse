*S2M-3450 Alasdair Morgan: Scallop Dredging in Luce Bay—That the Parliament notes the recent designation of Luce Bay on the Solway Coast as a Natura 2000 site, giving it status as an area of the highest value for natural habitats and species of plants and animals which are rare, endangered or vulnerable in the European Community; considers that sustained, large-scale, commercial scallop dredging would be detrimental to the future of this site; recognises that it may be some time before the site is fully mapped and assessed, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to examine urgently the need for scallop dredging in the bay to be restricted until the site has been comprehensively assessed.
