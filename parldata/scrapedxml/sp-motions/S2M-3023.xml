 * S2M-3023 Mr David Davidson:Obesity and Diabetes—That the Parliament recognises that obesity plays a significant part in the development of type 2 diabetes whose unchecked growth in numbers places considerable strain on NHS resources; acknowledges that early intervention after detection of impaired glucose tolerance can help to postpone or prevent the progression to type 2 diabetes and would be consistent with the recommendations in the Kerr report, and urges the Scottish Executive, in considering the new priorities for the Scottish Diabetes Framework, to include weight management for those patients where there is evidence of impaired glucose tolerance.
