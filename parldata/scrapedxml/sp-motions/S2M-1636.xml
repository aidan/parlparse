 * S2M-1636 Mr Brian Monteith:A Tolerance-Free Parliament?â€”That the Parliament supports the principle of a socially-inclusive Scotland; urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to recognise that smokers and non-smokers work in the Parliament, be they cleaners, security officers, researchers, Scottish Executive ministers or Presiding Officers; notes that the majority of smokers choose to smoke because they enjoy it and that they do not appreciate being marginalised, alienated and made public outcasts, and believes that smokers and non-smokers can coexist by the provision of a designated smoking room so that a tolerant and liberal example is set to the rest of Scotland. Supported by: Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Murdo Fraser*
