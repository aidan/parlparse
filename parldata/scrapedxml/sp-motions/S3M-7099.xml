 *S3M-7099 Rob Gibson: First Young Highland Chef of the Yearâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Fiona Murray of Helmsdale, the winner of Young Highland Chef of the Year 2010 at the inauguration of what it considers a prestigious competition held in the Burghfield House Hotel, Dornoch, organised by Taste of Tain; notes that the event attracted a panel of judges, led by Albert Roux, from what are considered some of the top restaurants in the country, including Glen Watson, Steven Docherty, Brian Maule, Andrew Fairlie, Martin Wishart and Derek Johnstone; welcomes the foresight of the organiser of the Taste of Tain team, Carole Herd, in collaborating with the Burghfield hotel school, which is part of the North Highland College of the UHI Millennium Institute, to inaugurate what can become an annual competition, thanks to the generosity and commitment of Albert Roux and the leading chefs whom he has trained, that will emphasise the talent among young Highland chefs and the fresh and nutritious produce available locally for their art to flourish; thanks all 14 contestants for what it considers was a culinary delight, and wishes them all good fortune in the cause of fine dining and the example set by chefs in hotels and restaurants far from the large cities.
