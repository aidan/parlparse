 *S3M-1221 Kenneth Gibson: Holocaust Memorial Day—That the Parliament recognises the significance of Holocaust Memorial Day; remembers all of the victims of Nazi persecution, including the six million Jews murdered in a systematic, state-sponsored campaign of persecution and extermination, and others who were targeted on ethnic, racial or political grounds; further remembers those affected by later genocides and reflects on present day discrimination; reaffirms the need to educate and motivate people individually and collectively to ensure that the horrendous crimes, racism and victimisation committed during the Holocaust and more recent genocides are neither forgotten nor repeated, and invites MSPs to light a "virtual memorial candle" on the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust website at http://www.hmd.org.uk/ HYPERLINK "blocked::http://www.hmd.org.uk/" \o "blocked::http://www.hmd.org.uk/" to demonstrate their commitment to remembering the past, reflecting on the present and creating a better future for all the communities that contribute to Scotland’s vibrant tartan.
