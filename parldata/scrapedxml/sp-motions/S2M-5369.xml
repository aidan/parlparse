*S2M-5369 Mr Brian Monteith: Old Parr Superior, the Finest Whisky in the World—That the Parliament congratulates MacDonald Greenlees of Leith on its Old Parr Superior 18 Years Scotch whisky being the first blended Scotch to be judged in the prestigious Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible as the best whisky in the world, ahead of 3,600 distinguished malts and deluxe blends, with 97 points out of 100 which equals the highest-ever score in the publication; recognises that the blending of whisky in Scotland is a fine art that has made Scotch whisky the pre-eminent whisky in the world by enabling the mass production of reliable and consistently high-quality blends and that the blending of single malts offers the opportunity to create an outstanding complex whisky with many characteristics; further recognises the success of Old Parr in many export markets but regrets that Old Parr is not available in Scotland, and calls on Diageo, the owners of MacDonald Greenlees, to consider making Old Parr available in Scotland, if not permanently then temporarily, to celebrate its distinction as the best whisky in the world and calls for it to be available in the Scottish Parliament’s bar and shop. Supported by: Mr Bruce McFee*, Alex Johnstone*, Phil Gallie*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*
