*S3M-4004 John Swinney: Budget Implications for Scotland—That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the contents of the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget last week; recognises that this is a product of poor financial management of the UK economy in recent years that will leave unprecedented burdens of debt for many years to come; acknowledges the significant pressure that the reduction of planned budgets of £500 million will have on public services, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward budget proposals for 2010-11 that will support a sustainable economy and effective public services and include an assessment of the carbon impact of its budget.
