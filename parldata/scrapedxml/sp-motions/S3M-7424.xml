*S3M-7424 Bill Wilson: Measures of Wellbeing, GDP and Free-market Ideology—That the Parliament congratulates the UK Government on its decision to instruct the Office of National Statistics to produce measures to gauge general wellbeing and welcomes reports of David Cameron’s ambition to place the eventual results at the heart of future government policy-making; predicts that, if these measures are robust and objective, they will steer policy away from free-market ideology and toward reducing socioeconomic equality by such means as implementing a truly progressive system of taxation, preventing tax evasion and avoidance, setting maximum pay ratios, eliminating the bonus culture and mandating the extensive use of community benefit clauses and related indicators of meaningful value in public procurement, and hopes that such measures will ultimately supplant GDP as a determinant of policy because it is of the view that ever-increasing GDP cannot be considered sustainable.
