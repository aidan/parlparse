 *S2M-2899# Bill Butler: Refugee Week—That the Parliament notes that 20 to 26 June 2005 is Refugee Week, supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; acknowledges that refugees have culturally, socially and economically enriched Scotland; applauds the fact that Refugee Week in Scotland aims to deliver positive educational messages that counter fear, ignorance and negative stereotypes of refugees through arts, cultural, sports and educational events which celebrate the contribution that refugees make to Scotland and promote understanding about the reasons why people seek sanctuary; welcomes the success of Refugee Week in Scotland in 2004, when over 40,000 people attended events to mark the occasion, and its continued growth with over 60 events being held in 2005, and commends the work being done by the Scottish Executive, churches, further and higher education colleges, local authorities, charities and the Scottish Refugee Council to assist the integration of refugees.
