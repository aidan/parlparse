*S3M-975# Stuart McMillan: Clyde Independent Health Scrutiny Panel Recommendations—That the Parliament welcomes the recommendations made by the independent Clyde Health Scrutiny Panel on proposals for health service changes in the Clyde area; notes that the panel believes that a longer and more reliable audit should be undertaken of why local mothers make the birthing choices that they are making, and agrees with the panel that community maternity units should continue to run for a further three-year period, accompanied by a positive community education programme informed by a survey of women’s attitudes. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Bill Kidd*, Sandra White*
