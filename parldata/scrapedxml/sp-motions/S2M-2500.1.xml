 *S2M-2500.1 Mr Brian Monteith: No Smoking Day, 9 March 2005—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2500) in the name of Mr Stewart Maxwell, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "welcomes 9 March 2005 as No Smoking Day; fully supports the efforts of the estimated 70% of smokers who wish to give up smoking; notes that the beer and pub industry in Scotland employs 150,000 people in over 5,000 public houses and that 80% of pubs are small businesses run by tenants, lessees and owners; believes that a complete ban on smoking in pubs would have a detrimental effect on freedom of choice in Scotland, and repeats calls for the Scottish Executive to allow landlords to determine smoking policy in their establishments and ensure that the freedom of choice for consumers to continue to use an establishment that allows smoking is protected.
