*S3M-593 Christine Grahame: Ronald Rae’s Lion of Scotland—That the Parliament notes the popular success of the exhibition of Ronald Rae’s sculptures in Holyrood Park; notes that most of the exhibits will be removed in November to locations such as Iona and the Falkirk Wheel; further notes that Ronald Rae is prepared to leave the Lion of Scotland in the vicinity of the Parliament with no funding cost to the Parliament, including liability cover, and therefore urges MSPs to support the relocation of the lion within the environs of the Parliament where it has already made its natural home.
