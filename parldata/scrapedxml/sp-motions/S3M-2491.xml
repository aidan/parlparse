*S3M-2491 Christine Grahame: MacDiarmid Remembered—That the Parliament acknowledges and remembers the 30th anniversary, on 9 September 2008, of the death of Scots poet and modernist, Hugh MacDiarmid, described variously as a "complex and perplexing Scottish hero", "the poet who dominates the imagination of Scotland" and "a one-man revolution"; considers that few other Scots poets or writers have left such a mark on the Scottish social and political atmosphere as has MacDiarmid, and remembers MacDiarmid as uncompromising, argumentative and unashamedly inconsistent, yet capable of writing such powerful and meaningful prose as to move a generation of Scots and open a window on the Scottish cultural and social psyche.
