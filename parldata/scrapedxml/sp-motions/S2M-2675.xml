 *S2M-2675 Christine Grahame: Scottish Achievements—That the Parliament welcomes the naming of the Central Office of Diabetes UK as Macleod House in recognition of the achievement of Professor JJR (Jack) Macleod who, with Frederick Banting, was awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin; notes that it was this Scottish doctor who in Canada, as Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto, provided the facilities, direction and advice and support to others which helped turn insulin into a usable treatment, saving millions of lives worldwide; further notes that a Macleod medal has been struck which is awarded to any person who has been insulin-dependent for more than 70 years and that already there are recipients of the medal; is concerned that the achievements of this Scot, who is one among many, have failed to be recognised or publicised, and urges the Scottish Executive to consult the Scottish people on placing within the Parliament a wall of fame for those compatriots, such as Professor Jack Macleod, whose achievements remain unrecognised to this day.
