*S2M-5048 Tommy Sheridan: Members’ Accommodation Allowances System—That the Parliament is concerned that the Members’ accommodation allowances system needs to be urgently reformed as the current system has allowed Scottish taxpayers to be ripped off for the benefit of very well-paid politicians who profit from a parliament-assisted property scheme; notes that the First Minister supports reforming the Members’ accommodation allowance system but regrets that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) has not responded positively, and therefore calls on the SPCB to review urgently the accommodation allowances system which has become totally discredited in public opinion.
