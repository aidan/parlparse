 *S3M-4274 Willie Coffey: Scottish Breast Screening Programme, 21st Anniversary—That the Parliament recognises the importance of increasing survival rates from breast cancer, the most frequently diagnosed form of cancer among women; notes that around 4,000 cases are diagnosed each year; further recognises that screening has significantly reduced deaths from breast cancer among women aged 50 to 70; acknowledges that 2009 is the 21st anniversary of the Scottish Breast Screening Programme; welcomes the valuable contribution made by this programme over the last 21 years, and looks forward to the NHS continuing to increase uptake of the programme among women aged over 50 by invitation and among younger women through action to increase the rate of self-assessment and self-referral.
