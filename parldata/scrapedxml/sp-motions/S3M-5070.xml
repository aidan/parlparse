*S3M-5070 Bill Wilson: Detention without Trial Is an Assault on Human Rights and Civil Liberties—That the Parliament recognises the right to due process for all detainees and therefore is disturbed that there are people in the United Kingdom who have been held in custody and without trial for an extended period; believes that due process entails all detainees knowing the charges against them, having access to legal advice and receiving a fair trial within a reasonable time, and believes that, when the basic human rights and civil liberties of some are breached, the rights and liberties of all are threatened and that disregarding rights and liberties does nothing to make the United Kingdom a safer country or combat terrorism.
