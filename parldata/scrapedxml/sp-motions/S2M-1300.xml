*S2M-1300# Cathy Peattie: Zero Tolerance to Fire Deaths-That the Parliament recommends the promotion of a culture of zero tolerance of all preventable fire deaths, that is deaths, including those resulting from arson attacks, that could be prevented by the adoption by local fire and rescue authorities of effective planning and strategies for prevention, detection and emergency intervention and considers that all fire and rescue authorities in Scotland should work towards this goal through proper strategic integrated risk management planning that combines the most effective mix of prevention, detection and intervention measures aimed at securing zero fire deaths.
