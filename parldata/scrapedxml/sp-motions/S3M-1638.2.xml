S3M-1638.2 Margaret Smith: Fatal Accident Inquiries—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1638) in the name of Frank Mulholland, insert at end "considers that there is a pressing need for the Scottish Government to enable inquiries to be held in Scotland into the deaths of military personnel, normally domiciled in Scotland, who are killed in active service overseas, and believes that the Scottish Government should give consideration to all available options, including the holding of fatal accident inquiries on a mandatory basis, so that the families of Scottish military personnel no longer have to suffer from the additional burden of attending coroners’ inquests in England."
