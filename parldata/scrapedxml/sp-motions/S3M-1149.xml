*S3M-1149 Helen Eadie: Friends of Remploy—That the Parliament celebrates the eighth year of the Friends of Remploy event at the Parliament on 23 January 2007 which will pledge ongoing support and help to all those involved in creating employment and training opportunities for those with special needs and hopes that the Scottish Government will ensure that initiatives are underway to ensure that officials involved in public procurement in Scotland in both the public and private sectors will be conversant with the special powers that Article 19 of the EU Directive confers to facilitate the award of contracts to sheltered workshops, helping thereby to protect the future for this vital aspect of employment opportunity and training in Scotland.
