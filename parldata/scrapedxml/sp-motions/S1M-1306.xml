 *S1M-1306 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Baillieston Community Care Project-That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to intervene immediately to save the Baillieston Community Care Project and related services from closure in November as they are unable to pay their £11,000 wage bill due to insecurity of funding; believes that this is a classic case of care in the community running into funding problems and that closure would mean that, of the 71 clients, an estimated 20 to 30 frail clients will have to be admitted to institutional full-time care at a cost of £322,000 to £483,000; notes that only £51,900 is needed in immediate aid with £106,000 needed in total to keep the Project going and that the two superb projects they run, Bealach House Day Care, Oldwood Road, Baillieston and the Dementia Home Care Project, are the principle surviving services of their kind in Baillieston which has suffered the closure of Easterhill Day Care Centre recently and that the future for more than 70 frail clients, ranging from those with cerebral palsy to autism and dementia, is at stake; further notes that people, including an 87 year old caring for her sister of 100 years of age, are able to remain in their own homes only because of the existence of the threatened day care services and that local doctors, clergy and families all appeal for the service, which was founded in 1992, to be saved as a matter of the greatest urgency, and considers that emergency intervention is needed, as such a closure would have a devastating effect on the most vulnerable people in the East End of Glasgow.
