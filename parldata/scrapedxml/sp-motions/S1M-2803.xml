*S1M-2803 Trish Godman: Fair Trade Fortnight-That the Parliament warmly welcomes Fair Trade Fortnight (4-17 March 2002); believes that Fair Trade activity, encouraged as it is by Oxfam Scotland and other non-governmental organisations and agencies, performs a valuable role in assisting with the setting up of women's co-operatives, small businesses and village enterprises throughout the developing world which provide important economic and social assistance to the families and communities of those involved in such productive activities, and commends the shops and stores which sell Fair Trade products and individual shoppers, local authorities, schools and churches who buy such products.
