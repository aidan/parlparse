*S3M-3608 Kenneth Gibson: Ayrshire Macmillan Ayrshire Appeal—That the Parliament congratulates Macmillan Cancer Support on the official launch of the Ayrshire Macmillan Money Matters Service on 3 March 2009; notes that even before the official launch, since opening in November 2008, 164 people with cancer and their families in Ayrshire have secured over £183,000 in additional benefits; recognises that Macmillan now runs 26 such centres across Scotland and, to date, has generated some £30 million in additional benefits, successfully assisting some 76% of all those who have called on their services; acknowledges that Macmillan also awards small hardship grants totalling around £1.5 million a year in Scotland for some 4,000 people; is aware that Ayrshire Money Matters was established with the support of East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire councils, NHS Ayrshire and Arran and the Pensions Service, with £300,000 from Macmillan itself to fund full-time welfare rights workers in each local authority area; commends the excellent work that Macmillan does in providing information on all aspects of finance, and wishes Macmillan Cancer Support every success in raising £500,000 through its Ayrshire Appeal to support the Ayrshire Macmillan Money Matters Service for the next three years and beyond.
