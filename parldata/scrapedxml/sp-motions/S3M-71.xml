*S3M-71 Angela Constance: Support for Tesco Lorry Drivers Based at the Livingston Distribution Centreâ€”That the Parliament calls on Tesco to abandon its planned imposition of new terms and conditions on lorry drivers currently employed at its Livingston distribution centre; agrees that using the relocation of the distribution centre to drive through a diminution of terms and conditions for staff employed at the current site is unacceptable; notes that the result of a ballot was 95.5% in favour of industrial action on a 92.3% turnout leading to three days of industrial action commencing on 24 May 2007; acknowledges concerns that the Livingston distribution centre may be used as a testing ground for other distribution centres within and outwith the Tesco supermarket chain; supports Unite T &amp; G Section in its past and current endeavours to reach a negotiated settlement, and calls on Tesco to re-engage with Unite T &amp; G Section as failure to do so may result in widespread industrial action.
