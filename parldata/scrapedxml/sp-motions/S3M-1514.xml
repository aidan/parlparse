 *S3M-1514 Brian Adam: Scrap the Fuel Tax Rise—That the Parliament notes with great concern the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s plans to increase fuel tax by two pence per litre; also notes the growing inflation on the price of groceries and other goods due to large shipping costs, and calls on the Chancellor to take measures on behalf of the haulage industry, Scottish business and the Scottish people to forego the tax increase and bring about measures to create more stability in the Scottish financial sector.
