*S3M-727 Elaine Murray: Crichton Economic Impact Study—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Cogent SI’s Crichton Economic Impact Study, commissioned by the Crichton Development Company, which estimates that activities on the Crichton academic and business campus will increase economic activity in Dumfries and Galloway by £311 million per annum; notes that 1,100 higher education students are currently studying at the campus; notes that the universities of Paisley and Glasgow and Bell College currently employ 120 academic and non-academic staff; notes also that 27 businesses and public organisations are also based on the estate, directly employing 720 people and indirectly supporting more than 1,000 additional jobs in the region; welcomes the quantification of the contribution of the campus to the local economy and the recognition that the Crichton is part of the Scottish knowledge economy, and agrees with the report’s conclusions that the Crichton is a huge asset to Dumfries and Galloway.
