 *S1M-2546.1 Richard Lochhead: Sea Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2546) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "; further calls on the Executive to seek an increase in nephrops quotas in line with scientific advice and ensure that the outcome of all the negotiations recognises the mixed character of Scotland’s fisheries and takes into account the many conservation measures already agreed by the industry; further calls upon Ministers to retain an open mind with regard to fisheries management measures proposed by the industry and financially supported by the EU, and urges the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to seek designation as lead UK Minister on the EU Fisheries Council for the forthcoming negotiations on quotas and the Common Fisheries Policy in order to secure the best possible deal for the catching and processing sectors.
