*S3M-2484 Kenneth Gibson: Options for Independence—That the Parliament applauds the work undertaken by the British Red Cross’s Options for Independence programme, which actively engages with physically-disabled adults to provide immediate skilled support and opportunities for young people to live more independently; is aware of the vital respite, short-stay, housing, transitional and residential support provided by this service; values the three high quality service Scottish locations in Highland, north and south Ayrshire, which make extensive use of volunteers to enhance the support to service users; congratulates the Irvine complex, which offers such a high standard of accommodation that the Care Commission in Scotland used it as the quality benchmark when setting national physical environment standards for disabled adult residential services, and appreciates that taking more control of their lives is vital to those living with physical disabilities and that, with support, such citizens are able to play a more active part in their communities.
