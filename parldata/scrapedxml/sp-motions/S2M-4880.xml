*S2M-4880 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Livestock Transport—That the Parliament notes the forthcoming implementation of the EU regulation on the welfare of animals during transportation from 5 January 2007; further notes that this regulation may require farmers who transport their own stock to pay more than £400 to secure the necessary authorisation to move those animals; recognises that these welfare regulations are to be welcomed but that they put yet another financial and administrative burden on small farmers, including a requirement for anyone transporting animals over 65km to have a specific authorisation and, from 2008, an independent certificate of competence, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take advantage of the available derogations to ensure that the proposed administrative and financial burdens on individual farmers are reduced and also to encourage the building of small-scale local slaughter houses which will reduce transport time, improve animal welfare and create much-needed rural jobs.
