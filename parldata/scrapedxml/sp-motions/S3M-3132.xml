 *S3M-3132# Sandra White: Opposition to Parkhead Fire Station Closure—That the Parliament expresses concern over the proposals of Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service management to close Parkhead fire station; believes that the communities of Shettleston, Tollcross, Haghill, Dalmarnock, Riddrie, Carntyne and Mount Vernon, which will now be served by a new station in Cambuslang, will see response times to incidents increasing, which in turn will lead to an increase in the number of fire deaths and injuries; notes that Parkhead fire stationcovers some of the poorest communities in the United Kingdom and that it has been identified that the main causes of fires are related to social and economic problems, drug and alcohol abuse and areas of poverty and high unemployment, and believes that Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service management’s proposals will be detrimental to those communities affected.
