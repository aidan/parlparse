 *S3M-5194 Willie Coffey: It’s Scotland’s Attendance Allowance Too—That the Parliament is concerned at the proposal to scrap attendance allowance, as outlined in the consultation paper, Shaping the Future of Care Together; records its particular concern that this proposal, which will affect older and disabled people across the United Kingdom, has been put forward by the UK Government in a consultation limited to England; calls on the UK Government to maintain attendance allowance in its present form, allowing disabled people to exercise a greater degree of control over their own lives; further calls on the UK Government to commit to equal consultation with those affected across the UK about any proposals to change the UK-wide benefit system, and notes that, in response to concerns expressed by constituents, a petition has been launched on these matters, which is available to be signed online at http://www.gopetition.com/online/31844.html.
