*S2M-3792.4 Rosie Kane: Sustainable Development Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3792) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from “supports” to end and insert “regrets that the strategy fails to address the environmental needs of Scotland’s communities with projects such as the M74 extension and the Dalkeith bypass developments going ahead, despite local community opposition; further regrets that the Executive has failed to introduce third party right of appeal for communities in the draft Planning Bill which is indicative of its inability to understand and address the environmental needs and concerns of individuals and communities, and therefore calls on the Executive to review its sustainable development policy in light of these concerns and to redraft its policy to ensure environmental justice for all.” Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
