*S2M-1465# Sarah Boyack: FareShare and Food Redistribution Schemes-That the Parliament recognises the valuable contribution made by the Edinburgh Cyrenians and Dundee Cyrenians in establishing their FareShare projects, which collect and redistribute surplus fresh food from manufacturers and retail outlets to centres and shelters for homeless people; notes the direct benefits of providing nutritious food to homeless people while minimising food waste and its subsequent disposal to landfill sites; recognises the additional benefits created by these charities in allowing resources to be diverted into vital counselling, resettlement and other support services and in encouraging homeless people to gain social contact and new skills by participating as volunteers; commends such excellent examples of socially and environmentally responsible partnerships between food manufacturers and the voluntary sector, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make a firm financial commitment to ensure the continuation of existing projects and the further development and enhancement of such schemes across Scotland.
