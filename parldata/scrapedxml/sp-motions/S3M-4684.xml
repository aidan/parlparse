 S3M-4684 Margaret Smith: Edinburgh’s Resilience in Difficult Times—That the Parliament welcomes the progress reports showing that Scotland’s capital is surviving the recession much better than predicted, with main indicators such as house prices, city centre footfall, airport passenger numbers, employment and new business formation stronger than expected in the current climate; notes the contribution that events such as the Royal Highland Show, Homecoming and Edinburgh’s festivals have made to this success; applauds the efforts of the City of Edinburgh Council in developing an Economic Resilience Action Plan and an Economic Resilience Network to allow the city to respond rapidly to the changing economic circumstances, and, recognising the importance to Scotland as a whole of a strong, successful capital city, supports the ongoing work of the council and key partners to ensure that Edinburgh continues to thrive.
