 *S3M-1452 Jeremy Purvis: Choices for People Coming to the End of Terminal Illness—That the Parliament recognises and commends the committed work of all health professionals and carers who support patients with terminal illness; welcomes the advances in the palliative care movement over recent years that have benefited patients who are coming towards the end of terminal illness; further welcomes national campaigns to allow patients to be aware of choices that they can make about their treatment and facilitate more patients to make the choice of dying at home, but believes, however, that there remain patients who wish to have greater control of their treatment and that it is right to debate allowing greater legal support for the choices that some patients may make to ask for assistance to die as they come towards the end of their terminal illnesses.
