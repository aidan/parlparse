*S3M-3549 Des McNulty: A82, Kilbowie Roundabout—That the Parliament notes the continuing problems being experienced due to increasing traffic flows at the Kilbowie roundabout on the A82, causing particularly severe congestion at peak hours in the Hardgate area; welcomes the steps being taken by West Dunbartonshire Council and its partners to come up with the most appropriate engineering solution, and urges Scottish ministers to provide funding for the necessary works, bearing in mind undertakings given at the time that tolls were removed from the Erskine Bridge that ministers would ensure that necessary upgrades to key junctions on the A82, as a consequence of increased flows arising from the removal of tolls, would be given priority in the Scottish Government’s transport programme.
