*S2M-693 Tommy Sheridan: Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service-That the Parliament notes the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service appeal for new blood donors to tackle the current crisis in supplies that could lead to hospitals being told that only emergency operations can be carried out because blood stocks are so low; calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to make the necessary arrangements for a mobile donor unit to come to the Parliament; encourages all MSPs and their staff to lead by example in donating a pint of blood where physically possible, and resolves to support high profile campaigns to encourage more Scots to become blood donors and thus save and enhance the lives of others.
