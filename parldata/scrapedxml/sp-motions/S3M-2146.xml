*S3M-2146 Gil Paterson: No News is Bad News for the BBC—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the BBC Trust report which highlights the absence of coverage in UK news bulletins of items that are of concern to Scotland; further notes that bulletins labelled as national are in fact almost exclusively English, and calls on the BBC to act swiftly to bring about an equity of programming to reflect the true nature of issues that are pertinent both to constituent nations of the United Kingdom and to the UK as a whole.
