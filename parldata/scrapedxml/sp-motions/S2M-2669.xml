 * S2M-2669 Michael Matheson: Crisis in Sudan—That the Parliament congratulates Alfred Taban on winning the 2005 House of Commons Speaker Abbot Award for exposing the scale of the killing in Darfur; recognises that Mr Taban has been arrested many times, harassed on a daily basis and his newspaper, the Khartoum Monitor, has been closed down on numerous occasions in fighting for media freedom and democracy in Sudan; recognises the scale of the crisis in Sudan with the death toll possibly reaching 300,000 and 2 million people having to abandon their homes; notes the recent House of Commons committee report which described the international communities response to the crisis as “scandalously ineffective”; believes that the international community must fulfil its responsibility to protect the people of Darfur, and supports the call for the situation in Darfur to be referred to the International Criminal Court.
