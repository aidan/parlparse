*S3M-3104 Jamie Hepburn: Walk Don’t Run—That the Parliament notes with concern the claims of the Communication Workers Union that Royal Mail management are expecting postal workers to walk their routes at an average speed of 4 mph, instead of the long-established expectation of 2.4 mph; believes that this is an obvious attempt at further cost cutting that will simply lead to increased work-related injury among staff, further reducing the morale of an already beleaguered workforce, and asks Royal Mail management to stop this cost-cutting exercise.
