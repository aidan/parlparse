*S2M-2931.2 Carolyn Leckie: Health Issues with Specific Reference to the Kerr Report—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2931) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the contents of the Kerr report and recognises its contribution to the debate on the future of the NHS in Scotland; believes that, if protected within a public model, many of its proposals are useful; is concerned, however, that the report suggests, in line with the current trend of Scottish Executive policy, several avenues for the further marketisation and privatisation of health care, relies heavily on NHS staff co-operating again with reorganisation and retraining and accepting new and additional roles and responsibilities but claims that the proposals within the report are "cost neutral", and therefore believes that the NHS’s capacity, workforce planning and recruitment and retention problems will not be resolved by the report’s recommendations or current Executive policy, and that only securing and expanding the NHS as a public service, delivered by public service workers from publicly-owned facilities, will offer the foundation for the improvement and development of an NHS in Scotland fit for the 21st century."
