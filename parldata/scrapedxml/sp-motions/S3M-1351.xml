*S3M-1351 Nigel Don: Public Bodies with 08 Telephone Numbersâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern that citizens in the north east of Scotland on low incomes are having to pay up to 40p a minute to call public bodies which use telephone numbers beginning with 08; welcomes Ofcom guidance which recommends the use of normal geographical numbers alongside 08 numbers, and encourages all public bodies to use 03 numbers which cost the same as normal geographical numbers.
