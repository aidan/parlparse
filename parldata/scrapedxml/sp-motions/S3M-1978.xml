*S3M-1978 Elaine Smith: Playboy Protest—That the Parliament notes the decision by a vicar in York to speak out against the sale and marketing of Playboy goods to children and commends the BBC for its excellent coverage of this issue; believes that the promotion of these items in everyday high street stores, alongside popular children’s goods such as Disney merchandise, suggests morally questionable marketing practices and placement of goods policies which must be rethought; expresses concern at the growing normalisation of inappropriate material, messages and logos on children’s goods and clothing; believes that it is manipulative, dangerous and exploitative to target sexualised merchandise at children, and further believes that such morally corrupt marketing practices contribute to the desensitisation of society to pornography and the continuing inequality and exploitation of women.
