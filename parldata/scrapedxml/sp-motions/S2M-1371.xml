*S2M-1371# Elaine Smith: Launch of Osteoporosis Mobile Scanner in Coatbridge-That the Parliament welcomes the launch in Coatbridge of the first NHS mobile scanner for osteoporosis; recognises that one in three women in Scotland suffer from osteoporosis, but that many women are not aware that they have reduced bone density; notes that there are 20,000 osteoporotic fractures in Scotland every year, which cost the NHS Â£1.7 billion per annum and that this figure will continue to rise as we live longer; recognises that this is a health issue of particular importance to the women of Scotland; congratulates NHS Lanarkshire for supporting this innovative project; further congratulates local Coatbridge GP, Dr Eamonn Brankin, the project leader, for his vision and tenacity in securing the loan of this mobile service; notes, however, that this is a temporary solution, only available for 16 weeks, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider ways of securing future funding for this example of best practice in Coatbridge and pursue the option of rolling it out across Scotland.
