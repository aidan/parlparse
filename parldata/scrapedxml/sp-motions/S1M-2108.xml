S1M-2108 Michael Russell: Number of MSPs—That the Parliament believes that any move at Westminster to implement the provision in the Scotland Act 1998 which would cut the number of MSPs from 129 would be severely damaging to Scottish democracy, given that 129 is the smallest number of seats that allows any effective proportionality of seats arising from votes cast; further believes that any reduction in the number of members would adversely affect the committee system of the Parliament which after two years is proving itself to be effective and efficient; believes that such a crucial decision for the future of Scotland and its democratic institutions would be better made by this Parliament rather than Westminster, and therefore calls upon the Parliamentary Bureau to establish a special committee to prepare an urgent all-party and unanimous submission to Her Majesty's Government demanding the retention of the present number of seats. Supported by: Fiona Hyslop, Richard Lochhead, Christine Grahame, Mr Kenneth Gibson, Ms Sandra White, Tommy Sheridan, Irene McGugan, Donald Gorrie, Mr Gil Paterson, Mr Lloyd Quinan, Mr Adam Ingram, Alex Neil
