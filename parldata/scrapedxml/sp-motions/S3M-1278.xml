 *S3M-1278 Robert Brown: Effective Energy Complaint Handling—That the Parliament notes that the changes in consumer representation and complaint handling that take effect from the end of September 2008 will require energy suppliers to take additional responsibility for resolving their own complaints; further notes that suppliers will have to adhere to a new statutory complaint-handling standard; recognises the need for Ofgem to ensure that a new standard gives a clear signal to suppliers that their complaint-handling functions must be accessible to all consumers and believes that company complaints data should be subject to independent verification, without which there are likely to be concerns about data quality, transparency and insufficient incentives on companies to invest in improving their customer service, and calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to ensure that, before the standard is approved, it contains provisions that companies must provide their complaints data to the new consumer advocacy body and Ofgem and that this data will be subject to independent audit to allow consumers to compare companies’ customer service performance.
