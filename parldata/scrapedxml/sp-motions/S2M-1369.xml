 *S2M-1369 Donald Gorrie: South Lanarkshire Council Planning for Sydes Braes-That the Parliament deeply regrets the decision of South Lanarkshire Council's planning committee to approve the application for the construction of a crematorium at the Sydes Braes site in High Blantyre; notes that this decision was taken in spite of almost 2,000 letters of objection from local residents, and believes that any further action in relation to the application should not be taken without a public inquiry which takes full and proper account of local views on the proposals.
