*S3M-1264 Peter Peacock: Scottish Book Trust—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Book Trust on the launch of its new programme of activities; recognises the importance of the work that the Scottish Book Trust carries out in encouraging both readers and writers in Scotland; commends the trust for its work in schools, prisons and also with looked-after children which helps to improve communication skills and encourages reading and literature; further congratulates the trust on its work to promote Scottish writers and writing through projects such as the New Writers awards and the Short Story campaign; commends in particular the Isle of Jura Writer Retreat programme which has established itself as one of the best creative opportunities available to writers of stature anywhere in the world; notes the new projects being introduced this year which include a new children’s festival, as well as a new Scotland-wide project to encourage Scots to share their stories, and wishes the Scottish Book Trust every success for these events and beyond.
