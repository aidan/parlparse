 *S3M-3296 Jackie Baillie: Slashing Services in West Dunbartonshire—That the Parliament expresses dismay at the recent budget savings options issued by West Dunbartonshire Council, totalling a possible £8.5 million of cuts in services; notes that the proposed cuts disproportionately affect children and young people and older and vulnerable people; further notes that for older people the proposals include increasing the cost of community alarms, charging for meals on wheels and closing day care centres and care homes, that for people with a learning disability or mental health problem who are receiving a housing support service the council is considering charging £20 a week for services that are currently free and that for children and young people the proposals include options such as closing Garshake Nursery and St Martin’s Primary School, the removal of all breakfast clubs and free milk for children in primary one to primary three, the closure of all out-of-school care provision and the removal of all music, PE, drama and art teachers from primary schools, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government urgently to intervene to protect the interests of West Dunbartonshire residents.
