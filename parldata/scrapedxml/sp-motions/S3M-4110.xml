 *S3M-4110# Ted Brocklebank: New Secondary School for North East Fife—That the Parliament believes that the children, parents and communities of Tay Bridgehead in north east Fife require a new secondary school and community facility in addition to the proposed single site at Madras College; highlights that the campaign for a new Tay Bridgehead school has been ongoing for more than half a century; considers, in light of recent leaked figures, that the proposed new Madras College will not be big enough to accommodate all the pupils, including those from the Tay Bridgehead area; notes that currently around 850 pupils from the Tay Bridgehead and Leuchars area have to be bussed to school and that this has affected their education and involvement in school activities, as has been the case for generations; congratulates The Courier, Fife Herald and St Andrews Citizen Newspaper for highlighting the growing public support for a Tay Bridgehead school, and supports all those involved in the campaign.
