*S3M-5598 Ken Macintosh: Bullyproof—That the Parliament commends the work of Radio 1’s Bullyproof campaign in raising awareness of bullying, in building self-confidence and in addressing the concerns of young people; deplores bullying in all of its forms; considers that the Bullyproof campaign provides children and young people with the tools to combat bullying and guidance on how to cope if they are the victims of bullying; believes that bullying is a serious issue in Scotland’s schools and that all efforts to help children and young people cope are to be commended; acknowledges the effectiveness and innovation of the Bullyproof campaign in reaching as many people as possible with its interactive use of numerous social networking sites and high-profile endorsers, and particularly welcomes the opportunity that it provides for young people who have experienced bullying to be heard and supported by their peers.
