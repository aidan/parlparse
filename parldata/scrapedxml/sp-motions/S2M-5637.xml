*S2M-5637♦ Jackie Baillie: Changing Places—That the Parliament recognises that around 3,500 people in Scotland with profound and multiple learning disabilities, as well as many thousands of other disabled people, cannot use standard accessible toilets and require public toilets with enough space for disabled people and their carers along with the right equipment, including a height adjustable changing bench and a hoist; notes the positive examples of facilities in the Meadow Centre in Dumbarton and in the Vale of Leven leisure centre; supports the Changing Places Campaign, launched by the Changing Places Consortium of MENCAP, PAMIS (Promoting a More Inclusive Society), Dumfries and Galloway Council, Nottingham City Council, the Valuing People Support Team and the Scottish Executive’s "Same As You" team, which is calling for more of these toilets to be installed in public places to enable disabled people and their carers to be active citizens, and notes that the Cross Party Group on Learning Disability welcomes all efforts, including those of the Parliament, to ensure that provision is made for people with profound and multiple learning disabilities.
