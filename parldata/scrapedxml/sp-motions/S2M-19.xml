*S2M-19# Tricia Marwick: Firefighters' Dispute—That the Parliament notes that the firefighters' dispute remains unresolved; supports the continued right to strike for an improvement in pay and conditions; further notes the position of Her Majesty's Government which allows for a pay settlement to be imposed by legislation; opposes such an imposition and any proposal for legislation in the Scottish Parliament intended to achieve that, and calls for meaningful talks to be resumed as soon as possible ensuring a fair settlement for firefighters with no detriment to the delivery of fire services to the general public and for any change to future bargaining arrangements to be the subject of consultation and negotiation with the Fire Brigades Union, the STUC and other relevant parties.
