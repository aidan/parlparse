*S3M-6872 Bill Kidd: UK Government Hits Poorest Hardest, New IFS Research—That the Parliament expresses concern that research by the Institute of Fiscal Studies has indicated that the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government’s June 2010 UK Budget is regressive as it "shows that, once all of the benefit cuts are considered, the tax and benefit changes announced in the emergency Budget are clearly regressive" and that "Low-income households of working age lose the most as a proportion of income from the tax and benefit reforms announced in the emergency Budget".
