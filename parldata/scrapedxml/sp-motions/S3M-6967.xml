*S3M-6967# Jamie McGrigor: Oban Bay Marine—That the Parliament notes the importance of recreational boating and marine tourism, which benefits the Scottish economy by upwards of £300 million per annum; considers that Argyll and Bute is in the forefront of this sector with many successful marinas; is disappointed by the recent decision made by the board of Argyll and Bute Council’s CHORD programme not to back the Oban Bay berthing scheme that was put forward by the Oban Bay Marine (OBM) company; congratulates the volunteers and backers of OBM for their hard work and financial support in relation to the scheme; would welcome the publication of the report that was the basis for the rejection of the proposal; notes that the OBM proposal was backed by many of the businesses and people in the area who have, for many years, believed that Oban needed a marina that could bring financial benefit to the local economy and take advantage of what is considered to be the steady expansion of Scottish sailing tourism by providing the right facilities in the area; further believes that Oban is a key west coast location for marine tourism and that the OBM proposal would complement existing local marinas; hopes that the £900,000 earmarked for the project will still be used for the benefit of the Oban economy, and believes that a new transit marina would benefit the town of Oban and Scottish marine tourism as a whole.
