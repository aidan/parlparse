*S1M-3804 Ms Margo MacDonald: Performance of Holyrood Progress Group—That the Parliament has no confidence in the political judgement and sense of proportion displayed by the Holyrood Progress Group as represented by its decision to celebrate and congratulate itself on the purchase of a reception desk for the new Parliament building, the price of which adds insult to the injury already done to the reputation of the Parliament by the group’s inept management of the Holyrood building project and its complete failure to fulfil the remit to bring the project in on time and budget, and therefore directs the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to relieve the current members of the group of their duties and replace them with a representative and competent group of MSPs.
