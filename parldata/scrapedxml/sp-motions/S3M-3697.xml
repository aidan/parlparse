*S3M-3697 Christine Grahame: Return of the William Wallace Safe Conduct Letterâ€”That the Parliament calls for the return to Scotland of the Safe Conduct Letter from the King of France, Philip IV, which was carried by William Wallace on his capture at Robroyston on 3 August 1305; notes with regret that this important historical artefact continues to be stored in a closed drawer at the UK National Archives in Surrey, and urges the Scottish Government, in the Year of Homecoming Scotland 2009, to back calls for its return and permanent display in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.
