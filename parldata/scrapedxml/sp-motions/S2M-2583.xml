 *S2M-2583 Bill Butler: Drumchapel High School Pupils’ Act of Solidarity—That the Parliament expresses its admiration for the pupils of Drumchapel High School in Glasgow who organised a petition which attracted hundreds of signatures in support of their friends and fellow pupils, Agnesa, aged 15, and Gentian Murselaj, aged 12, who were taken from their home in Scotstoun at 7.00 am on Sunday 6 March 2005 following the rejection of their family’s asylum application; conveys concern at the apparently heavy-handed nature of the family’s eviction, which saw Mr Murselaj handcuffed by one of several immigration officials drafted in to extract the family of five, including a nine-year-old child, from their home; notes that the pupils’ petition may have played a significant role in influencing the Home Office’s subsequent decision to grant the family a stay of removal pending a case review; agrees that these acts of solidarity and support not only exemplify the goodwill which exists towards asylum seekers in Scotland but also demonstrate the philosophy behind the Scottish Executive’s One Scotland Many Cultures campaign, and considers that the pupils should be congratulated for their stance.
