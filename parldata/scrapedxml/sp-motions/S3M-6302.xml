 *S3M-6302 Kenneth Gibson: Democratic Choice—That the Parliament condemns what it believes to be the bizarre and anti-democratic comments reported by newly elected Labour MP Margaret Curran MSP in The Herald on 12 May 2010 when her statement implied that the SNP should not stand candidates against Labour although Labour should be able to field candidates against the SNP; considers that Ms Curran’s reported suggestion that the SNP is somehow responsible for the creation of the Conservative/Liberal Democrat UK government by standing candidates in the same seats as the Labour Party is wholly inaccurate, undemocratic and against the right of people to vote for whom they wish; believes that if the SNP had not stood candidates in constituencies such as Banff and Buchan, Perth and Perthshire North, Moray and Angus then the number of seats won by the Conservative Party would have been even greater; also considers it arrogant to assume that if the SNP had not stood candidates in these constituencies that votes would automatically have gone to the Labour Party, and believes that Labour lost power because of its dismal failure in England, caused by years of economic mismanagement.
