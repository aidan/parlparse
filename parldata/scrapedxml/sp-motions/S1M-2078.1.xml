*S1M-2078.1 Dr Elaine Murray: Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-2078) in the name of Mike Watson, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "does not agree to the general principles of the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill because, while accepting the desire of the sponsors to end cruelty to wild mammals, it does not believe that this Bill adequately addresses the issues presented in evidence to the Rural Development Committee and considers that the Scottish Executive, as an alternative, should examine the existing law in relation to wild mammals, in particular the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996, in order to take action against any unnecessary suffering caused through the provisions of this Act and to bring the legislation covering wild mammals into line with that which applies to domestic animals."
