*S2M-3157 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Green Power Developmentâ€”That the Parliament backs recent moves to create a major biomass development at the Tullis Russell paper mill in Fife which could use up to 700,000 tonnes of fuel crops, including willow chippings, for a heat and electricity generating plant; further supports the fact that this could be a major boost for local farmers who may be able to grow willow coppice to support the plant; notes that renewable energy in Scotland will take a big leap forward with this major project and that it widens the range of renewable energy projects in Scotland, and recognises that farming is going through tough times with many enterprises not recovering their costs of production and that Scottish agriculture will benefit greatly from this development.
