*S3M-2853.1 Derek Brownlee: Scottish Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-2853) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from second "and" to end and insert "; notes the actions already taken by the Scottish Government but believes that the current recession is in part attributable to the mismanagement of the UK economy by the present UK Government and the era of irresponsibility over which it has presided, evidenced by the record levels of government borrowing, regulatory failure and the taxation of pension schemes, which has discouraged saving and investment, and welcomes the measures approved by this Parliament, such as business rates relief and the council tax freeze, which will help businesses and households to maximise jobs and investment and provide a basis for Scotland to take early and speedy advantage of any recovery."
