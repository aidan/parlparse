 *S3M-3133 Sandra White: Glasgow’s New Centre of Excellence—That the Parliament welcomes the groundbreaking commitment by the British Heart Foundation Scotland and Marie Curie Cancer Care to invest £3.6 million in a centre of excellence in Glasgow to provide a comprehensive service for advanced heart failure patients and their families; considers that these services will create a gold standard in palliative care for patients in the advanced stages of heart failure and pioneer a model of care for patients in Scotland and across the United Kingdom, and believes that sufferers and their families will benefit greatly from the dignity and peace of mind that this investment will bring.
