*S3M-3433 Bill Kidd: Carer’s Allowance—That the Parliament notes that, at £50.55 per week, Carer’s Allowance is lower than most earnings replacement benefits, lower, for example, than the category A State Pension of £90.70, than long-term Incapacity Benefit and Employment and Support Allowance (with work-related activity component) of £84.50, than Statutory Sick Pay of £75.40 and than contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance for over-25s of £60.50, with the contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance for under-25s being an exception at only £47.95; considers that unpaid carers make a vast contribution to society as a whole, both in terms of social wellbeing and public finance, and calls for an urgent and substantial increase in Carer’s Allowance to support more fittingly those who unselfishly sacrifice their time to look after others.
