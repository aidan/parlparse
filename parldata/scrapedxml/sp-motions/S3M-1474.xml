 *S3M-1474 Bill Wilson: Scottish Affairs Committee: Report on Child Poverty in Scotland (HC 277)—That the Parliament welcomes the recent report on child poverty in Scotland by Westminster’s Scottish Affairs Committee which shows that Scotland is doing better than the United Kingdom as a whole at reducing child poverty; notes, however, that the rate of reduction in child poverty may be slowing and that recent reductions in child poverty rates may not have fully benefited children in the most severe poverty; notes the recommendation that the position of young single adults should be improved and, accordingly, that age-based discrimination in the tax and benefits system should end; notes that a significant proportion of children living in poverty come from households where at least one parent is working and the committee’s consequent recommendation that the problems of low pay, job retention and career advancement be tackled; further notes the committee’s emphasis on the importance of suitable and affordable childcare, especially with respect to disabled children, as well as its emphasis on the importance of the contribution to society made by full-time carers; also notes its criticism of the complexity of the tax credit system; supports its call for the UK and Scottish governments (where relevant) to do more to simplify the benefits system, to improve awareness of entitlements and to constantly review the effectiveness of programmes designed to tackle child poverty, and, especially, calls for poverty-reduction programmes to be focussed mainly on those in the deepest poverty and on families with disabled members.
