 *S1M-1768 Michael Russell: The Scottish Daily Express—That the Parliament notes with concern current speculation regarding a threat to the continued operation and identity of the Scottish Daily Express as a result of the recent change of ownership of Express newspapers; notes that the Scottish Daily Express has a distinguished history and has made a consistent contribution to the breadth of Scottish political debate; recognises that Scotland requires a diverse and healthy press, not a reduction of choice of titles available, and expresses the hope that the current ownership of the Express group will strengthen the identity and independence of its Scottish title and compete vigorously for readers, rather than abandoning an important and growing market.
