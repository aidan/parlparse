*S3M-2740 Bill Kidd: Radiation Exposure at Faslaneâ€”That the Parliament commends the bravery of workers at Faslane nuclear submarine base on the Clyde who were forced to close by hand the doors on a radiation source after equipment failure that led to them being exposed to more radiation than the annual limit for members of the general public; expresses serious concern that this latest incident comes after safety lapses at the base that have reached an all-time high with 100 recorded between June 2006 and May 2007, and believes that the UK Government should conduct an inquiry into the lamentable and potentially fatal safety record at Faslane.
