*S3M-2181 Kenneth Gibson: Smoking Prevention—That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement of the Smoking Prevention Action Plan which proposes a range of measures to discourage young people from taking up smoking; recognises that these measures, among others, include (a) restricting the display of tobacco at points of sale, (b) introducing licensing and sanctions on those who illegally sell tobacco to those under age, (c) the possible banning of sales of cigarettes in packs of 10 and (d) reducing underage sales from vending machines; acknowledges research which shows that the younger someone begins smoking, the less likely they are to give up; notes with concern that over 13,000 people per year die from tobacco use in Scotland, and believes that time should be allocated after the summer recess to debate smoking prevention, with particular reference to young people, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups.
