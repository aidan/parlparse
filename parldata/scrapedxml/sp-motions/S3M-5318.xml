S3M-5318 Rob Gibson: Forres Pies are World’s Best—That the Parliament congratulates Murdoch Brothers Butchers on its success in the 2010 World Scotch Pie Championships; commends the Forres-based butcher shop in beating out 85 other entrants to earn the title of World Scotch Pie Champions while also taking home the bronze medal for its pork pie and gold medal for its steak pie, and recognises the continued excellence of Murdoch Brothers, a family company dating back three generations, and the world-class quality of its 40-year-old original family recipe, still in use today.
