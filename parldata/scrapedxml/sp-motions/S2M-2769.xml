S2M-2769 Elaine Smith: National Breastfeeding Awareness Week 2005â€”That the Parliament notes that National Breastfeeding Awareness Week takes place between 8 and 14 May 2005; acknowledges the importance of the week in raising awareness of, and support for, breastfeeding; considers that Scotland has made considerable advances in recent years, including ensuring that 54% of Scottish babies are now born in a UNICEF "Baby Friendly" accredited maternity unit; congratulates health sector professionals who have worked tirelessly to achieve these improvements; considers that the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 provides a strong message of support for health professionals, breastfeeding mothers and their babies; recognises, however, that Scotland has failed to reach its target of having 50% of mothers still breastfeeding their babies at six weeks of life by 2005, and considers that this target should be reassessed with a view towards strengthening, and providing greater support for, the national breastfeeding strategy. Supported by: Dr Jean Turner, Shiona Baird, Frances Curran, Eleanor Scott*, Nora Radcliffe*, Patrick Harvie*, Sarah Boyack*, Margaret Jamieson*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Susan Deacon*, Michael McMahon*, Christine Grahame*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Robin Harper*, Brian Adam*, Bill Butler*
