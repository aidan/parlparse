*S2M-3543.3 Shiona Baird: Energy Policy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3543) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from "to deliver the nation’s" to end and insert "in order to deliver Scotland’s sustainable energy needs and to tackle climate change which is recognised as one of the greatest threats to our economy, communities and environment; further considers that, if we are serious about tackling climate change, a radical overhaul of our energy use is urgently required, particularly addressing contradictory transport policies which are increasing carbon emissions, and further notes that a truly sustainable energy policy will require the widespread adoption of domestic and community-based renewable micro-generation as well as the development of decentralised energy networks."
