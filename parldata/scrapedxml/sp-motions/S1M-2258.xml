*S1M-2258 Christine Grahame: Saltire over Edinburgh Castle-That the Parliament notes that the British Army in its current recruiting campaign uses the Saltire to attract young Scots; welcomes the recognition of this, the most potent symbol of Scotland's nationhood, as a patriotic inspiration to Scots through the centuries, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to the British Army that, in the interest of consistency, it should remove the Union Flag from the main flagpole at the army barracks on Edinburgh Castle and raise in its place the Saltire. Supported by: Kay Ullrich*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*, Richard Lochhead*, Michael Russell*, Colin Campbell*, Fergus Ewing*, Ms Sandra White*, Fiona McLeod*, Mr Duncan Hamilton*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Ms Margo MacDonald*, Andrew Wilson*
