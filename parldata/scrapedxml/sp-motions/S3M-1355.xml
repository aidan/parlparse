 *S3M-1355 George Foulkes: Portobello For a New School—That the Parliament believes that the children, parents and community of Portobello need a new high school; congratulates everyone involved in producing the Portobello For A New School campaign DVD which can be viewed on YouTube; understands that council leaders say that they need more money from the Scottish Government and the Scottish Government says that the council has all the money that it is going to get; believes that SNP and Lib Dem councillors and the SNP government should stop passing the buck and start taking responsibility for delivering the new school which is so desperately needed; believes that the SNP promised that it would match Labour "brick for brick" and that those bricks included new Portobello, Boroughmuir and James Gillespie’s high schools as well as new primary schools for St Crispin’s and St John’s, and encourages all those involved in campaigns for new schools to keep up their efforts.
