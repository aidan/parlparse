 *S2M-2733 Mrs Nanette Milne: Congratulations to CRANES for NHS Grampian Fibre Optic Technology Boost—That the Parliament welcomes the recent gift from Cancer Research Aberdeen and North East Scotland (CRANES) to NHS Grampian of £120,000 worth of fibre optic technology for training clinical staff; congratulates CRANES and all those involved in the charity for raising the money to buy this equipment; notes that this fibre optic technology, which has been installed at the Clinical Skills Centre at Foresterhill, will revolutionise endoscopic training in north-east Scotland by enabling training to continue without the need to remove vital kit from daily medical use, and wishes CRANES and all other cancer charities well as they continue to raise funds for such vitally-important causes.
