*S3M-1719 Gil Paterson: Arthritis Care Awareness Week—That the Parliament recognises Arthritis Care Awareness Week and acknowledges the valuable contribution of Arthritis Care in Scotland in promoting the self-management agenda across Scotland; commends its approach in aiming to support the 900,000 people in Scotland currently living with the condition and in giving them the coping skills and techniques to effectively manage its impact on their everyday life; values the positive involvement of people with arthritis who volunteer to develop their own skills and share their learning with others through high-quality self-management programmes such as Challenging Arthritis, Challenge Your Condition and Challenging Pain, and believes that the third sector has a key role to play in the delivery of the Scottish Government’s Better Health, Better Care strategy.
