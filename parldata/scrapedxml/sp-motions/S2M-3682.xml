*S2M-3682 Rob Gibson: Caithness Maternity Saved!—That the Parliament congratulates the successful, persistent and popular campaign by the North Action Group to secure consultant-led maternity services in Wick that can now serve the people of Caithness and north Sutherland for the foreseeable future; notes the role of the Kerr report which seeks to establish a workplan that contributes to the recently accepted national priority of sustaining rural general hospitals; wishes the board of NHS Highland success in seeking to recruit three permanent consultant obstetricians to be based in Caithness; welcomes the aim of catering for the work needs of clinicians’ partners; notes that the communities’ wishes will be met by the appointment of these consultants to back up a midwife team whose task is to provide quality services that are women and family-centred, essentially community-based and midwife-managed while demonstrating a shared philosophy of care irrespective of risk, and hopes that this will encourage young families to remain in the far north and attract more economically active people to choose to live and work there. Supported by: Jim Mather*, Richard Lochhead*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Brian Adam*
