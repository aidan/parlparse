*S3M-6223.2 Ken Macintosh: Changing Lives: A Confident, Competent Social Care Workforceâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6223) in the name of Adam Ingram, insert at end "; while acknowledging the important role of the social work and social care workforce in supporting and protecting people across the whole age spectrum, notes the impact of changing demographics and, in particular, the increase in the older population on the demand for services, as indicated by the Social Work Inspection Agency report, Improving Social Work in Scotland, which estimates that by 2018 the number of people aged 85 and over will have increased by 40%, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that social care services are sufficiently prepared and resourced accordingly, taking into account the fact that many older people are themselves carers."
