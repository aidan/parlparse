*S1M-3194.2 Cathy Jamieson: Youth Justice—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3194) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "recognises the problems faced by those local communities where a disproportionate amount of crime and disorder is caused by a small number of persistent offenders; considers it a priority to reduce youth disorder and youth offending; welcomes Scotland’s Action Plan to reduce youth crime and the establishment of Youth Justice Teams in each local authority; believes that effective disposals and programmes must be available to the Children’s Hearing System which make young offenders face up to the consequences of their behaviour; supports all parties involved in the youth justice system to play a full role and be accountable for their actions, and welcomes the Executive’s continuing focus on improving the youth justice system in order to reduce youth crime, the fear of youth crime and build safer communities."
