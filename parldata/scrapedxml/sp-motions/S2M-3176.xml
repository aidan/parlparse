*S2M-3176 Alex Johnstone: Clydesdale Bank Branch Closures in the North East—That the Parliament notes with concern the Clydesdale Bank’s announcement that it intends to close eighteen branches in the north east of Scotland; notes that these closures will deny many rural businesses and customers a local branch in which to deposit cash and cheques and conduct other transactions; further notes that lack of banking facilities damages tourism in rural areas, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with Postcomm and the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that the ongoing review of rural post offices does not lead to closures of post offices in these areas which would result in the withdrawal of access to the only remaining local banking facilities.
