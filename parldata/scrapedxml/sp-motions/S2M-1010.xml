*S2M-1010# Murdo Fraser: Management of Wild Deer—That the Parliament acknowledges the excellent work carried out by the Association of Deer Management Groups and their members throughout Scotland in managing our wild herds; further acknowledges the importance of the wild game industry to Scotland in providing jobs and income for rural communities; appreciates the significant expense involved in funding essential management plans and habitat assessments to ensure the best possible management of deer herds, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider positively a request for funding for such management of £1 million over three years.
