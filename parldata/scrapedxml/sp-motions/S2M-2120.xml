*S2M-2120# Christine Grahame: Scottish Borders Children’s Panel—That the Parliament notes with concern the terms of the letter of 3 December 2004 from the Chairman of Scottish Borders Children’s Panel Advisory Committee, as instructed by the Committee, to the Minister for Education and Young People which states, inter alia, serious concern that increasing demands on panel members in terms of number and complexity of cases and additional training are having a detrimental effect on the welfare of those members, that this has led to an increasing turnover in members, causing hearings to be cancelled, that some panel members are experiencing training and hearing commitments "overload" and that "what is being asked is beyond the voluntary nature of the appointment"; notes that there are "grave concerns that the current review may not happen soon enough"; further notes that, because of resignations, the panel is operating with 30% fewer members and that approaches have now had to be made to East Lothian and Midlothian panel areas to establish whether those panel members could be made available; notes that this undermines the ethos of the panel system, that cases should be heard before representatives of the local community; further notes that phase 2 of the review, due to commence in November, has now been postponed, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency in the above circumstances and recognising the sterling work of panel members and the distinctive and crucial function of the children’s hearing system, intervene to assist panel members in the Scottish Borders and further should accelerate the review.
