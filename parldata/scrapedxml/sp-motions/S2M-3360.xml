*S2M-3360 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Free Use of MECS in Stirling—That the Parliament notes the inaccuracy and misinformation in motion S2M-3251 by Brian Monteith regarding the decision of Stirling Council to introduce an annual charge of £52 for use of the Mobile Emergency Care System (MECS) as community alarms do not fall within the definition of free personal and nursing care as set out in section 2(28) of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 and congratulates Stirling Council on its provision of a free MECS service to all of its most vulnerable residents, while also recognising that the additional provision of this community alarm service makes a valuable contribution to the quality of life for those less vulnerable residents and their families who can use MECS at a nominal cost.
