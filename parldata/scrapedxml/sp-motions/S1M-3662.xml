 *S1M-3662# Helen Eadie: European Union Year for Disabled People—That the Parliament notes that 2003 will be the EU Year For Disabled People; recognises the challenges that lie ahead in tackling the major social and practical barriers that continue to confront people who have a disability, and considers that companies, voluntary organisations, non-departmental public bodies and the Scottish Executive should adopt mandatory criteria to ensure that projects supported by grants, charitable donations or other means are designed to remove barriers that prevent people with a disability from playing a full part in society.
