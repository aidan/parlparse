*S3M-3305 Richard Baker: Beating Bowel Cancer’s 2009 Be Loud! Be Clear! Campaign—That the Parliament supports Beating Bowel Cancer’s Be Loud! Be Clear! campaign, formerly the Loud Tie campaign, on the charity’s 10th anniversary; notes that the campaign aims to raise awareness of bowel cancer and its symptoms, dispelling the embarrassment so often associated with the disease; also notes that bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in Scotland, with around 1,600 people dying from the illness and over 3,500 new cases being diagnosed each year; further notes with concern that 75% of those under the age of 35 recently polled by YouGov were not aware that bowel cancer was the United Kingdom’s second biggest killer cancer; recognises that early clinical detection and intervention could save the lives of 90% of those diagnosed if detected early enough; welcomes the continuing roll-out of the national screening programme in Scotland to people aged 50 to 74; urges people to take part in the national screening programme by returning their self-test kits; notes that while the risk of bowel cancer increases with age it also affects a significant number of younger people; supports further improvements in bowel cancer services in Scotland that build on increased patient involvement and public awareness delivered through managed clinical networks, and encourages MSPs to support the Be Loud! Be Clear! campaign between 26 January and 1 February 2009 on behalf of Beating Bowel Cancer.
