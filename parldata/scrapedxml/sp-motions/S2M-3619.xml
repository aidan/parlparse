*S2M-3619 Christine Grahame: Scott’s Selkirk—That the Parliament recognises the benefits that Scott’s Selkirk contributes to the local economy, running as it does on Saturday and Sunday, 3 and 4 December 2005; notes that it commemorates the ride of Sir Walter Scott into Selkirk from Clovenfords, and then from Abbotsford, to dispense justice in the courthouse that still dominates Selkirk’s market place; further notes these words from Marmion “Heap on more wood! - the wind is chill; But let it whistle as it will, We’ll keep our Christmas merry still... While music, mirth, and social cheer speed on their wings the passing year.”; further notes that during the weekend there are living history performances including the re-enactment of Scott’s court cases, together with street theatre and stalls, and congratulates the Souters of Selkirk on celebrating this extraordinary Borderer with such panache. Supported by: Bruce Crawford*
