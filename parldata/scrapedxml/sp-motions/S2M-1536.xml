*S2M-1536# Mr John Home Robertson: Better Access to Small Claims and Summary Cause Procedures-That the Parliament notes the significant cross-party support previously expressed for an increase to the threshold for access to small claims and summary cause proceedings; believes that the case for updating the limits has been made and that limits of £5,000 and £15,000 for small claims and summary cause respectively should be urgently considered; further notes that as a consequence the privative limit should be increased to £5,000, and considers that such changes are required to improve affordable access to justice.
