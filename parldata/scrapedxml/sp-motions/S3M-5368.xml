 *S3M-5368 Trish Godman: The Proposed Extradition of Gary McKinnon to America—That the Parliament views with serious concern the proposed extradition to the United States of America of Glasgow-born Gary McKinnon, who has Asperger syndrome and who can best be described as a misguided or deluded hacker rather than a saboteur; believes that the Extradition Act 2003, which is being employed to send him to the USA, is manifestly unbalanced in that it denies both due process and equality of treatment; agrees with his mother, Janis Sharp, that "we do not have equal rights with Americans"; is of the view that, were Gary McKinnon to be sent to the USA to be imprisoned there, it is extremely doubtful that his human rights would be protected and his medical needs attended to in that country’s overcrowded and chronically under-funded prison system; notes the observation made by Lord Carlile, QC, that Gary McKinnon’s proposed extradition is disproportionate, unnecessary and avoidable, and therefore concludes that if Gary McKinnon has to stand trial for offences that he is alleged to have committed, then he should be tried in a court in the United Kingdom.
