 S3M-5311 Stuart McMillan: Energy Suppliers Accused of Breaking Rules Designed to Protect Customersâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern recent media reports that suggest that five energy suppliers have been accused of breaking rules that are designed to protect the poorest customers; notes that the National Housing Federation claims that Scottish Power, British Gas, Scottish and Southern Energy, npower and E.ON breached new licence conditions, which set a cap on how much more pre-paying customers can be charged than those paying by direct debit; believes that this will affect some of the poorest people in society and hit them hardest in their pockets, and therefore urges Ofgem to investigate this as a matter of urgency and rectify this situation as soon as possible.
