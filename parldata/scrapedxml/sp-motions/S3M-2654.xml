*S3M-2654 Stuart McMillan: Concern Over Lord Coe’s Comments—That the Parliament notes with concern the comments of Lord Sebastian Coe in a London newspaper article in which he is reported to have stated that a British Olympic Football team for 2012 would go ahead no matter what the views of the governing football bodies in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales were; further notes that the governing football bodies and supporters associations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have repeatedly stated they do not favour a British Olympic Football team in 2012, and calls on Lord Coe to retract the reported comments as they only serve to show contempt for the football associations of the three nations.
