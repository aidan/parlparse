 *S3M-7776 Patrick Harvie: Congratulations to Govanhill Baths Community Trust—That the Parliament congratulates Govanhill Baths Community Trust on the opening of its new charity shop, Emporium, that, it is hoped, will provide a source of valuable ongoing funding toward what are considered to be the trust’s inspiring plans to reopen Govanhill Baths as a swimming pool and wellbeing centre; considers that the trust’s forthcoming move of its offices to the Govanhill Baths’ building on the 10th anniversary year of the closure of the baths will be a landmark moment in this hard-fought campaign; acknowledges with thanks the impressive hard work and energy of the trust’s committed volunteers over the last decade to get to this exciting stage, and looks forward to the long-awaited reopening of the baths as a wellbeing centre that, it believes, will benefit hugely the citizens of Govanhill and the surrounding areas. Supported by: Bob Doris* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
