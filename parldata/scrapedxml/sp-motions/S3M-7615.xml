*S3M-7615 Kenneth Gibson: Citizens Advice, Consumer Issues—That the Parliament welcomes publication of Citizens Advice Scotland’s (CAS) report, Advice in Detail - Consumer Issues; recognises the expert advice that it considers CAS provides to the people of Scotland through its 80 branches across the country; notes that a 2009 poll showed that one in five members of the public had visited a Citizens Advice Bureau in the previous three years; believes that during this time of austerity CAS has provided an invaluable service that aided Scots on a number of important issues including 69,097 consumer debt issues, over 24,000 utility and communication issues, almost 18,000 financial product issues and nearly 17,000 consumer goods and services issues in the year 2009-10; further recognises that 98% of people trusted CAS and were satisfied with the service that they received, and judges CAS to be an essential service provider that should receive the continued financial support of the Scottish Government.
