*S3M-6242 Richard Baker: Grampian Police Rolls Out Local Policing Modelâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the move by Grampian Police to a local policing model that will see police officers working more closely with north-east communities; notes this fundamental change will see the force split into 24 divisions with dedicated local policing teams stationed in communities across the region to allow police to get to know the people and the needs of particular communities; notes the approach aims to help foster stronger relationships between the public and police officers and to build up trust and confidence, increase visibility, accessibility and maximise front-line policing effectiveness; believes the new approach under the banner of Local Policing - Closer to You will make it easier for communities to contact their local policing teams to make their concerns known, while local policing teams will have greater power to set priorities for their areas, and welcomes plans to regularly survey communities to gauge the effectiveness of this new approach.
