*S3M-5482 Bill Butler: Pleural Plaques Justice—That the Parliament welcomes Lord Emslie’s judgment on the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Act 2009 that has dismissed an attempt by insurance companies to set aside an Act of the Scottish Parliament; salutes the campaigning efforts of victims’ groups across Scotland that continue to fight tirelessly on behalf of people with pleural plaques and their families, and believes that those who brought this action should accept that the Act is the settled will of the Scottish Parliament.
