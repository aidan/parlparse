*S3M-2973 Jamie Hepburn: Towards Independence for Greenland—That the Parliament congratulates the people of Greenland on their historic vote for increased autonomy from Denmark; notes that some 75% of voters favoured the proposals to transfer a range of powers including those over police, courts and coastguard as well as a share of oil revenues to the island; welcomes this peaceful and democratic transfer of powers, and believes that this demonstrates that even in times of global economic uncertainty nations can move forward constitutionally.
