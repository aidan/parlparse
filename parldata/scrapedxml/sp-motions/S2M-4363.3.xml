 *S2M-4363.3 Tommy Sheridan: Council Tax and Pensioner Povertyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4363) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from "and calls for" to end and insert "regrets the failure of the SNP and Liberal Democrat parties to vote for the replacement of the unfair council tax with an income-based alternative, when presented with such an opportunity during the February 2006 debate on the Council Tax Abolition and Service Tax Introduction (Scotland) Bill; notes the failure of either the SNP or Liberal Democrat parties to propose any concrete legislative alternative to the council tax over the last seven years, and believes that the overwhelming majority of Scottish citizens support the replacement of the council tax with a system based on income and designed to tax the wealthy more and ordinary workers and pensioners less."
