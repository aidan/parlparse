*S3M-6696 Jack McConnell: Make Poverty History, Keep the Promises Made in 2005—That the Parliament notes the 5th anniversary of the G8 summit held at Gleneagles in 2005 and of the Make Poverty History demonstration that saw over 250,000 people take to the streets of Edinburgh on 2 July 2005 to demand justice for the poorest people in the world; applauds the commitments made in 2005, which pledged to boost aid for developing countries by $50 billion, cancel the debt of the 18 poorest nations and reduce tariffs and subsidies; welcomes the continuing commitment of the UK Government to keep the promises made in 2005; notes with concern that, after the recent G8 and G20 summits held at Miskoka and Toronto in Canada, the 2010 G8 communiqué does not mention the commitments made at Gleneagles, as was done in previous years, and implores the richest nations in the world to honour their promises to avoid the feared $18 billion shortfall in the overall $50 billion target and to make poverty history.
