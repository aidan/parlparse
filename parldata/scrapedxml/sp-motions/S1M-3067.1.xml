 *S1M-3067.1 Bruce Crawford: Sustainable Development - Meeting the Needs... Priorities, Actions and Targets for Sustainable Development in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3067) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "believes that sustainable development must be a central principle in governing Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Executive's statement on sustainable development, Meeting the Needs. Priorities, Actions and Targets for Sustainable Development in Scotland, and further believes that, while the statement marks an important step forward for sustainable development in Scotland, further work is required to produce a list of indicators that is more comprehensive and meaningful for the purpose of measuring progress and that the targets' lack of ambition does not recognise Scotland's full potential and therefore will not contribute significantly to ensuring a sustainable future for Scotland."
