*S3M-1154 Helen Eadie: Disability Access to Train Stations in Semi-Rural and Urban Areas—That the Parliament notes with concern that there is no single programme of development across Scotland in respect of access for wheelchair, pram and pushchair users to railway stations; further notes that a variety of interested parties such as the transport minister, Network Rail, local authorities and train companies with a locus to ensure that developments in our railways take place have historically always passed the responsibility to each of the other partners with no single point of co-ordination, coherence or overall strategy; recognises that, in major stations across Scotland, work has taken place to ensure such equality of access; regrets that no single agency or person in Scotland has the responsibility of bringing all potential partners to the table to take charge of this vital aspect of delivering equality, and hopes that without further delay the Scottish Government will take on board this challenge and that we shall soon see new accessibility developed at stations like Cardenden, Lochgelly and Cowdenbeath among others across Scotland.
