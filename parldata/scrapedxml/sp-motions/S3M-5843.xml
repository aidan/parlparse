*S3M-5843 Joe FitzPatrick: Games Tax Relief—That the Parliament congratulates the video games industry on its contribution to the country’s economy; notes that the video games industry contributes over £1 billion annually to the United Kingdom’s gross domestic product, generates £400 million for the Exchequer in tax revenues and supports 28,000 jobs, over a tenth of which are in the Dundee area; recognises the threat to the UK games industry that comes from its main competitors, including the United States of America, Canada and South Korea, which all offer major tax breaks at either national or regional level for game production or other substantial government financial support; welcomes the research by TIGA, the trade association representing the UK games industry, into tax relief, which shows that a tax break would create or save 3,550 graduate-level jobs or the vocational equivalent and increase and protect £415 million in new and saved tax receipts over five years, and calls on the Scottish Government to lobby the UK Government to implement such a tax break for game production in this year’s budget. Supported by: Sandra White*, Alasdair Allan*, Kenneth Gibson*, Gil Paterson*, Stuart McMillan*, Bill Kidd*
