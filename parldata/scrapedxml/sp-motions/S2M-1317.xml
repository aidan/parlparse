*S2M-1317 Mike Pringle: Dalai Lama's Visit to the Parliament-That the Parliament recognises the great honour and importance of the visit of the Dalai Lama to Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament and calls on the Presiding Officer to put aside the normal protocol with regard to flying national flags on parliamentary buildings and follow the admirable example and lead of the City of Edinburgh Council in flying the Tibetan flag during this historic visit.
