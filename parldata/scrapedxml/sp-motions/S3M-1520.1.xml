*S3M-1520.1 Murdo Fraser: Cuba—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1520) in the name of Elaine Smith, leave out from first "and wishes him" to end and insert "notes that, according to Human Rights Watch, Castro repressed nearly all forms of political dissent, enforced political conformity using criminal prosecutions, long and short-term detentions, mob harassment, police warnings, surveillance, house arrests, travel restrictions and politically-motivated dismissals from employment and that the end result is that Cubans are systematically denied basic rights to free expression, association, assembly, privacy, movement and due process of law; further notes that the Cuban Government forbids Cubans from leaving or returning to Cuba without first obtaining official permission and that it frequently bars citizens from taking their children with them overseas, essentially holding the children hostage to guarantee the parents’ return; recalls with sadness the events of 1994 when a tugboat packed with Cubans fleeing their homeland was intercepted by Cuban Navy patrol boats, resulting in the deaths of 41 men, women and children after being swept off the tug’s deck with high-pressure water hoses; further recalls with sadness the events of 2003 when the Cuban Government arrested dozens of journalists, librarians and human rights activists who were given very lengthy prison sentences following closed-door trials branded as hasty and manifestly unfair by Amnesty International; notes that in July 2005 the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a respected local human rights group, issued a list of 306 prisoners who it said were incarcerated for political reasons, and therefore, in light of Mr Castro’s appalling record of political repression, warmly welcomes his retirement from public office and looks forward to the day when the Cuban people can throw off the shackles of Marxist oppression and enjoy life in the free world."
