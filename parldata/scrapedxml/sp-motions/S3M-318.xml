 *S3M-318 John Park: Aircraft Carriers at Rosyth and Clyde Yardsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the UK Government to build two new aircraft carriers and the positive impact that this will have for yards at Rosyth and on the Clyde; recognises that this decision is testament to the highly-skilled and committed workforce at the shipyards, and applauds the constructive approach to workplace issues, alongside robust political campaigning, undertaken by the trade unions and the workforce at the yards since privatisation.
