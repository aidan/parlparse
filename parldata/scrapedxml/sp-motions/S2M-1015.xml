*S2M-1015# Pauline McNeill: Support Service for Victims of Trafficking—That the Parliament utterly condemns the international organised criminal gangs involved in the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation; opposes the deception of women from poor backgrounds into believing that they are coming to the UK for legitimate work and their coercion; is extremely concerned at the increasing numbers of trafficked women held as sex slaves in flats, saunas and massage parlours in towns and cities throughout Scotland; recognises the plight of trafficking victims who are often beaten, bound, blackmailed and forced into prostitution, are given no money and have their passports taken by the traffickers; notes with concern that women fleeing from traffickers fear death threats, violence and repercussions to both themselves and their families back home; further notes that in a raid on a Glasgow sauna in 2002 nine foreign women were believed to be working as sex slaves and that another Glasgow sauna advertised on the internet that all its women were bonded; considers that the immigration system must recognise the specific experience of trafficked women, who when returned as illegal immigrants are often met at the destination airport by traffickers to return to the same miserable trafficked life, and therefore welcomes the Scottish Executive International Women’s Day announcement of £100,000 to Glasgow City Council for a pilot support service for victims of trafficking that will assess the needs of trafficked women, provide support services and collate information on trafficking.
