 *S3M-346 Joe FitzPatrick: Arms Exports—That the Parliament welcomes the recent report by the House of Commons Quadripartite Committee which includes calls for better policing of arms fairs, the need for a greater number of weapons to require licences and prevention of re-exporting to countries with arms embargoes; welcomes the decision by the Prime Minister to close down the Defence Export Services Organisation, a government arms sales unit; notes that the United Kingdom is still the second largest global arms dealer; calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to end all public subsidy towards arms exports, and calls on the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office to take a lead and start talks on a legally binding global arms trade treaty as envisaged in the recent United Nations resolution approved by 153 nations.
