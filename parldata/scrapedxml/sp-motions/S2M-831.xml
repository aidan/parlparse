*S2M-831# Johann Lamont: Disabled Parking Spaces-That the Parliament notes the difficulties experienced by people within local communities who have secured disabled parking spaces outside their homes; deplores the fact that these spaces can become a focus of conflict within communities where people seek to use a space, although they do not have a disabled parking badge; recognises that the current legal position, which distinguishes between courtesy parking spaces and those supported by traffic regulation orders, creates problems for people with disabilities who need to rely on a designated parking space; considers that the Scottish Executive should examine how it might legislate to address this problem, and believes that the Scottish Executive, local authorities and all relevant agencies should work together to develop an awareness campaign to highlight the rights of disabled people and to emphasise the unacceptability of harassing those who have been allocated such spaces. Supported by: Bill Butler*
