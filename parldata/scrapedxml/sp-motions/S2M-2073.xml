 *S2M-2073# Donald Gorrie: Tackling the Impact of Misuse of Alcohol—That the Parliament, in the light of the major influence which misuse of alcohol has on many issues of great concern to it, such as violence in the home and in the streets, knife crime, sectarian and racial violence and abuse, misbehaviour at and around football matches, hate crimes and ill-health, believes that the Scottish Executive, while working on bringing forward a comprehensive Licensing Bill, should actively pursue bringing together the various proof-of-age card schemes into an effective voluntary national scheme and should encourage the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to enforce more vigorously existing legislation on adults not buying alcohol for under-age people and on the offence of serving alcohol to someone who is already drunk.
