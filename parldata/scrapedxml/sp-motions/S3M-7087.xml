*S3M-7087 Willie Coffey: Councils Get on with Delivering Frontline Services—That the Parliament congratulates East Ayrshire Council’s Onsite Services team for winning the best public/voluntary partnership working initiative award for Get Stuck In, its ethical school meals incentive scheme that is run in partnership with Save the Children, in the UK-wide 2010 Association of Public Service Excellence (APSE) Service Awards for local authorities; endorses the statement by Paul O’Brien, APSE chief executive, who said that "whilst the debate about the future of our public services still rages, councils are quietly getting on with the job of delivering on frontline services," and joins with APSE in celebrating the contribution that such services make to the lives of communities.
