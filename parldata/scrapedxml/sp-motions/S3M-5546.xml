 *S3M-5546 Ms Wendy Alexander: Threat to Renfrew Ferry—That the Parliament regrets the threat to the Renfrew Ferry, the second cut proposed to public transport infrastructure in Renfrewshire, following the Scottish Government’s cancellation of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link; notes that the Renfrew-Yoker ferry links the north and south banks of the Clyde, is 500 years old and one of Scotland’s oldest ferry links, is used by over 140,000 passengers a year and costs £1.10 for a single adult journey; considers the ferry to be a vital public transport link, and calls on every avenue to be explored to retain this link, including, if necessary, support from the Scottish Government. Supported by: Des McNulty*, Mary Mulligan*, David Whitton*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Jackie Baillie*, Robin Harper*
