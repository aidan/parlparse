 *S3M-4578 Marilyn Livingstone: Investment in Burntisland Primary School—That the Parliament congratulates the contribution of Burntisland Primary School to educational services in the community; notes with concern the urgent need for investment in the school; considers the fact that the school does not have a games hall and that pupils must walk to the Toll Centre to take physical education lessons to be unacceptable; notes with concern the delay in deliberation of the business case for investment until 2011 from the initial date of September 2008; urges the SNP/Lib Dem-led Fife Council to honour the previous administration’s plans for £3 million investment in Burntisland Primary School, and further urges Fife Council to consider Burntisland Primary School as a priority should the local authority be allocated funds from the Scottish Government’s £1.25 billion school building programme.
