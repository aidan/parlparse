*S3M-3872 Willie Coffey: Additional Help with Heating Costs for People Affected by Disability—That the Parliament notes that Scotland’s homes are on average more expensive to heat than those in other parts of the United Kingdom, with the cost of heating properties in Stornoway up to 63% higher than in Bristol, those in Aberdeen 57% higher, Dundee 30% higher and Kilmarnock up to 24% higher; recognises that these additional costs are borne most heavily by people affected by disability who are less able to leave their homes during the winter and are therefore required to heat their properties fully for longer periods; expresses concern that benefits for disabled people are unable to cope with the more than doubling of gas costs and the substantial increase in electricity costs in the last five years, and calls on the Department for Work and Pensions to provide additional help with heating to Scots affected by disability when they need it most.
