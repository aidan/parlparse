*S3M-530 Robin Harper: The Cost to Scotland of Children’s Poor Communication—That the Parliament welcomes the recent report by I CAN, the children’s communication charity, entitled The Cost to the Nation of Children’s Poor Communication in Scotland; acknowledges the importance of the conclusions of the report which illustrate the potential long-term economic cost to Scotland of not identifying and remedying children’s communication difficulties at an early age; acknowledges the strong links between communication impairments, social deprivation and an increased likelihood of being not in education, employment or training (NEET) and that Scotland already has the highest proportion of young people who are NEET of all OECD countries; notes that a central role for communication which is embedded in the curriculum, skilled and confident parents and carers and a focused early intervention policy can have an enormous positive impact on children’s language development; urges all MSPs to support I CAN and consider the findings of the report, and hopes that the Scottish Government will ensure that communication skills, speech and language therapy feature strongly in its recently announced comprehensive strategy on early years.
