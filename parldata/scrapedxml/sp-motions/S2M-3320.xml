 *S2M-3320u Sarah Boyack: Promoting Energy Saving Using Micro and Small-Scale Renewable Technology—That the Parliament believes that micro and small-scale renewable technology offers huge opportunities to tackle both fuel poverty and the causes of climate change; notes the Scottish Executive’s target of achieving a 20% improvement in energy efficiency on 2000 levels by 2010; believes that, to help achieve this target, building standards should be amended to include micro-renewable technology as permitted developments and should require generation capacity to be included in all new developments; particularly notes examples of good practice in Edinburgh Central such as Dunedin Canmore Housing Association’s European award-nominated Slateford Green Development; believes that local authorities should be required to consider the role that micro-generation targets could deliver in achieving sustainable energy and to set appropriate targets accordingly; notes the Energy Savings Trust’s proposal of a flat rate reduction on council tax or its replacement for houses which incorporate certified energy efficiency or micro-renewable technology, and believes that fiscal measures such as these should be actively considered.
