 *S3M-2592 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to NHS Lothian—That the Parliament congratulates NHS Lothian on its pioneering work to ensure that people with diabetes in police custody receive suitable care; notes the success of the joint initiative between NHS Lothian and Lothian and Borders Police in establishing a new approach that has helped custody officers to identify and treat swiftly problems related to diabetes, which are often difficult to distinguish from the effects of alcohol or drugs; further notes that this has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of emergency referrals of prisoners to hospital, and wishes NHS Lothian every success with the upcoming conference organised to enable healthcare professionals working in a custody environment and police from Scotland and northern England to learn from the Lothian experience.
