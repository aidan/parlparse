*S2M-798.3 Robin Harper: Fisheries Council December 2003-As an amendment to motion (S2M-798) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "condemns political attitudes which set aside the finding of marine science; recognises the importance of conserving fish stocks and regenerating them for the long-term future health of fishing communities; notes the precarious state of many species and the need for urgent action; welcomes the new EU fisheries agreement, whilst far from ideal, as a step in the right direction, and calls on the Scottish Executive, together with Her Majesty's Treasury, to draw upon available EU funds to deliver an investment package in fishing communities to see them through the fish recovery programme."
