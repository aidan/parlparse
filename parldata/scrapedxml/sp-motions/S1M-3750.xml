 *S1M-3750# Trish Godman: Ageism in the Labour Market-That the Parliament believes that it is both absurd and hypocritical to advocate the need for longer working lives when the labour market is infected so heavily with ageism, meaning that many individuals in their 40s and 50s are denied the opportunity to engage in full-time, or even part-time, work or voluntary participation in their local communities; further believes that measures must be adopted in the public and private sectors to deal with this economic and social problem, and considers that the Scottish Executive should set a good example by ensuring that the civil service and public bodies are free of the pernicious problem of ageism in personnel principles, policies and practices.
