 *S2M-2103 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Celebration of Chanukahâ€”That the Parliament sends warm greetings to Jews throughout Scotland for the Festival of Chanukah; recognises the challenge of dedication represented by the Chanukah lights shining brightly for eight days, dedication to friends, dedication to society and dedication to freedom; further recognises that the Chanukah candles are a powerful symbol of light overcoming darkness, and, with that light, prays for a bright future for the world built on harmony, diversity and freedom.
