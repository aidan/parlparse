*S3M-7238 Helen Eadie: Lucky 2B Here—That the Parliament congratulates the work of Skye-based charity Lucky 2B Here, which works to provide medical equipment and emergency life-saving training; welcomes the enormous success that Lucky 2B Here has demonstrated in realising its three key aims of community empowerment, cooperation and education; applauds the hard work of local man Ross Cowie, who himself suffered multiple cardiac arrests and whose life was saved by an ambulance passing the Shinty Club where he arrested, who founded the charity after being told that he was indeed "lucky to be here" and whose subsequent fundraising for a defibrillator for the club exceeded his expectations and left him with enough money for two defibrillators, thereby beginning the work of Lucky 2B Here; supports the work of Lucky 2B Here in empowering local communities with the provision of heartstart training, installation of defibrillators and pressing for communities to fundraise through activity-based challenges to contribute towards the cost of the equipment, to raise local awareness of the training opportunities and to ensure their commitment; congratulates Lucky 2B Here on its work with local services to greatly improve the availability of trained first aiders and equipment in an emergency; welcomes the support that the charity has secured from Northern Constabulary in ensuring that all police response vehicles on Skye now carry defibrillators and all officers are offered training; notes the work with Portree High School to run heartstart training for the pupils and empower them with the knowledge and skills to save lives; believes that the Lucky 2B Here model of community empowerment, cooperation and education is simple yet effective and backs its long-term aim to see a future where every member of every community in Scotland is empowered to save a life, and wishes it every success in realising the Lucky 2B Here aim as it works with two national charities, Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland and British Heart Foundation Scotland, to share the model across Scotland.
