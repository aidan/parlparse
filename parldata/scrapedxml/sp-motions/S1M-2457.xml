*S1M-2457# Christine Grahame: Borders Tourism-That the Parliament notes with concern the report in The Scotsman on 15 November 2001 about falling visitor numbers and the consequential loss of around £30,000 in "gate receipts" at the former home of Sir Walter Scott, Abbotsford, near Galashiels, following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and recent events in the USA; draws the attention of the Scottish Executive to the report of 7 November 2001 by the Director of Lifelong Care at Scottish Borders Council on the impact in the area of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and in particular the estimated total loss for the coming year to Borders tourism of £30 million (paragraph 12.1); considers that the £440,000 delivered by the Executive so far for marketing purposes is insufficient to redress this loss, and calls upon the Executive, on presentation of the Scottish Borders Tourist Board's forthcoming report, to provide realistic funding to redress this spiralling decline. Supported by: Mr Lloyd Quinan*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Ms Sandra White*, Michael Russell*, Ms Margo MacDonald*, Fiona Hyslop*
