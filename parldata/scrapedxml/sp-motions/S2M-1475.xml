*S2M-1475 Mike Pringle: The Future of Forth Corinthian Yacht Club-That the Parliament commends Forth Corinthian Yacht Club for providing, as their motto states, "affordable sailing for all" for the last 124 years; notes the wide membership from across Edinburgh and the Lothians; is very concerned that the redevelopment for housing of Granton Harbour by Forth Ports Ltd does not provide shore-based facilities for the club, which it enjoys at present, and that this will put the future of the club and affordable sailing in Edinburgh at risk, and calls on Forth Ports Ltd to incorporate adequate facilities for the Forth Corinthian Yacht Club in plans for Granton Harbour.
