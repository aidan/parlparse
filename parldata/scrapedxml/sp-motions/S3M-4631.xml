*S3M-4631 Patricia Ferguson: Partick Thistle Wins the Loving Cup—That the Parliament congratulates Partick Thistle Football Club on being awarded the Loving Cup from Glasgow City Council; notes that this award is the city’s highest honour and is presented to "any person or group who have brought distinction and honour to Glasgow"; believes that this is appropriate acknowledgement of the huge contribution that the club has made and continues to make to the city in the year that it celebrates its 100 years’ residence at Firhill Stadium, Maryhill; welcomes this addition to the club’s trophy cabinet to sit alongside previous awards from victory in the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup, and looks forward to it winning many more cups in the coming seasons.
