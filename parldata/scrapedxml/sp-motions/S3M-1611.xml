*S3M-1611# Johann Lamont: Congratulations to the Bullwood Project—That the Parliament applauds the ambition, energy, tenacity and vision of the Bullwood Project, a self-help group based in the Pollok parliamentary constituency; notes the creativity and environmental benefits of its work and that it is working towards being a self-sustaining social enterprise; supports social enterprises which make a real difference in our communities; applauds particularly the Bullwood Project’s contribution to Scotland Week in New York in producing the largest caber in the world; congratulates the project on being invited by the Tartan Day Parade Committee to march in the parade on 5 April 2008, and believes that this caber is an imaginative way of communicating Scotland’s message of friendship and humanity to all those who will participate in the Scotland Week celebration and will see the caber as it is exhibited in the USA.
