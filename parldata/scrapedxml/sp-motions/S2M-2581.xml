 *S2M-2581# Christine Grahame: Scotland Day - 6 April—That the Parliament notes that 6 April 2005 will mark the 685th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath, a formal declaration of Scottish independence and the seminal document in our nation’s history which proclaimed in 1320 that "It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom"; notes that the Declaration of Arbroath was the inspiration behind the American declaration of independence from Britain and that the date chosen to mark Tartan Day, 6 April, recognises the important part played by Scots in the establishment of the United States as a nation free from the "chains and slavery" of "English rule"; acknowledges the heroic struggle of our ancestors who freed our nation from tyranny and oppression, and believes that Scottish ministers should recognise that struggle and formally establish a "Scotland Day" on 6 April each year which will allow Scots to celebrate our history and inject greater confidence and optimism as a nation, one of the oldest in Europe, and allow us once again to take our rightful place amongst the family of nations. Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Jim Mather*
