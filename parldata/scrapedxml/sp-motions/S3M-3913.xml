*S3M-3913 Jamie Hepburn: Public Opposition to Privacy Infringementâ€”That the Parliament notes the results of a recent survey, conducted on behalf of the Metro newspaper by www.PoliticsHome.com, which indicates that 60% of those surveyed disapprove of a new EU directive that requires that all communications, including phone calls, emails and internet usage, are recorded and stored for one year and that 58% of those surveyed agreed with the statement that "There is no such thing as secure data storage. It inevitably gets into the wrong hands"; believes that the concerns of the general public are well placed considering a spate of data blunders by UK Government departments in recent years, which includes the loss in 2007 of data discs that contained the personal details of 25 million people; believes that the UK Government must take heed of the growing public concern at moves to curb personal privacy and individual civil liberties, and calls on the UK Government to work against efforts at wide-scale monitoring of personal communications.
