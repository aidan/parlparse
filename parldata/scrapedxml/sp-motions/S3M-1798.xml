*S3M-1798 Kenneth Gibson: Membership of Commission on Scottish Devolution—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the membership of the Commission on Scottish Devolution; is aware that the commission purports to comprise "the range of pro-Union opinion in Scotland", according to the Scotland Office; notes that of 15 members on the Commission, five are members of the House of Lords and two are knights of the realm, hardly a cross-section of Scottish society, and believes that the National Conversation, which welcomes input from Scots of all opinions and from all walks of life, is a better vehicle for addressing Scotland’s constitutional future than the hand-picked unionist clique who form the commission. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Christine Grahame*, Stuart McMillan*, Christina McKelvie*
