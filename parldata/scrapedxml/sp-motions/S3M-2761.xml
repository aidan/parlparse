*S3M-2761 Roseanna Cunningham: Congratulations to Scotland’s World Amateur Team Golf Champions—That the Parliament notes with delight the victory of the Scottish team in the World Amateur Team Golf Championship and congratulates the playing members of the team, Wallace Booth (Comrie), Gavin Dear (Murrayshall) and Callum Macaulay (Tulliallan) and team captain George Crawford, for bringing the Eisenhower Trophy to Scotland, the home of golf; notes that it is only eight years since Scotland first entered the event as a separate nation, having previously participated as part of a Great Britain and Ireland team, which won the title just four times in the 50-year history of the event; further notes that Scotland now holds world team titles at both amateur and profession level, and wishes Colin Montgomery and Alastair Forsyth every success as they seek to retain the title at the Omega Mission Hill’s World Cup, starting on 27 November 2008.
