*S2M-911# Robin Harper: Airborne Initiative-That the Parliament regrets the Scottish Executive's decision to withdraw funding from the Airborne Initiative; commends the staff for the excellent work that they have put in over the last 10 years; recognises that the initiative's strategy, in terms of what was possible, has been a huge success in that at least half of the participants completed the course and at least a quarter of these have not reoffended; notes that recent success rates show that up to 50% of those who completed the course have not re-offended; further notes that the scheme has saved the Executive between £2.8 and £4.2 million in prison costs over the last 10 years, and believes that the Executive should consider whether it has any other scheme that is likely to be anywhere near as effective in helping serious and persistent offenders back into society and out of prison on a permanent basis.
