*S1M-2974# Tommy Sheridan: Labour Against the Euro Campaignâ€”That the Parliament notes the launch of the Labour Against the Euro campaign in Westminster on Wednesday 10 April 2002 which involved 30 Labour MPs declaring their opposition both to a euro referendum before the next general election and their opposition to joining the euro, should such a referendum be called; further notes the release of a major survey at the meeting illustrating that 75% of Labour voters were opposed to joining the euro and that expenditure on public services was the key preoccupation of Labour voters, and, while welcoming the launch of the Labour Against the Euro campaign, believes it is time for a progressive cross-party and labour movement campaign against the euro to be established in Scotland.
