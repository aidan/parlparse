*S3M-1692♦ Christine Grahame: How Much is that Doggy in the Window?—That the Parliament notes that the international trade in dog and cat fur leads to the slaughter of around 2 million dogs and cats in Asia each year; further notes that there is considerable public concern about the lack of protection for animals in China, given its role as the main exporter in the dog and cat fur trade; notes that it takes 12 to 15 adult dogs, usually Alsatians, for a dog fur coat, which may be labelled for instance "fox"or "sobaki" and up to 24 cats for a cat fur coat, to be made and that these may also be used as trim on hats and gloves; notes that EU Regulation 1523/2007 banning the sale, production, marketing and import into or export out of the EU of dog and cat fur and products containing these types of fur will not come into effect until the end of 2008 and that, in any event, it is difficult to identify, after processing, the skins without DNA testing, and considers that stringent DNA testing of unclassified furs presented for import should begin without delay and, when the species of the animal is not clearly identified, entry of the item in question should be prohibited, in the south of Scotland and elsewhere.
