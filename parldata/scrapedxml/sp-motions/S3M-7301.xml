*S3M-7301 Christina McKelvie: Equal Pay Day, 2 November—That the Parliament notes that 2 November 2010 is Equal Pay Day in the United Kingdom; further considers that this date is significant because the full-time pay gap between women and men is equivalent to men being paid all the year round while women work for free after 2 November; further notes that 40 years after the Equal Pay Act women working full-time in the UK are still paid on average 16.4% less per hour than men; believes that equal pay is a fundamental right; calls on the UK Government, in the 40th anniversary year of the Equal Pay Act, to step up action to close the gender pay gap once and for all, and fully supports the national day of action on 2 November to fight for equal pay for women.
