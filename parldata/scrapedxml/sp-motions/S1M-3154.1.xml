 *S1M-3154.1 Robin Harper: Scotland's Air Links-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3154) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "the importance" to end and insert "that air transport is the most highly polluting public transport mode on earth; further recognises that air transport is unsustainable because of its dependence on a finite supply of fossil fuels; notes that, contrary to the assertion that increased air links generate economic gains, pollution from air transport contributes a major hidden cost to the economy, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive (a) to bring about a reduction in the demand for air links by investment in less-polluting alternative modes of public transport and by promoting alternatives to business air travel including state of the art electronic communications, (b) to support a European level charge on aviation based on aircraft emissions and support an end to any public subsidies and tax exemptions for aviation, and (c) to include an assessment of the impact of Scotland's air links on climate change, health and other external costs in its related policies."
