*S3M-3139 Lewis Macdonald: Future of Electricity Generation—That the Parliament welcomes the report published by the Scottish Council for Development and Industry on the future of electricity generation in Scotland; notes the report’s finding that more than 80% of new renewable energy required to meet Scotland’s targets for 2020 will come from onshore wind; also notes its further findings about the key role of grid upgrades such as Beauly-Denny and about the importance of not ruling out any low-carbon energy source in meeting yet tougher carbon-reduction targets after 2020, and calls on Scottish ministers to respond to these findings by providing consistent support for onshore wind developments and grid upgrades and by adopting a policy towards future energy generation that is based on the priorities of carbon reduction, security of supply and affordability, rather than a policy based on a presumption against nuclear generation regardless of these priorities.
