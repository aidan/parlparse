*S2M-1575 Mr Brian Monteith: Stirling - The Worst Local Roads in Scotland-That the Parliament notes that the recent Scottish road condition survey for 2003-04, carried out by consultant engineers for the Society of Chief Officers of Transport in Scotland using the latest laser technology on more than 10,000 miles of A, B and C roads, established an accurate and objective audit of the state of Scotland's local road network; notes that Stirling was found to have the worst roads in Scotland with almost two-thirds requiring either immediate repair or further investigation; notes from the research submitted in November 2003 by the AA Motoring Trust to the Local Government and Transport Committee on roads maintenance expenditure in Scotland that Stirling Council spent £5.1 million less on its local roads network from 2001 to 2003 than it received in central government grant, in contrast to the majority of Scottish councils which spent more than they received; further notes that the council's own scrutiny group published research in February 2003 showing that £9.8 million would have been invested in local roads had the local authority and its predecessor Central Region spent their full allocation from central government over the previous six years; acknowledges that Stirling's current Labour administration has consistently rejected alternative budget proposals to spend more on roads; believes that Stirling Council has neglected its responsibility to maintain Stirling's roads to a proper standard, and calls on the Scottish Executive to communicate to Scottish local authorities, such as Stirling Council's Labour administration, the seriousness of the problems that can result from failing to spend residents' and drivers' taxes on the proper maintenance of local roads.
