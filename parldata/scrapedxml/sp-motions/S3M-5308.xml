*S3M-5308 Robert Brown: 10th Anniversary of the Scottish Youth Parliament—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Youth Parliament on its 10th anniversary, which will be marked at a reception in the Parliament to be hosted by the Presiding Officer on the evening of Wednesday 2 December 2009; recognises all the work that the Scottish Youth Parliament has undertaken over the past 10 years and continues to undertake in raising the voice of young people in Scotland on issues that are important to them and their communities; welcomes the Scottish Youth Parliament’s vision of a stronger, more inclusive Scotland that empowers young people by truly involving them in the decision-making process; commends the Scottish Parliament and successive Scottish administrations since 1999 for the continuing level of support given to the Scottish Youth Parliament and all of its elected members past and present; hopes that this support will be maintained in the future, and is confident that the Scottish Youth Parliament will continue to grow in strength and success as a powerful enabler of young people in the years to come.
