*S3M-7307 Linda Fabiani: East Kilbride Folk Festival—That the Parliament sends good wishes for the success of the first ever East Kilbride Folk Festival, which is scheduled to take place from 5 to 7 November 2010; notes that the festival line-up includes a wealth of musical talent from the town of East Kilbride itself as well as traditional and folk singers and musicians from across Scotland; is delighted at the involvement of children from St Vincent’s and Crosshouse primary schools in East Kilbride, who have written songs to be performed during the festival; notes that ticket prices have been kept at what it considers to be a very affordable level and that entry to many sessions will be free; believes that this will enable the widest possible range of people to enjoy the festival, and looks forward to the East Kilbride Folk festival becoming a permanent fixture in Scotland’s traditional arts calendar in years to come.
