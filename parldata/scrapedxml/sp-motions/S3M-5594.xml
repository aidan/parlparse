*S3M-5594 Jamie Hepburn: UK Government Bank Ownership and the Public Interestâ€”That the Parliament notes reports that the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is providing finance to Kraft Foods Inc in support of its bid to purchase Cadbury plc; believes that, given that the UK Government holds an 84% share in RBS, this essentially represents the use of public money to fund the foreign acquisition of a UK-based company; understands that the UK Government has previously refused to use its majority shareholding in banks to renegotiate payment terms of PFI contracts or end the cross-subsidisation of rail rolling stock that is owned by such banks, and calls on the UK Government to consider how best it can use its majority shareholding in banks to protect jobs and leverage better deals for the public purse in order to avoid it becoming the case that, despite being bailed out at public expense, the banks can ignore the public interest.
