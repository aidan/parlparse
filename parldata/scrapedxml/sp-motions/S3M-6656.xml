*S3M-6656 Bill Kidd: Safety Concerns with the Nuclear Programme in Faslane—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the content of a recently released internal Ministry of Defence (MOD) safety report, which details increasing difficulties on the part of the MOD in safely managing its nuclear programme, located at HMNB Clyde, "with due regard for the protection of the workforce, the public and the environment"; considers that the report points to insufficient resources, in terms of funding and staff, for satisfactory maintenance; believes that this report is of grave concern, underscoring the concerns that exist over the safety of the nuclear programme located at Faslane, and, therefore, calls on the UK Government to reconsider what are believed to be its ill-advised plans to press ahead with the wasteful renewal of Trident. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Christina McKelvie*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Sandra White*, Stuart McMillan*, Michael Matheson*, Brian Adam*
