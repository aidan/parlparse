*S2M-996 Shiona Baird: International Women's Day - Trafficked Women-That the Parliament recognises, during International Women's Week, the plight of women who are trafficked for the purposes of prostitution and work in the sex industry; further recognises that the expansion of the EU may exacerbate the problem of identifying and supporting women who are so trafficked; notes the extreme difficulties faced by trafficked women seeking to escape prostitution and their particular vulnerability under immigration law, whereby they may be returned to dangerous and life-threatening situations, and urges the Scottish Executive to conduct research to determine the number of trafficked women in Scotland and to consider establishing dedicated refuge and support services for such women. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Tommy Sheridan*, Chris Ballance*, Ms Sandra White*, Rob Gibson*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Eleanor Scott*, Robin Harper*
