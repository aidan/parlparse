*S1M-1371 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Tribute to the Reverend Adrian Rennie—That the Parliament pays tribute to the outstanding, devoted and passionate work for Scottish causes carried out by the late Reverend Adrian Rennie of Drylaw Parish Church who has died at the age of 37, having lavished his time and energy upon work for the people of Scotland, ignoring courageously his lifelong heart condition; wishes his family to know how deeply he touched the lives of many, whether from his devoted service to the Iona Community, his church work in the East End of Glasgow, his burning concern for world peace, his chairmanship of the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament or his invaluable aid in setting up the Parliament’s Cross Party Anti-Nuclear Group, and wishes to record that in his brief lifespan he achieved more in the fight for social justice than many spared for decades more and proved by his blithe spirit and sparkling humour that human goodness such as his does not equate with dullness.
