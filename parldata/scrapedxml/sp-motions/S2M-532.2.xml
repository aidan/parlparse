*S2M-532.2 Colin Fox: Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill—As an amendment to motion (S2M-532) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "does not agree to the general principles of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill because it believes that the most effective way to address antisocial behaviour is through greater investment in a wide range of community support services, does not believe that the punitive measures contained in the Bill will address this issue, believes that a fully-resourced Children’s Hearing system represents the best way of dealing with young offenders; does not believe that extending the use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders to under-16s is appropriate, and considers that, rather than creating extra legal powers such as dispersal, the police should be provided with extra resources."
