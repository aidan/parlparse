 *S1M-2315# Bill Butler: First Anniversary of the Death of Donald Dewar—That the Parliament notes the first anniversary of the death of Donald Dewar, Scotland’s first First Minister, on 11 October 2000 and places on record its admiration for his life and work, in particular his central role in the long campaign for the establishment of a devolved Scottish legislature, which assumed its full legislative powers on 1 July 1999; recognises Donald Dewar’s contribution to Scottish public life, not only as one who held high ministerial office, but also as a wholehearted advocate for the people he represented – firstly as MP for Aberdeen South (1966-70), then as MP for Glasgow Garscadden (1978-1997) and finally for Glasgow Anniesland, as both MP (1997-2000) and MSP (1999-2000); acknowledges that Donald Dewar’s central political objective was to champion the cause of those most in need and to do so unequivocally, without fear of favour, and remembers with affection the life of a man who was devoted to the creation not only of the Parliament itself but of a more just and equal Scotland.
