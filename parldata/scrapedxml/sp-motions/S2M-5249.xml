*S2M-5249 Linda Fabiani: Strategic Approach to Race Equality—That the Parliament recognises that racial inequalities and discrimination are iniquitous and hamper the development of nations; believes that a more strategic approach to promoting race equality is necessary if we are to achieve the vision of a fair and equal Scotland where everyone can maximise their potential; considers that we require a more accurate and up-to-date measure of Scotland’s ethnic diversity and improved ethnicity data in order to inform planning and policy-making and to track progress towards achieving race equality; believes that the forthcoming race equality strategy and action plan should include ambitious targets, and, given the positive impact that equality in the labour market can have, not only on individuals but on businesses, communities and overall economic growth, believes that equality and diversity are valid measures of economic progress.
