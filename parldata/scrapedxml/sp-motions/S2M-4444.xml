*S2M-4444# Mr Jamie McGrigor: UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in Fort William—That the Parliament notes that the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup will be hosted on the Nevis Range on 27 and 28 May 2006 and welcomes the event to Fort William for the fourth consecutive year; further notes that the event attracts the sport’s top competitors from across the world, as well as thousands of supporters, and plays a crucial role in the economy of both the town and the surrounding area; congratulates the organisers of the event and all those involved in securing next year’s World Championships, the blue riband event of mountain biking, which will also be held at the Nevis Range, and, in the light of concerns over future funding for hosting UCI World Cup events after 2007, believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that financial support is in place to allow Fort William to continue to play its central role in the mountain biking world’s calendar.
