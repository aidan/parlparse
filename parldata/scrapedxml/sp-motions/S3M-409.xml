 *S3M-409 Hugh O’Donnell: Fires in Greek Peloponnesus—That the Parliament notes the major forest fires raging across Greece and seriously regrets the loss of life and substantial damage caused to the environment and people’s homes and livelihoods, as well as the negative impact on archaeological sites of worldwide significance, such as ancient Olympia and Sparta; commends the efforts, dedication and bravery of firefighters, local people and those from other EU countries who are working to contain the fires and to help deal with the consequential reconstruction and emergency support that the communities in the Peloponnesus will need to rebuild their lives, and believes that the European Union, its member states and voluntary organisations should as a matter of urgency provide all necessary support to aid the affected communities in Greece recover from this national tragedy.
