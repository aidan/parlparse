*S2M-3584.1 Mrs Nanette Milne: Dentistry—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3584) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out from “endorses” to end and insert “is further concerned that the Scottish Executive’s initiatives will not entice dentists back to the NHS; recognises the increased support in dental education, employment of overseas dentists and financial packages enacted by the Executive but sees this as a stopgap solution which will do nothing to stem the tide of dentists leaving the NHS in the future; calls for more initiatives for dentists to undertake preventative work, a reduction in bureaucracy and for the Executive to create a more genuine and innovative debate on the future of dentistry, and further calls on the Executive to engage positively with the wider profession to ensure that reforms and initiatives enable every patient to have access to a dentist.”
