*S3M-4191 Bill Butler: ProjectScotland, Yes We Can—That the Parliament commends the significant achievement of ProjectScotland volunteers, mentors and staff in facilitating over 2.2 million hours of volunteering in communities since May 2005 through a programme of structured placements with over 300 non-profit organisations across the country; notes the positive role that ProjectScotland has played in changing young people’s perceptions of volunteering and, indeed, themselves; acknowledges that, during 2008-09, 40% of ProjectScotland volunteers came from the 20% most deprived areas of Scotland; regrets that the Scottish Government decided to withdraw its financial support to the charity as of 1 April 2009; recognises the serious implications that this decision has for the charity, its partner organisations and the hundreds of young people who have been in touch in recent months about placements; contrasts the decision with the bold and ambitious Serve America Act in the United States of America, recently signed into law by President Obama, which will quadruple the number of AmeriCorps volunteers to 250,000, and encourages the Scottish Government to revisit its decision and do all in its power to ensure that ProjectScotland can continue to change lives and communities across our country. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Elaine Murray*, David Whitton*, Marlyn Glen*, Michael McMahon*, Patricia Ferguson*, Jackie Baillie*, Cathy Jamieson*, Malcolm Chisholm*, David Stewart*, Richard Baker*, Robert Brown*, Andy Kerr*
