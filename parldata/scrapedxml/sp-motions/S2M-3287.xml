*S2M-3287 Mark Ballard: Possible Acquisition of More Polar Bears by Edinburgh Zoo—That the Parliament notes with concern that Edinburgh Zoo is giving serious consideration to acquiring more polar bears despite the Zoo’s assurance in 2003 that it would stop keeping this species when its current polar bear, Mercedes, dies; notes that Mercedes is the last polar bear kept in a UK zoo and that she displays signs of distress and abnormal behaviour such as repetitive pacing and swimming; further notes that it is widely accepted that polar bears’ needs can never be properly met in captivity; believes that captive breeding in zoos is not a realistic approach to the conservation of polar bears as it is considered to be extremely difficult to successfully re-introduce such creatures into the wild, and calls on the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland not to acquire any new polar bears for keeping at Edinburgh Zoo.
