 *S3M-2577 Liam McArthur: Save the Skull Splitter Name—That the Parliament notes with amazement that the Portman Group is considering a complaint against the name of the Orkney Brewery’s Skull Splitter beer, a complaint that claims that the name could imply violence and the impact that the beer will have on the drinker; recognises that the name would be inappropriate if it were applied to a low price high alcohol content drink aimed at young drinkers seeking cheap alcoholic oblivion; considers that Skull Splitter is not such a drink, but is instead a high quality premium beer, a past Champion Winter Ale of Britain, which is targeted at, and bought by, discerning drinkers who appreciate its quality and who drink it responsibly; believes that the name is an entirely appropriate name for a beer brewed in Orkney with its Viking heritage, helping the brewery to maintain its hard-won distinct island identity; further believes that to lose the use of the name would be a serious setback to the brewery, undoing years of good work building a market share for Skull Splitter among connoisseurs of good beer, and calls on the Portman Group to reject the complaint. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Alasdair Allan*, Ross Finnie*, Jamie Stone*, Jim Hume*, Jamie McGrigor*, Robin Harper*, Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson*, Hugh Henry* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
