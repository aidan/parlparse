 * S2M-2701 Colin Fox:Publicly-Owned Rail System—That the Parliament welcomes the Catalyst Forum’s report, The Railways in a Third Term, which concludes “the most conservative estimates indicate that bringing the railway system back into public ownership could produce immediate cash savings of £500m a year”; notes that the Department for Transport’s own figures acknowledge that the UK Government currently finances the private rail network to the tune of £17 million a week; further notes that delegates at the Labour Party conference in 2004 voted to adopt a policy of “introducing an integrated, accountable and publicly-owned railway”; believes that a publicly-owned rail system would make sound financial sense, as well as reaping significant social, economic and environmental benefits in the longer term, and fully supports the RMT union in its campaign to renationalise the rail network and supports its rallies on 16 April 2005 in Glasgow and 17 April 2005 in Edinburgh as part of its march, visiting 14 cities from Glasgow to London.
