*S3M-2237 Bill Kidd: Register Protest against Lloyds TSB—That the Parliament condemns the actions of Lloyds TSB which has written to its customers who have business dealings with Cuba informing them to cut all ties with Cuba or move their accounts; believes that such actions will undoubtedly cause more hardship and unnecessary suffering for the ordinary people of Cuba; encourages Lloyds TSB’s account holders and business clients to consider withdrawing their custom in protest, and urges others to register their protest in order to reverse this decision.
