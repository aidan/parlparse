*S1M-1067 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Essential User Fuel Duty Rebate—That the Parliament notes that, as a consequence of high taxation, the cost of providing fuel for road haulage companies in Scotland is double that of our European neighbours; notes that, as a consequence, the number of road miles travelled by lorry has not been reduced, merely that Scottish drivers and operators are being undercut and displaced by continental drivers and operators, and that across Scotland the cost of goods is rising to reflect increasing transport costs; further notes the answer to question S1W-7586 by Sarah Boyack on 26 June 2000, indicating that the Scottish Executive would carefully consider any proposals by the Road Haulage Association for an essential user rebate; therefore draws the attention of the Scottish Executive to the proposals published by the Road Haulage Association for an essential user rebate for fuel duty, a scheme which would ensure that on valid business journeys the cost of fuel to Scottish operators was brought into line with the cost of fuel to our nearest continental neighbours, by rebating the excess taxation charged here, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to publish a detailed consideration of the impacts and benefits of such a scheme.
