*S3M-1815 Jamie Hepburn: 2012 Olympic Games Contracts—That the Parliament notes with concern that only 3% of contracts for the 2012 London Olympic Games have been awarded outside England, despite claims by the UK Government that Scotland would benefit from London being awarded the Games; believes that Scotland is due to see millions of pounds worth of lottery funds displaced due to the way that these games are being financed; considers the news that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been awarded minute numbers of the contracts associated with the 2012 Olympics thus far is further evidence that Scotland will see little in the way of tangible benefits from the games, and calls on the authorities awarding the contracts to assess whether they are being awarded fairly across the United Kingdom.
