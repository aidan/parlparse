*S3M-6975♦ John Scott: Reinstatement of Route Development Fund—That the Parliament recognises the importance to the economy of developing routes to airports such as Prestwick; regrets the ending of route development funding for new routes that arose as a result of a conflict with European state aid regulations in 2007; notes the forthcoming consultation on barriers preventing direct support to airlines, and believes that there is a need to hold a further consultation with the aims of removing such barriers and reinstating support for the development of new routes to Prestwick and the other Scottish airports.
