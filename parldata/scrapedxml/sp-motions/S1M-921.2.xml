*S1M-921.2 Bill Aitken: Tackling Rough Sleeping in Glasgow and across Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-921) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, insert at end: "and also recognises that concrete proposals are now essential to ensure that the commitments of the Executive are achieved, that these proposals must include provision for support to rough sleepers to enable them to obtain, and in turn to maintain, short and medium term tenancies with a view to enabling them to return to mainstream housing in the shortest possible time, and that such support should ensure that the needs of homeless people with drug, alcohol or mental health problems are met."
