 *S2M-822# Christine Grahame: "In Touch", Out of Touch?-That the Parliament notes the success of projects such as "In Touch" in Galashiels which, through New Futures funding, enables young people between the ages of 16 and 25 to move towards education, training and employment; further notes that since January 2000, when the project started, some 200 young people have used its facilities, that currently there are 35 to 40 clients, that some referrals are from social work, some from youth offending services and some are from Penumbra, among other agencies, that of those who have taken part for whom outcomes are known only five are known to have gone to, or returned to, prison and that 23 started in full-time employment, four started in part-time work and 31 went into some form of further education; is most concerned that this project will run out of New Futures funding at the end of March 2004, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should as a matter of urgency provide, either through direct funding or through the Scottish Enterprise New Futures Fund, interim funding until either the termination of the New Futures Fund nationally or "In Touch" secures substitute funding, whichever is the earlier.
