*S1M-2804 Pauline McNeill: The College of Piping-That the Parliament notes with pleasure the recent £300,000 end of year flexibility grant to the Piping Centre in Glasgow; regrets, however, that once again the College of Piping, which has been in existence since 1944, currently has more than 150 pupils on its register and maintains a teaching network covering the whole of Scotland, has failed to receive similar support, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to consider distributing financial support to such bodies in a fairer and more equitable way.
