 *S1M-3650.1 Michael Russell: Education—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3650) in the name of Mr Brian Monteith, leave out from "should" to end and insert "must be one which delivers the best for each child, is founded upon the broad and inclusive traditional strengths of Scottish education, is resourced and organised to help young people gain a secure grounding in the basic skills at an early age, gives various routes for entry into further education or skilled employment and which welcomes diversity and a variety of local delivery within a strong state sector, and therefore rejects any attempt to bring back from the political grave the divisive Tory educational philosophies of the past which proved so damaging to Scotland’s young people during 18 years of undemocratic and unwanted Conservative Government in this country."
