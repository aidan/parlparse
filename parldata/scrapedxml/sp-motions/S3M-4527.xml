*S3M-4527 Jamie Hepburn: Unfair Charges for Supplemental Oxygen by Airlines—That the Parliament notes that many individuals with a variety of conditions require supplemental oxygen when travelling by air; is concerned that many airlines continue to charge for providing passengers with the supplemental oxygen that they require; believes that this is effectively profiteering from disabled people; calls on those airlines that continue to charge passengers requiring in-flight supplemental oxygen to cease doing so by allowing such passengers either to bring personal oxygen equipment on board and use it or to have supplemental oxygen provided for them, in both cases without charge; welcomes the recent decision by British Airways, Emirates and Cathay Pacific to drop all charges; notes that as of 1 May 2009 airlines in the United States of America have to allow passengers requiring supplemental oxygen to use their own portable oxygen concentrator free of charge, and calls for airlines operating from Scotland that at present levy charges for the provision of in-flight supplemental oxygen to do the same.
