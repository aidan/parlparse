 *S3M-1547 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Iranian Asylum Seekers Mehdi Kazemi and Pegah Emambakhsh—That the Parliament condemns the UK Home Office decision to reject asylum applications from Mehdi Kazemi and Pegah Emambakhsh, both Iranian nationals who fear persecution and execution on return to Tehran on the basis of their sexual orientation; notes with deep concern reports that Mehdi Kazemi’s former boyfriend was arrested and executed for sodomy and that Ms Embambakhsh’s partner was arrested and may face being stoned to death; expresses concern over increasing reports of growing repression in Iran and figures from Iranian human rights campaigners which state that over 4,000 lesbians and gay men have been executed since 1979, and calls on the UK Government to urgently review these cases and the guidance issued to immigration officers and to consider following the example of the Netherlands and Germany by imposing a moratorium on the deportation of gay and lesbian asylum seekers who fear that they will be persecuted in Iran.
