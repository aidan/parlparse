*S1M-437.3 Tommy Sheridan: Tackling Drug Misuse in Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S1M-437) in the name of Angus MacKay, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "regrets the current drugs policy which in 1999 resulted in the highest number of heroin related deaths, the highest and most widespread level of heroin addiction and the worst level of drug related crime ever recorded in Scotland; supports an alternative policy based not on the failed policies of increased law enforcement and education based mainly on scare tactics, but on harm-reduction policies which would include – (i) honest, realistic and constructive drugs education programmes formulated mainly by drugs workers and drug users; (ii) a range of approaches to heroin addiction, including the controlled prescription of pharmaceutical heroin to registered addicts in order to stabilise their lives and the lives of the communities they live in which would drastically reduce both drug-related deaths and drug-related crime; (iii) legalising the production and sale of cannabis through properly licensed and regulated premises to end the criminalisation of over one million cannabis users in Scotland as well as driving a clear wedge between the heroin and cannabis markets and (iv) the diversion of funds from the law enforcement budget to provide adequate resources for an integrated treatment, rehabilitation and education programme, and which is based on the best examples of integrated drugs policies endorsed and practised by European partners like Switzerland and Holland which have resulted in significant reductions in problematic drug use, and recognises that problematic drug use is mainly rooted in the social and economic conditions of poverty, lack of opportunity and poor recreational facilities which face so many of our young people and that tackling poverty is therefore essential to the success of this approach.
