*S3M-7128 Willie Coffey: Fèis Chill’ Mheàrnaig, the Kilmarnock Festival of Gaelic Language and Culture—That the Parliament welcomes the holding of the inaugural Fèis Chill’ Mheàrnaig, the Kilmarnock Festival of Gaelic Language and Culture, at Onthank Primary School on 17 and 18 September 2010; notes that the festival gave children from north-west Kilmarnock and across East Ayrshire the opportunity to learn Gaelic through song, to receive professional tuition in musical instruments such as the fiddle and clàrsach and to try step-dancing, shinty and Gaelic drama; welcomes the support for this event from Bòrd na Gàidhlig through its Taic Freumhan Coimhearsnachd fund, which is aimed at strengthening the acquisition and usage of Gaelic across Scotland, and from East Ayrshire Council, Comann nam Pàrant, Fèisean nan Gàidheal and Comann na Gàidhlig; recognises that the development of Fèis Chill’ Mheàrnaig builds on the Mod successes of Onthank pupils Callum Douglas, Reece Macdonald, Adele Anderson and Taliah Howard, medal winners at the Glasgow Mod, and Findlay Crawford, winner of medals at both Glasgow and National Mods, and congratulates all the staff of the Onthank Gaelic Unit, Steve Banks, headteacher of Onthank Primary School, and the parents, organisers and tutors of the event on its success.
