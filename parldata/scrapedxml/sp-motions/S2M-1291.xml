*S2M-1291 Carolyn Leckie: Thiomersal in Vaccines-That the Parliament recognises that thiomersal in vaccines has been banned in Japan, South Korea, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Canada and the United States of America, that in 1999 the institute of medicine in the USA declared that it was "biologically plausible" that thiomersal was the cause of neurological problems in children, that the European agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products recommended "it would be prudent to remove thiomersal from childhood vaccines", that the World Health Organisation recommended that this be done as soon as practicable and that an alternative thiomersal-free DTP vaccine is available and licensed but not actively promoted; is extremely concerned that thiomersal containing DTP is the predominant vaccine still promoted and administered in Scotland, and believes that it should be withdrawn immediately and that the Scottish Executive should, at least, as is within its remit, issue guidance to NHS boards and all those delivering primary care to ensure that parents are informed of, and offered, thiomersal-free vaccines and make the necessary funding available.
