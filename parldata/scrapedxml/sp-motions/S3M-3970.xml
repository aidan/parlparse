 *S3M-3970 Murdo Fraser: Major Benson-Blair—That the Parliament gives its support to Major Angus Benson-Blair of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards for his noble challenge to cycle 3,100 miles across America in under 12 days to raise $35,000 for the Army Benevolent Fund and the British Army Benevolent Fund America; notes that Major Benson-Blair, who has served twice in Iraq, will begin his endeavour on 17 June 2009 in California on the west coast and will finish at Maryland on the east coast; understands that to complete this gruelling task Major Benson-Blair will cycle 260 miles per day and that during his trans-continental charge he will gain over 100,000 vertical feet, the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest over three times; hopes that many individuals and organisations in Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom and in the United States of America will show their support to Major Benson-Blair by visiting www.benson-blair.com, and commends him on his courageous quest to raise funding for these important charities.
