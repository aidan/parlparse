*S3M-4745 Robin Harper: Duke of Edinburgh Awards Scheme—That the Parliament congratulates the thousands of Duke of Edinburgh’s (DofE) Award volunteers, leaders and staff across Scotland on the publication of the recent HM Inspectorate of Education report that rates the impact of the DofE scheme on young people as excellent (outstanding and sector-leading); welcomes the report’s conclusions that the DofE scheme provides a significant personal development programme that complements the core activities of a diverse range of providers, including schools, those who work with marginalised and disaffected young people, mental health units and young offenders institutions; applauds the impressive impact that the programme has on young people with additional support needs, and further notes that the DofE scheme has a valuable contribution to make to the values, purposes and capacities of the Curriculum for Excellence.
