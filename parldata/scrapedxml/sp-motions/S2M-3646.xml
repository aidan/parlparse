*S2M-3646 Ms Sandra White: Positive Action in Housing—That the Parliament congratulates Positive Action in Housing (PAH) and its director, Robina Qureshi, for the excellent work that they do, especially with refugees and asylum seekers in often difficult circumstances; notes the comments by Tom Harris MP on the BBC’s Politics Show, suggesting that PAH’s funding should be looked at by the Scottish Executive because of its campaign against dawn raids; believes that this would set an unacceptable precedent whereby independent organisations would only be allowed to say things consistent with Executive policy; notes that the Scottish Compact of 2003 between the Executive, its agencies, non-departmental public bodies and the voluntary sector in Scotland states "The Compact acknowledges that the voluntary sector and the Executive have their own spheres of action with different roles, responsibilities and resources. It is accepted that not all voluntary organisations will have an interest in seeking partnership with the Executive. Some will pursue their own objectives without reference to the state. Others may find themselves more often in opposition to the Executive than in partnership", and condemns the comments made by Tom Harris MP.
