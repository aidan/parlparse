*S2M-4901.3 Christine Grahame: Scotland’s Duty to its Senior Citizens—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4901) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "is therefore" to end and insert "expresses concern, therefore, that free personal care is not being delivered equitably, with waiting lists being operated in some regions, and believes that the Scottish Executive must take immediate action to eradicate these practices; also believes that pensioner poverty cannot be tackled without the abolition of the council tax and its substitution by the fairer system of a local income tax; is alarmed at the devastating fuel cost increases which must lead to increasing vulnerability of our older people to cold-related illnesses and early mortality, and, while welcoming legislation to end age discrimination, calls on the Executive to inquiry into elder abuse."
