 * S3M-5789 Rhona Brankin: Midlothian Young People’s Advice Service—That the Parliament congratulates Midlothian Young People’s Advice Service (MYPAS), an independent community-based organisation that provides a wide range of integrated and creative services to improve young people’s health and wellbeing, for its achievement in being one of only ten UK-wide winners of a GlaxoSmithKline IMPACT Award, managed in partnership with the King’s Fund, which acknowledges the exemplary endeavours of charities working in health-related fields in the UK; recognises that this is a significant achievement given that the IMPACT Awards received over 350 applications from across the UK; delights in the award of £25,000 that MYPAS will receive as a winner and the boost that this will give towards the provision of an excellent and greatly valued service to young people in Midlothian; wishes MYPAS the very best of luck in the grand final in London in April, and hopes for its success in gaining an additional £10,000 towards its work and becoming the overall UK winner.
