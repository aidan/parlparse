*S2M-4723 Donald Gorrie: Downgrading of Monklands Hospital Accident and Emergency Services—That the Parliament deeply regrets the decision of the Scottish Executive to endorse the decision of NHS Lanarkshire to downgrade the status of accident and emergency services at Monklands Hospital; believes that this will seriously damage the health and well-being of the population and communities of Lanarkshire’s northern corridor, including Airdrie, Coatbridge and Cumbernauld, and further believes that major decisions over the provision of health services should no longer be the sole responsibility of ministers or non-elected quangos but should be brought before the Parliament for debate and vote.
