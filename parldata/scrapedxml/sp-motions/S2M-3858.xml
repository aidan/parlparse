 *S2M-3858 Colin Fox: Support for Sacked Worker—That the Parliament believes that the chain store firm, Dunnes Stores, which has outlets throughout Scotland, has achieved a new low in European industrial relations by sacking shop steward, Joanne Delaney; notes that 22-year-old Ms Delaney was elected shop steward by her fellow members in the Ashleaf store in Crumlin, Dublin, after four years’ service with the firm, but was sacked shortly afterwards for wearing her Mandate trade union badge on her store uniform; further notes that Dunnes then compounded its anti-trade union stance by refusing to attend a meeting about the disciplinary action with Ms Delaney because she was accompanied by her trade union official; utterly condemns Dunnes’ behaviour towards Ms Delaney, believing that it directly contravenes her basic human rights of freedom of association and belief, and urges the firm to reinstate her forthwith.
