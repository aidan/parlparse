*S2M-4828&lt;&gt; Helen Eadie: Life. Live It - British Red Cross—That the Parliament congratulates the British Red Cross on its report, Life. Live it; notes that every year there are 5.5 million attendances at hospitals across the United Kingdom; agrees with the view that in many health emergencies interventions in the first few minutes, before the emergency services arrive, can make a crucial difference to the outcome for the casualty and that people in the UK should have basic first aid knowledge; notes that Norway, Denmark and France already teach first aid as a core part of the school curriculum; congratulates New Zealand for measuring the impact of a public health campaign on first aid for burns; applauds all organisations similarly engaged in first aid activity, such as the St. Andrew’s Ambulance in Cardenden where a new course for local people started on 18 September 2006, and hopes that the Scottish Executive will take the appropriate measures to ensure that schools, colleges, universities and workplaces make it a core part of their programme of activity to provide first aid education and training.
