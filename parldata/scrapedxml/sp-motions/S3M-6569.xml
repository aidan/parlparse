*S3M-6569 Robin Harper: School Playgrounds—That the Parliament recognises the importance of school playgrounds in enriching childhood through getting children active, giving them regular experiences of nature, developing their social skills, helping them to learn and developing citizenship and pride of place; expresses concern that many of Scotland’s school playgrounds are in poor shape and that few local authorities have any proactive programme in place to develop them, and urges the Scottish Government to give local authorities a clear responsibility to provide school playgrounds in which children can play, enjoy nature, learn and thrive.
