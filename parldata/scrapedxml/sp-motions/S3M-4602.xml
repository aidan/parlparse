 S3M-4602 Liam McArthur: Scottish Education Awards 2009—That the Parliament congratulates the winners of the Scottish Education Awards 2009; celebrates the achievements of each of the schools, pupils and teachers nominated for awards this year and the high standards attained by all; applauds, in particular, the efforts of Shapinsay Primary School, whose commitment to becoming carbon neutral and self-sufficient in energy generation impressed the judges in the Greener Schools Award category; agrees that this achievement is all the more impressive given that the school has only 20 primary and six nursery pupils; hopes that the pupils, staff and parents will soon be rewarded with Green Flag status, and believes that the example set by Shapinsay Primary School and the other nominees for this year’s awards will help inspire schools across Scotland.
