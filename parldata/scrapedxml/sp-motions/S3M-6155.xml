* S3M-6155 Stuart McMillan: Inverclyde Schools Wind Orchestra Receives Gold Award—That the Parliament congratulates the achievements of the Inverclyde Schools’ Wind Orchestra for receiving a gold award at the National Concert Band Festival, which took place in Birmingham on 10-11 April 2010; notes that the event is the United Kingdom’s largest wind band and big band festival; further notes that the band performed New York by Nigel Hess and The Year of the Dragon by Philip Sparke, and acknowledges that this is a first for a band from Scotland to achieve a gold award at the national finals and, therefore, praise must go to the band and musical director David Hutcheson for their hard work and enormous achievement.
