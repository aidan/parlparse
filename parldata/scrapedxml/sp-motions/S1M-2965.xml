*S1M-2965 Pauline McNeill: River Kelvin Walkway-That the Parliament welcomes the Â£750,000 upgrade to the three-mile River Kelvin walkway planned by Glasgow City Council; notes that this walkway is very popular with walkers, cyclists, joggers and families and provides a quiet and safe route for many people who wish to avoid busy city roads; further notes that it is also home to a wide variety of wildlife and native plants and believes that the beauty of the river walk will only be enhanced by the resurfacing of the path.
