*S3M-3900 Robin Harper: Marine and Coastal Litter Strategy—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Marine Conservation Society 2008 Beachwatch report; expresses alarm that 2,581 items of litter were recorded per kilometre of Scottish beach surveyed, the highest average of any UK country; acknowledges that, despite many voluntary efforts and schemes such as Fishing for Litter, the problem of marine debris continues to damage the Scottish marine and coastal environment; notes that the US Commission on Ocean Policy recognised marine debris as a serious threat to marine resources and human health and that US legislation tasks the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Coast Guard to deal specifically with these dangers; understands that marine debris does not obey political boundaries, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that a comprehensive marine and coastal litter strategy is developed in partnership with appropriate agencies across the United Kingdom in order to tackle this scourge of Scotland’s coastlines.
