 *S1M-2537 Mr Gil Paterson: Civil Legal Aid—That the Parliament supports the Cross-Party Group on Men’s Violence Against Women and Children in its campaign to make it easier for abused women to access civil legal aid; calls on the Executive to implement the recommendations of the Justice 1 Committee that the eligibility criteria for civil legal aid be widened by removing the inconsistencies in the treatment of benefits and by increasing the lower capital limit; urges the Executive to increase as a matter of urgency the current qualifying income levels which ultimately determine whether or not an application can be considered eligible to receive legal aid; and further urges the Executive to review the scale of contributions payable by applicants to minimise their financial burden in order to recognise that many women who leave their abuser have additional demands on their income which further disadvantage them.
