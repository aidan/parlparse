*S3M-7842 Liam McArthur: Bill Hogg OBE—That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Bill Hogg OBE who played a key role in Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) over many years; recognises the service that he gave to the development of the modern game in Scotland in the various posts that he filled, including treasurer, secretary, and chief executive of the SRU, as the SRU representative on a range of international bodies and as Scotland team secretary; considers also that he never forgot the grassroots of the game, serving George Watson’s College and Watsonian FC over many years as a referee of schoolboy and senior matches; believes that he will be greatly missed by Scotland’s rugby community, and offers its condolences to his family on their loss.
