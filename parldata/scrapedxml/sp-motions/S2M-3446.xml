S2M-3446 Murdo Fraser: Scotch Whisky—That the Parliament welcomes the Memorandum of Understanding between the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), a signed agreement that states that the SWA and HMRC will work together to stop spirits fraud; believes that the agreement will send a strong signal to spirits fraudsters and will help the Scotch whisky industry grow as illegitimate Scotch whisky production is being tackled; further believes that this new co-operation between Her Majesty’s Government and the whisky industry is a vast improvement on the proposed imposition of strip stamps on the Scotch whisky industry by HM Treasury; hopes that the new agreement will see the end of Her Majesty’s Government forcing measures that will damage the Scotch whisky industry, and expects the new agreement to lead to success in tackling spirits fraud. Supported by: Nora Radcliffe, Mrs Nanette Milne, Mr David Davidson, Alex Johnstone, Murray Tosh, John Scott, Mr Jim Wallace, Phil Gallie, Derek Brownlee, Robin Harper, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Margaret Mitchell, Mary Scanlon, Bill Aitken, Donald Gorrie, Alex Fergusson, Mr Brian Monteith, Bruce Crawford, Mr Ted Brocklebank*
