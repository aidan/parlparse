 *S1M-3540# Ms Sandra White: Exploitation of Women—That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing proliferation of lap-dancing clubs and other establishments of a similar nature throughout Scotland; further notes that the US-based firm Spearmint Rhino, reported to be linked with pornographic websites featuring the drugging, abduction and rape of women, has plans to expand its lap-dancing operations into Scotland; believes that these establishments encourage the exploitation of women and have no place in a modern Scotland seeking to promote equality and eradicate violence against women, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should monitor this situation closely and take whatever action is necessary to halt the spread of these establishments.
