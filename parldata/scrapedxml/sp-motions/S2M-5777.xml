*S2M-5777 Dr Jean Turner: Essential Services for Head Injuries—That the Parliament acknowledges that there may be around 100,000 head injuries per year in Scotland for which adequate facilities should be available for assessment and rehabilitation within the NHS; emphasises the need for such services, which should be routinely available to patients and their families and carers who frequently require counselling and support, especially when dealing with the personality changes that can arise from acute brain injury; notes that relatives’ confidence can be shattered when staff are removed, as in the case of a nurse from the Physical Disability Rehabilitation Unit at the Southern General Hospital who was withdrawn and returned to ward duties due to lack of funding, leaving a hole in this essential service, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that such services are not comprised by lack of funding in future.
