*S2M-1618 Murdo Fraser: Shameless Behaviour of Liberal Democrats on Perth and Kinross Councilâ€”That the Parliament considers that the decision of the Liberal Democrat councillors in Perth and Kinross Council to unilaterally end their coalition with the Conservative and Labour councillors and form a new coalition with the SNP is shameless; believes that this action insults the voters of Perth and Kinross who endorsed the Independent/Conservative/Liberal Democrat/Labour administration at the polls in May 2003; believes that the new coalition is bad news for the people of Perth and Kinross as council tax payers will inevitably see their bills rise under the new administration, and further believes that this behaviour exposes the Liberal Democrats as opportunists who are, at every level, prepared to coalesce with whichever party offers them the best deal with no thought for principle or integrity.
