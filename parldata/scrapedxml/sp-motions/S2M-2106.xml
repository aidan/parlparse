*S2M-2106 Michael Matheson: Threat to Scottish Magazine and Newspaper Distribution—That the Parliament notes the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) review of the newspaper and magazine supply chain in the United Kingdom; recognises that some 14 million newspapers and thousands of individual magazine titles are delivered each day to 54,000 retail outlets, however remote, with the same cover price; notes with concern that the OFT and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry are considering the United Kingdom becoming the first country in the European Union to introduce an entirely free market with no obligation to supply smaller retailers in rural, remote and socially-excluded areas; believes that such a free market would almost certainly put at risk a large proportion of Scotland’s 6,000 newspaper and magazine retailers with numerous retailers, especially in the rural areas of Scotland, suffering financial hardship or even closure, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the OFT and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to ensure that the existing tried-and-tested supply chain is retained.
