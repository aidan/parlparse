*S2M-570# John Swinburne: Abuse of Older People—That the Parliament recognises that around one in ten older people in Scotland have been victims of various forms of elder abuse; congratulates Age Concern Scotland’s elder abuse project on its work in attempting to raise awareness of this problem and, in particular, supports its interactive forum theatre events, which will lead to breaking the silence on elder abuse in our communities; hopes that this unique approach to tackling the very sensitive subject of the abuse of older people will lead to its greater recognition, and believes that the Scottish Executive should take action to reduce the level of elder abuse and to ensure that victims of abuse have access to appropriate support and legal remedies.
