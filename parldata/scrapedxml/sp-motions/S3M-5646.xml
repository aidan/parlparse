*S3M-5646 Jackie Baillie: Alexandria Medical Centre—That the Parliament regrets the delay in the building of the new Alexandria Medical Centre; notes that the final business case submitted by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to the Scottish Government has yet to be approved; considers the conditions in the existing medical centre appalling for staff and patients alike; further considers that the new medical centre is an essential part of the Vision for the Vale, and calls on the Scottish Government to commit the capital cost of £18.5 million without any further delay.
