*S2M-3568 Shiona Baird: Dundee Sun City—That the Parliament congratulates all involved in the Dundee Sun City initiative, a multi-agency partnership aimed at promoting sustainable urban development by maximising awareness and adoption of both energy-efficiency measures and renewable energy; welcomes the relaunch of the scheme on 18 November 2005 which will see a renewed drive to boost local manufacturing and installation of renewables, including micro-renewables which have the potential to reduce fuel bills and lift households out of fuel poverty; notes that Dundee has the greatest potential for solar energy in Scotland and that Tayside has enormous potential for on and offshore wind, marine renewables and biomass, and believes that the combination of experts from the council, private sector and academia will provide the best opportunity for maximising research and development and job creation in this sustainable growth sector, as well as offering a vision for Scotland’s green future.
