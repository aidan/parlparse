*S3M-1664 Hugh O’Donnell: Merger of Epilepsy Scotland and Enlighten - Tackling Epilepsy—That the Parliament welcomes the merger of Epilepsy Scotland and Enlighten – Tackling Epilepsy, based in the Lothians; welcomes this progressive move; believes that this merger of two excellent services will bring added support and quality to services that help nearly 40,000 people affected by this common neurological condition, and hopes that it will secure new funding and build on the existing innovative projects that already assist households living with epilepsy and continue to make a difference and transform people’s lives.
