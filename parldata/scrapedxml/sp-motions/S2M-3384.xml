*S2M-3384# Christine Grahame: Haddington Citizens Advice Bureau—That the Parliament commends the work of citizens advice bureaux throughout Scotland, of which Haddington Citizens Advice Bureau is typical; notes that in 2004-05 it opened 2,015 new cases with an increase in drop-in and telephone access and that £117,083 was secured for clients, but that premises and funding for staff continue to be its main priorities for service development; notes with concern the increasing demand for the Money Advice Service, with the level of debt increased by 25% from the previous year making more demands on the service; is most concerned that this service is now stretched to its limits; further notes with regret that the Good Advice Better Health Clinics in Berwick, Cockenzie, Port Seton and Tranent have lost continuation funding and that the hours of the Project Worker at the one GP Advice Clinic in Dunbar have been reduced from 25 to seven per week when 56 patients accessed this service, there were 177 contacts from third parties and £26,685 was secured for clients from a small investment in the service of £6,500; considers that all of these services are invaluable to individuals and the community at large, and considers that the Scottish Executive should reconsider their funding now.
