*S3M-7402 Bill Kidd: Universal Credit and an Uncertain Future for Carers—That the Parliament expresses concern at the position of carers that has arisen from the proposals in the UK Government’s White Paper Universal Credit: welfare that works; considers that the paper’s statement that "All governments, since 1976, when Invalid Care Allowance was introduced, have faced the dilemma that increasing the level of benefit is neither affordable nor cost effective" appears to seriously undervalue the contribution that carers make to society, including the huge savings it believes that they make to public finances by providing informal, unpaid care; is concerned about what it considers is the confusing uncertainty surrounding the future of Carer’s Allowance arising from the words "The Government is carefully considering whether changes to Carer’s Allowance will be necessary to take account of the introduction of Universal Credit and provide clearer more effective support for carers", and is further concerned that the paper states that recipients of Universal Credit will not be required to face conditionality if they have "intensive and regular caring responsibilities", believing that this indicates a possible tightening of the future definition of who is or is not a carer.
