 *S3M-4658 Stewart Maxwell: Congratulations to Scotland’s Top Blood Donor—That the Parliament applauds Thomas Bradley of Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, for his 600th blood donation over the past 42 years; notes that the 66-year old started donating blood when he was just 24 and that his generosity has helped to save or improve the lives of more than 2,000 people since then; acknowledges that, although the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service has helped increase the number of blood donors in Scotland by 10,000 in the last year, less than 7% of Scotland’s eligible population volunteers to donate blood; further notes that the need for blood donations never stops, and welcomes the ongoing dedication and support of blood donors like Mr Bradley who help to save lives every day.
