*S3M-2593 Helen Eadie: Celebration of John Thomson’s Induction into Scottish Football’s Hall of Fame—That the Parliament celebrates the well-deserved upcoming induction of Celtic and Scotland goalkeeper, John Thomson, into Scottish Football’s Hall of Fame; notes that John Thomson, who tragically passed away from injuries during an Old Firm derby in 1931, grew up in the mining community of Cardenden and is recognised by annual tributes from residents of Fife as well as from the whole of Scotland and abroad; recognises and thanks, in particular, members of the John Thomson Memorial Committee, such as Alex Burns, for tireless efforts in promoting the remembrance of the legendary player through community events such as the annual children’s football tournament, which, in its 26th year, this summer marked one of its most successful celebrations ever and was attended by Lindsay Roy and Cathy Jamieson MSP; considers that this induction is made even more special by the fact that January 2009 marks the centenary of John Thomson’s birth and praises the efforts of local Fife schools that will be celebrating this anniversary with a play about John Thomson’s life and career in the Bowhill Centre that month; acknowledges with thanks the MSPs who supported the debate on motion S2M-3243 on this subject last session, including Bruce Crawford, Jamie McGrigor, Trish Godman, Michael McMahon and Patricia Ferguson, and finally considers that John Thomson’s induction will cement his legacy in Scotland’s football history and continue to inspire Scotland’s youth in both community and sport.
