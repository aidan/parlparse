 *S3M-5481 Stewart Maxwell: 49 out of 50 US States Agree to Fire-safe Cigarettesâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the US states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee on the implementation on 1 January 2010 of legislation for fire-safe cigarettes, which have a reduced tendency to burn when left unattended, in a bid to drastically reduce the number of fire deaths and injuries; further notes that this now leaves only one state, Wyoming, still to pass such legislation; believes that the European Commission is shamefully lagging behind in the development of an agreed European standard, and calls on the UK Government to assist in speeding up the process. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Mike Pringle*, Brian Adam*, Bill Kidd*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Wilson*, Rob Gibson*
