*S2M-1366 Frances Curran: Racist Election Literature-That the Parliament notes that the Commission for Racial Equality believes that the British National Party's current European election leaflet amounts to an incitement to racial hatred which is an offence under the Public Order Act 1986; is concerned that tens of thousands of pounds of public money have been used to deliver this vile, racist message of hatred to hundreds of thousands of homes across Scotland; further notes that Royal Mail employees, who have objected to delivering the leaflet, have been threatened with disciplinary action and that, so far, despite dozens of complaints by members of the public, the police have failed to bring a prosecution; believes that democratic principles are undermined when minority ethnic communities are placed in a state of fear by literature of this nature, and calls on the Scottish Executive's Law Officers to urgently investigate the possibility of prosecuting the British National Party for public order offences. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, John Swinburne*, Campbell Martin*, Tommy Sheridan*
