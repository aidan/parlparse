*S3M-6143 Fiona Hyslop: Gaelic - An Action Plan for Gaelic—That the Parliament recognises that Gaelic is more than a language and, as such, it strengthens and enriches many aspects of Scotland’s social, cultural and economic life; also recognises that the current condition of Gaelic needs urgent attention, and welcomes the programme of action provided by Bòrd na Gàidhlig, which is designed to achieve the outcome of increasing the number of Gaelic speakers and bring renewed attention to the important place that Gaelic holds in Scotland.
