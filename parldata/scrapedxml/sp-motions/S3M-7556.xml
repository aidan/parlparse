*S3M-7556 Patrick Harvie: Scottish Social Enterprise Charter—That the Parliament considers that, from the earliest mutuals and co-operatives, social enterprises were created in Scotland to address community need; recognises the over 3,000 social enterprises in Scotland that it considers pioneer new approaches to delivering quality public services, tackling climate change, regenerating communities and creating quality jobs, training and exciting career opportunities for individuals of all ages; believes that Scotland’s social enterprises are an increasingly valuable part of the fabric of Scottish society, and supports the Scottish Social Enterprise Charter and, notably, the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition’s call for social enterprises in Scotland to be empowered to play their role in regenerating and building Scotland’s communities, creating a national culture of social entrepreneurship.
