*S2M-5655.2 Richard Lochhead: The Future of Scotland’s Organic Farming—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5655) in the name of Sarah Boyack, insert at end "but believes that, as many of the targets in the current Organic Action Plan have only been partially met, it is time for a new updated organic action plan that encourages a more balanced basket of healthy, locally grown organic produce, and pledges to use public procurement to promote organic produce, to communicate the benefits to consumers and to minimise the bureaucracy associated with organic production."
