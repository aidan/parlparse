*S2M-1176# Colin Fox: Abolish Prescription Charges-That the Parliament believes that charging patients for their medicines breaches the principle of universally free health care that underpins the NHS; notes that Unhealthy Charges, published by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux in July 2001, indicates that as many as 70,000 Scots per year may have gone without vital medicines because they could not afford the £6.30 charge for each item; believes that the logic behind the charging criteria, with one patient exempt and another with a very similar condition paying in full, cannot be sustained, and believes that the Scottish Executive should follow the example of the National Assembly for Wales which voted recently to abolish prescription charges.
