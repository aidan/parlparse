*S2M-2215 Mr Brian Monteith: Responsible Drinkingâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Diageo and The Portman Group for the creation of www.drinkaware.co.uk, a website which provides UK consumers with comprehensive information on responsible drinking, including a unit calculator that uses real brands to allow consumers to see accurately how many units they are drinking, alongside hints and tips for responsible drinking and information for people at different life stages, for example drivers or pregnant women, and calls on all parties to support this industry initiative which will see the website address appear on drinks packaging and advertising over the coming months and encourages all members to try the unit calculator for themselves.
