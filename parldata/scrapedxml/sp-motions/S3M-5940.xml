*S3M-5940u Stuart McMillan: World Oceans Day—That the Parliament recognises World Oceans Day 2010 on 8 June and congratulates the United Nations for designating a day with the aim of improving the health of the world’s oceans; considers that lobbying by the Ocean Project and the World Ocean Network encouraged the UN to officially recognise 8 June as World Oceans Day; acknowledges that there will be events to mark the date across the world and hopes that communities across Scotland may take part or organise their own events; further considers that the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, Scotland’s first such Act, goes a long way in improving awareness and responsibility for the sustainability of Scotland’s seas and hopes that the events on 8 June will take up this message; hopes that the theme of the day, Our Oceans, Our Responsibility, will be widely spread, and wishes World Oceans Day much success in future years. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Aileen Campbell*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Bill Wilson*, Gil Paterson*, Sandra White*, Maureen Watt*, Kenneth Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Robin Harper*, Brian Adam* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
