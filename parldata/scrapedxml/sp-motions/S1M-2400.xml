*S1M-2400# Bristow Muldoon: Proposed Closure of Binny House, Sue Ryder Care-That the Parliament condemns the unilateral and disgraceful decision by Sue Ryder Care to close the Binny House care centre in Ecclesmachan, West Lothian; considers that this shows a complete disregard for the interests of the residents and staff of the centre; believes that by walking away from very substantial offers of additional finance from health boards and local authorities Sue Ryder Care has demonstrated bad faith, and further believes that, unless this decision is reversed, local authorities and the NHS should regard Sue Ryder Care as an unsuitable partner for any future care projects. Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan*, Robin Harper*
