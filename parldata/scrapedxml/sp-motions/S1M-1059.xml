S1M-1059 Mr John McAllion: Educational and Training Provision for Scots on the Autistic Spectrum Disorder—That the Parliament notes the emerging problems surrounding the funding of educational and training provision for young Scots on the autistic spectrum disorder, accepts that local authorities such as City of Dundee Council and other agencies find it increasingly difficult to meet the increased demand for this provision from existing resources, and calls for a national debate within and outside the Parliament on how these problems can be identified and overcome.
