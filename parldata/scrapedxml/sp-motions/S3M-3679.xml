*S3M-3679 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow City Council Announces £7 Minimum Wage—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Glasgow City Council, Scotland’s largest local authority, to pay its staff a new minimum wage of £7 per hour; notes that this move will boost the wages of the lowest paid staff by more than £1,100 a year; further notes that up to 80,000 workers in Glasgow earn less than £7 per hour and that this move has the potential to improve the lives of thousands of families across the city; acknowledges that the decision follows a similar successful scheme in London, and recognises that the national minimum wage was introduced by the UK Labour government without the support of other parties. Supported by: Michael McMahon*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Malcolm Chisholm*
