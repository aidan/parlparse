 * S2M-2644.2 Murdo Fraser: Life Sciences—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2644) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from “endorses” to end and insert “notes the Scottish Executive’s support to the sector, notably through initiatives such as the Scottish Co-investment Fund and the Life Sciences Intermediary Technology Institute; regrets, however, that the Scottish Life Sciences Community Strategy failed to engage adequately with all sectors of the industry; notes the industry’s very real concerns about bureaucracy, infrastructure and an appropriate skills base, and therefore calls on the Executive to supplement glossy brochures with tangible action to grow biosciences and encourage venture capitalist investment in Scotland by creating a more business-friendly environment.”
