 *S3M-2183 Mike Rumbles: Aberdeenshire Schools—That the Parliament commends Aberdeenshire Council for agreeing to provide funding for new primary schools at Kinellar, Drumoak, Dunnottar, Portlethen, Inverurie, Turriff, Newmachar and Rathen and a new academy and primary school at Alford; recognises the urgent need to extend this programme to cover other secondary schools in Aberdeenshire, including new schools for Laurencekirk, Kemnay, and Ellon; notes that the previous administration provided £63 million for schools in Aberdeenshire in the last Session of the Parliament alone; further notes the scepticism that has been voiced by Scotland’s business community on the SNP’s proposed Scottish Futures Trust, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide funding for new secondary schools in Aberdeenshire as a matter of urgency to ensure that pupils receive the best possible education.
