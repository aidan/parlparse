*S3M-6667 Christine Grahame: Borders Rail Full Steam Aheadâ€”That the Parliament notes the commitment of the Scottish Government to the reinstatement of the Borders Railway with stops at Tweedbank, Galashiels, Stow, Gorebridge, Newtongrange, Eskbank and Shawfair and considers that the Liberal Democrat, Conservative, Labour, Green and Independent support in the Parliament for the Edinburgh tram project was wholly misguided, is costing the Scottish public purse dear and should never have proceeded.
