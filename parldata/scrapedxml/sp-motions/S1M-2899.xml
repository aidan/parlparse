*S1M-2899 Richard Lochhead: Attack on Scottish Fishermen by Struan Stevenson MEP-That the Parliament condemns comments by the Chair of the European Parliament Fisheries Committee, Struan Stevenson MEP, that labelled Scottish fishermen as "cheats" if they accepted decommissioning grants but did not leave the fishing industry; notes that the purpose of decommissioning is to reduce capacity in the catching sector rather than remove individuals from the industry, and further notes that having a Scot as Chair of the European Parliament Fisheries Committee should be a benefit to the fishing industry in Scotland rather than a liability.
