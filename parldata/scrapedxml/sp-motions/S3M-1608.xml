 *S3M-1608 Stuart McMillan: New Sponsorship Deal for Scotland’s Under-21 Footballers—That the Parliament welcomes the recent news that the Scottish under-21 football team will be sponsored by the Scottish Government through the CashBack for Communities scheme; notes that the current sponsor, Tennent’s, has agreed to donate its sponsorship rights for the under-21 team to the scheme, which uses the proceeds of crime to make a positive difference to the lives of young people throughout Scotland; believes that the new sponsorship deal will help drive awareness of the scheme among young people; also notes that the deal will see the CashBack for Communities scheme promoted on the training kit of the Scotland men’s under-21 team as well as through trackside advertising at all home games, editorial and advertising in match programmes and access to the players for CashBack-related media opportunities, and further notes that the deal will also include 300 free tickets for each under-21 home game, to be used for competitions. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Alasdair Allan*, Kenneth Gibson*, Aileen Campbell*, Sandra White*
