 * S2M-2920 Nora Radcliffe: G8 Summit Environmental Priorities—That the Parliament notes that World Environment Day is 5 June; believes that climate change must be a priority for discussion and action at the G8 summit at Gleneagles; supports the intention of the UK Government for the summit to be carbon neutral but calls for full details of how the government will invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy and forestry schemes to deliver carbon neutrality; believes that the United States of America’s acknowledgement and acceptance of its own scientific evidence on climate change are urgently necessary, and believes that a symbolically carbon-neutral G8 summit cannot be deemed to be successful in environmental terms unless it produces a statement demonstrating real commitment to immediate action to tackle climate change by all of the G8 states, backed up by an action plan.
