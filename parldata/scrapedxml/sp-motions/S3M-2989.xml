*S3M-2989 Sandra White: Size Does Matter—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the EIS report, The Case for Reducing Class Sizes in Scotland’s Schools, supporting the case for a reduction in class sizes; notes that studies have shown that smaller class sizes result in higher attainment levels, particularly among those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and an improvement in pupil behaviour, motivation and self-image, and urges all parties involved in the delivery of smaller class sizes to work together to give all children in Scotland the opportunity to realise their full potential.
