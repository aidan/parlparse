 *S3M-4638 Nicol Stephen: Increase in Hepatitis C Cases in Grampian—That the Parliament notes with concern the rise in new confirmed cases of hepatitis C in Grampian to 184 cases in 2008 from 148 the year before; further notes that an estimated 60% of those suspected to be chronically infected with the disease remain undiagnosed; recognises that hepatitis C can have a serious impact on individuals’ health and can lead to major complications and eventually death; further recognises that those who are infected with the virus often show no initial symptoms and only around half of those infected are ever fully cured of the disease; believes that not enough is being done to educate people about the risks of this disease, and, given that at present there is no vaccine or cure, calls on ministers to strengthen and repeat messages and advice in order to raise further awareness of hepatitis C and how to avoid contracting it.
