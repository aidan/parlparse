*S2M-5446 Dr Elaine Murray: Recommendations of Joint Administrators of Farepak Food and Gifts Limited—That the Parliament notes the publication on 18 January 2007 of BDO Stoy Hayward’s statement to creditors of Farepak Food and Gifts Limited; notes that unsecured creditor claims are estimated at £46 million and that the dividend payment to these creditors is estimated at 5p in the pound; notes the recommendation of the joint administrators that Farepak should move to creditors’ voluntary liquidation and that a liquidator has wider powers of investigation than an administrator to take legal action against third parties, which could lead to further funds being released to creditors; notes also the proposal that a creditors’ committee be created, and hopes that the recommendations of the joint administrators will be supported by customers of Farepak in pursuance of their demands to know what happened to their money.
