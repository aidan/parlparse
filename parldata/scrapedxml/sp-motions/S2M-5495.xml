*S2M-5495 Richard Baker: Beating Bowel Cancer - 8th Loud Tie Campaign—That the Parliament supports Beating Bowel Cancer’s "Loud Tie Campaign" which aims to raise awareness of bowel cancer; notes that bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in Scotland, with around 1,600 people dying from the illness, and over 3,500 new cases being diagnosed, each year; recognises that early clinical detection and intervention can save lives; welcomes the roll-out, from March 2007, of the national screening programme, already piloted in Grampian, Tayside and Fife, which will see over 650,000 potentially vulnerable people being screened by 2009; urges people to take part in the national screening programme by returning their self-test kits; supports further improvements in bowel cancer services in Scotland which build on increased patient involvement and public awareness, delivered though managed clinical networks, and encourages MSPs to support national Loud Tie Week between 29 January and 4 February 2007 and to wear a loud tie or scarf on 6 February to show their support for the Beating Bowel Cancer campaign.
