*S2M-4692 Mr Charlie Gordon: Air Route Development at Glasgow International Airport—That the Parliament expresses concern at the closure by American Airlines of its summer air route from Glasgow International Airport to Chicago, after 12 years of operation; is further concerned that Glasgow International Airport has, in recent years, lost direct routes to London City, Boston, Washington, Frankfurt/Munich, Stockholm and Brussels airports; is also concerned that previously withdrawn routes to Toronto and Prague have only been partially replaced; notes that seasonal routes such as the erstwhile Chicago route and the current Philadelphia route are not eligible for support under the current rules of the Scottish Executive’s Air Route Development Fund, and calls on the Minister for Transport, Tavish Scott, and BAA Scotland to meet urgently to give, together, fresh impetus to route development and surface access to the airport by more flexible application of the Air Route Development Fund, expediting the completion of the M74 motorway and the Glasgow Airport Rail Link and by an irrevocable commitment to Glasgow Crossrail.
