 *S3M-5928 Elaine Smith: Celebrating International Women’s Day by Ending Abuse—That the Parliament joins with the European Network on Independent Living, Inclusion Scotland, Glasgow Disability Alliance and North Lanarkshire Disability Forum in celebrating International Women’s Day and in calling for an end to the continuing complacency that allows disabled women to be physically and sexually abused; understands that disabled women are twice as likely to experience abuse compared with other women and, in particular, that they are up to 10 times more likely to be abused if they are institutionalised, with the risk of abuse being highest for women with learning difficulties, intellectual impairments and those from the deaf community; recognises that all people have the right to live free from violence, abuse and dependency, and believes that disabled women do not want "care", dependency or institutionalising but instead wish to live independently with dignity, self-determination and control.
