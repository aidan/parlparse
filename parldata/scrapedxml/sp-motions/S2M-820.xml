*S2M-820 Carolyn Leckie: Alternative MMR Vaccine Research-That the Parliament commends the Irish Government and the Science Foundation of Ireland for awarding a £482,000 grant to fund research by Professor Greg Atkins of Trinity College, Dublin, into the development of a new synthetic alternative to MMR; believes that the Irish Government has shown foresight and helped move the debate on vaccination policy forward everywhere by recognising that a causal link between MMR and children having autism and bowel disease has neither been confirmed or refuted; further believes that compatible research should be funded in Scotland and that, in the meantime, single vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella should be made available to all parents as well as MMR, and believes that this would improve confidence in vaccination policy and increase uptake to levels more likely to ensure herd immunity.
