*S3M-170 Helen Eadie: Breathe Easy Week 2007—That the Parliament welcomes British Lung Foundation Scotland’s Breathe Easy Week from 11 to 17 June 2007 which aims to "Blow the Whistle" on Scotland’s poor record on lung disease; regrets that one person in five in Scotland is affected by lung disease; further regrets that death rates from lung disease in the United Kingdom are twice the European average; expresses real concern at the impact on health, and lung disease in particular, from the use of cannabis across Scotland and recognises that earlier diagnosis and improved treatment and care for all lung disease sufferers will reduce the burden on NHS Scotland and help those affected to live longer and healthier lives; welcomes the British Lung Foundation Charter which highlights 12 priorities for improving lung health; calls on MSPs to "Blow the Whistle" on lung disease in their constituencies, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with NHS QIS to develop clinical standards for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and managed clinical networks for respiratory conditions in every NHS board area of the country.
