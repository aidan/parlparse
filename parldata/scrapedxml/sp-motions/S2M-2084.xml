 *S2M-2084 Christine Grahame: The Scottish Helpline for Older People—That the Parliament commends the work of Age Concern Scotland and, in particular, the success of the Scottish Helpline for Older People launched in June 2004; notes that, since that date, it has dealt with 3,000 calls Scotland-wide, with 150 per week on average, that its service is available in over 120 languages through the use of Language Line and that it also provides a textphone service for the hard of hearing; further notes that, during this period, it has provided over 100 referrals to specialist organisations, and commends its aims for the coming years to market the helpline specifically to black and minority ethnic communities and to continue to develop an effective referrals structure.
