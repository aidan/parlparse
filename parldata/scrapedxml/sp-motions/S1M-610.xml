*S1M-610 David McLetchie: European Convention on Human Rights—That the Parliament notes with concern the disruption to Scotland’s judicial system resulting from Her Majesty’s Government’s decision to directly incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into Scots Law without having paid due attention to the consequences; further notes that the Convention now impacts directly upon the legislative competence of the Parliament and the powers of the Scottish Executive and from October 2000 will apply to all public authorities in Scotland; calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide, at the earliest opportunity, a full report to the Parliament on the impact of incorporation to date and a statement on the Executive’s state of preparedness for October when the Convention becomes fully operational, and further calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide a full and detailed analysis of the ECHR implications of legislative proposals submitted to the Parliament and to consider establishing a Human Rights Commission or some other body to provide expert advice and guidance on the impact of the ECHR on public authorities in Scotland.
