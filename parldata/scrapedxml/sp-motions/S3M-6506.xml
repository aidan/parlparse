*S3M-6506 Patrick Harvie: UK Border Agency and International Volunteering—That the Parliament notes the valuable contribution of short-term visitors coming to Scotland to volunteer in the country’s communities and contribute positively to important intercultural exchange; is concerned that recent changes to tier 5 of the UK Border Agency (UKBA) Points Based System do not distinguish between volunteer and migrant worker and therefore may prevent volunteers from coming to Scotland due to the extra bureaucracy, expense and delay involved with this change; urges the UKBA to amend the Points Based System to remove volunteer from the work category or at least make an exemption for short-term volunteers, and recommends that the UKBA considers the merits of the approach used in the Australian points-based system, which allows tourist visitors to volunteer as part of their stay without the need for a specific temporary worker visa.
