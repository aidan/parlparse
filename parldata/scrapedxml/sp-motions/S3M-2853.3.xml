*S3M-2853.3 Jeremy Purvis: Scottish Economy—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2853) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from "across" to end and insert "; deeply regrets the lack of early and decisive action by the Scottish Government in response to this downturn; recognises that its much trumpeted six-point plan is little more than re-announced promises; welcomes the growing consensus across all the major parties that tax cuts are a positive and effective way to energise the economy, and calls on the Scottish Government to revise the operating plan of Scottish Enterprise, restore local economic development and support to small businesses, make a statement on how capital projects are being accelerated and use the tax-varying powers at its disposal to implement the Liberal Democrats’ proposed 2p reduction in the basic rate of Scottish income tax to deliver more than £300 per year into the pay packet of the average Scottish earner and a significant fiscal stimulus to the economy."
