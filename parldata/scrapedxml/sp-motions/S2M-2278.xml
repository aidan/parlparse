*S2M-2278 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Child Support Agency Privatisation Concern—That the Parliament notes that, as part of a pilot project, the Child Support Agency (CSA) will be allowing its computer supplier, EDS, to take over some management functions at the CSA’s processing centre in Accrington; views such a move with the greatest concern given EDS’ previous record in delivering a computer system which has created massive delays in payments for one of society’s most vulnerable groups, and agrees with the Public and Commercial Services Union that such a move amounts to creeping privatisation of the CSA during a period when both Scottish lone parents and CSA staff require greater stability.
