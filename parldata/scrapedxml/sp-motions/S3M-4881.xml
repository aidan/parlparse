 *S3M-4881 Helen Eadie: Retrospective Adjustments to the Terms and Conditions of Employees of the Scottish Government and Agencies of the Scottish Governmentâ€”That the Parliament is very concerned to learn that human relations staff in various departments of the Scottish Government are putting in place retrospectively a change to the agreed terms and conditions of staff in the civil service; hopes that any changes to terms and conditions will be undertaken with prior consultation and proper trade union agreement irrespective of which department of the civil service is affected, and further hopes that, when any quango is abolished, the staff concerned in the transfer to a new body will not suffer any detriment to their terms and conditions, as it understands is being proposed to the employees of the Care Commission who will move from a civil service pension scheme to a local government pension scheme if the changes proposed in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill are enacted.
