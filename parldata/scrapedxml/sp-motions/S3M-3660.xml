 *S3M-3660 Rob Gibson: Inspiring Women Politicians—That the Parliament notes with concern, following International Women’s Day on Sunday 8 March 2009, the recent report by Girlguiding UK that found that the 19% of UK MPs who are women are failing to inspire young women to become interested in politics; further notes that on average fewer than one-fourth of members of national parliaments are women, that out of 12 European Parliament presidents only two have been women and there has never been a woman president of the European Commission; recognises the world-class example set by the Scottish Parliament in having 45 women MSPs, four women ministers and in being the first to have a woman Deputy First Minister; highlights the precedent set by Elish Angiolini in being Scotland’s first woman Procurator Fiscal, Solicitor General and Lord Advocate; hails Rwanda’s example as the first parliament in the world to have a female majority, and finally calls on all politicians, leaders and business executives, men and women, to recognise the unique perspective that women offer and to work mindfully towards inspiring the next generation of female leaders so as to see a more representative democracy at decision-making tables around the world.
