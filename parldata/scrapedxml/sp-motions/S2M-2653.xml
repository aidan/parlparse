 * S2M-2653 Jackie Baillie: Breakthrough Breast Cancer Drugâ€”That the Parliament warmly welcomes the development of the new breast cancer drug, Femara (letrozole), which is a major weapon in the fight against the disease by cutting the risk of breast cancer recurring by 42% and lowering the risk of cancer spreading to other parts of the body by 39%; notes that this throws a lifeline to post-menopausal women, the majority of breast cancer patients; further notes that the drug prevents breast cancer recurrence and is a breakthrough in the battle against the most common form of cancer among Scottish women, as the only prior options were surgery and a maximum of five years tamoxifen therapy with no other preventative measures available after these, and acknowledges that the drug lowers the number of women needing expensive treatment for recurring cancers while providing new hope for a positive and healthy future.
