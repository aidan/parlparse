*S3M-1961 Ted Brocklebank: 100th Anniversary of the Death of Old Tom Morris—That the Parliament notes that 24 May 2008 is the 100th anniversary of the death of Old Tom Morris, a native St Andrean and a pioneer of professional golf; recognises that Old Tom won the Open four times, including in 1867 at the age of 46, and that he still holds the record as the oldest Open winner as well as being part of the only father/son duo to be winner and runner-up; further notes that Old Tom was also a clubmaker, "keeper of the greens" at St Andrews Old Course and the designer responsible for remodelling some 75 courses from Muirfield to Prestwick and from Carnoustie to Askernish, South Uist, and considers that Old Tom more than anyone was responsible for establishing Scotland as the World Home of Golf. Supported by: James Kelly*, Stuart McMillan*, George Foulkes*, Rob Gibson*, Elizabeth Smith*, Patricia Ferguson*, Mike Pringle*, Nanette Milne*, Bill Aitken*, Jamie McGrigor*, Christina McKelvie*, John Lamont*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Murdo Fraser*, Alex Johnstone*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Bob Doris*, Jim Hume*
