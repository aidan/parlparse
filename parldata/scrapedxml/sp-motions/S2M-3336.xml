*S2M-3336 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Financial Straits Faced by Dairy Farmers—That the Parliament recognises the dire financial straits faced by Scotland’s dairy farmers; acknowledges the financial constraints placed on them by the large companies wielding too much power and pursuing a completely blinkered short-term buying policy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene in the supply chain to compel major processors and supermarkets to adopt a long-term perspective that protects supplies and dairy farmers.
