*S2M-704 Jackie Baillie: End to Energy Disconnections for Debt-That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing increase in the level of disconnection from energy supply due to debt in Scotland, 735 for the first nine months of 2003 compared to 40 in total for 2001; is concerned that with expected price rises this problem will be exacerbated; recognises that disconnection is the most extreme form of fuel poverty and that its continuation compromises the Scottish Executive's and Her Majesty's Government's aim to end fuel poverty; believes that this is unacceptable and supports Energywatch's call to end disconnections for debt, and congratulates Mark Lazarowicz MP for seeking to end this archaic practice through the forthcoming Energy Bill, providing legal protection for the most vulnerable in society.
