*S2M-221 Jeremy Purvis: Flooding in Selkirk and Yarrow Valleyâ€”That the Parliament notes the major damage done to properties in Selkirk and the Yarrow valley caused by major floods that occurred on 30 May 2003; condemns the slow response of many private insurers to support clients in the immediate aftermath; recognises that there is still considerable damage to private homes, rented accommodation and public property that needs to be repaired and that over 70 households need to be decanted; is concerned that there is an acute shortage of alternative accommodation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with all the agencies, including housing associations, to act urgently in ensuring that people suffer as little distress and disruption as possible.
