*S3M-1866 Patrick Harvie: Flying the Rainbow Flag at Holyrood on International Day Against Homophobia—That the Parliament notes that International Day Against Homophobia takes place on 17 May; expresses dismay that there are still 77 countries in the world today where it is a criminal offence to be gay and that these countries punish women, men and children because of their sexuality and that in seven countries the punishment is death; supports actions being taken by the Scottish Government as well as local authorities, the voluntary sector and others to combat homophobic prejudice, discrimination and violence, and considers that it would also be highly appropriate for the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to arrange for the flying of a rainbow flag from one of the flagpoles at the main entrance to Holyrood on 17 May 2008 and on International Day Against Homophobia each year thereafter.
