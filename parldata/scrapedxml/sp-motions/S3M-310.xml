*S3M-310 Robert Brown: Scottish Civil Serviceâ€”That the Parliament supports in principle the establishment of a separate Scottish civil service but believes that it is vital that regular and informal contacts continue between civil servants in Whitehall and those serving the Scottish Government and that there are good opportunities for civil servants to move between the two jurisdictions; believes that the establishment of a separate Scottish civil service should only proceed after a ministerial statement to, and approval by, the Scottish Parliament after detailed scrutiny by appropriate committees of the Parliament; calls on the First Minister to make a statement to the Parliament on the issue immediately after the summer recess, and requests that the Parliamentary Bureau establishes forthwith a Public Administration Committee with a full remit to examine the proposals and report to the Parliament on them.
