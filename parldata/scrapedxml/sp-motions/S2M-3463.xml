*S2M-3463 Campbell Martin: David McLetchie MSP: Allegations of Misuse of Parliamentary Taxis—That the Parliament notes with concern recent press coverage regarding the use of parliamentary taxis by David McLetchie MSP; believes that any lack of candour on the part of Mr McLetchie in relation to the allegations contained in the press stories would result in damage to the reputation of all MSPs and the Parliament itself, and therefore calls on David McLetchie to seek time in the Chamber to make a full statement to the Parliament on this matter as soon as possible.
