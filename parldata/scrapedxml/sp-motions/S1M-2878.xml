*S1M-2878 Tommy Sheridan: Legalisation of Cannabis and Drug Laws-That the Parliament notes and welcomes the resolutions at the Liberal Democrat spring conference to support the legislation of cannabis and issuing of heroin on prescription to registered addicts; further notes that this policy position has been promoted by the Scottish Socialist Party since the Parliament's inception, and believes that it is time to radically overhaul the unrealistic drugs laws and invest in treatment, rehabilitation and community facilities as part of a social and medical approach to drugs policy, as opposed to the "Just Say No" rhetoric of the past.
