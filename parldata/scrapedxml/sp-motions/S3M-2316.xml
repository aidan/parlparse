*S3M-2316 Iain Smith: Scottish Enterprise—That the Parliament condemns Scottish Enterprise for failing to fulfil previous commitments to fund regeneration projects, including £600,000 towards the £1.6 million scheme at the West Sands, St Andrews; believes that Scottish Enterprise should honour these commitments, and urges Scottish ministers either to instruct Scottish Enterprise to honour these commitments or to directly transfer the relevant funds from Scottish Enterprise to the appropriate local authorities.
