*S2M-3513 Shiona Baird: Scottish Parliament Visitor and Outreach Services—That the Parliament congratulates members of the Visitor and Outreach Services team on their work in taking the Scottish Parliament out to the people of Scotland; believes that, by facilitating greater participation by individuals, organisations and communities, the outreach team has already made significant progress towards achieving its aim of encouraging greater political awareness and engagement by the public across Scotland; notes the overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic response by members of the public who attended recent outreach events in Arbroath, Inverurie and Peterhead in the north-east region; recognises that community-based parliamentary events have an important role to play in helping MSPs reach out to constituents and in educating the general public about the work of the Parliament; considers that outreach events have already helped increase public confidence in, and accessibility to, the Parliament and may ultimately help boost electoral turnout, and believes that continuing support for outreach services should remain a key priority for the Parliament if it is to succeed in becoming a truly inclusive institution.
