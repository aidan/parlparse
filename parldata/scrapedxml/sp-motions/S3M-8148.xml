*S3M-8148 Margaret Smith: Forth Crossing Contract—That the Parliament expresses its concern at plans for the contract for the Forth Replacement Crossing project to be awarded during dissolution; considers that this announcement breaks with tradition; recognises reported concerns that this decision means that it will be signed in haste; considers that lessons should be learned from the contractual difficulties of the Edinburgh tram project, and urges that the contract is neither awarded nor signed until members have been elected and sworn in for the fourth session.
