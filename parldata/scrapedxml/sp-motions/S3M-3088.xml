*S3M-3088 Bill Kidd: Bank Bailout Failing Small Businesses—That the Parliament notes with concern, despite recent assurances by the UK Government that small businesses would remain top of the agenda, the news that, according to new figures from the Federation of Small Businesses, around one third of small businesses is struggling to get affordable credit from banks; considers that the UK Government is failing to encourage lending to small businesses; commends actions taken by the Scottish Government to protect small businesses, which have seen real benefits, particularly from the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which benefits three out of four businesses, and believes that the complete lack of decisive, practicable action on the part of the UK Government further illustrates the need for the restoration of sovereignty to the people of Scotland.
