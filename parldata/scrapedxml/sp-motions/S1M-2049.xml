*S1M-2049 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Unison Resolution "The Labour Government - What Do We Get For Our Money"—That the Parliament acknowledges the passing of a motion, by a majority of 91,862 votes, at the recent UNISON National Delegate Conference, in Brighton which states "This Conference notes that, despite four years of a New Labour government, UNISON members continue to face cuts in jobs and conditions, that the privatisation of public services has continued apace and that hundreds of thousands of our members continue to earn less than £5 an hour; Conference notes that, increasingly, UNISON members are asking why we hand over millions of pounds of members’ money to fund a party which is attacking our jobs, wages and conditions; Conference also notes that the New Labour policies have led significant groups of electors in London and elsewhere to vote against New Labour candidates in favour of independents or other candidates who oppose cuts and privatisation and defend public services; this Conference does not believe that we are using our funds to defend UNISON policy and objectives as required to under the rules of the union; Conference therefore instructs the National Executive Council to consult the affiliated and general political fund committees, service groups, self organised groups, regions and branches in order to prepare a report for submission to the Annual Delegate Conference in 2002 on the future of UNISON’s political funds with appropriate recommendations accompanied by any necessary amendment to rules"; endorses the view of the UNISON National Delegate Conference, and urges other unions to address this issue in similar fashion.
