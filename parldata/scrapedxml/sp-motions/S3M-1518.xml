*S3M-1518 Sandra White: Racial Harassment Toolkit—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Positive Action in Housing’s online Racial Harassment toolkit, www.challengeracism.com, aimed at providing a straightforward framework for helping housing providers challenge racism in their communities; believes that this toolkit will complement previous work done on promoting awareness and reporting of such incidents and as such help to further bridge the gap between legislation and guidance, and encourages housing providers and other organisations to make full use of these excellent resources in order to promote a more inclusive society free from racially motivated crime and harassment.
