 *S3M-747.1 Sarah Boyack: Independence is the Only Solution to West Lothian Question—As an amendment to motion (S3M-747) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from "that the Conservative" to end and insert "the findings of the Social Attitudes Survey for 2007 which shows support for independence at only 23%, the lowest level since the survey began a decade ago; further notes that when in government the Conservative Party was content to use the votes of English MPs to push through Scotland-only legislation including for the community charge, or poll tax, and relied on the votes of Northern Irish MPs to sustain itself in government until its defeat in 1997; further notes that during previous spells of devolution in Northern Ireland until 1974 no proposal to preclude Northern Irish MPs voting at Westminster was forthcoming from the Conservative Party, and considers that the current mood in both the Conservative Party and Scottish National Party is motivated more by their inability to secure sufficient support for their policies rather than any concern for fairness."
