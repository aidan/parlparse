*S3M-5639 Ross Finnie: Food Collection Trial a Waste—That the Parliament questions the logic of running a food waste collection trial for a year in seven local authorities across Scotland, only to end financial support for the trial after a year without any evaluation, and believes it to have been a waste of public money to have allowed the participating local authorities to invest in the necessary capital equipment, only to abandon the equipment after a year.
