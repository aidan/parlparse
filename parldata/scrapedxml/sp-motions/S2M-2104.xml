 *S2M-2104 Christine Grahame: Show Prejudice the Red Card—That the Parliament recognises that sectarian and racial prejudice is a regular occurrence at football matches and that players, management and supporters’ clubs have a central role to play in marginalising those elements responsible and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce an annual awards scheme, along the lines of Investors in People, which recognises those clubs that have successfully marginalised such prejudices.
