 * S2M-3086 Shiona Baird: Support for Renewable Energy—That the Parliament welcomes the current review of the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order; notes that, whilst the technology-neutral nature of the ROCs system has encouraged the development of onshore wind power, it is not providing adequate support to emerging technologies such as biomass, offshore wind, wave and tidal power; acknowledges that the renewables industry has been calling for increased support for these sectors for several years; feels that the Scottish Executive has yet to grasp the full potential of this industry, estimated by the World Energy Council to be worth £500 billion for wave energy alone; regrets that Ocean Power Delivery’s first commercial contract was in Portugal and not Scotland, and calls on the Executive to provide increased support for emerging renewable technologies as a matter of urgency.
