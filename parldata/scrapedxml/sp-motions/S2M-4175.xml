 *S2M-4175 Pauline McNeill: Anti-Trades Union Practices at Asda Wal-Mart—That the Parliament condemns the anti-trades union practices of Asda Wal-Mart which has been fined £850,000 for offering employees a pay rise to give up union rights at a distribution depot; congratulates GMB Scotland on the success of its campaign on the legal right to maintain union recognition which is fundamental to our society; expresses concern over the attempt of Asda Wal-Mart’s public relations company to discredit the GMB, and reiterates that modern, growing trades unions are an important, indeed vital, part of both Scottish society and the viability and future success of Scotland’s economy.
