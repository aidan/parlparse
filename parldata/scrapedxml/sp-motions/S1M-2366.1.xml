 *S1M-2366.1 Irene McGugan: Consultation and Advocacy Promotion Service—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2366) in the name of Helen Eadie, insert at end "but notes in contrast the concern expressed by both service users and carers about the absence of and reluctance to introduce a Patients’ Council within the Royal Cornhill Hospital, Aberdeen to promote user involvement in the shaping and delivery of mental health services locally, thus ensuring that these services are truly patient focussed; and considers that the Scottish Executive should support the Aberdeen Mental Health Reference Group and others in their campaign to establish such a Patients’ Council by approving the Millan Committee proposal that there be statutory funding for collective advocacy services, in order to guarantee implementation in Aberdeen and across the country."
