*S1M-1958 Roseanna Cunningham: Justice—That the Parliament notes with concern the developing crisis in the administration of Scotland’s justice system; recognises that public confidence in the criminal justice system is being eroded by the system’s inability to deal with the current level of prosecutions, and asserts that urgent action must now be taken to ensure that resourcing levels are assessed and addressed if this crisis is not to deepen.
