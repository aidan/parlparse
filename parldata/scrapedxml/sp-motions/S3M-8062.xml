 *S3M-8062 John Wilson: Coatbridge’s St Patrick’s Day Festival 2011—That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming St Patrick’s day events being planned in Coatbridge; recognises that Coatbridge’s annual St Patrick’s festival has been named in the world’s top 10 of global St Patrick’s day celebrations; notes that new events such as the showing of the much anticipated film on James Connolly, born in Edinburgh and seen as an important political figure in the fight for home rule in Ireland, will be aired at St Patrick’s Hall; recognises that previous events, which it considers have proven a success, will also be returning, including An Evening with Father Ted and The Quiet Man Evening, to entertain those in the area; further notes that a host of other cultural events, including music, dance, theatre, lectures, exhibitions and sport, will form part of what is considered this year’s exciting programme; applauds the hard work being put in by event organisers to bring the local Coatbridge community together to celebrate St Patrick’s day, and joins in wishing the 2011 St Patrick’s Day Festival in Coatbridge every success.
