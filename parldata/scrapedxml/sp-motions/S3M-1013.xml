*S3M-1013 Christine Grahame: Unsavoury Stain? Unsavoury Language—That the Parliament notes the intemperate language used by the British Conservative leader, David Cameron MP, during his recent visit to Scotland; condemns the tone of his comments which do not reflect the democratic political realities in Scotland today; welcomes the seismic shift that the Scottish Conservatives have undergone towards supporting increased powers for the Scottish Parliament and away from this increasingly untenable union, and recognises that David Cameron’s comments are aimed more at securing the right-wing vote in the south of England rather than winning converts in Scotland. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Brian Adam*, Kenneth Gibson*, Stuart McMillan*, Bob Doris*
