*S1M-801 Mr Brian Monteith: Birthplace of Modern Football in Callander—That the Parliament notes that a field in the grounds of the Roman Camp Hotel, Callander, is now believed to be the birthplace of modern soccer; further notes that this field would therefore be home to the oldest football pitch in the country and that competitive matches were played there over 150 years ago; recognises the special significance that this pitch will have in the history of Scottish and international soccer, and calls upon the Scottish Football Association to consider what action should be taken in partnership with the land owners to ensure that the significance of this site is celebrated.
