*S2M-2604# Irene Oldfather: Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease—That the Parliament notes with regret the recent decision taken by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) not to recommend the use of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine in the treatment of newly-diagnosed sufferers of Alzheimer’s disease in England; acknowledges the uncertainty and concern that this decision will cause the families of Alzheimer’s sufferers in Scotland; recognises that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will take any such decision in Scotland; is aware that there are 62,000 sufferers of Alzheimer’s disease in Scotland and that a significant proportion of these people are currently being prescribed these drugs; accepts that the drugs are widely available in the United States and across the rest of Europe to successfully treat Alzheimer’s disease; acknowledges the work of Age Concern and Alzheimer Scotland in raising awareness of the disease and providing advice and support for sufferers and their families; is aware that Alzheimer’s disease is a recognised terminal illness; notes that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland has not yet approved the use of memantine and has not yet taken a final decision on prescribing practices for Alzheimer’s disease on the basis of the NICE recommendations, but considers that the Scottish Executive should look at the wider picture and take into account the benefits that the use of these drugs have been proven to have for sufferers and their families across the rest of Europe and beyond.
