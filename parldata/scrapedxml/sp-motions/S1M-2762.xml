*S1M-2762 Fiona McLeod: GM Crop Trials—That the Parliament believes that the GM crop trials underway in Scotland should be discontinued immediately and ploughed up in light of (a) the report by the Royal Society on 4 February 2002, (b) the study by English Nature revealing that genes from separate GM varieties can accumulate in plants that grow from seed spilled at harvest through a process known as "gene-stacking", (c) the recent admission by the Scottish Executive that horizontal gene transfer from GM foods has taken place under laboratory conditions and (d) Her Majesty's Government’s own scientific evidence, as detailed in the Sunday Times of 17 February 2002.
