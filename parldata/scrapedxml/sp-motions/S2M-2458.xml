*S2M-2458 Christine Grahame: Newlands Primary School—That the Parliament congratulates the parents and community in winning a stay of execution on the proposal to close Newlands Primary School in the Scottish Borders; notes the determined and professional campaign mounted to prevent closure against the wishes of the community; has concerns that the closure proposal is conditional on the parents and wider community raising £1 million to keep the school open when taxation and council taxes have already been paid for this purpose; considers that this may establish an unhealthy precedent which may require communities elsewhere in the Borders to seek a similar solution to proposed closure; notes that Highland Council has a policy of non-closure of small primary schools if it is opposed by the community, and urges the Scottish Executive, which has undertaken to put schools "at the heart of the community", to provide additional funding to cash-strapped rural councils for the sole purpose of keeping their small but essential local primary schools open.
