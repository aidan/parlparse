 *S3M-5086 Liam McArthur: Impact on Fishermen of New Net-measuring Gauge—That the Parliament notes with concern the problems that fishermen are encountering when the mesh sizes of their nets are found to be undersized when measured with the new electronic net-measuring gauge despite being measured as legal with the hand-held wedge-shaped device previously used by fisheries officers and that were in use when the nets were purchased; is further concerned that this can lead to expensive nets having to be discarded or to boats being arrested, resulting in a loss of valuable fishing time; believes that this is an unnecessary addition to the economic pressure on Scotland’s fishermen who are already severely handicapped by the tight restrictions on their fishing opportunities; further believes that it is unacceptable for a formerly legal net to be deemed to be illegal because of a change in measuring device, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce a transition period, during which fishermen can choose to have their old nets measured with the device in use when they were purchased, that will be long enough to allow fishermen to get the full use out of their old nets before discarding them.
