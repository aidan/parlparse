*S3M-2468 Robin Harper: Action on Post Office Closures—That the Parliament condemns the programme of post office closures initiated by the UK Labour government; notes that UK Government figures predict an overall annual shortfall across the United Kingdom of just £200 million; recognises that only 1,638 of the 14,300 UK post offices are in Scotland and that, of those Scottish post offices, 258 are currently threatened; believes that post offices offer a vital public service in communities throughout Scotland that should be preserved, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to take immediate action by writing to the UK Government offering to fund the financial shortfall in Scotland in exchange for a commitment that no further Scottish post offices will be closed.
