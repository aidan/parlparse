*S1M-2731# Mary Scanlon: Macmillan Cancer Relief - Cancer Talk-That the Parliament congratulates Macmillan Cancer Relief on its important and innovative educational programme, Cancer Talk; notes that Cancer Talk is key to realising the charity's vision of tackling unnecessary levels of fear about cancer by raising awareness and dispelling myths in the classroom; further notes that over two hundred Scottish schools have signed up to Cancer Talk, with several keen to publicise it within their local media and community, especially during the week beginning 4 March 2002; urges members to contact their local schools in order to encourage them to get involved in integrating Cancer Talk within their existing curriculum both during that week and afterwards; recognises the need for the Scottish Executive to consider the incorporation of Cancer Talk formally within the schools' curriculum, and believes that such incorporation would be a major source of help and support to the many schoolchildren, parents and teachers whose lives are touched by cancer each year. Supported by: Mr David Davidson*, Bill Aitken*, David Mundell*, Miss Annabel Goldie*, Mr Brian Monteith*, Ben Wallace*, Alex Johnstone*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*
