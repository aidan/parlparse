*S3M-2670 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Leading on Nurseries and Childcare—That the Parliament welcomes Glasgow City Council’s recent announcement that over the next five years it is planning to give every parent in Glasgow with pre-school children access to year-round nursery provision within buggy pushing distance of their homes; notes that, as a result of these wide-ranging proposals, Glasgow parents will also enjoy the most comprehensive and flexible service for five to 14-year-olds anywhere in the United Kingdom, ultimately benefiting from an affordable childcare scheme that will provide access to sport, music and play from 8 am until 6 pm in a range of school and community venues; further notes that the initial five pilot schemes that are due to begin in November 2008 will encourage Glasgow parents to access their full tax credit entitlements and will include information for parents about possible employment opportunities while prioritising placements for parents wishing to return to education, training or work and offering reduced costs linked to the UK Government’s tax credit banding for parents on low incomes, in training or with larger families, and believes that the council’s far reaching and progressive proposals represent a major step forward in tackling child poverty and parental worklessness in the city. Supported by: Sarah Boyack*, James Kelly*
