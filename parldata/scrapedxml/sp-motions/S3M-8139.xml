 *S3M-8139 Christina McKelvie: World Social Work Day—That the Parliament joins social workers and social care staff across Scotland in celebrating World Social Work Day on 15 March 2011; notes that this event focuses on the contributions of social work to societies across the world and the ways in which the social work profession can address challenging social conditions wherever they are found; welcomes the opportunity provided by the day to express appreciation for what it considers to be the excellent work done by social workers and social care workers, often in difficult circumstances, throughout Scotland every day; believes that, in tough economic times and with a growing number of older people in the Scots population, social care and social work services are more vital and more valuable than ever, and wishes success for the World Social Work Day event scheduled to take place in the Glasgow Science Centre on 15 March, organised by the Association of Directors of Social Work and the Scottish Social Services Council and supported by the Scottish Government.
