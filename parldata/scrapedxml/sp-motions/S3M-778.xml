 *S3M-778 Michael Matheson: CSA Discriminates Against Scottish Workforce—That the Parliament opposes the decision of the Child Support Agency (CSA) to impose holiday arrangements on its Scottish workforce during the festive period that are based on the English holiday period; notes that it has not taken into account the different school holidays in Scotland; further notes the ongoing campaign by the PCS union to ensure that the 1,600 CSA staff in Scotland are not discriminated against in holiday entitlement over the festive season, and calls on the CSA to end this ongoing discrimination against its Scottish workforce and ensure that the different holiday period in Scotland is fully recognised and provided for in its festive holiday arrangements.
