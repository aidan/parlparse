 *S3M-4743 Jackie Baillie: Vale of Leven Community Maternity Unit 24/7—That the Parliament expresses its concern regarding the news that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is proposing the mothballing of the Community Maternity Unit at the Vale of Leven Hospital at night; understands that the maternity unit will run normally during the day but be replaced by an on-call service in the evening; considers that this decision effectively downgrades the service and is a blow to a vital resource that midwives have fought so hard to build up and that expectant mothers need available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; further notes that this decision may have an adverse effect on the choices of future expectant mothers who may decide to go to another hospital, and calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to abandon this daft proposal, which appears to be based on the premise that babies are born between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm.
