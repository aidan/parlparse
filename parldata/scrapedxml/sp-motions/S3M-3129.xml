*S3M-3129♦ Bill Kidd: £12 Million Third Sector Enterprise Fund—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government’s £12 million Third Sector Enterprise Fund, which is aimed at helping voluntary organisations to increase their turnover and become more sustainable, affording organisations looking to develop social business activities the opportunity to apply for grants of up to £100,000 from January 2009; notes the importance, in the current economic climate, of supporting the third sector, which contributes towards increasing sustainable economic growth in Glasgow and throughout Scotland, and echoes the sentiments of Lucy McTernan, SCVO’s acting chief executive, that this fund "will allow organisations across the sector to get the sort of investment they need to develop a more enterprising approach to their activities".
