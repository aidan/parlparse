*S2M-5118 Mr Jim Wallace: Air Ambulance Cover in the Highlands and Islands—That the Parliament notes with concern reports that the Scottish Ambulance Service is trying to restrict the number of missions flown by its Inverness-based air ambulance helicopter by using the helicopter only when a road ambulance cannot access the site and even then only when authorisation is granted by the head of the air ambulance service; believes that such action will inevitably delay the arrival in hospital of patients in need of urgent medical treatment; further believes that this is the result of the reduction in the number of air ambulance aircraft in Scotland, in particular the loss of an air ambulance based in Orkney which has left the Inverness helicopter covering a much enlarged area, and calls on the Scottish Executive to instruct the Scottish Ambulance Service to base an additional air ambulance aircraft in Kirkwall as a matter of urgency so that adequate levels of air ambulance cover in the Highlands and Islands can be restored.
