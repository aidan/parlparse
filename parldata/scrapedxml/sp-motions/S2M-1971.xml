*S2M-1971 Trish Godman: Overcrowding on Scottish Train Services—That the Parliament is seriously concerned at the abject failure of ScotRail officials to address the serious problem of gross overcrowding of trains in Scotland and, especially, on the commuter train running from Glasgow to Edinburgh; believes that this cramming of passengers into trains is, at worst, a potential safety hazard of some magnitude and, at best, a source of serious discomfort and stress, especially to elderly and disabled passengers and that it acts as a powerful deterrent to those who would travel on public transport if they could be guaranteed a level of comfort that equals the standards to be found in most European Union member states and Scandinavian countries, and calls on the Scottish Executive to engage in discussions with senior officials of ScotRail in order to enhance the safety and comfort of rail passengers in Scotland.
