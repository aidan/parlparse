*S2M-2021 Patrick Harvie: Fluoride—That the Parliament notes recent reports that the Scottish Executive has decided not to include water fluoridation in the forthcoming Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; believes that the quality of research into the health impacts of drinking fluoride has been too poor to establish whether it is harmful or not; recognises that the European Convention on Human Rights clearly states that individuals have the right not be medicated without their consent; acknowledges the appalling state of oral health in Glasgow; welcomes the proposals on expanding access to dental services, maintaining good oral hygiene and tackling poor diet contained in NHS Greater Glasgow’s Oral Health Strategy; urges NHS Greater Glasgow to rule out introducing fluoride to Glasgow’s water supply, and calls on the Executive to categorically rule out fluoridation from all other future legislation.
