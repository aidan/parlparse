 *S2M-1039.1 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1039) in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end "but, in so doing, expresses concern that the Scottish Executive did not act fully upon the recommendations of the Education Committee's 2nd Report 2004 (Session 2), Stage 1 Report on Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill, and is concerned that a significant number of parents who formerly had records of needs for their child will no longer have comparable legal rights to those parents whose children will qualify for a Co-ordinated Support Plan."
