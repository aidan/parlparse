 *S1M-3559 Irene McGugan: Street Football for All-That the Parliament notes the work of the C.A.F.E. Project, a highly successful and nationally recognised voluntary organisation which provides a one-stop shop for leisure, culture, health, education and employment facilities and outdoor activities for people under 25 in the Arbroath area, which was recently described by Tony Andrews, Director of the British Council in Germany as "extraordinary, innovative and inspiring in the way it reconnects young people with the mainstream - a model for working with disadvantaged young people"; congratulates the project on its plans to develop "Street Football For All" alongside the national "Dreams and Teams" project, which seeks to promote sport, health and active citizenship by using football to bring together young people from Scotland and Germany and 15 other countries of the world to increase understanding and tolerance, and wishes the projects every success with this excellent initiative which meaningfully embodies equality and social inclusion
