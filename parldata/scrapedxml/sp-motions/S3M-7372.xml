 *S3M-7372 Mary Scanlon: Mouth Cancer—That the Parliament recognises that Mouth Cancer Awareness Week runs from 15 to 19 November 2010; notes that there is a death from mouth cancer on average every five hours in the United Kingdom and that survival rates can increase from 50% to over 90% with early detection, yet over two thirds of cases are diagnosed at a late stage; is concerned that the number of new cases of oral cancer recorded in the UK in 2007 showed that there were over 13 cases per 100,000 in Scotland compared with the UK average of 8.9; applauds the past and ongoing research efforts of Scottish universities and dental schools in the fight against mouth cancer, which it considers to be significant; acknowledges the value of the dental profession in early detection, and commends this campaign and its aims of increasing awareness of this disease in an effort to increase survival rates from mouth cancer.
