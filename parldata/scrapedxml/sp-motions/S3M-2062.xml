*S3M-2062 Roseanna Cunningham: Congratulations to the Youngest Ever Curtis Cup Team Member—That the Parliament recognises the achievement of Carly Booth from Comrie in becoming the youngest ever player, at 15 years and 11 months, to be selected for the Great Britain and Ireland Curtis Cup team; notes that her team mates, including three other Scots, form the most youthful Curtis Cup side ever to represent Great Britian and Ireland; believes that, regardless of the result, this side shows the strength of our young sportswomen, and wishes all eight every success in their future golf careers.
