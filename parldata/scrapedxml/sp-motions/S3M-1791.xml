 *S3M-1791 Pauline McNeill: The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama—That the Parliament recognises the value and contribution of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD) in Glasgow to the arts in Scotland and further afield; notes that the RSAMD is Scotland’s only national conservatoire of music and drama and a recognised world-class institution producing famous alumni, including the current Dr Who, David Tennant, and acclaimed actors Alan Cumming, James McAvoy, Bill Paterson and Daniella Nardini, as well as renowned musicians, singers, composers and conductors; further notes that the academy has ensured that students have benefited from the high standard of one-on-one tuition which conservatoire teaching provides, despite the fact that drama courses have not been funded by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to conservatoire level; is concerned that this historic underfunding has finally come to a head and is leading to a restructuring exercise among teaching staff which threatens the quality of teaching at the academy, including major changes to staff contracts and a failure to rule out compulsory redundancies, and calls on the Scottish Government to fund the current £600,000 gap and work with the funding council to ensure that drama and music courses are both funded to conservatoire level to ensure that Scotland remains at the centre of international arts provision. Supported by: Claire Baker*, David Whitton*, Karen Gillon*, Malcolm Chisholm*, Jamie Stone*, Margaret Curran*, Karen Whitefield*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Bill Butler*, Iain Gray*, Ken Macintosh*, Tavish Scott*, Robin Harper* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
