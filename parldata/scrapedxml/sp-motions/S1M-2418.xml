*S1M-2418 Irene Oldfather: Bicycle Helmets-That the Parliament notes that the majority of deaths in cycling accidents occur as a result of head injuries; recognises that wearing a correctly fitted helmet has been shown to reduce the risk of severe head injury by 63 to 88%; further recognises that cost is a major barrier, particularly for families on a low income, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to promote a campaign of responsible cycling, including dissemination of information on wearing helmets correctly and measures to reduce the cost of bicycle helmets to the public.
