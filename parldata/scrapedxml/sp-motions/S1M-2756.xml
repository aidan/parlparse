 *S1M-2756# Cathie Craigie: Dangerous Driving and the Law—That the Parliament notes the publication of the report by the Transport Research Laboratory, Road Safety Research Report No.26, Dangerous Driving and the Law, which examines the use and application of the law on careless and dangerous driving throughout the UK; further notes the conclusions of the report and, in particular, that (a) the situation exists where those "guilty of serious negligence in their driving face the same charge of Careless Driving as those guilty of very minor offences", (b) maximum penalties are rarely used, (c) limited resources allocated to investigating fatal road traffic accidents affect the quality of the police investigations of them, and (d) the level of care for victims of the bereaved is variable across the UK; draws attention to the report’s recommendations and, in particular, the recommendations that the (i) introduction of a new offence of causing death/serious injury by negligent driving should be introduced and (ii) feasibility of special prosecutors should be investigated; supports the report where it states that in Scotland a "clearer message regarding the seriousness of these offences would be sent to both defendant and society if all causing death by dangerous driving cases were tried in the High Court", and considers that the Scottish Executive should commission specific Scottish research in this area to take on board the report’s conclusions and recommendations and should work with Her Majesty’s Government to consider the need for a change in the law or in its administration in this area if required.
