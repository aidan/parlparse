*S1M-2622 Marilyn Livingstone: Cross-Party Support for a Review of the Construction Industry in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament recognises the importance of the construction industry to the Scottish economy and the contribution it makes to supporting employment and vocational education and training; notes that nine out of every 10 construction firms employ less than eight people; acknowledges that the reputation of the whole industry is damaged by the actions of rogue traders, particularly within the residential sector, and that small businesses contend that their profitability and competitiveness is adversely affected by the system of cash retentions, and believes that the Scottish Executive should initiate a strategic review of construction in Scotland in order to (a) identify how best to combat the "cowboy" element, (b) support the education and training infrastructure so that it is able to meet the skill requirements of the industry, (c) examine the possibility of developing an inspection and assessment regime to evaluate the competence of construction companies, (d) address the system of cash retentions and (e) ensure that the provisions within the existing construction contracts legislation deliver a process that is fair, effective and easy to understand. Supported by: Miss Annabel Goldie*, Tavish Scott*, Alex Neil*, Robin Harper*
