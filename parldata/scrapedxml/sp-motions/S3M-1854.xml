*S3M-1854 Murdo Fraser: Rangers in the UEFA Cup Final—That the Parliament congratulates Rangers FC on its success in the UEFA Cup this season and for reaching the UEFA Cup Final against Zenit St Petersburg at the City of Manchester Stadium on the 14 May 2008; notes that over 10,000 Rangers fans travelled to Florence for its semi-final victory over Fiorentina, where the local authority organised fan zones and a large screen to show the match, with Rangers fans being congratulated on their excellent behaviour; recognises that over 100,000 Rangers fans intend to travel to Manchester to enjoy and experience the UEFA Cup Final atmosphere, with only 13,000 tickets allocated to Rangers fans; welcomes Manchester City Council’s decision to establish fan zones in the city but is disappointed that there are no plans to set up large screens to show the match in the fan zones and hopes that, in the interests of fans, Manchester City Council will set up large screens to show the match, and wishes Rangers FC success in the UEFA Cup Final.
