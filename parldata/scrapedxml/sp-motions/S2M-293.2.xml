*S2M-293.2 Tommy Sheridan: Closing the Opportunity Gap—As an amendment to motion (S2M-293) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "condemns the failure of the Scottish Executive's policy over the last four years to deal with the problem of poverty in Scotland; notes the findings of the recent Rowntree report on poverty and social inclusion which shows that the proportion of the population living in poverty in Scotland has risen to 23% and the proportion of children in poverty to 30%; believes that the problem of poverty will never be solved until there is a fundamental redistribution of income and wealth which requires an independent Scotland, but considers, however, that even with its limited power the Parliament could begin this process by abolishing regressive council tax and introducing a Scottish service tax based on people's ability to pay and, in addition, introduce a minimum wage in the public sector of £7.50 an hour and free, nutritious school meals for all state school children in Scotland."
