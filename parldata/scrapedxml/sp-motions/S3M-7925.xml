 *S3M-7925 Jackie Baillie: Reverse Unfair Cuts to Argyll and Buteâ€”That the Parliament considers the scale of the reduction in the 2011-12 budget of Argyll and Bute Council as the greatest of any local authority in Scotland, a reduction of 4.94% on 2010-11; notes that this is double the average cuts in the settlement for other local authorities; understands that the COSLA leaders meeting on 19 November 2010 had agreed to update the indicators and maintain the existing distribution for Supporting People funding but, due to a miscalculation, the Scottish Government has allocated less funding to Argyll and Bute than it should have received; understands that West Dunbartonshire has been similarly affected, and urges the Scottish Government to reverse cuts to this funding in Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire to protect vital local services.
