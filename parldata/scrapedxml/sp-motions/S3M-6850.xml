*S3M-6850Margaret Mitchell:Two North Lanarkshire Projects Nominated for Landscape Awards—That the Parliament congratulates North Lanarkshire Council and the RSPB on their efforts to restore the historic Dalzell Estate and Baron’s Haugh RSPB Reserve; notes that the project included the repair and restoration of the estate’s fascinating historical features, the installation and improvement of access to the site and environmental conservation of the woodlands and wetlands that are the habitat for birds and other wildlife; acknowledges that the estate and reserve provide a valuable resource for locals and visitors to appreciate the natural and social history of the area; further considers that Castlehill Community Park in Gawkthrapple, which was opened in 2003 following the efforts of local mothers, is an impressive example of a project that is combating vandalism and antisocial behaviour and is now the centre of the growing community, and notes that the park and the Dalzell Estate have both been nominated by North Lanarkshire Council to the UK Landscape Awards 2010, the winner of which will be announced in November and will become the UK entry for the Landscape Award of the Council of Europe.
