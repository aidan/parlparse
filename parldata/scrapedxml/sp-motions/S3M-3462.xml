*S3M-3462♦ Christina McKelvie: Visitors to Scotland—That the Parliament considers that everyone who comes to Scotland should be afforded a warm welcome and that we should extend every Scottish courtesy to visitors to our country whether they have come as part of the Year of Homecoming 2009, as tourists, as migrant workers, as immigrants, as asylum seekers or as trafficked people; notes the work done by staff at centres like Dungavel House in South Lanarkshire striving to treat those held there in as humane and dignified a manner as possible; supports those who are challenging the measures contained in the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill currently wending its way through the Westminster Parliament that would criminalise trafficked people; disdains those who would seek protectionism and isolationism in an ill-considered defence of domestic jobs; avers that Scotland should be a nation where compassion informs policy, and believes that we should work towards a society and a legal framework where every visitor to Scotland is treated with the same respect and is afforded the same welcome as every other visitor, no matter how or for what reason they came here. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Rob Gibson*, Aileen Campbell*, Bill Kidd*, Angela Constance*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*
