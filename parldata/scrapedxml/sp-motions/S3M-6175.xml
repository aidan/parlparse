*S3M-6175 Bill Kidd: Countering Extremism—That the Parliament commends the work of Quilliam, the world’s first counter-extremism think tank, which stands for religious freedom, human rights, democracy and developing a Muslim identity at home in, and with, the West, in pioneering new and effective ways in which to challenge, expose and sideline extremism; notes that, over the past year, Quilliam has, among other initiatives, trained over 1,000 public sector workers in countering extremism, run a project in Pakistan that has reached over 5,000 students, empowering them in the battle against extremist ideas, and initiated a series of outreach events at British universities and in Muslim communities in the United Kingdom and beyond; believes that it is only through countering extremist ideology with reasoned debate that understanding and respect can be reached, and hopes that that the lessons learned from these initiatives can be replicated in communities across Scotland.
