*S2M-5148 Carolyn Leckie: Scottish Power’s Profits—That the Parliament notes that fuel poverty has been identified as Scotland’s biggest winter killer of old age pensioners (OAPs) and that an extra 30,000 households fall into fuel poverty with each 5% increase in fuel prices; further notes that Scottish Power’s pre-tax profits for the first six months of 2006 show a 77% increase to £483 million; believes that this massive increase has been achieved through profiteering on increased energy prices, and believes that those who will really pay for Scottish Power’s profiteering are the thousands of OAPs who will die because they cannot afford to heat their homes and the tens of thousands of Scots families that will spend part of this winter shivering in unheated homes because they will suffer self-disconnection when they cannot afford to feed their meters.
