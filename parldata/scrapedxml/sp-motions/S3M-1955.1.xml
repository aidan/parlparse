 *S3M-1955.1 Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish Ambulance Serviceâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1955) in the name of Margaret Curran, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "welcomes the improved performance demonstrated by the Scottish Ambulance Service in recent months, particularly in relation to responding more quickly to life threatening calls; congratulates the staff of the Scottish Ambulance Service for their efforts in achieving this improvement for patients; acknowledges the need to ensure that the Scottish Ambulance Service continues to improve across a range of indicators and that it effectively consults staff and communicates with the public about the service it provides for them, and, while recognising its autonomy, would welcome the Health and Sport Committee undertaking a review of these matters."
