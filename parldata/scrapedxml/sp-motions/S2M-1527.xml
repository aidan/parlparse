 *S2M-1527 Patrick Harvie: Public Involvement in Planning-That the Parliament regrets Glasgow City Council's decision to grant planning permission for 22 flats and a restaurant to be built in an outstanding conservation area along the River Kelvin in Glasgow's West End; notes that the development will destroy the beauty of the locality and lead to the obliteration of an important wildlife corridor; further notes that the development will jeopardise the future of small, locally-owned, nearby businesses; believes that the absence of a third party right of appeal in the planning system allows developers to have a huge advantage over communities; further believes that the appropriate response to private sector critics of third party rights is to develop positive and constructive ideas for the smooth functioning of a planning system which treats all parties fairly; expresses concern over recent media reports that the Scottish Executive is considering dropping plans to widen rights of appeal in planning; seeks reassurance that the current consultation on wider rights of appeal has not been compromised by these reports; believes that the Executive should genuinely listen to the views of everyone who responds to their current consultation and should actively solicit responses to the consultation from communities who might otherwise fear that a decision has already been taken, and considers this to be a touchstone issue in relation to the Executive's stated commitment to environmental justice.
