*S2M-4593 Richard Lochhead: Genetic Testing Waiting Times—That the Parliament welcomes the report by Breakthrough Breast Cancer, Testing Times - Waiting for Genetic Test Results; recognises that there are 3,600 diagnosed cases of breast cancer every year in Scotland, with 180 women developing breast cancer as a result of an inherited DNA defect; condemns the current situation where women are forced to wait for up to three years for genetic test results; further condemns current procedures which mean that those waiting for life-altering test results are not kept up to date with progress; supports the aims of the report to reduce waiting times for test results to between two and eight weeks, and calls on NHS boards to meet the targets set out in the report.
