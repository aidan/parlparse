 * S2M-2851 Brian Adam: Store Wars—That the Parliament condemns the Somerfield supermarket chain’s decision to close its Aberness service centre and depot in Aberdeen, which will lead to the loss of around 75 jobs; calls on Somerfield to do everything possible to find alternative employment for the Aberness workforce, and believes, furthermore, that the current store wars that are taking place throughout Scotland may be considered by some to be good for customers, but are certainly not beneficial to employees who work in the retail trade.
