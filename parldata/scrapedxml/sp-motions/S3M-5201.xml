*S3M-5201 Aileen Campbell: 2009 Trad Music Awards—That the Parliament notes that the 2009 MG ALBA Scots Trad Music Awards ceremony will take place on 28 November 2009 at the DG One venue in Dumfries; recognises that the awards aim to showcase Scotland’s wonderful traditional music in all its forms and create a high-profile opportunity to raise media and public awareness of the music and music industry; further notes that the event has completely sold out, with an expected audience of 900 people, and wishes the wide range of talented artists and musicians shortlisted for awards the very best of luck. Supported by: Brian Adam*, Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson*, Sandra White*, Robin Harper*, Liam McArthur*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Wilson*, Stuart McMillan*, Cathy Peattie*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bob Doris*, Patricia Ferguson*, Linda Fabiani*
