 *S2M-4062 Mr Ted Brocklebank: St Andrews - The Best Place in Scotland to Bring up Children—That the Parliament notes research by CACI UK which ranked the best and worst places in Scotland to bring up children, based on academic qualifications, time spent by parents looking after their children, the number of people per household and family income; congratulates the town of St Andrews which was found to be the best place to raise children in Scotland, rated 4.5 times better than the national average; endorses comments by Patrick Tate of CACI UK that St Andrews stood out "because of the high level of qualification of parents in the town who value education and want that to be passed on to the next generation", and believes that this demonstrates the undoubted importance of education in providing opportunities for younger people and that St Andrews should be an example to other communities across Scotland.
