 *S3M-5434 Christine Grahame: Israel War Crime Court Action—That the Parliament notes the decision of an English court to issue an arrest warrant for the Israeli opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, who was foreign minister at the time of the three-week Israeli assault on Gaza, an attack in which, according to the United Nations, the Israeli Defence Force committed a number of war crimes, including the deliberate and systematic targeting of Palestinian civilians; supports any future arrest warrants being issued against the former Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, and Ehud Barak, the defence minister, and considers that all states, including the United Kingdom, have a duty, under the principle of universal jurisdiction, when dealing with crimes against humanity to pursue war crime suspects and can bring them before English and Scottish courts regardless of whether the crime took place outside their normal legal jurisdiction; welcomes the precedent that this English court decision establishes despite reports that the British Government now plans to introduce new legislation to make Israeli Government ministers immune from such action, and urges relevant groups and organisations to bring similar court proceedings against other individual former US and UK Government ministers, such as George W Bush and Tony Blair, who are suspected of instigating wars in flagrant contravention of international legal mores.
