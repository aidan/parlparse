 *S2M-890.1 Alex Johnstone: Nuclear Waste-As an amendment to motion (S2M-890) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from "is concerned" to end and insert "believes that nuclear power capacity is vital in meeting Scotland's future energy needs; recognises technical advances in the handling and disposal of the associated waste materials, and considers that the resolution of nuclear waste issues and the development of new nuclear power capacity can and must run in parallel, as the lengthy commissioning process means that decisions about new nuclear power stations cannot be put off any longer."
