*S3M-1948 Bob Doris: First Glasgow Fare Increases—That the Parliament believes that the recent bus fare increases of up to 25% by First Glasgow are unacceptable; notes that this includes raising the price of a child all-day ticket to £2, that this will be too much for some families and that with the summer holidays just around the corner this comes at the worst possible time for them; further notes that the fare cap has been lifted by the Competition Commission partly due to rising fuel costs despite UK First Bus seeing an increase in its operating profits of 11% to £122 million, a bigger jump than last year and far higher than FirstGroup as a whole which had a 7.6% increase in operating profits; believes that, with FirstGroup declaring preliminary profits of almost £152 million, there is no need to put fares up in this way and that if it has a problem with the level of rising fuel prices it should make representations to the UK Exchequer and not pick on hard-pressed commuters, and calls on UK First Bus to rethink its pricing strategy or at the very least guarantee a future price freeze over a number of years.
