*S1M-2100 Mr Brian Monteith: Access to Higher Education—That the Parliament recognises that further attempts to increase access to higher education for applicants from low income families, in the name of greater social inclusion, will lead to displacement of those who currently meet the entrance requirements unless there is a continued expansion in higher education places; notes than any such displacement would be discriminatory and unjust and work against the recommendation of both the Dearing and Garrick committees that a gradual expansion of higher education places was required to widen access across all social groups, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that university entrance is based on merit and that any measures to increase access for individuals from low income families are achieved through increased numbers of university places and not through discrimination against students with better academic qualifications.
