 *S1M-2880 Ms Margo MacDonald: Palestine-That the Parliament condemns the policies of the Israeli government towards Palestinians; urges the Prime Minister to use his best efforts to convince the government of Ariel Sharon that the continued brutality in territory occupied illegally by Israel under resolutions of the United Nations has resulted in the inevitability of the establishment of the State of Palestine, and counsels that this Israeli government and future governments should seek for this to be realised in peaceful co-operation between the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine.
