 *S3M-5593 Sarah Boyack: Conversion Needed for Scottish Rugby Coverage—That the Parliament considers that there are significant gaps in broadcast coverage in Scotland of rugby, particularly on terrestrial television and particularly around the community game and high performance professional teams; is disappointed that despite the strenuous efforts of Scottish Rugby there is little interest to broadcast the sport sufficiently on either terrestrial or satellite television, and, finally, considers that the broadcasting of rugby is essential to further increase participation in the sport thus increasing fitness levels, promoting Scotland to a wider audience and creating a platform for greater Scottish sporting achievements.
