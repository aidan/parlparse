*S3M-6505 Marilyn Livingstone: Accident and Emergency Services in Kirkcaldy—That the Parliament recognises the importance of accident and emergency services in the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy to the health and wellbeing of patients in Kirkcaldy and Mid-Fife; notes with concern that the hospital’s accident and emergency unit was closed from 17 to 24 May 2010 due to a shortage of junior doctors to staff the department; welcomes the resumption of the evening services since then, and looks forward to talks between NHS Fife and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to secure an adequate allocation of junior doctors for Fife, the opening of the new wing of the Victoria Hospital building in 2011 and the reconfiguration of services.
