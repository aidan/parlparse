*S1M-2433 Tommy Sheridan: North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust's Handling of Industrial Action—That the Parliament condemns the North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust’s incompetent handling of the month-long medical secretaries’ dispute; believes that the secretaries have been forced into industrial action by low pay, an unfair grading system and an intransigent attitude on the part of the Trust’s management; further believes that the secretaries were forced to resume all-out strike action when the Trust reneged on the agreement negotiated between staff and management on 24 October 2001, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring pressure to bear on the Trust to honour that agreement.
