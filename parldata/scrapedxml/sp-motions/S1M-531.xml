*S1M-531# George Lyon: Regeneration of the Clyde-That the Parliament recognises that in the Clyde, Scotland has a magnificent international icon which can be marketed globally to promote enterprise and tourism in the region; recognises also that investment in and modernisation of transport infrastructure on the Clyde is a prerequisite for the economic and social regeneration of the area's communities and that the absence of fast and efficient ferry links on the Clyde is one of the contributing factors to social exclusion in the area, and calls for a thorough and fundamental review of the current infrastructure's shortcomings with a view to developing a long term strategy that can exploit the potential of the area and which can meet the needs of communities on the Clyde in the 21st century.  Supported by: Mr Duncan McNeil*, Allan Wilson*, Michael Russell*
