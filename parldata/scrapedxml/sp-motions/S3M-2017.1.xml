 *S3M-2017.1 Murdo Fraser: London-Venezuela Oil Agreement—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2017) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from "has" to end and insert "was undoubtedly the correct decision for both Londoners and Venezuela alike; believes that the deal was an example of undisguised political posturing and an abuse of office on the part of former mayor, Ken Livingstone, and one which Londoners voiced their disapproval off in record numbers at the recent elections; notes that, according to Human Rights Watch, "President Chávez and his supporters have sought to consolidate power by undermining the independence of the judiciary and the press, institutions essential for the protection and promotion of human rights", that "State interference in trade union elections has weakened the right to free association", that "the government has failed to tackle widespread police abuse" and that "prison conditions remain among the worst on the continent", and therefore believes that UK institutions should consider carefully their dealings with the Chávez regime.
