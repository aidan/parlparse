*S3M-2323 Margaret Mitchell: World Heritage Status for the Antonine Wall—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the UN cultural body, Unesco, to make the Antonine Wall, which was the most northerly point in the Roman Empire, a World Heritage Site; notes that the wall stretches for 37 miles across the central belt of Scotland from Bo’ness, near Falkirk, to Old Kilpatrick in West Dunbartonshire; looks forward to the boost to the local economy and tourism in the area and specifically for the communities of Cumbernauld, Falkirk, Bo’ness and Kirkintilloch located along the wall, and congratulates Historic Scotland, East and West Dunbartonshire councils, Falkirk Council, Glasgow City Council and North Lanarkshire Council on the successful campaign to have the significance of the landmark fully recognised and accorded world heritage status.
