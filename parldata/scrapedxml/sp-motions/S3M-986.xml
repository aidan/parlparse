*S3M-986 Kenneth Gibson: Farepak—That the Parliament condemns the fact that Farepak savers have yet to receive any compensation; calls on the Westminster Government, which underwrote Northern Rock at a cost in excess of £24 billion, to assist victims of the Farepak collapse, which in total would cost the comparatively much smaller sum of £40 million; demands that small savers be given as much protection as big savers; acknowledges that, according to research carried out by the University of Birmingham, the majority of Farepak savers were low-paid women prudently saving for Christmas who were subsequently forced into a cycle of debt, and supports better and mandatory regulation of savings schemes and the publication of the Companies Investigations Branch report into the Farepak collapse in the interests of transparency.
