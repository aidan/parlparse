*S3M-1926# Elaine Murray: Success of First Year of Co-Operative Development Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the success of Co-operative Development Scotland in promoting and facilitating the development of co-operative enterprises across Scotland since it became fully operational in April 2007; notes that research carried out by Heriot-Watt University in 2006 estimated the combined annual turnover of co-operatives and mutuals in Scotland to be around £4 billion; believes that the contribution of this sector to the Scottish economy nationally and to local urban and rural economies, such as that of Dumfries and Galloway, could be increased, and believes that government funding for Co-operative Development Scotland should be extended beyond March 2009.
