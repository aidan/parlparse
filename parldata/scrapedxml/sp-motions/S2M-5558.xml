 *S2M-5558 Tommy Sheridan: Solidarity with Cuba against the Hilton Group—That the Parliament notes the recent decision of the Hilton hotel group to refuse a booking from a Cuban delegation in Oslo and condemns this as an act of blatant political victimisation driven by the United States of America which continues to impose an illegal trade embargo on the Cuban socialist republic and calls on the Parliament’s travel desk and the Scottish Executive to cancel existing bookings and refuse to engage in any further trade with the Hilton group anywhere in the world until it apologises to Cuba for insulting its people and publicly announces that there will be no more discrimination against Cuba at the behest of America or for any other reason. Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne*
