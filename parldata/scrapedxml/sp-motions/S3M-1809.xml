*S3M-1809 George Foulkes: Stop Bickering and Start Building—That the Parliament acknowledges that there are currently 45 school building contracts under way across Scotland; notes that the Minister for Schools and Skills, Maureen Watt MSP, accepts that all 45 contracts were under negotiation prior to May 2007; condemns the fact that not a single new school has been initiated by the SNP government in the last 12 months and is very concerned about the lack of progress in Liberal Democrat/SNP-led City of Edinburgh Council; avers that Edinburgh’s Lib Dem councillors and SNP ministers consistently blame each other for the lack of progress while the city’s 12 SNP councillors remain silent; believes that the City of Edinburgh Council Education Convener’s plan to demand more money from the SNP government will be fruitless and worries that unless rapid progress is made soon, not a single new school initiated since May 2007 will open its doors before the next election; further believes that the Scottish Futures Trust is a white elephant and ill-thought through; hopes that ministers will see sense and put the needs of Scotland’s parents and pupils ahead of grandstanding, and calls on the SNP to start building schools again.
