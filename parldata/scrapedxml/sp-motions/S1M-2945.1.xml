 *S1M-2945.1 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Transport—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2945) in the name of David Mundell, leave out from "unreliable" to end and insert "trunk roads and unreliable public transport; recognises that this is a result of decades of under-investment and misguided privatisation; regrets that the Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive has failed to reverse these damaging Tory policies, and further regrets that the Scottish Executive’s latest transport strategy publication, Scotland’s Transport: Delivering Improvements, provides no programme, no costings and no timescale, and therefore offers little hope for, or commitment to, improvements in Scotland’s transport infrastructure."
