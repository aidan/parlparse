*S2M-5602 Mr Mark Ruskell: National Post Office Week—That the Parliament welcomes National Post Office Week from 19 to 23 February 2007 which aims to highlight and campaign against Westminster government plans to close approximately 2,500 post offices across the United Kingdom, several hundred of which will be in Scotland; congratulates the coalition of groups behind the campaign including Age Concern, Citizens Advice, the Communication Workers Union, the Countryside Alliance, Local Works, the National Federation of SubPostmasters, the National Pensioners Convention, Royal National Institute of the Blind and the Townswomen’s Guilds; strongly believes that an accessible post office network in urban, suburban and rural areas is vital to the future of vibrant communities and sustainable local economies; notes research by the New Economics Foundation that each urban post office saves small businesses around £270,000 every year; encourages all interested parties to respond to the current DTI post office network consultation that runs until 8 March 2007, and also calls on the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to oppose the proposed cuts in the Scottish post office network.
