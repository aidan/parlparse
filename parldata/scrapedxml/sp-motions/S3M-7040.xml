*S3M-7040 Pauline McNeill: Congratulations to the Glasgow Boys—That the Parliament congratulates the exhibition, Pioneering Painters: The Glasgow Boys 1880-1900, at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on having received more than 100,000 visitors; considers that the success of this exhibition has been due to the hard work of the staff involved, particularly those on Kelvingrove’s exhibition organising committee; believes that this demonstrates the popularity of Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, and realises the importance of properly funding such a venue.
