 *S3M-7114 Jim Hume: Nith Inshore Rescue—That the Parliament congratulates Nith Inshore Rescue on the recent launch of its new lifeboat, the St John; considers that the name of the new lifeboat reflects the outstanding support offered to Nith Inshore Rescue by the Order of St John charity; further notes that the rescue team is entirely funded from donations and continues to receive significant support from the local community; thanks Lady Mary Mumford for providing the land in Glencaple from where Nith Inshore Rescue operates; recognises that the team is made up of unpaid volunteers and has carried out over 250 rescues since its creation in 1981, saving a number of lives; values the work of Nith Inshore Rescue, and wishes all associated with it continued success in the future.
