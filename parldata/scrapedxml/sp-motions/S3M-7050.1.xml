 *S3M-7050.1 Liam McArthur: Westminster Thinking on Science Not Just Wrong, But Mad—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7050) in the name of Bill Wilson, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes New Scientist’s editorial of 15 September 2010, Don’t let Britain’s politicians ruin science; regrets that Professor Robert M May’s article did not include an analysis of the situation in Scotland, where serious concerns have been raised by the Moredun Research Institute and others about the SNP government’s approach to future scientific research funding in areas where Scotland has a global lead, including in infectious disease research and animal health; considers that specialist research facilities and centres such as Moredun have a world-renowned reputation and are making significant contributions to the economy in terms of jobs and training young people in relevant skills; notes concerns raised that Moredun may be forced to dilute its focus on infectious disease and move into other areas of research, potentially compromising its capability to contribute most effectively to the Scottish and UK economy, and considers it hypocritical of SNP members to attack the UK administration while it is believed that the Scottish Government risks squandering the specialist scientific excellence that delivers real economic value for Scotland by pursuing a lowest common denominator in scientific research, threatening to replace world-class empirical research with desk-based social science analysis."
