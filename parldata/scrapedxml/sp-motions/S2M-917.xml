*S2M-917# Rosie Kane: Parkhead Youth Project-That the Parliament notes the invaluable contribution that Parkhead Youth Project has made to life in the East End of Glasgow; notes the success of the project in making up to 13,000 contacts with young people each year, offering them advice and support; further notes the recent decision by the East End Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) to withdraw core funding from the project despite its success in helping young people and the efforts of the staff to attract additional grants; deplores the fact that the project will be forced to close, denying the young people of the East End the opportunity to take part in empowering educational activities; notes that the project has complied with every piece of developmental and organisational advice offered to it by the local SIP; believes that East End SIP should reconsider the decision to withdraw funding from the Parkhead Youth Project, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take steps to end the funding lottery for community organisations by adopting the principle that funding is guaranteed for all types of social inclusion projects where need has been demonstrated.
