 *S3M-1280 Elaine Smith: Access to Work for Young Deaf People—That the Parliament believes that all young people should have equal access to employment on leaving school or further and higher education; agrees that a modern Scotland should embrace a diverse workforce; welcomes the presence of the STUC in the Scottish Parliament earlier this month, when a workshop was held to discuss issues relating to access to work for deaf people; recognises the good work that the STUC is undertaking in partnership with trade unions and employers in the Highlands to provide training sessions in deaf awareness and British Sign Language (BSL); is aware however that key voluntary organisations such as the National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS), the Scottish Council on Deafness and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People are still generally finding that there are significant barriers for young deaf people and adults to access employment or training opportunities, including work experience, due to communication barriers and lack of deaf awareness in the workplace; notes that the UK Government’s Access to Work scheme, while providing for access to appropriate communication during working hours, does not cover such access for training provision, which is crucial to an employee’s induction and professional development; is further concerned that there is an acute shortage of qualified BSL interpreters in Scotland, meaning that many deaf people in the workplace cannot access even the minimum level of communication support that they are entitled to; welcomes the work of the NDCS, who have been supporting deaf young people to make the transition from school into the world of work via its Moving On project, and, while welcoming the Scottish Government’s intention to increase the number of qualified BSL interpreters in Scotland, considers that the Scottish Government should liaise with the UK Government, where appropriate, to ensure better access to employment and training and increased promotion of deaf awareness in the workplace, for the benefit of deaf young people and adults alike.
