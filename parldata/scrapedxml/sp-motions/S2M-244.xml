*S2M-244# Mr Bruce McFee: Argyll and Clyde NHS Board Maternity Review—That the Parliament views with concern the decision of the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board, taken at its meeting on 29 July 2003, relating to its review of maternity services; notes that implementation of the board’s decision would result in only one consultant-led maternity unit in Paisley remaining within the board’s entire area; further notes the removal of consultants from the Rankin Maternity Unit in Greenock and the non-return of consultant services to the Vale of Leven Hospital, after the withdrawal of maternity services from that hospital last year, and believes that the Minister for Health and Community Care should delay reaching a final decision on the board’s recommendation until such time as the effects on paediatrics, gynaecology, anaesthetics, accident and emergency and clinical support services, as a consequence of the board’s decision, have been fully assessed, along with the impact of the decision on the wider review of health care services.
