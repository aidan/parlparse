*S3M-835 Jim Hume: Rural Fuel Prices—That the Parliament recognises the disproportionate cost of fuel in rural areas, in particular the south of Scotland, where in many towns and villages people are reliant on cars as an essential method of transport; notes with concern the proposed two pence per litre increase in fuel duty in spring 2008; considers that this will place unbearable pressure on individuals in the south of Scotland as well as hauliers and other businesses nationwide, and calls on the Scottish Government to press the Chancellor of the Exchequer to freeze any further increases in fuel duty and to redress the imbalance between rural and urban fuel prices.
