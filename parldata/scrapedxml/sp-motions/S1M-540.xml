*S1M-540 Johann Lamont: Arms Sales-That the Parliament welcomes Her Majesty's Government's commitment not to sell arms to countries that will use them to commit internal repression or external aggression; further welcomes the publication of an annual report on strategic exports as a first step towards improved transparency; notes that 15 February 2000 is the fourth anniversary of the publication of the Scott Report; notes with concern that, without new legislation to address the problems identified in the Scott Report and other loopholes, Her Majesty's Government cannot ensure that UK arms exports do not contribute to human rights violations being committed, fuel conflict or undermine development; and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to introduce comprehensive and effective legislation to strengthen the control on strategic exports in the next Parliamentary session, given that 91% of the Scottish public believe that the UK Government should introduce systems to ensure that arms exported by the UK are not misused.
