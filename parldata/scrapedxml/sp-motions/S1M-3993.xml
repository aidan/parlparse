 *S1M-3993 Scott Barrie: Proposed Redundancies at Solectron, Dunfermline—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the announcement of 4 March 2003 by Solectron Corporation that it is proposing to reduce its workforce in Dunfermline by up to 330 people; expresses the hope that the redundancies will not come about and that Solectron and all the key agencies involved will work to this end; recognises that trade unions will be fully involved throughout the consultation period, and calls on the Scottish Executive, Scottish Enterprise Fife and Solectron, in the event that the redundancies do take place, to ensure that those made redundant are given redundancy packages that recognise the excellent service they have provided to Solectron and that every possible assistance is given to those made redundant to ensure that they are afforded proper retraining opportunities, if required, in order to find alternative employment.
