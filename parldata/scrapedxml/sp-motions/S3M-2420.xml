 *S3M-2420Elaine Smith:Fair Play, Fair Payâ€”That the Parliament expresses its solidarity with the public sector workers, members of the GMB, UNISON and Unite the Union, currently in dispute over pay and conditions; commends their loyal public service, which is vital not only to our economy but also to the quality of life of our citizens; understands that, while no one wants to strike, these workers feel that they have no other choice when faced with a derisory three-year pay deal, which effectively amounts to a pay cut in the current economic climate; feels, in particular, that the burden of inflation and the council tax freeze should not be placed on the lowest-paid workers; believes that the employers must take immediate steps to resolve this dispute by meeting with the trade unions to negotiate a better deal, and further believes that the Scottish Government has a duty to intervene to end this damaging dispute by making the necessary funds available.
