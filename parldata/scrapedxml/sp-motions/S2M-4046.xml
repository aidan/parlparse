*S2M-4046 John Swinburne: Senior Citizens and Tolls—That the Parliament notes with approval that the tolls have been removed from the Erskine and Skye bridges, but deplores the fact that a postcode lottery now applies to the Forth and Tay road bridges; further appreciates the free bus travel for all senior citizens in Scotland, and asks the Scottish Executive to give consideration to giving exemption from paying tolls to all car-driving senior citizens to coincide with the implementation of the concessionary travel scheme.
