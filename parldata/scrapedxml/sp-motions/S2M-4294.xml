 *S2M-4294 Mr Frank McAveety: Deaf Awareness Week—That the Parliament recognises that 1 to 7 May 2006 is Deaf Awareness Week and supports the work carried out by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) Scotland and many other organisations to change the world for deaf and hard of hearing people across the country; recognises the great work done by Deaf Connections in the Glasgow Shettleston constituency in empowering deaf and hard of hearing people to improve their lives; further notes than one in seven people in Scotland are deaf or hard of hearing, some 758,000 people, and encourages as many people as possible to take part in Britain’s Biggest Soundcheck on Wednesday 3 May, during which RNID hopes to have 100,000 people across the UK, 25,000 of them in Scotland, check their hearing by telephone on 0845 600 5555, and further notes that hearing loss left unchecked can have a debilitating effect upon people’s lives and that we should do all that we can to ensure genuine social inclusion for all.
