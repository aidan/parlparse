*S2M-1991.1 Mr Brian Monteith: Ban on Smoking in Enclosed Public Placesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-1991) in the name of Mike Rumbles, leave out from "the Executive" to end and insert "the Parliament staff smoking room is just that, a staff smoking room and, as such, is not an enclosed public place; notes that it is ventilated and has double doors, and believes that, as the Parliament does not have jurisdiction over employment legislation and workplace smoking bans, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should continue to allow members of the Parliament and all employees the choice of whether or not to use the smoking room."
