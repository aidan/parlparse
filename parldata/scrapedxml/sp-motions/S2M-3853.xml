*S2M-3853 Marilyn Livingstone: Dundee University - Relocation of Training—That the Parliament notes with concern the current proposal from Dundee University to relocate all nurse and midwifery teaching, currently provided in Kirkcaldy, to Dundee; believes that this proposal would be detrimental to the future recruitment of nurses and midwives, particularly in relation to mature students living in Fife, and would have a major impact on NHS Fife; believes that NHS Fife is under an obligation to the Scottish Executive to provide premises in Fife from which the university’s teaching role can be fulfilled; further believes that this local provision must continue, and therefore requests that this proposal be immediately withdrawn. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Christine May*
