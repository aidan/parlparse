*S3M-715 Hugh O’Donnell: School Placements—That the Parliament expresses concern at the recent ruling by the Court of Session that there is no provision in the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 for school placement requests in respect of children with additional support needs and believes that the Parliament must undertake a review of the Act to ensure that placement requests for all such children are treated equally under the law and that, if appropriate, the law is amended to ensure that this happens.
