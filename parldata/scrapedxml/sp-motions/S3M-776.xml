*S3M-776 Liam McArthur: RIAS Award for the Pier Arts Centre—That the Parliament notes that the £4.5 million project to extend and refurbish the Pier Arts Centre in Stromness has won the prestigious Royal Incorporation of Architecture in Scotland Andrew Doolan Award; congratulates the project architects, Riach and Hall, and all those involved in the design and construction of the project for their well-earned success in winning the award and for providing a high-quality building that sits so well in the unique harbourside townscape of Stromness; believes that the reopened Pier Arts Centre will provide both an ideal home for the impressive collection of 20th Century British art presented by the centre’s founder, Margaret Gardiner, and a valuable space for visiting exhibitions, and strongly recommends that all those with an interest in art and architecture make a visit to the Pier Arts Centre, just one of the many highlights of a visit to Orkney, described last year by the Lonely Planet as the "glittering centrepiece in Scotland’s treasure chest of attractions".
