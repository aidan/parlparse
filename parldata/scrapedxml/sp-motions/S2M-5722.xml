*S2M-5722u Helen Eadie: Bid to Increase Financial Limits for Small Claims—That the Parliament welcomes the work of colleagues at Westminster who have ensured that there is pressure on the banking sector and commends the decision by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) last year to limit customer charges by credit card providers; notes recent developments taking place across the United Kingdom with regard to penalty charges being reclaimed by thousands of bank customers who continue to make successful claims; regrets that in very many cases constituents in Dunfermline and across Scotland are being compelled to take out claims in the sheriff courts to conclude their cases against their banks; expresses serious concern that the claims are adding considerable pressures to the workload of the sheriff courts; hopes that the Scottish Executive will urgently examine the pressure on Scotland’s sheriff courts and deliberate carefully on the fact that many constituents are being seriously disadvantaged by the fact that the court system, with the limits of £750 for small claims actions and £1,500 for summary cause actions, has prevented thousands of them legitimately reclaiming significant sums of money from the banks across Scotland which have made record profits in the last year; considers that the Executive should urgently revisit the decision to limit small claims to £750 and summary cause claims to £1,500, recognising that these limits have not changed for more than 10 years; believes that the Executive should reflect on the fact that, if it does not act without delay, it will actively prevent many claimants across Scotland from reclaiming money illegally taken from their accounts; hopes that the Executive will seek meetings with the OFT as a matter of urgency to ensure that in the preparation of the report on which the OFT is currently working it will address the concerns of constituents and the situation in respect of Scotland’s banks, and finally congratulates the Penalty Charges Forum, which has worked voluntarily, professionally and tirelessly to ensure that single parents, nurses, youth leaders, students and many others have returned to them some of the illegal charges which have been withdrawn from their bank accounts without their authorisation in the pursuit by banks to ruthlessly maximise their profits.
