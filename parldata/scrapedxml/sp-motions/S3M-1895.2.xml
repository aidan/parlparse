 *S3M-1895.2 Patrick Harvie: Removing the Barriers to Microgeneration—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1895) in the name of Shirley-Anne Somerville, insert at end "considers that householders also need suitable methods of financing their investment in microrenewables and that in addition to grant-based investment there is also scope for government to support the development of new financial products which would allow homeowners to use the equity in their property to install microrenewable technology without upfront costs or regular loan repayments, the sum being repaid only when the property is sold; recognises the work being done by Kirklees Council in the north of England to develop the RE-Charge scheme which works in this way, and considers that the Scottish Government should learn from such innovative approaches and follow this example."
