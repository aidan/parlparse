*S2M-2736.1 Miss Annabel Goldie: Supporting Safer, Stronger Communities: Reform of Scotland’s Criminal Justice Services—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2736) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from first "believes" to end and insert "notes the unacceptable rate of reoffending occurring in Scotland today; accepts that there is a place in our criminal justice system for a range of different sentencing options to address this problem but recognises that, when a prison sentence is the appropriate disposal, then prison is not simply a punishment but is intended to rehabilitate, deter and protect the public; believes that the way to reduce reoffending and subsequently the prison population is to reduce the overall incidence of crime in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the police presence in our communities to deter and detect crime and to end automatic early release from our prisons to ensure honesty in sentencing."
