 *S1M-2509 Michael Russell: Ministerial Responsibility for Education and Schoolsâ€”That the Parliament notes that the principal day-to-day responsibility for education and schools now lies with the Deputy Minister for Education and Young People and not with the Minister for Education and Young People; regrets that this change in responsibilities was not announced to the Parliament before the vote on the appointment of Ministers, which is contrary to the principles of openness and accountability on which the Parliament was founded; expresses concern that there will now be no Minister in the Cabinet who has hands-on responsibility for the major devolved area of responsibility that covers schools and the investment that education of young people makes in our society, and calls on the First Minister to bring this issue to the Parliament for full debate.
