*S2M-5508 Frances Curran: James Watt College—That the Parliament notes the Further Education Development Directorate’s confidential report which reportedly uncovered financial mismanagement, poor governance, a "blame culture" and "overspending" by senior managers at James Watt College; regrets that this report has remained confidential and calls for it to be made public so that the staff and students of the college can have an insight into the origins of the college’s current problems, and considers that, in the interests of transparency at our further education institutions and accountability of their managers, a public inquiry into the situation at James Watt College should be held. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Campbell Martin*, Rosie Kane*
