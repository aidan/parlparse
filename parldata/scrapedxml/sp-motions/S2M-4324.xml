*S2M-4324 Rob Gibson: Replacement Theme Tune for BBC World Cup Football Coverage—That the Parliament calls on the BBC to commission new music to introduce their coverage of the 2006 World Cup football tournament in Germany; calls for the rejection of their recently announced choice, "Sports Prepare", which is adapted from "See the Conquering Hero Comes", a hymn in praise of the Duke of Cumberland, the victor at Culloden; notes that its composer, George Frederick Handel, included it in his oratorio, "Judas Maccabaeus", celebrating the Hanoverian victory over the Jacobites in the rising of 1745-46 which was followed by Cumberland’s repression of the Highlanders, backed by his government, that nearly destroyed Gaelic society, language and customs and included near genocide in some areas along with the infliction of indiscriminate punishment against Hanoverian as well as Jacobite clanspeople, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to remind the BBC that in a multicultural age appropriate music for world cup football coverage should not engender memories of oppression and destruction of Gaelic Scotland which is only recovering in our times.
