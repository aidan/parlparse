*S3M-4099 Kenneth Gibson: Lifetime Homes Standard—That the Parliament supports the Lifetime Homes Standard, a set of 16 design criteria intended to make homes more accessible and functional for all; recognises the social responsibility to promote equality and inclusion and believes that this can be accomplished through assisting an ever-increasing number of Scots in maintaining independent living; seeks a future housing supply that is responsive to everyone’s potential needs and economic sustainability by empowering the more vulnerable and excluded members of our communities to remain economically active; acknowledges the need for sufficient lead time so that industry and government can make adjustments in the most economic way; welcomes the work of the British Standards Institution, which has been clarifying standards to ensure future consistency, and also seeks consultation and cooperation from key builders and encourages them to implement these standards and help meet the housing challenges of an aging society.
