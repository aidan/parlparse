 *S3M-2929 Patrick Harvie: The Arches - Best Bar None—That the Parliament congratulates the staff and management of the Arches arts venue and nightclub in Glasgow on their gold award in the nightclub category at Glasgow’s Best Bar None Awards 2008; recognises the hard work and commitment that the Arches staff have shown in achieving an excellent standard in protection of children from harm, prevention of crime and disorder, prevention of public nuisance and promotion of public health and public safety, standards that many Glasgow venues would do well to emulate; believes that this well deserved award reinforces the position of the Arches as a vital part of Glasgow’s arts and social scene; believes that Glasgow, and in particular Glasgow City Council, should be proud of a venue that not only adds to the vibrancy of the city’s social life but also takes its responsibilities as a licensed venue so seriously, and offers the very best wishes to all at the Arches in the coming months as they look forward to festive celebrations. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Aileen Campbell*, Gil Paterson*, Stuart McMillan*
