 *S2M-2823# Christine Grahame: Dungavel’s Children—That the Parliament notes with concern the report on an unannounced inspection of Dungavel House immigration removal centre on 14 to 16 December 2004, in particular "that there was still no independent assessment or review of the welfare, educational and developmental needs of children and agreed procedures for their detention were not being followed" and two main recommendations that "agreed procedures for the detention of children, at sufficiently senior level, recording full consideration of all factors, should be adhered to" and "the detention of children should be exceptional and for the shortest possible period. Within a matter of days, there should be an independent assessment of the welfare, educational and developmental needs of each child held in detention to inform decisions about the necessity of continued detention. This should be repeated at regular intervals to advise on the compatibility of detention with the welfare of the child and to inform reviews of detention."; further notes that this is against the background that six children subject to investigation by the reporter to the children’s panel were deported before investigations had been concluded, and believes that the Scottish Executive should address the issues of the welfare of children detained in Dungavel as a matter of priority.
