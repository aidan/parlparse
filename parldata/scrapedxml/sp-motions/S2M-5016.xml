*S2M-5016 Elaine Smith: Solidarity with MacKinnon of Scotland Employees—That the Parliament sends a message of solidarity and support to striking workers at the MacKinnon of Scotland factory in Coatbridge who are now in their fifth week of industrial action; acknowledges that these low-paid workers, the majority of whom are women, are demanding only a 2.5% increase on their salaries which, in a number of instances, currently fall below the minimum wage; acknowledges that this request comes following 10 years of regular wage freezes for these workers; conveys concern that, while a rise of 2.5% has been guaranteed to 3,000 non-unionised retail employees, MacKinnon has suggested that it cannot afford a similar increase for 130 manufacturing workers in Coatbridge; expresses alarm at the behaviour demonstrated by management at Mackinnon which has refused to engage with Community union representatives and have attempted to instigate disciplinary and legal action against some employees; acknowledges that such action is entirely unacceptable; believes that it is a source of shame for Mackinnon of Scotland that, whilst the garments that these workers make grace the wardrobes of the world’s elite, including the European Ryder Cup Team, employees in Coatbridge are being denied the most meagre of wage rises, and urges the company to rethink its current stance and engage responsibly and positively with union representatives.
