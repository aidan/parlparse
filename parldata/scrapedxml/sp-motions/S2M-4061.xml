 *S2M-4061 Sarah Boyack: Nuclear Power in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Sustainable Development Commission’s nuclear review which evaluates the contribution of nuclear power in a low carbon economy; acknowledges the survey for BBC Scotland’s Energy Week which found that more than 52% of people prefer renewable energy resources and 51% oppose nuclear power stations being built in Scotland; notes the Scottish Executive’s current position that there will be no support for the further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved; believes that underground, retrievable, monitored storage is not a long-term or sustainable solution for nuclear waste; supports the conclusion that nuclear power is not the answer to tackling climate change or security of supply, and urges the maximum use of energy efficiency measures, alongside renewable energy and micro-generation capacity, to meet the energy needs of people in Scotland.
