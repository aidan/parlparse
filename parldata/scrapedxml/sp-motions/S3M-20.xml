 *S3M-20 Mike Rumbles: Improving Local Health Care—That the Parliament recognises the importance of excellent health care services in communities across Scotland, allowing front-line professionals from hospitals, other health disciplines, social work and the voluntary sector to work together to plan and deliver more flexible services; notes that community health centres give support to the work of local GPs and allow more people, particularly elderly people and those with chronic illnesses, to be treated closer to home; believes that investment in more local health care can deliver faster diagnosis and treatment for patients; notes that over 90% of health care is now delivered locally and that people across Scotland are already benefiting from investment in local health care facilities; considers that the time is right for a step change in investment to deliver quality local health facilities, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use the next spending review to identify funding and give priority to the development of 100 new local health centres. Supported by: Tavish Scott*, Jim Hume*, Jim Tolson*, Alison McInnes*, Liam McArthur*, Margaret Smith*, Jeremy Purvis*, Ross Finnie*, Iain Smith*, Mike Pringle*, John Farquhar Munro*, Robert Brown*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Nicol Stephen*, Hugh O’Donnell*
