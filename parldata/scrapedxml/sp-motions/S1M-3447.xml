 *S1M-3447# Ms Sandra White: Inquiry Into Glasgow Housing Stock Transfer—That the Parliament notes that, since the ballot to transfer Glasgow’s housing stock, the entire process has been fraught with lengthy delays and constant changes to the business plan and that significant sums of money have been spent on consultants rather than repairing homes in Glasgow for over two years; further notes with concern that, in this period, many Glasgow tenants have had minimal repairs carried out and continue to live in houses in serious disrepair, that the timetable for carrying out repairs given to tenants prior to the ballot is now unachievable and that consultants report that the financial costs of the scheme have been seriously underestimated; recognises that a crisis of tenant participation in local housing associations has developed, totally undermining the supposed central objective of the transfer process, namely improved tenant involvement and participation in managing housing stock; further recognises that recent events conclusively prove that the large scale housing stock transfer model is an expensive and complex mechanism for improving housing stock; believes that the Scottish Executive should recognise that the promises made to tenants prior to the ballot have not been carried out, with Glasgow tenants still suffering from sub-standard housing, and considers that the Executive should urgently hold a full inquiry into this gross misuse of public money.
