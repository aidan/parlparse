 * S2M-2637 Christine Grahame: Grub Log—That the Parliament notes the comments of Euan Robson, Deputy Minister for Education and Young People, on BBC Newsnight Scotland on 21 March 2005 regarding the lack of data on the impact of the Scottish Executive’s healthy eating initiative; notes the rise in children’s obesity from 9% at P1 to 18% at P7, and therefore urges the Executive to produce and circulate an e-questionnaire to pupils in all our schools, along the lines of Jamie Oliver’s “grub log”, as a snapshot into the actual eating habits of both primary and secondary pupils as a first step in closing the data gap.
