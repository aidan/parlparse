 *S2M-116# Brian Adam: Aberdeen Council Housing Debt Write-Offâ€”That the Parliament notes the Treasury-led write-off of Glasgow City Council's housing debt; regrets the linking of that action to the wholesale transfer of the council's housing stock; applauds the overwhelming rejection of such a wholesale stock transfer by Aberdeen City Council's tenants, and expects that a similar debt write-off will be made to benefit Aberdeen City Council's housing tenants and to allow the council to invest more in its stock.
