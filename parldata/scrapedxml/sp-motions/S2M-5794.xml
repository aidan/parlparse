*S2M-5794 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Launch of Prostate Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the new charity, Prostate Scotland; recognises that prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in Scotland, after lung cancer, that it is the third most common cancer cause of death in the country, that incidence rates increase with age and have risen by 9.5% in the last 10 years in Scotland, that between 1998 and 2002 10,527 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in Scotland and that between 2000 and 2004 3,913 men died of prostate cancer in Scotland; is concerned the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2016 and 2020 is predicted to rise to more than 15,000, which would mark a 50% increase over a period of 20 years; is further concerned that there is a clear lack of awareness about the function of the prostate and its importance, the problems that can arise and what can be done to diagnose and prostate these conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with organisations and charities like Prostate Scotland to change attitudes and behaviours regarding men’s health, diet and lifestyle choices, to help challenge the lack of openness about men’s health issues, their reluctance to seek regular health checks and the lack of understanding over the risks associated with problems of the prostate and so improve education, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment.
