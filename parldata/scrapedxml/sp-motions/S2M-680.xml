 *S2M-680 Patrick Harvie: M74 Public Local Inquiry-That the Parliament recognises and agrees that the answer to question S2F-383 by the First Minister on 27 November 2003 concerning the M74 motorway extension clearly gives an appearance of bias; believes that the Scottish Executive has conflicting roles in the decision-making process; further believes that the public local inquiry under way from 1 December 2003 has now been compromised such that under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights the objectors are entitled to hold the view that the appeal process does not provide them with a fair and impartial hearing, and considers that the inquiry should be abandoned until such time as a process can be put in place that complies with Article 6.
