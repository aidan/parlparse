 *S3M-5289 Jim Hume: Community Hospitals in Dumfries and Galloway—That the Parliament notes the contents of NHS Dumfries and Galloway’s consultation document, Your NHS - Your Future Care; believes that the preferred option, which would result in the closure of Moffat, Langholm, Kirkcudbright, Lochmaben and Thornhill community hospitals, is widely unpopular with the respective local communities and fundamentally disregards the rural remoteness of parts of the region and the invaluable and high quality of care provided by these facilities; further believes that NHS Dumfries and Galloway must take advantage of opportunities to redevelop hospitals in conjunction with other statutory bodies, private providers and voluntary organisations where necessary, and considers that the Scottish Government should reject NHS Dumfries and Galloway’s preferred option for closures and, instead, require redesign of the proposals to redevelop these vital, locally delivered community NHS services.
