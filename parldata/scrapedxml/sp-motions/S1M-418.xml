*S1M-418 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Suicide—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the death of 874 Scots by their own hand in 1998; is aware that since 1984 the proportion of male Scots aged 35 or under whose deaths can be attributed to suicide has increased from one in nine to one in four, and for females from one in twenty to one in seven in the same age category, making suicide the most common cause of death in young Scots; recognises that in Scotland the suicide rate for males and females of all age groups is 32 and 10 respectively per 100,000 and increasing, whereas in England it is 18 and 6 per 100,000 and decreasing; believes the reasons for suicide to be complex, multi-functional and poorly understood and calls upon the Scottish Executive to commission, at the earliest date possible, wide ranging, comprehensive research into the issue of suicide, analysing what makes people take their own lives, why the suicide rate in Scotland is increasing, why particular groups in society are more vulnerable than others, how other countries prevent suicide, and introducing an early warning system of diagnosis and intervention.

S1M-418# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Suicide—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the death of 874 Scots by their own hand in 1998; is aware that since 1984 the proportion of male Scots aged 35 or under whose deaths can be attributed to suicide has increased from one in nine to one in four, and for females from one in twenty to one in seven in the same age category, making suicide the most common cause of death in young Scots; recognises that in Scotland the suicide rate for males and females of all age groups is 32 and 10 respectively per 100,000 and increasing, whereas in England it is 18 and 6 per 100,000 and decreasing; believes the reasons for suicide to be complex, multi-functional and poorly understood, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to commission, at the earliest date possible, wide ranging, comprehensive research into the issue of suicide, analysing what makes people take their own lives, why the suicide rate in Scotland is increasing, why particular groups in society are more vulnerable than others, how other countries prevent suicide, and introducing an early warning system of diagnosis and intervention.
