*S3M-7414 Patrick Harvie: Human Rights Abuses in Gambia—That the Parliament condemns the reported catalogue of human rights abuses taking place in Gambia, which, according to Amnesty International, include torture, secret detention, lack of fair trials and the disappearance of many people including journalists, civilians and politicians; highlights the case of missing journalist Ebrima Manneh who disappeared after allegedly attempting to publish an article criticising the Gambian Government for violations of human rights; expresses solidarity with the people of Gambia in facing these reported abuses and who are now living in what it sees as a culture of silence; particularly supports those Gambians who are resident in Scotland but who might feel unable to speak out about the situation in their country for fear of the consequences, and urges the UK and Scottish governments to ensure that international pressure is put on the Gambian Government in defence of human rights. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, David McLetchie*, Patricia Ferguson*, Robin Harper*, Sandra White*, Gil Paterson*, Bill Wilson*, Aileen Campbell*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Bill Kidd*, John Wilson*
