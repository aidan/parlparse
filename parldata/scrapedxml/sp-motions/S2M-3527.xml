*S2M-3527 Tommy Sheridan: Condemnation of Attacks on Firefighters—That the Parliament utterly condemns the reprehensible attacks on firefighters in Rutherglen, Hamilton, Castlemilk and elsewhere over the Guy Fawkes weekend; believes that that these workers deserve the support of the whole community so that they can go about their life-saving work without being needlessly endangered, and calls on the Scottish Executive to launch an intensive media and education campaign in support of the vital work carried out by firefighters and condemning the actions of the mindless minority who attack them.
