 *S2M-3037 Robin Harper: Friends of the Forth Funding Shortfall—That the Parliament notes the excellent work done by Forth Estuary Forum to raise awareness of the issue of coastal litter, remove litter and identify the sources of litter in the Forth through the highly successful Coastal Litter Campaign which ended after three years in 2004; recognises that the follow-on project, Friends of the Forth, will continue to work on the Coastal Litter Campaign; notes that funding for the Forum is time-limited and expires shortly and that there is a shortfall of £5,000 to start the project and draw on financial support already offered, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide funding to enable this new project to commence.
