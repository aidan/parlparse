 *S2M-4239 Colin Fox: Breakdown in University Pay Negotiations—That the Parliament notes the breakdown in pay negotiations between university principals and the Association of University Teachers (AUT); notes that the average salary of a university principal is now around £195,000 per annum and has risen by 23% in the last three years; believes, therefore, that the principals are in no position to deny AUT members a living wage or to fail to recognise the very valuable role that university teachers play in developing Scotland’s knowledge economy, and hopes that principals will appreciate the need for an agreement to be reached before the 27 April 2006 deadline so that no students go without their degree as a consequence of the exams boycott and the failure of management to recognise the reasonable demands of their workforce.
