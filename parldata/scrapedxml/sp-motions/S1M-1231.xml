*S1M-1231 Mr Kenneth Gibson: The Possible Extinction of the Great Apes-That the Parliament notes with alarm the continued destruction of humankind's closest relatives, the four species of great apes, the bonobo, chimpanzee, gorilla and orang-utan; notes that bonobo numbers alone have halved to 10,000 in only two years, bonobo sharing 98.4% of its DNA with Homo sapiens sapiens; notes that while chimpanzee numbers have plummeted from over two million to less than 180,000 in four decades, three of the five sub-species of gorilla, the Cross River, Bwindi and mountain, number only an estimated 150, 290 and 320 respectively and the two orang-utan sub-species 15,000 in total; is concerned that continued habitat destruction through deforestation, hunting for bushmeat and the pet trade, catching human diseases and fragmentation of habitat into small unsustainable areas could lead to extinction of all twelve sub-species of great ape within a generation; supports the 34 organisations of the Ape Alliance in their attempts to save the great apes, and seeks support from the Scottish Executive in calls upon Her Majesty's Government to increase conservation funding to poor countries, to assess aid projects to ensure they do not harm wildlife and to phase out the import of tropical timber not harvested in an environmentally friendly manner.
