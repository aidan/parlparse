*S2M-509# Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses' Dispute Still Unresolved-That the Parliament notes the persistent refusal by COSLA to conduct meaningful negotiations with UNISON to resolve the nursery nurses' dispute; recognises that recruitment and retention difficulties will be exacerbated without an acceptable solution and that differences in pay grades and career structure across authorities will lead to local authorities competing with each other for staff, undermining continuity of education for children; further recognises the need for an agreed national settlement binding on local authorities that meets the moderate demands of nursery nurses, and considers that the Scottish Executive should intervene, albeit belatedly, to secure settlement of the dispute.
