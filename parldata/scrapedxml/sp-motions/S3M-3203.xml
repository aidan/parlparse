 *S3M-3203 Margaret Mitchell: Lifeline Tubes Service—That the Parliament acknowledges the successful completion of the Lifeline Tubes service pilot in Cumbernauld, as part of the Living Well in North Lanarkshire project; congratulates NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council on the introduction of this innovative voluntary scheme, designed for anyone who feels vulnerable when living alone; notes that plastic tubes, containing vital details of any illness or allergy, medication taken and emergency contacts are distributed then stored in the individual’s refrigerator hence providing emergency services with potentially life-saving information in the event of the individual suffering a sudden illness or personal accident, and welcomes the extension of this service throughout North Lanarkshire.
