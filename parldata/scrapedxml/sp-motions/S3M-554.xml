 *S3M-554 John Scott: Temporary Relaxation of Drivers’ Hours—That the Parliament notes with mounting concern the large number of animals confined to Scotland’s hill farms as a result of the foot-and-mouth crisis; also notes the UK Government’s refusal to permit a temporary relaxation of drivers’ hours regulations so as to allow the transport of livestock; further notes the Scottish Government’s efforts to persuade the UK Government to reverse this decision, and, in light of the escalating animal welfare and economic crisis that has arisen, calls on the UK Government to allow an immediate relaxation of the drivers’ hour regulations.
