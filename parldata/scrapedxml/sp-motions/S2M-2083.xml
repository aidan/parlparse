*S2M-2083 Brian Adam: Gaelic and Scots Translations of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe—That the Parliament notes that Article IV-448, paragraph 2, of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe allows EU member states to translate the treaty into any of the languages of that Member State and that a certified copy of any such translation may thereafter be deposited in the archives of the European Council; further notes the commitments made to Scotland’s languages in the manifestos of the various political parties and in the Scottish Executive’s cultural strategy, as well as in the working practices of the Parliament; considers that the translation of the treaty into the Gaelic and Scots languages would be a symbolically important means of demonstrating a continued commitment to the long-term future of these important elements of Scottish culture; considers that any such translations should be made available prior to the proposed referendum on the treaty in order to allow voters to refer to the treaty in their chosen language, and accordingly calls on the Executive to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government with a view to having the translations completed.
