*S2M-2045 John Swinburne: Concessions for Senior Citizens at CIS League Cup Finalâ€”That the Parliament believes that the football clubs involved in the forthcoming CIS League Cup semi-final matches should review their pricing position, as set out to the Scottish Football League, of charging all spectators full price to attend these matches; calls for a concession for senior citizens to enable them to see their clubs play in all competitions, and believes, therefore, that all clubs should give greater consideration to those fans who have spent a lifetime supporting their teams.
