*S3M-758 Kenneth Gibson: State Visit of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia—That the Parliament deeply regrets the state visit accorded by the UK Government to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; recognises that this absolute monarchy has little respect for democracy and refuses to allow any form of religious freedom; abhors the human rights record of the Saudi regime which, among other appalling abuses, allows the beheading and stoning of women accused of adultery; is concerned and confused by the statement made by the UK Foreign Office Minister, Kim Howells MP, when he said that the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia have shared values, and urges the Scottish Government to seek clarification from the UK Government on what these shared values are.
