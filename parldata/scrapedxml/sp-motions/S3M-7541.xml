*S3M-7541 Aileen Campbell: Clydesdale Community Initiatives Recognised in 2010 SURF Awards—That the Parliament congratulates Clydesdale Community Initiatives (CCI) on being highly commended in the Health and Employability Partnership category at the 2010 SURF Awards, organised by Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum (SURF), which is Scotland’s independent regeneration network, and supported by the Scottish Government; notes that the judges said that they were greatly impressed with the outstanding commitment of CCI in providing real health and employability support to its client group, who are largely volunteers with particular health and social care needs and mental health issues; notes that CCI was the only project based in solely the South of Scotland region to be shortlisted for an award, and wishes all the organisations involved in the awards process every success for the future.
