*S2M-1424# Mark Ballard: Full Freedom for Mordechai Vanunu-That the Parliament notes Mordechai Vanunu's interview with the BBC broadcast on BBC2 on Sunday 30 May 2004 in which he revealed that it was his intention to save Israel from a nuclear holocaust by blowing the whistle on the country's nuclear programme; recognises that Mr Vanunu's decision to inform the world of Israel's nuclear weapons programme was an act of bravery providing much needed transparency to the international community; condemns Israel's lengthy imprisonment of Mr Vanunu and the harsh restrictions imposed on him after his release, including restrictions against his right to travel and his right to speak to foreign nationals; supports Mr Vanunu's petition to the Israeli High Court of Justice on Thursday 3 June 2004 appealing against the restrictions imposed after his release, and believes that all weapons of mass destruction are an obstacle to peace and that there should be moves to decommission them. Supported by: Eleanor Scott*, Robin Harper*
