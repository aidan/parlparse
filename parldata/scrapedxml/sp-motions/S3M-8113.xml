 *S3M-8113 David Stewart: Insulin Pumps—That the Parliament regrets the loss of potential savings opportunities of £278,000 in the procurement of insulin pumps through what appears to be mainland NHS boards, excluding Ayrshire and Arran, disregarding the guidance of NHS National Services Scotland’s National Procurement Division’s guidance on the preferred ranked supplier; considers that the division undertook an extensive technical and clinical assessment of the pumps prior to ranking preferred suppliers; calls for an explanation of why the mainland NHS boards seem to have failed to follow procurement guidance; urges the Scottish Executive to strengthen the requirement of NHS boards to follow national procurement guidance; is of the view that the Scottish Diabetes Action Plan sets out too modest targets for widening access to insulin pump therapy and understands that several boards have predicated their plans to widen access on expected procurement savings; believes that those NHS boards failing to follow procurement guidance have denied pumps to people on waiting lists because expected savings did not materialise; is concerned about what it believes to be the deteriorating position on widening access to pump therapy for adults in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area and calls on NHS Highland to reconsider its decision not to introduce a paediatric pump service; considers that Scotland has the second highest prevalence of type 1 diabetes in Europe but the lowest pump provision, and urges the Scottish Executive to challenge NHS boards to improve their record on widening access to insulin pump provision.
