*S2M-749 Mike Pringle: Hearts FC Relocation from Tynecastle Stadium-That the Parliament notes the Heart of Midlothian Football Club board's intention to move from Tynecastle at the end of this season, set out in its document Tynecastle Stadium: Not Fit for the Purpose; further notes that two stated reasons for moving are UEFA restrictions on pitch size and planning restrictions on rebuilding the McLeod Street stand; further notes previous comments of the Scottish Football Association and UEFA that at present no one can state categorically that Tynecastle will be banned from hosting UEFA matches; agrees with the Federation of Hearts Supporters that a move from Tynecastle may be necessary if planning restrictions will prevent redevelopment of the McLeod Street stand; believes, nonetheless, that the Hearts FC board must actually prove and not merely predict that this is the case; believes that football clubs help sustain the community in which they are rooted and therefore welcomes the intention of Hibernian FC to remain at Easter Road, and calls on the Hearts FC board to pursue the option of remaining at Tynecastle in a transparent manner and to view the option of a move to Murrayfield or other venue only as a last resort.
