*S2M-3684 Mr Andy Kerr: Future Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area—That the Parliament supports the decisive action announced by the Scottish Executive on 19 May 2005 to dissolve Argyll and Clyde NHS Board and to redraw the boundaries of the neighbouring boards to take over its responsibilities from April 2006; believes that these steps will address the board’s structural and financial problems; applauds the continued successful efforts of staff in NHS Argyll and Clyde to maintain comprehensive healthcare services for the people of the area; notes that a full public consultation has been held on the boundary option to be adopted, and supports NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow in their task of returning services to financial balance while maintaining high standards of quality and access.
