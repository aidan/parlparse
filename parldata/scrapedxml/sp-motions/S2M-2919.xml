 * S2M-2919 Shona Robison: Abolition of Prescription Charges for Chronic Conditions—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to review the list of long-term medical conditions exempt from prescription charges; notes that many long-term conditions, such as asthma, arthritis, cancer, heart disease, dyspraxia, Aspergers syndrome, schizophrenia, eczema, psoriasis, rheumatology, incontinence, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and stroke, are not exempt from prescription charging; notes with concern the impact that charging for prescriptions has on those with long-term conditions where essential treatment may be at risk because people are unable to meet the cost of prescriptions, and urges the Executive to prioritise exempting all long-term medical conditions from the cost of prescription charges.
