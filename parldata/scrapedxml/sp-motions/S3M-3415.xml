 *S3M-3415 Ian McKee: European Parliament Elections 2009—That the Parliament expresses concern that a recent Eurobarometer poll commissioned by the European Parliament that surveyed 27,000 people across the 27 EU Member States, found that only 26% of respondents were aware that European Parliament elections are taking place in June 2009; notes that Scotland has a poor record of voter turnout at European Parliament elections, often reaching just above 30%; further notes that the European Parliament has direct and indirect legislative competence in a substantial range of policy areas, including chemical safety, the environment and food and agriculture, which have a major impact on Scottish citizens; urges the Electoral Commission to intensify its 2009 campaign to ensure that Scotland’s citizens are aware of the upcoming elections and are given sufficient information on voting methods, and encourages all candidates to the European Parliament, including currently elected MEPs, to raise the profile of the elections and encourage voter participation. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Kenneth Gibson*, Sandra White*, Bill Kidd*, Bob Doris* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
