 *S3M-2427 Keith Brown: The SSPCA’s New National Wildlife Rescue Centre—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) that it intends to open a new national wildlife rescue centre at Castleton Farm, by Dollar, in Clackmannanshire; notes the massive expansion in capacity and amenity this site offers beyond the SSPCA’s current centre, which has nonetheless become an international centre of excellence in its field; recognises the confidence in Clackmannanshire shown by a high-profile national organisation choosing to locate there, and, above all, congratulates the SSPCA on its tireless commitment to working for ever higher standards of animal welfare in Scotland.
