*S3M-2175 Christine Grahame: Stepping Out—That the Parliament welcomes the theme of Stepping Out on  National Falls Awareness Day UK, being launched by Help the Aged in Scotland on 24 June 2008; acknowledges the important work being done at national and local levels to prevent falls; notes the serious physical and psychological impact that falls can have, especially on older people, and that falls represent the most frequent and serious type of accident for adults aged over 65 years, as well as a high cost to the NHS with hospital stays related to hip fractures costing around £5,000 per fracture; expresses concern that following a fall an older person has a 50% probability of having their mobility seriously impaired and a 10% probability of dying within a year, and urges all local authorities as a priority to identify and repair dangerous pavements to reduce the risk of falls.
