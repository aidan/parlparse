*S1M-2141 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Scottish Parliament Police Unit—That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to reimburse Lothian and Borders Police for the full annual cost of running the Scottish Parliament Police Unit, instead of the current 39 week basis of reimbursement which will result in a funding deficit of £111,436 in the current financial year, as the costs of policing the Parliament should be borne centrally and not at the expense of one region of the country.
