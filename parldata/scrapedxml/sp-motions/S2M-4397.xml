*S2M-4397 Maureen Macmillan: Christian Aid Week, 14 to 20 May 2006—That the Parliament commends the work undertaken by Christian Aid which works in partnership with local organisations in more than 50 countries worldwide, helping people and tackling the causes of poverty and injustice; notes that Christian Aid Week takes place from 14 to 20 May 2006 when fundraising events will be taking place across the United Kingdom and Ireland to raise awareness and help those in the world’s poorest countries; further notes this year’s "You add. We multiply" campaign where, working with the world’s poorest communities, Christian Aid invests in things that multiply and provide benefits for years to come, helping people to improve their own lives whatever their race or religion; notes the report produced by Christian Aid which predicts that climate change could directly cause the deaths of 182 million sub-Saharan Africans by the end of the century, and therefore calls for the United Kingdom to cut its carbon emissions and urges people to give generously to Christian Aid week by logging on to www.caweek.org.
