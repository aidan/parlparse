*S2M-372# Rosie Kane: Expansion of Dungavel Detention Centreâ€”That the Parliament condemns the plans by the Home Secretary to expand the Dungavel House immigration removal centre which fly in the face of the democratic will of the Scottish people, many of whom regard Dungavel as a prison for asylum seekers and their children and wish it to be closed down altogether; notes with alarm that Premier Security, the private company contracted to run Dungavel, must have been privy to these plans before democratically elected MSPs were informed of them; assumes, therefore, that Her Majesty's Government is not serious about devolution, and considers that the Scottish Executive should stand up to the government in Westminster and take charge of the situation with a view to closing down Dungavel at the earliest possible opportunity.
