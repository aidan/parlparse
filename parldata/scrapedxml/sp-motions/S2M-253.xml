 *S2M-253 Pauline McNeill: Communication Workers Union Campaign on Remote Sourcing of Call Centre Jobs-That the Parliament notes that the call centre industry now comprises a significant sector of the Scottish economy, that there are now over 50,000 jobs in the 250 call centres in Scotland and that 17,000 of these jobs are located in Glasgow alone; is therefore concerned at the threat to over 1,000 jobs in Glasgow by British Telecom's outsourcing of 2,000 call centre jobs from across the United Kingdom to Bangalore and New Delhi in India; considers that there is now a significant risk to jobs in the industry in Scotland from further remote sourcing by call centre operators following the example of British Telecom; notes that the Call Centre Association assesses the labour cost of English-speaking IT-literate graduates in India at 10-15% of their European counterparts, and calls on British Telecom and other call centre operators to invest in their high quality workforce in Scotland and on the Scottish Executive to continue to work through Scottish Development International to promote Scotland as a quality location for value-added high-skill call centres and protect existing call centre jobs.
