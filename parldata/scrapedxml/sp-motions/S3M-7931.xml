 *S3M-7931 Kenneth Gibson: Government Cuts to Families with Babies—That the Parliament condemns any UK Government cuts that target families with new babies; recognises the importance of grants in helping to support struggling young families and believes that cuts should not be inflicted on those who can least afford them; understands that, according to the Family and Parenting Institute, there will be a total loss of £775.3 million to the families of 790,000 babies born each year; notes that, by 2013-14, another £1.3 billion of support will be lost due to the impact of the three-year freeze in child benefits; understands that an additional 205,000 people with children who work less than 24 hours per week, stand to lose up to £3,810 per year each; further believes that parents who are seeking a divorce should not have to pay the fee proposed by the UK Government to sort out child arrangements and that this plan might create situations where people become trapped in abusive relationships, and considers that it is unacceptable for families with new babies to take on the burden of decreasing the UK deficit brought about by what it considers as the economic incompetence and financial mismanagement of the previous UK Labour administration.
