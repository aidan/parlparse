 *S3M-7196 Alasdair Allan: Islands Fuel Duty Reduction—That the Parliament urges the UK Government to press ahead with talks with the European Commission on introducing a five pence reduction in fuel duty for the inner and outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland; considers that this move by the UK Government comes following a prolonged campaign by many people in these communities, which have some of the highest fuel prices in the world, and believes that such a measure is long overdue and would be of direct benefit to thousands of people in Scotland’s remotest communities who it considers are currently being penalised by high fuel prices.
