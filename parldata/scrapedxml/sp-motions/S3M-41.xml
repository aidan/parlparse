*S3M-41 Hugh O’Donnell: Affordable Housing—That the Parliament notes the steps taken by the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive in delivering record investment into affordable housing, including the building of 21,500 affordable homes to rent or buy by 2008; however acknowledges the need for increased investment in building affordable homes, and calls on the Executive to recognise the recent Shelter survey that shows that eight out of 10 people living in Scotland think that affordable rented housing is in short supply and to make a commitment to building at least an additional 27,000 affordable homes over the period of the next spending review.
