*S3M-7080 Rob Gibson: Celebrate 80% Clean Energy—That the Parliament welcomes findings from an independent study commissioned by Renewable Scotland that suggest that Scotland’s renewable energy output in the next 10 years could rise to 80%; notes what it considers to be the great potential of Scottish renewable output and echoes the calls contained in the report for investment on a massive scale in the industry and for it to have maximum support from all levels of government, and calls on the UK Government to end what are believed to be the discriminatory transmission charges and release the Scottish fossil levy funds to the Scottish Government which, it believes, will allow the renewable sector in Scotland to grow further and flourish.
