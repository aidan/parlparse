*S2M-2543# Ms Sandra White: Scotland’s Depopulation Crisis—That the Parliament notes the growing crisis of depopulation that Scotland is facing with more and more young Scots choosing to relocate to countries abroad which offer better economic and social benefits than is the case at home; expresses disappointment that Scottish ministers do not appear to have any contingency plans in place in the event of all-out failure of the Fresh Talent initiative; notes further that the far-right immigration policies being developed by both Conservative and Labour parties at UK level will further exacerbate Scotland’s population crisis; notes the comments of First Minister, Jack McConnell, that the high levels of outward migration have only been a factor in Scotland for two centuries, and under union with England; believes that members of the Parliament should consider all of the potential options on offer which would retain our existing youth potential whilst attracting growing numbers of foreign workers to Scotland, and notes that the annual targets set by ministers for attracting fresh talent to Scotland are hopelessly low and that independent opinion has stated as a matter of public record that Scotland needs somewhere in the region of 60,000-plus new workers settling in the country in order to ensure we have a sustainable public service infrastructure and growing private business sector in the years to come.
