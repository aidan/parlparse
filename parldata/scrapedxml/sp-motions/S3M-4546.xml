S3M-4546 Bill Kidd: Former Labour Defence Minister Calls for Trident to be Axed—That the Parliament welcomes the report for the national security commission by Lord Guthrie, former chief of the defence staff, Lord Ashdown, former head of the Liberal Democrats, and Lord Robertson, the former Nato Secretary-General calling for the new Trident nuclear deterrent system to be axed; further notes the comments, which seem to lay bare the internal disagreements within the Labour party over Trident, by the former Defence Secretary Des Browne that the Ministry of Defence was facing tough financial decisions and that there is an order book that outstrips the department’s capacity to pay for it was no secret, and believes that Gordon Brown’s apparent addiction to debt and David Cameron’s apparent intention to treat the will of the Scottish people and its Parliament with contempt ill-serves the Scottish people who would be better served by measured debate than political grandstanding.
