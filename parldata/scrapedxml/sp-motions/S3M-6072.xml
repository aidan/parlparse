*S3M-6072 John Park: Carbon Capture and Storage at Longannet—That the Parliament welcomes news that Longannet Power Station has been selected as one of the final bids in the UK Government’s carbon capture and storage competition; congratulates the Scottish Power-led Carbon Capture and Storage Consortium on getting through to the final stage of funding, sharing a £90 million UK Government fund with e-on to finance design and development studies; hopes that Longannet is successful as one of the two contenders for a possible further award of a £1 billion subsidy in 2011; considers supporting the development of carbon capture and storage important in delivering the low-carbon energy of the future; understands that some estimates, including that of WWF, suggest that the successful demonstration of this technology at Longannet could result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of over 14 million tonnes by 2025; further welcomes the prospects for a new industry that this announcement affords, including an estimated 10,000 jobs over the next 10 to 15 years, and looks forward to Scotland leading the way in delivering clean coal technology.
