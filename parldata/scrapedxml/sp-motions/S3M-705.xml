*S3M-705 Bill Wilson: ASH Scotland Annual Report: Relationship Between Health and Wealth Inequalities—That the Parliament notes the ASH Scotland Annual Report for 2006-07, particularly the statement it contains that the disparity in smoking rates between the most affluent and the poorest communities points to a growing health inequalities gap in Scotland, and congratulates ASH on its resolution to ensure that inequality-focused work will remain its priority and also remains on the Scottish Government’s health agenda.
