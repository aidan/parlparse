 * S2M-3077 Bristow Muldoon: Congratulations to West Lothian Council—That the Parliament welcomes the latest Accounts Commission report on West Lothian Council which recognises the good practice, clear strategic vision and strong commitment to improvement in the local authority under the excellent leadership of Labour’s council leader, Graeme Morrice; notes the first-rate work of the professional officers at the local authority in securing such a positive report; further notes that West Lothian Council has had to contend with the pressures of a fast-growing population but that, through a culture of improvement and strong leadership, the local authority has responded to the changes positively, and acknowledges that West Lothian Council is widely recognised as one of the best local authorities, not just in Scotland but in the United Kingdom.
