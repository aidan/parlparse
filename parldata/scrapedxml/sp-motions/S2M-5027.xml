*S2M-5027 Christine May: Scotland’s Historical Places and Artefacts—That the Parliament recognises the support given by the Scottish Executive to conserve Scotland’s heritage; believes that a knowledge of the buildings, monuments, historic sites and ancient artefacts in Scotland contributes to our knowledge of ourselves as a nation; welcomes the recent announcements on funding to protect ancient battlefields and historic buildings and to support local projects; further welcomes the statutory protection given to listed buildings and ancient monuments; considers that the voluntary register of historic sites maintained by most local authorities is a welcome source of information on Scotland’s history and peoples; congratulates the Council for Scottish Archaeology and national, local authority and community historical, archaeological and museum groups which work tirelessly to research, identify and conserve places such as the henge at Balfarg in Glenrothes and the Bronze Age burial cist at Sillerhole in Leven and display artefacts in both national and local museums such as Lower Methil Heritage Centre; believes that opportunities exist to give further protection through legislative measures; welcomes the offer by the Deputy Minister for Communities to discuss such opportunities in the context of the current planning Bill, and believes that all MSPs and ministers should consider what further support can be given to protect Scotland’s historical places and artefacts.
