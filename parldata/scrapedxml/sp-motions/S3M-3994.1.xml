 *S3M-3994.1 Jamie McGrigor: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3994) in the name of Alex Neil, leave out from "10 years" to end and insert "30 years; urges the Scottish Government to engage proactively with the 26 local authorities yet to transfer their housing stock with a view to effecting stock transfers to community-based housing associations with the consent of the tenants of these homes, thus achieving the write-off of Scotland’s estimated £2 billion housing debt and facilitating further investment in affordable housing in Scotland, and rejects the further restrictions on the right to buy proposed in the draft Housing (Scotland) Bill as being unfair and failing to meet the aspirations of many of today’s tenants."
