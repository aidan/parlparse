 *S2M-5782 Jackie Baillie: Hermitage Academy Sprinkler System—That the Parliament expresses disappointment with Argyll and Bute Council for not fitting a fire sprinkler system to the new Hermitage Academy; notes that sprinklers cost in the region of 1% of building costs and that this sum can be recouped in as little as four years through insurance discounts alone; recognises the vital role that such a system may play in both maintaining the fabric of the buildings and, more importantly, the lives of school pupils, and urges the council to think long term and reconsider its position regarding sprinkler systems in new public buildings.
