 *S3M-3866 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Destitution of Asylum Seekers—That the Parliament welcomes the report, 21 Days Later, by the Refugee Survival Trust and British Red Cross that explores the causes and extent of destitution among refugees and asylum claimants living in Scotland; notes that the Refugee Survival Trust is a charity that provides small grants to alleviate the destitution of asylum claimants and refugees who have no access to any other form of support; welcomes the report’s identification of operational issues that could be improved upon by the UK Border Agency to prevent the destitution of hundreds of people living in Scotland; notes the finding that devolving responsibilities to local teams, including to the UK Border Agency in Glasgow, has helped reduce problems with asylum support by improving communication and partnership working; expresses concern that since 2003 single adults and childless couples who have arrived in Scotland are unable to submit a claim for asylum in Scotland but have to make their own way to the Asylum Screening Unit in Liverpool; recognises that new arrivals often arrive with no money or support, are likely to be confused, disorientated and unfamiliar with the language and the system and are therefore particularly vulnerable to destitution, and supports the call for the UK Border Agency’s current limited screening facilities to be expanded to enable all new arrivals in Scotland to be able to submit their asylum claim both at port and in country.
