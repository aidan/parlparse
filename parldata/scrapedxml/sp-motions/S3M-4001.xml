*S3M-4001 Claire Baker: Wake-up Call for the Scottish Government—That the Parliament notes the open letter on student hardship sent to the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and signed by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat MSPs, further and higher education spokespeople, Gurjit Singh, NUS president, and 25 other student leaders at colleges and universities across Scotland; highlights that the letter criticises the Scottish Government for its focus on reducing graduate debt to date, ignoring the growing student hardship crisis in Scottish colleges and universities; further highlights that the letter calls for the Scottish Government to take a new direction by focussing the existing resources for student support on reducing student hardship; considers that student support levels in Scotland have fallen far behind the rest of the United Kingdom, with a maximum of £4,510 for most Scottish students compared to a maximum of £6,200 for students from England; believes that the Scottish Government should use the open letter as a wake-up call to come forward with new priorities for the £30 million allocated to the student support budget next year to tackle student hardship, based on the principles of reaching a minimum income of £7,000 for the poorest students, increasing student loans and bursaries to address students’ continuing reliance on commercial credit and providing additional funds for hardship and childcare funds, and calls on the SNP to rethink its priorities, to begin finally to listen to students and to work with opposition parties and NUS and student leaders to bring forward new policies, using existing resources, to begin to tackle student hardship in Scotland. Supported by: Murdo Fraser*, Margaret Smith*
