 *S1M-3940# Trish Godman: Shipbuilding on the Upper and Lower Clyde—That the Parliament, in the light of recent and forthcoming Ministry of Defence contracts, is confident that the shipyards on the upper and lower Clyde have a sound future with the welcome retention, and expansion in the range of the superb skills that characterise the industry at its best and believes, however, that these yards, from Port Glasgow to Scotstoun and Govan, require from time to time appropriate and judicious support from the Scottish Executive in order to strengthen this now small but vitally important industry and that this can be best achieved by strengthening the existing close working relationship with management and the trade unions.
