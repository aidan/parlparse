*S3M-5093♦ Brian Adam: Tax Incentives Needed for Oil and Gas Industry—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by TAQA Bratani that it has started production on its first new North Sea oil well in the Cormorant field and also welcomes the announcement of a discovery of light oil in the West of Shetland by Hurricane Exploration PLC, the first time that a basement reservoir has been planned and drilled in the UK continental shelf as an exploration target; believes that these excellent examples show that further investment in the UK continental shelf can produce rewards; however notes with concern recent comments from Oil and Gas UK that 50,000 jobs could be put at risk if tax incentives are not created to increase investment and that offshore platforms, pipelines and infrastructure would fall into disrepair, and would therefore welcomefurther tax incentives for the oil and gas industry to protect investment and jobs in the north east and help drive the economy out of this recession.
