*S2M-1619 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Scotland’s BBC Restoration Representatives—That the Parliament acknowledges the efforts of all those involved with the campaigns of Hall of Clestrain, Knockando Wool Mill and Portencross Castle, the three Scottish entries on the BBC’s Restoration programme; recognises the importance of each building to the architectural heritage of both their local area and Scotland in general, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all three buildings, and all other historically or architecturally significant buildings in Scotland, are given the support required to ensure a sustainable future.
