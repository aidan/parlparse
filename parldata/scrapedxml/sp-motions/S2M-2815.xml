 *S2M-2815 Richard Baker: Adult Learners’ Week—That the Parliament notes that Adult Learners’ Week takes place from 21 to 27 May 2005; further notes that this week forms a vital part of attracting adult learners who are under-represented in this field into education and training; welcomes publicity of the national freephone helpline, 0800 100 900, which offers impartial advice and guidance to adults on education, training and employment opportunities; congratulates the hundreds of organisations which open their doors and provide opportunities for new and existing adult learners to develop their skills, and praises the United Kingdom’s biggest festival of learning for celebrating the positive role that learning can play in changing people’s lives and for stimulating participation amongst those who do not think that learning is for them.
