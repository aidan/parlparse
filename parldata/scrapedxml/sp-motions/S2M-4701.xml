*S2M-4701&lt;&gt; Dr Elaine Murray: Contribution of Pharma-Related Business Activity to the Scottish Economy—That the Parliament notes the recent report for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Scotland from economics consultancy, EPA, which shows that pharma-related businesses, such as Shasun Pharma Solutions in Annan, contribute some £830 million each year to the turnover of Scotland’s economy, are responsible for nearly £470 million in spending on goods and services, support 12,500 jobs and directly employ 8,000 people in Scotland; recognises that the sector is key to the nation’s economic well-being; commends the efforts of those who seek to win new investment by the sector in Scotland; recognises the need to attract the best and brightest people from around the world into this area of activity, and considers that the Scottish Executive should provide appropriate support for pharma-related businesses, their people and their products.
