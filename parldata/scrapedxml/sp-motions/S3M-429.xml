*S3M-429 Stuart McMillan: QE2—That the Parliament notes the visit of the QE2 to the River Clyde on 20 September 2007; further notes that the QE2 was built by John Brown’s shipyard in Clydebank 40 years ago; welcomes the invitation extended by Cunard to the men who built the vessel to board the ship one last time; notes with concern that many of those who built the QE2 are no longer alive, due to asbestos-related diseases resulting from less secure work and safety practices in the shipbuilding industry at that time, and calls on Cunard to consider a more generous gesture to the surviving men and the families of men who are no longer alive.
