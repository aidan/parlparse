*S1M-1650# Kay Ullrich: School Swimming Lessons—That the Parliament notes the report compiled by Scottish Swimming, which highlights that almost 50% of local authorities in Scotland no longer provide school swimming lessons; acknowledges that this coincides with a report from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents which records an increase in the number of children in Scotland who die as a result of drowning; recognises that the withdrawal of local authority-provided school swimming lessons has a greater impact on children from less well off backgrounds, and encourages Scottish local authorities to ensure that every pupil in Scotland has access to at least one publicly funded course of swimming lessons prior to leaving primary school.
