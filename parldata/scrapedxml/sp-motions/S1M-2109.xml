S1M-2109 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Govanhill Pool—That the Parliament calls for an investigation into the ruthless way Glasgow City Council acted against the occupation of Govanhill Pool; deplores the council's decision to send in sheriff officers and police against what had been a peaceful protest for 140 days; notes that the council was entirely responsible for the police being called in; believes that no council should involve the police in purely political matters such as this, and asks Glasgow City Council to provide an explanation for its specific acts of provocation, which included ignoring pleas to alleviate the situation which would have avoided the charge by mounted police, a lack of regard for the safety of either police or demonstrators, a failure to send any positive message that they would even talk to the pool protesters and abandoning the police and public to face the consequences of its decisions, as well as for the further acts which re-started trouble, such as sending workmen to board up the swimming pool in front of demonstrators and, next day, refusing to let the Southside Against Closures group into a council-run hall to hold a peaceful meeting and closing Govanhill Neighbourhood Centre to everyone, including local sports groups which usually use the facility, and thus forcing people back onto the streets.
