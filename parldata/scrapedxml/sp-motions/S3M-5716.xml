 *S3M-5716 Gil Paterson: Summit to Save St Margaret of Scotland Hospice—That the Parliament notes that there is cross-party support in the Parliament for the view that the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to remove funding for 30 long-term care beds from St Margaret of Scotland Hospice puts the future of the hospice under threat and therefore calls on the SNP, Conservative and Labour members on the board to be involved in a summit meeting with MSPs from all parties to discuss the full extent of the comments from John Bannon MBE with a view to having the original decision reversed.
