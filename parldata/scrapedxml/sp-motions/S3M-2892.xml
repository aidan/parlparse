 *S3M-2892 Jackie Baillie: Improving Accessâ€”That the Parliament believes that no person should be left stranded or isolated as a consequence of an inability to board a bus; calls on bus operators in West Dunbartonshire and across Scotland to accelerate their programmes for replacing old vehicles, particularly on principle routes, to ensure that more low-floor accessible buses are available; notes that many disabled people, elderly people and parents with prams are unable to access transport to vital services, and recognises the efforts made to date by some bus operators but strongly believes that the current stock of low-floor buses is insufficient to meet need and that bus operators should introduce accessible buses on key routes.
