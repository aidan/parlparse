*S3M-2794# Nanette Milne: Seabirds—That the Parliament notes with concern recent data from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) Scotland highlighting another terrible season for Scotland’s breeding seabirds, notably Arctic skuas, Arctic terns and kittiwakes; is alarmed that many of our internationally important species have now suffered successive poor breeding seasons over a period of years, with evidence suggesting that the Scottish populations of these species are experiencing substantial declines; notes that Scotland is an internationally important breeding ground for seabirds, with spectacular coastal seabird colonies in areas such as north-east Scotland and the Northern Isles containing 45% of the European Union’s breeding populations; further notes that seabird populations are a key health indicator for the marine environment as a whole, and considers that the forthcoming Scottish marine bill offers an opportunity to examine what can be done to address the catastrophic decline of our seabird populations. Supported by: John Scott*, Jackson Carlaw*, Elizabeth Smith*, Roseanna Cunningham*, John Lamont*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Aitken*, Elaine Murray*, Jamie McGrigor*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Murdo Fraser*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Liam McArthur*, Bill Wilson*, Bill Kidd*, Alex Johnstone*, John Wilson*, Ken Macintosh*
