 *S2M-885 Richard Lochhead: Days at Sea and the Safety of Our Fishermen-That the Parliament recognises the dangers that fishermen face in the pursuit of their work to provide us with high quality produce; deplores the fact that the deal reached at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels failed to take into account force majeure, the impact of bad weather on fishing time or time taken for vessels to steam to and from fishing grounds; notes the impact that this will have on the safety of our fishermen at sea, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to negotiate an increase in days at sea to ensure that the safety of our fishermen is not further compromised by the Common Fisheries Policy.
