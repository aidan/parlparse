 *S2M-5744 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Pay Nurses a Proper Wage Rise—That the Parliament notes that the decision on Scottish nurses’ pay was announced at a Labour Party meeting and not in the Parliament or indeed in the Cabinet; believes that this shows a serious lack of respect for the Parliament; also notes that, although nurses in Scotland will get their pay rise in one stage, the pay rise is still below the rate of inflation and is in effect a pay cut, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reward all public sector workers in Scotland with an above inflation rise and continue to ignore the Chancellor as they have done today.
