*S2M-1392 Maureen Macmillan: Inverness Caledonian Thistle Football Club-That the Parliament regrets the decision that Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC loses out in its bid to ground-share with Aberdeen Football Club and as a result is denied promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL), despite winning the Scottish Football League First Division Championship; notes the SPL's in-principle agreement for clubs elsewhere in Scotland to ground-share; further notes that the SPL is currently reviewing rules on stadia criteria; urges the SPL to give clubs a sufficient opportunity to fulfil such criteria, and calls for fair treatment for all clubs and their supporters across Scotland.
