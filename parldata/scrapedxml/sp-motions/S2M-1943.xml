*S2M-1943 Malcolm Chisholm: Domestic Abuse Services—That the Parliament recognises the very serious and totally unacceptable problem of domestic abuse in Scottish society; notes in particular the traumatic effect of domestic abuse on children and young people as well as on women; acknowledges the range of initiatives in this area that have been funded by the Scottish Executive in the last few years, and welcomes the Scottish Executive’s partnership working and its investment and work to support those experiencing domestic abuse.
