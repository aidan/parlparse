 *S3M-4718 Elaine Murray: Release of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi—That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill MSP, to release Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds; notes that Mr al-Megrahi had dropped his appeal and therefore remains a convicted terrorist; notes also that no compassion was extended to the 270 victims of the Pan Am bombing of 21 December 1988 or to the people of the town of Lockerbie who have lived with the aftermath of the bombing for the past 20 years, and believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice badly mishandled the decision making process and that both the process of making the decision and the decision itself have damaged Scotland’s international reputation.
