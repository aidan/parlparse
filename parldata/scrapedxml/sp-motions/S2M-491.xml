*S2M-491 Mr Brian Monteith: Swimminig in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the work of Scottish Swimming and the Bank of Scotland in launching the National Swimming Award; recognises that the Scottish Executive’s plan to make the activity of swimming a key part in the lifestyle of Scotland’s population will be greatly enhanced if swimming provision in Scottish schools were to improve; notes the shortage of properly qualified instructors and the lack of swimming education courses for them to learn appropriate teaching standards, and believes that further initiatives, including the provision of more physical education teachers in primary schools, should be undertaken by the Executive to help foster swimming as an ideal activity for the long term pursuit of a healthy lifestyle.
