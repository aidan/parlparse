 *S2M-2049.1 Shiona Baird: Towards A Green Job Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2049) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert ", while welcoming the Scottish Executive’s commitment to develop and implement a green jobs strategy, recognises the importance of placing sustainability at the heart of development and the inherent contradiction in A Partnership for a Better Scotland between having economic growth as top priority and having environmental concerns at the heart of public policy; notes that the leadership so far shown by the Executive in identifying and securing "big wins" in terms of green jobs for Scotland would be greatly enhanced if it broadened its conception of green jobs from jobs in the environmental sector alone to mainstreaming sustainability in all enterprise; notes that a broader conception of green jobs could help to resolve this contradiction in the Partnership Agreement, and encourages early publication of a finalised Green Jobs Strategy that covers all sectors of the Scottish economy."
