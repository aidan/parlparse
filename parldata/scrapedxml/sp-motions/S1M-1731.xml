*S1M-1731 Trish Godman: Ferguson's Shipyard—That the Parliament offers its warm congratulations to the management and workforce of Ferguson’s shipyard in Port Glasgow for winning against intense competition the contract, worth £23.5 million, to build a fisheries research vessel for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; notes that an earlier fisheries research vessel built at this Port Glasgow yard is judged by naval architects to be amongst the top three such vessels in the world, and believes that this order shows very clearly that this is an excellent shipyard.
