*S3M-1415 Pauline McNeill: 28 February 2008 - European Day of Action on Prison Overcrowding—That the Parliament notes the Federation of European Public Sector Unions’ (EPSU) day of action on 28 February 2008 to raise awareness of prison overcrowding across Europe; is concerned at the increasing prison population across Europe over the last decade, which stands at over 600,000; recognises that most prisons across Europe are now overcrowded, with more prisoners than establishments can accommodate healthily and humanely; believes that overcrowding negates many aspects of prisoner rehabilitation and consequently impacts on efforts to reduce reoffending and leads to further increases in prisoner numbers, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with trade unions and others within the justice system to improve prison conditions by further investment in the prison estate alongside robust alternatives to imprisonment where appropriate.
