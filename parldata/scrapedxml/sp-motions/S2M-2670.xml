 * S2M-2670# Mr Mark Ruskell: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the most comprehensive scientific survey ever into the state of the planet, which concluded that human activities threaten the earth’s ability to sustain future generations; recognises the main findings of the report that humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively over the last 50 years than in any comparable period of time in history, that the changes made have contributed to substantial gains in well-being for some people but are unsustainable and have left many in poverty, that the degradation of ecosystems could grow significantly worse over the next 50 years and is a barrier to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and that the degradation of ecosystems may be reversed and increasing demands for ecosystem services managed but only if significant changes are made to policies, institutions and practices, and believes that the Scottish Executive should examine the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, particularly the interventions suggested, and respond to it.
