 *S3M-2401.1Liam McArthur:Highlands and Islands-Friendly Quality Mark—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2401) in the name of Rob Gibson, leave out from "those firms" to end and insert "the Scottish Government to take up the Sanday Community Council’s quality mark proposal at the earliest opportunity, and, in the meantime, urges those firms that impose extra costs for deliveries to rural areas and islands to follow best practice examples, such as Amazon and the Royal Mail, so that they may receive the quality mark when the Scottish Government introduces it."
