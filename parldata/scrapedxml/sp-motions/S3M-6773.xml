*S3M-6773 Bill Butler: Titian’s a Hit!—That the Parliament welcomes what is considered the outstanding success of the exhibition at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum of Titian’s Diana and Actaeon during the month of July 2010; celebrates the fact that over 140,000 people visited Kelvingrove during July to view the masterpiece and that it will also be on display in Dundee and Aberdeen during the summer; considers that displaying such masterpieces in venues across Scotland is an effective and imaginative way of widening access to the arts and ensuring that Scotland’s artistic treasures are enjoyed by as many people as possible, and encourages the National Galleries of Scotland to give serious consideration to participating in similar schemes involving other works in its collection.
