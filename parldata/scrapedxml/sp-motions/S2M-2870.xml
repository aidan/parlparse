 * S2M-2870 Carolyn Leckie: Low Pay Continues to Blight Scotland—That the Parliament notes the publication of the Scottish Low Pay Unit report, Low Pay in Scotland, which shows that there is still a chronic problem with low pay in Scotland; notes that the report says that at least 421,000 workers, over a quarter of the Scottish workforce, earn less than the low pay threshold which currently stands at £7.44 per hour; notes that the report also shows that the gender pay gap continues, with women in Scotland earning just 63% of male gross median earnings; believes that an £8 per hour minimum wage would immediately lift hundreds of thousands of Scots out of poverty; urges the Scottish Executive to direct local authorities to implement an £8 an hour minimum wage, and believes that the Executive should enforce equal pay legislation in the public sector. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Rosie Kane*
