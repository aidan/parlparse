*S2M-4773 Mike Pringle: Scottish Banknotesâ€”That the Parliament is saddened to have learned that the National Car Parks Ltd (NCP) car park on Holyrood Road, sited less than a quarter of a mile from the Parliament, does not accept Scottish banknotes in its pay machines; notes that the Parliament has mastered this technology with its own cash vending service, and calls on NCP to seek technical assistance from the Parliament in order to allow it to reprogramme its machines and so make its car park fit for purpose in its location close to the heart of Scottish democracy.
