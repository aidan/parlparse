*S3M-5232 Bill Wilson: State of Scotland’s Greenspace 2009 and SROI—That the Parliament congratulates Greenspace Scotland on the publication of State of Scotland’s Greenspace 2009, the first comprehensive report on the extent of urban green space in Scotland, which amounts to 23 square metres per person; notes that the report contains information on the work of Renfrewshire and 19 other local authorities with regard to green space; further notes that the first social return on investment (SROI) analysis of a green-space-related project, the Greenlink project run by Greenspace Scotland and the Central Scotland Forest Trust, which examined the impact of a new cycle path on antisocial behaviour, health and activities for children, concluded that it produced a sevenfold return on investment; believes that this level of return is likely to apply to other green space projects in view of the beneficial effects of green space on health and wellbeing, acknowledged by the Chief Medical Officer, Dr Harry Burns, and others; calls for SROI methodology to be adopted widely by local authorities, the Scottish Government and other public bodies when assessing projects and making investment decisions, and believes that such methodology and the State of Scotland’s Greenspace 2009 report will both prove invaluable for improving the wellbeing of the people of Scotland.
