S3M-5315 Gil Paterson: Trading away Human Rightsâ€”That the Parliament is concerned that any free trade agreement entered into by the European Union and Colombia would be a step in the wrong direction for those who have suffered or are suffering human rights abuses in Colombia; calls on the European Union to follow the lead of the United States of America by refusing a free trade agreement with Colombia until the human rights record is up to an acceptable standard, and further calls on the European Union to put pressure on Colombia to clean up its act on human rights and refuse any agreement that is not endorsed by Colombian civil society.
