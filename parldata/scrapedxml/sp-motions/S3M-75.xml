*S3M-75# Mike Rumbles: Road Safety on the A90 at Laurencekirk—That the Parliament notes with concern the high number of serious and fatal accidents at the A90/A937 junction near Laurencekirk; believes that the introduction of a 50mph speed limit at this location by the former Minister for Transport, Nicol Stephen, was a welcome temporary measure, and further believes that a full grade-separated junction in the form of a flyover or underpass is necessary and that this should be implemented as soon as possible.
