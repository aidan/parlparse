*S1M-2304# Dr Elaine Murray: Foot-and-Mouth Disease-Free Status—That the Parliament welcomes confirmation that tests on 22,828 sheep on 144 farms across Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders between 16 August and 7 September 2001 have all proved negative; further welcomes the granting of provisionally foot-and-mouth disease-free status to the whole of Scotland; notes with concern that some rights of way remain closed and believes that local authorities, the State Veterinary Service, landowners and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department should work together to remove all restrictions on rights of way as a matter of urgency.
