*S3M-7975 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Keep Edinburgh Tidy—That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh on being placed in the top 10 of an MSN Travel online poll of world cities judged to be spic and span; recognises that Edinburgh came first in the Keep Scotland Beautiful awards 2010, which takes into account the absence of litter and graffiti; considers that Scotland’s capital has seen a dramatic rise in the number of volunteers taking part in organised litter picks, with the MSN poll citing 5,000 volunteers city wide; highlights the many events already planned for the Keep Scotland Beautiful National Spring Clean campaign, which takes place from Monday 14 March to Monday 16 May 2011; considers litter-picking events in Victoria Park in Leith, organised by Trinity Primary School, and in Hawthornvale Path by the Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop to be great examples of community action for cleaner streets and parks, and notes that information about events for the National Spring Clean campaign can be found at http://springclean.keepscotlandtidy.org.
