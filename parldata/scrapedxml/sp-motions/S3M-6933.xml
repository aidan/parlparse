*S3M-6933 Mary Scanlon: ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Virus Link Found in Children—That the Parliament welcomes the conclusions of a study by scientists at the University of Dundee that has found further evidence that myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), could be caused by a virus; considers that these findings will be welcomed by young people with ME/CFS in the Highlands and across Scotland who still experience the consequences of the belief that ME is a disease of the mind rather than, as this evidence suggests, a disease of the body; notes that 25 children with ME/CFS were assessed along with 23 controls and that all 25 children with ME/CFS were found to have abnormalities in their blood, providing similar results to those previously identified in adults with ME/CFS, and further thanks and congratulates the Young ME Sufferers (Tymes) Trust, which is the longest established national UK service for children and young people with ME and their families, with a team of professionals who give all their time free of charge, and ME Research UK, which is a charity with the principal aim of commissioning and funding scientific investigation into the causes, consequences and treatment of ME/CFS, for their support of this study and all the outstanding work that they do for the many thousands of people with ME/CFS across Scotland and the UK.
