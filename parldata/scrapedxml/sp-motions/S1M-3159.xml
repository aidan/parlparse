 *S1M-3159 Michael Russell: Appointment of the Lord High Commissioner-That the Parliament notes that the Catholic Relief Act of 1829 continues to prohibit the appointment of a Catholic as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland; further notes that virtually all other provisions of this outmoded and discriminatory act have been repealed and that, whilst the position of Lord High Commissioner is a non-ecclesiastical appointment by Her Majesty the Queen with no liturgical or religious function in the Church of Scotland, it has great significance and prominence in Scotland at the time of the Kirk's General Assembly; observes that the Church and Nation Committee of the Church of Scotland is taking a commendable stance on issues of sectarianism and the need to root them out from Scottish society, and suggests that the Church of Scotland join with the Scottish Parliament in encouraging Her Majesty's Government to repeal this provision in the Catholic Relief Act and in exhorting Her Majesty the Queen to appoint a Catholic to the position of Lord High Commissioner for 2003 as a mark of reconciliation and as a sign of national determination to have done with institutionalised discrimination.
