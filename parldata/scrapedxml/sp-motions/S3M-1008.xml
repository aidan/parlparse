*S3M-1008 Michael Russell: The Benefits of Woodland and Greenspaces—That the Parliament recognises the value of the physical environment in promoting health and wellbeing; recognises the role that woodland and other greenspace plays in this through increased opportunities for physical activity, relaxation and social interaction in people’s everyday lives, and calls on the environmental and health sectors to work together to further develop the contribution of woodland and other greenspace to Scotland’s health.
