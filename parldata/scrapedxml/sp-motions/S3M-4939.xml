*S3M-4939 Ian McKee: 25 Years of Victim Support Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates Victim Support Scotland in its 25th anniversary year for the valuable and essential services that it provides to victims of crime across Scotland; notes that the charity provides emotional and practical support to people who have been victims of all types of crime, from housebreaking to rape, sexual assault and murder; further notes that during 2007-08 the organisation’s victim services and witness services supported around 175,000 people affected by crime; believes that the work of over 900 volunteers across the country contributes hugely to the success and achievements of the organisation; supports the charity’s work programme, No More Victims, and its vision to support individuals and communities, to help rebuild lives and keep people affected by crime at the heart of justice in Scotland; recognises the extensive projects that it is undertaking to address youth crime, and welcomes the First Minister’s announcement during the national charity’s AGM that an information service for victims of youth crime will be rolled out across Scotland by the end of September 2009 to ensure that victims of youth crime receive the best help and advice available in a consistent, easy and accessible way.
