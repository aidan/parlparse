 *S2M-4728 Euan Robson: The Commemoration of Black Friday—That the Parliament remembers with respect the east coast disaster of 14 October 1881 in which 189 east coast fishermen, of whom 129 came from Eyemouth, lost their lives; recognises the efforts of Berwickshire coastal towns, villages and others to commemorate the 125th anniversary of Black Friday, the worst fishing tragedy ever suffered in Scotland, and further recognises both the dangers faced by contemporary fishermen at sea and the continuing importance of the fishing industry to communities around Scotland’s shores.
