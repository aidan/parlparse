 *S3M-4834 Bill Wilson: Welcoming Sea Angling Strategy Group—That the Parliament notes the estimate in the Scottish Government’s recent report, Economic Impact of Recreational Sea Angling in Scotland, that sea angling is as significant to the Scottish economy as all forms of freshwater angling combined, contributing almost £141 million annually and sustaining 3,148 jobs; further notes, however, concerns expressed by the Scottish Sea Angling Conservation Network (SSACN) that sea angling is in serious decline due to historically poor fisheries management and practices, with the Clyde now being described as a monoculture fishery, and welcomes the SSACN vision for Scottish sea angling and agrees with it that, if stocks were to be regenerated and sustainably managed, sea angling could provide a major growth opportunity for many fragile coastal economies, and therefore applauds the Scottish Government’s support for a recreational sea angling strategy group.
