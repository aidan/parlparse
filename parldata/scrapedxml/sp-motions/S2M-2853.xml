 * S2M-2853 Mark Ballard: Confirmation That Tasers Will Not Be Used at G8—That the Parliament notes recent press reports that police officers at the G8 summit will be equipped with electroshock tasers; notes that tasers are potentially lethal and inherently open to abuse; welcomes the statement from David Strang, President of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland that, “Tasers will not be used by either Scottish officers or by officers from England and Wales during the G8”, and is concerned that negative and unfounded press reports may dissuade people from exercising their right to peaceful protest.
