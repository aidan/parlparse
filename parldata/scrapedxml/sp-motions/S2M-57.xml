*S2M-57 Margo MacDonald: Appointment of Ministers—That the Parliament believes that the requirements of sections 44 and 47 of the Scotland Act 1998 are inconsistent with the duty of the First Minister elected by Parliament to carry out his programme for government along with ministers selected by him to have responsibility for specific portfolios within that programme for government and believes that the Procedures Committee should, as a matter of urgency, review the proceedings surrounding the First Minister’s appointment of his ministerial team in order to petition Her Majesty’s Government for appropriate amendments to the act on the appointment of ministers.
