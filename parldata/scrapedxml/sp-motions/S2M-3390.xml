*S2M-3390 Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Maternity Services—That the Parliament expresses concern at the public consultation process on the reform of maternity services in Glasgow; notes that NHS Greater Glasgow attempted to rule out all but one of the potential sites for the new maternity hospital at a recent public meeting; notes that the independent group, chaired by Professor Calder, which is tasked with selecting the final site, appears to have a difficult job in light of this decision as their options have been limited; further notes the Minister for Health and Community Care’s statement that "I will decide what happens on these services, not Greater Glasgow Health Board" and believes that it is his duty to ensure that the process is more open and transparent than it has been to date and that all the relevant information regarding the resiting of the children’s hospital in Glasgow is considered by the independent group chaired by Professor Calder, and further believes that transport links and the future of Ronald McDonald House must also be given careful consideration.
