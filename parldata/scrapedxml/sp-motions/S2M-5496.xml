*S2M-5496 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Condemn the Cuts, Save the Jobs—That the Parliament condemns the decision of Dumfries and Galloway Council’s Education and Community Services Committee to cut the teacher allocation to secondary schools; notes that this is a cut in a front-line service which the present administration is pledged to avoid; recognises that the main effects will be a reduction in the choice of courses available to pupils and increased class sizes; acknowledges that this cut effectively cancels out the extra teachers promised by the Scottish Executive to secure the reduction in class sizes in English and Maths to 20 from August 2007, and calls on Dumfries and Galloway Council to reconsider this decision and reinstate the 15 teaching posts affected.
