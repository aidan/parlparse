*S2M-988 Jeremy Purvis: Higher Education in the Borders-That the Parliament recognises the very high standard of education provided in the Scottish Borders and the high percentage of school leavers that enter into further and higher education; welcomes the applications for major investment in the further education sector for the redevelopment of Borders College, which will provide state-of-the-art facilities in Galashiels, Hawick and wider access in all other parts of the Borders; congratulates the college and other partners, including Heriot-Watt University, on their partnership working; expresses serious concern, however, that Heriot-Watt University may wish to withdraw textile design courses from the Netherdale Campus and relocate these to Edinburgh, and expresses further concern that such a move would be wholly detrimental to the partnership working that has developed and damaging to the creation of a centre of excellence in education in Netherdale for both further and higher education, founded on 130 years of provision of training and education in textiles.
