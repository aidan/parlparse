 *S3M-6866 Bill Wilson: Importance of FCO Human Rights Reportâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is considering cutting the costs of its Annual Human Rights Report; applauds, however, the statement on its website that "It is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience or to repudiate our obligation to help those less fortunate", and calls on the FCO to cut costs only with regard to the physical format of the report and not its compass and rigour.
