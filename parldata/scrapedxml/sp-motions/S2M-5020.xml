 *S2M-5020 Murdo Fraser: Scottish Public Services Ombudsman—That the Parliament notes the important work that the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) undertakes for the Scottish public and its vital role in investigating complaints against public bodies; welcomes the SPSO’s commitment to improve the delivery of services provided by bodies under its jurisdiction and further welcomes recent changes that the SPSO has made to improve access to its services for complainants; notes that in 2005-06 the SPSO received 99% more enquires and 56% more complaints than in 2004-05, and believes that the SPSO’s annual budget must reflect the increased demands placed on the SPSO so that its office is appropriately staffed and resourced to continue to carry out its work, with any increased funding to come from reducing the budgets of other commissioners and ombudsmen.
