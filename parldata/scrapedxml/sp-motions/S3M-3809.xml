*S3M-3809 Christopher Harvie: Sunday Express Apology over Dunblane Article—That the Parliament notes the apology by the Sunday Express for its wholly unacceptable front page article on 8 March 2009 about the young survivors of the Dunblane massacre upon their entry into adulthood, a dismaying intrusion into the lives of young people who suffered traumatic experiences and have done their best to come to terms with them; deplores the level of journalism in this article, now subject to a Press Complaints Commission adjudication, and expresses hope that the newspaper’s contrite response marks a move towards more responsible journalism at a time of economic hardship where high quality information-driven reporting is one way to counter the financial troubles of the Scottish newspaper industry.
