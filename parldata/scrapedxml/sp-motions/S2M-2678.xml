 *S2M-2678 Richard Lochhead: Solar One—That the Parliament notes the recent launch of the Solar One van which is propelled by biodiesel and is capable of supplying all its energy needs, both electricity and heat, from solar power; believes that this is a significant development in the renewable energy field which proves that renewable energy can play a significant role in the Scottish power supply; congratulates Dr Kerr MacGregor for coming up with this exciting and innovative idea, and calls on the Scottish Executive to prioritise research into renewable energy and to ensure that Scotland develops a diverse renewable energy programme which utilises a variety of renewable energy sources and harnesses Scotland’s potential in terms of natural and academic resources to make Scotland a leading nation in renewable energy development.
