*S3M-367 Rhona Brankin: Poisoning of Raptorsâ€”That the Parliament condemns the illegal poisoning of one half of the only breeding pair of golden eagles in the Borders, Scotland having seen too many incidents involving the illegal poisoning of birds of prey in the last few years; calls on the Scottish Executive to publish the times and exact locations of instances of illegal poisoning of wildlife, and further calls on the Executive to encourage owners to stand up and be counted and to condemn any instances of illegal wildlife poisoning that takes place on their land.
