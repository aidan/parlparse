*S3M-1983 Kenneth Gibson: Scotland’s Oil Wealth—That the Parliament recognises the recent study, performed by Grant Thornton, validating the immense oil wealth potentially available to Scotland; notes conservative estimates giving an independent Scotland a £4.4 billion annual surplus, even if Scotland had access to only 82.5% of North Sea oil revenue; is aware that, with oil prices now at $135 a barrel and heading towards $200, this is an huge underestimate of the wealth that could accrue to Scotland; acknowledges that Oil &amp; Gas UK has stated that reserves could last for at least 30 years, during which time a fund for future generations could be initiated and established; regrets that Scotland’s unionist parties, in thrall to their bosses in London and with no faith in the Scottish people, still try to argue that Scotland is a parasitic burden on the United Kingdom, with Labour being particularly guilty, claiming in the spring of 2007 that an independent Scotland would be in deficit to the tune of £12.9 billion a year; looks forward to a time when Scotland and its people will, through independence, be allowed to realise its full economic potential, and calls on the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer to transfer Scottish oil and gas wealth into the hands of the Scottish people.
