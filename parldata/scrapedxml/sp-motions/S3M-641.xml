 *S3M-641 Alasdair Allan: Royal National Modâ€”That the Parliament notes that Friday 12 October 2007 is the start of the 104th Royal National Mod in Fort William; recognises that this nine-day-long event is a showcase for Gaelic language, culture and heritage; believes that events like this are important to the strengthening of the distinct cultural and social identities of the Scottish Gaidhealtachd; welcomes the official opening of the Mod by Len Goucher, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Heritage in Nova Scotia, to help further reinforce the links between the Gaels of Nova Scotia and of Scotland, and wishes success to the many competitors from all areas of Scotland and to those from outwith Scotland.
