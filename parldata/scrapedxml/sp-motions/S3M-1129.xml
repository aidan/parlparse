*S3M-1129 Jamie Hepburn: Sixth Anniversary of Detention Camp at Guantanamo Bay—That the Parliament notes that 11 January 2008 marked the sixth anniversary of the opening of the detention camp at the Guantanamo Bay site in Cuba by the United States authorities; notes that Amnesty International organised a peaceful protest outside the US consulate in Edinburgh on that date to mark this anniversary; notes that Amnesty International organised a collection of signatures of 1,200 parliamentarians across the world who believe that this camp should be closed and that the 53 members of the Scottish Parliament among that number represent the highest proportion of any Parliament in the world; believes that the camp at Guantanamo Bay represents a fundamental breach of the human rights and civil liberties of the hundreds of detainees held there without charge or attempt to bring them to trial; further believes that this breach of human rights and civil liberties gives lie to the pretence that the so-called "war on terror" is about protecting human rights and civil liberties and means that the US Government is in violation of established international law; congratulates Amnesty International for its efforts at raising awareness about these issues, and calls on the US Government to shut down the detention camp at the Guantanamo Bay site with immediate effect.
