 *S3M-3142 Jamie Hepburn: UK Citizens Allegedly Tortured in Guantánamo Bay—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Supreme Court of the United States of America to reinstate the lawsuit of UK citizens Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal, Rhuhel Ahmed and Jamal al-Harith, former Guantánamo Bay inmates who have alleged that they were tortured by US personnel while in custody; notes that the Supreme Court has upheld their claims to rights under the US constitution while detained at Guantánamo Bay; further notes that, while none of the men were accused of terrorism or designated as enemy combatants, they spent more than two years in Guantánamo before being returned to the United Kingdom and have reported being subject to beatings, humiliations, threats and food, water and sleep deprivation; looks forward to a free and fair hearing of the men’s accusations in open court, and calls on US President-elect Barack Obama to make good his pledge to close the detention camp as soon as possible after his inauguration.
