*S3M-4720 Rob Gibson: Glendale Life—That the Parliament congratulates the Glendale Trust for mounting a heritage exhibition, displayed in Borrodale school, on the life of Glendale people in the last 200 years; commends the content of the show donated by many whose families and work have enhanced the life of this corner of the Isle of Skye; recalls the important part played by Glendale folk in the crofters’ struggles of the 1880s and its unique place in the establishment of the people’s right to live on their own land, and welcomes the growing support to retain Borrodale school as a heritage centre for the area.
