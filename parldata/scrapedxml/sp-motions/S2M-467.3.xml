*S2M-467.3 Murdo Fraser: Creating an Enterprise Culture in Scotland's Schoolsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-467) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises the necessity of creating an enterprise culture in Scotland in order to help reverse our economic decline; welcomes any moves to encourage young people to become more entrepreneurial but understands that what the business sector primarily looks for from school leavers are skills in literacy, numeracy, communication and timekeeping, and accordingly calls upon the Scottish Executive to take steps to reduce the unacceptable number of school pupils failing to meet basic standards in reading and writing, widen access to vocational courses at further education colleges for 14 and 15-year-olds, and increase opportunities for school pupils to experience work placements."
