*S2M-4988 Colin Fox: House Price Rises and Lack of Affordable Housing—That the Parliament believes that the recent rises in average house prices in Scotland are unsustainable and that lack of new social housing is fuelling inflation in house prices, making both buying and renting increasingly unaffordable to those on low incomes, and therefore calls for an end to right-to-buy and for substantial investment by the Scottish Executive in the building of new local authority and housing association properties for affordable rents to meet the obvious need that rising house prices signify.
