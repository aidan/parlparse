 *S3M-7529 Jackson Carlaw: Sentencing of Mohammed Sandia—That the Parliament condemns the comments of Mohammed Sandia who posted a series of what it considers disgraceful anti-Semitic remarks on The Scotsman newspaper’s website; welcomes what it considers Sheriff Gordon Liddell’s unequivocal condemnation of Sandia’s comments when he appeared for sentencing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on 10 November 2010; considers that Mr Sandia’s prosecution sends out a welcome message to society at large about how indefensible anti-Semitism is and how vile its consequences can be; congratulates the determination of the police and Crown Office to pursue this case to its conclusion, and urges editors of all media, and online media outlets in particular, to be on their guard to prevent similar instances of religious or racial hatred from finding their way onto their pages in the future.
