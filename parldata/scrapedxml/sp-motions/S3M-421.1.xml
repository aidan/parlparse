 *S3M-421.1 Roseanna Cunningham: Antonine Wall World Heritage Site—As an amendment to motion (S3M-421) in the name of Cathie Craigie, insert at end "however, notes that Scotland’s Roman heritage also includes the Gask Ridge, first constructed by Agricola in the 80s AD, a Roman frontier system extending from the Antonine Wall at Camelon near Falkirk to Bertha near Perth and comprising a roadway along which were built forts and watchtowers of which the most complete is the Ardoch Fort at Braco, and recommends that this continuation of Roman fortifications in Scotland is also worthy of being included in the application for World Heritage Status."
