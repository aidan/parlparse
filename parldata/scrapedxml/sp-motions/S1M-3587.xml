 *S1M-3587# Christine Grahame: Grooming of Children and Vulnerable Adults-That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing use of internet chat rooms and other methods by adults to deceive, beguile and lure children into compromising situations with a view to sexual gratification, sometimes known as "grooming"; further notes that there may be a lacuna in existing criminal law in this regard; notes that the Scottish Executive is investigating whether a new statutory offence is required, and considers that the Executive should extend its inquiry and any potential new statutory offence to cover vulnerable adults.
