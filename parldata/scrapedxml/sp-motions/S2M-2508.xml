*S2M-2508 Shiona Baird: Support for Tidal Power—That the Parliament welcomes the £1 million funding awarded by the Scottish Executive towards the establishment of a tidal test centre at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney; recognises that it is vital to fund the speedy development and commercialisation of a range of renewable technologies in order to avert climate change and to capitalise on opportunities for home-grown Scottish enterprise; expresses its concern, however, that £1 million represents a mere drop in the ocean, and calls for increased funding urgently for more development of tidal power in Scotland.
