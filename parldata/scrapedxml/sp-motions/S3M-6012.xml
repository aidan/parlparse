*S3M-6012 Dr Richard Simpson: Congratulations to ParentLine Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in ParentLine Scotland, the national, free helpline service for anyone caring for a child in Scotland, run by Children 1st, which will reach its 11th birthday in the week of 22 March 2010; notes that, in this time, the service has received more than 103,000 calls from 33,000 parents, grandparents and other carers; notes the high proportion of calls concerning substance misuse by both children and adults and believes that this merits a considered, effective and fair response that takes full account of often complex underlying reasons; further believes that, as well as providing a valuable insight into the concerns and needs of parents and carers across Scotland, ParentLine has proven to be an invaluable source of information, advice and further assistance in handling the challenges that come with caring for children and that otherwise may not be accessed, and wishes all staff and volunteers the very best for the future.
