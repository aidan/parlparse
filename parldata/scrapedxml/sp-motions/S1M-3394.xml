 *S1M-3394 Johann Lamont: Challenging Sectarianism in Glasgow-That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council on its important and pioneering work in challenging sectarianism; notes in particular the powerful partnership it has forged with Strathclyde Police, the Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church, Celtic Football Club, Rangers Football Club and voluntary organisations in developing the "Sense over Sectarianism" campaign; welcomes the decision to commission major research into the extent of sectarianism and Glaswegians' perception of it and acknowledges that this research will allow the development of meaningful action to tackle sectarianism; further welcomes the initiative by the council in bringing together all the major faiths in the city to launch the "Forum of Faiths" on 23 September 2002, an initiative which will work to foster respect and understanding amongst people of all religious beliefs and none in Scotland's largest city; congratulates all those involved in this important work, and welcomes this measured approach which looks beyond simplistic rhetoric and provides a model for those who seek to eradicate sectarianism across Scotland.
