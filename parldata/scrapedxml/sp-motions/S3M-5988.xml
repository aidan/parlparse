*S3M-5988Marilyn Livingstone:Victory for Local Newspapers—That the Parliament considers the decision by the Scottish Government to drop its proposals for local authorities to publish public information notices online instead of in newspapers as part of a money-saving exercise a victory for local newspapers; believes that the proposals were deeply undemocratic due to the fact that many people still do not have access to the internet, including nine out of 10 single pensioners, 46% of single parents, 49% of single adults and 77% of couples of non-pensionable age; considers that the proposals could have resulted in changes being introduced in local areas without proper scrutiny and widespread public knowledge; is concerned that the proposals would have cost the newspaper industry up to £10 million in lost revenue; believes that local authorities have a duty to ensure that communities are properly informed about important decisions and to protect good local journalism, and congratulates all those involved in the campaign to support local newspapers, such as the Fife Free Press, that provide a good quality service.
