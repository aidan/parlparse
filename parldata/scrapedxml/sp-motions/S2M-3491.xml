*S2M-3491# Fergus Ewing: The A82: The Case for Major Improvements and the Removal of the Temporary Traffic Lights at Loch Lomondside—That the Parliament notes with concern that the traffic lights on the A82 at Loch Lomondside, restricting traffic to one lane, have now been in place for approximately 40 years; believes that the A82 trunk road is a vital transport link for the people living in, and travelling to and from, the west highlands and islands; notes that in a report published by HITRANS it is estimated that a series of improvements to the A82 could generate additional income of £493 million for the economy and create 1,000 sustainable jobs by 2019; endorses the analysis of the HITRANS report; believes that the case for such improvements is overwhelming, not only on economic grounds but also for improved road safety, and considers that, of the improvements sought, the priority for upgrading is that section of the A82 between Tarbet and Inverarnan.Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Bruce Crawford*, Brian Adam*, Rob Gibson*, Murray Tosh*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Michael Matheson*, Jim Mather*, Phil Gallie*, Alex Neil*
