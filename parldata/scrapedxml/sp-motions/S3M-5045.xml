*S3M-5045 Bob Doris: Save the Wyndford Wallâ€”That the Parliament commends the application on behalf of the Wyndford Residents Association in Maryhill to have the Wyndford Barracks wall listed by Historic Scotland; considers that Wyndford is an urban community of distinct identity and notes that the perimeter wall surrounds the Wyndford housing estate on the site of the former Wyndford Barracks, which opened in 1872 and was home to two proud Scottish regiments, the Royal Scots Greys and the Highland Light Infantry; considers the wall to be a local landmark that links the community to its past and believes that local historic structures should, where possible, be preserved; wishes the Wyndford Residents Association well in its efforts to improve the local environment for future generations, and notes the sense of civic pride that local people hold for the area and the outrage at proposals to demolish the barracks wall.
