 *S1M-726 Mr Brian Monteith: Maternity Services in Forth Valley—That the Parliament notes that a consultation exercise has been instigated by Forth Valley Acute Hospitals (FVAH) NHS Trust over the future of health service provision in the region; further notes that the provision of in-patient maternity services is to be removed from Stirling Royal Infirmary and centralised in Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary, and calls upon the (FVAH) NHS Trust and Forth Valley Health Board to take fully into account the views of those living in the most remote parts of rural Stirlingshire and West Perthshire who already face a long journey to Stirling for maternity care, and to take into consideration the considerable investment already made in these services at Stirling Royal Infirmary in comparison with the significant investment that will be required for a new central unit at Falkirk.
