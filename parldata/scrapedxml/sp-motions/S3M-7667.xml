*S3M-7667 Rhoda Grant: Supporting Local Forums’ Involvement in Delivering Community Care—That the Parliament recognises the value of supporting local forums’ involvement in delivering community care; notes the research undertaken by the Inverness and Highland community care forums that highlights the vital role that lunch and social clubs play in supporting older people in the Inverness area; believes that these groups provide a vital service in creating and maintaining social networks and alleviating the effects of social isolation; considers that, when funding for the Highland Community Care Forum ceases in June, local forums will be left without any support and will not survive, and therefore calls on both NHS Highland and Highland Council to extend Highland Community Care Forum’s present contract to cover the gap between the old contract and the new to ensure that local forums continue to have a part to play in the delivery of future localised community care services.
