*S2M-1875# Richard Lochhead: Energy Efficiency Weekâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the commencement of Energy Efficiency Week between 25 and 31 October 2004, but notes that distribution of electricity to end-users in Scotland actually increased by 10% between 2000 and 2002; notes that this trend would prevent Scotland contributing the one million tonnes of carbon savings required as its fair contribution to the UK aspiration of 10 million tonnes of carbon savings from energy efficiency by 2010; notes that such savings can be achieved by methods such as improving the quality of the building stock, installing energy efficient equipment such as lighting and installing local clean or efficient energy sources and that these measures could have a beneficial impact upon endemic social problems such as fuel poverty; notes that, historically, specific regional figures pertaining to energy consumption have not been collated by bodies such as the Department of Trade and Industry, and calls on the Scottish Executive to collate and publish comprehensive Scottish energy statistics to underpin a comprehensive review of current energy efficiency strategy and aid the development of an evidence-based national energy efficiency strategy, ensuring that Scotland becomes a leader in energy efficiency.
