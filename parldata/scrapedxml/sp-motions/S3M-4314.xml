*S3M-4314 Ross Finnie: Support the Beatson Pebble Centre—That the Parliament supports the Beatson Pebble Appeal, a £10 million campaign to raise funds to build the Beatson Translational Research Centre, which will foster collaboration between scientists and clinical researchers to improve existing cancer therapies and develop new treatments; notes that more than one in three people in the United Kingdom will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime and that cancer causes one in four deaths in the UK, but that cancer research has been instrumental in reducing the overall cancer death rate by 10% over the last decade; further notes that translational research bridges the gap between scientific discovery and successful patient treatment; considers that this facility will greatly enhance the capability of the Glasgow Centre for Cancer Research, and praises the efforts of the Beatson Pebble Appeal to raise the additional funds required to build this exceptional facility.
