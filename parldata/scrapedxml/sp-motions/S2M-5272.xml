 *S2M-5272 Rosie Kane: Victory for Militant Trade Union Action at Glasgow City Council—That the Parliament congratulates UNISON members in Glasgow City Council for the substantial victory they have achieved after the council caved in on the eve of a planned three-day strike which would have been the biggest conflict it faced with trade unionists in several years; notes that the negotiated agreement means that the union has won a settlement that amounts to indefinite or lifetime protection of current salaries, that is that either people will be retrained or their jobs will be redesigned to guarantee them their current pay by March 2009 or that deadline will be extended indefinitely until such time as these devices kick in; recognises that the Culture and Leisure Services Department is still threatened by a proposal that it will be hived off to a charitable trust which would mean only one year’s protection under TUPE rules, and further notes that women underpaid for decades have still not achieved full compensation to the value of potential equal pay claims but, in so doing, recognises that this victory strengthens the trade union and its members and will enable them to organise and achieve fair and equal terms and conditions in the future. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Colin Fox*
