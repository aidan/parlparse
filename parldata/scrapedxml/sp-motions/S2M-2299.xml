 * S2M-2299# Dr Jean Turner:NHS Bed and Theatre Numbers—That the Parliament acknowledges the need to reduce waiting times and waiting lists safely; notes that, in order to help achieve this, the Scottish Executive should have more information than just what adequate numbers of trained NHS staff are required at all stages of the patient journey; therefore urges the Executive to identify how many hospital beds are necessary to cope, with ease, with the anticipated demands of emergency and elective workloads and the extra beds required, as stand-by, to maintain smooth working and thus prevent delays in admission for elective procedures due to lack of beds or staff; considers that the Executive should establish the number of surgical theatres necessary for special, general, elective and emergency procedures to allow surgeons access to a theatre without having to wait until one becomes free, and also considers that the Executive should establish how many high-dependency and intensive care beds are required to cope comfortably with the work of surgical theatres and wards in order that delays in admission for elective procedures will not occur due to lack of such beds and/or staff of any kind.
