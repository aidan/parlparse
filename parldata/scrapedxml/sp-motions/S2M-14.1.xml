 *S2M-14.1 Bill Aitken: M74 Northern Extensionâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-14) in the name of Rosie Kane, leave out from "opposition" to end and insert "support for the M74 Northern Extension but invites the Scottish Executive to examine the potential impact of a significant increase in traffic exiting from the extension on the Tradeston and Plantation areas of the City of Glasgow and to undertake a study on how the proposed extension plans might be amended in order to obviate any problems of congestion and promotes the free flow of traffic south of the River Clyde."
