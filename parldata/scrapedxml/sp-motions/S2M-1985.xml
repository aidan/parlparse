*S2M-1985# Helen Eadie: World COPD Day 2004—That the Parliament welcomes the third annual World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day on 17 November 2004 which aims to raise awareness of COPD across the world; regrets that COPD is the only major cause of death on the increase in Scotland, with an estimated 33,000 sufferers and more than 4,600 deaths each year, equating to approximately one death every two hours; recognises the importance of effective management of COPD in primary care with services such as early diagnosis with spirometry testing, pulmonary rehabilitation, non-invasive ventilation therapy and access to a multi-disciplinary healthcare team; supports the efforts of the British Lung Foundation Scotland in highlighting the benefits of these services for improving outcomes for patients and reducing the major burden on the NHS; urges members to contact and liaise with their local NHS boards to ensure that these services are available to their constituents, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that COPD and respiratory disease are given appropriate prominence in the NHS in Scotland.
