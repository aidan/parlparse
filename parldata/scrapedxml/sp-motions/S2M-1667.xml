 *S2M-1667 Carolyn Leckie: Support for a Moratorium on NHS Closures—That the Parliament notes the succession of profound concerns expressed in debates and motions on the NHS; further notes that these concerns are so serious that calls for a moratorium on NHS closures and centralisations have been made for over a year; notes that communities remain at odds with NHS boards and the Scottish Executive over the future of the NHS, that NHS boards implement Executive policy and budgets, notably on PFI/PPP, that boards do not play any political role in terms of PFI/PPP or pharmaceutical profits which represent a massive strain on their budgets, that the application of the working time regulations have neither been planned properly nor budgeted for, that new contracts for medical staff at all levels have not been fully funded and that numbers of graduates in all health professions have been, and are, consistently insufficient to meet the needs of patients or a 21st century NHS; believes that NHS boards should be democratically accountable for their responsibilities but that it is the Executive that sets the structural, strategic, financial and political context that they operate in and regrets the failure of the Executive to acknowledge that responsibility or engage in a debate with the public; further believes that the threat of closure of so many important facilities is entrenching the disengagement between communities and government, and therefore believes that the Executive should now announce a moratorium so that a wide-ranging and meaningful debate about the security and future of the NHS can take place in Scotland.
