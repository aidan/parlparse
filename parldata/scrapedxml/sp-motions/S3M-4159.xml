 *S3M-4159 Jamie Hepburn: Royal Mail Profits Double—That the Parliament welcomes a two-fold increase in the annual profits of the Royal Mail, from £162 million in 2007 to £321 million in 2008, with all four core businesses having turned a profit for the first time in two decades; notes that these profits come in spite of the recession and a 5.5% decrease in the number of letters being sent, while private mail companies, including TNT, have experienced huge profit reductions, and believes that these figures present a clear signal that the UK Government must immediately abandon its plans for the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail.
