*S3M-5410 Ian McKee: European Citizens’ Initiative—That the Parliament notes with interest the European Commission’s consultation on the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI); recalls that the Lisbon treaty introduces the right of the citizens’ initiative, allowing for one million citizens who are nationals of a significant number of member states to call on the Commission to bring forward any legislative proposal that is within the framework of its powers; further notes that, before the ECI can be exercised, some rules and procedures need to be established, hence the need for the current consultation; believes that the ECI introduces a crucial element of democracy and legitimacy in the EU decision-making process; observes that the initiative gives way for direct democracy at the European level, allowing European citizens to influence the direction of European policy, and encourages Scottish citizens, organisations and public authorities to take part in the consultation process and exercise their right once the initiative has fully entered into force. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Kidd* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
