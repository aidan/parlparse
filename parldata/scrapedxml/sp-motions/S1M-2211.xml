*S1M-2211 Dennis Canavan: Strip 4 Shelter, Friday 14 September 2001—That the Parliament notes that Friday 14 September 2001 is Shelter Scotland’s "Strip 4 Shelter Day", a campaign to raise awareness of homelessness and to raise funds to prevent and tackle homelessness in Scotland; welcomes the involvement of schools, businesses, local authorities, voluntary organisations, housing associations and individuals in supporting this year’s "Strip 4 Shelter Day" thereby demonstrating the people of Scotland’s commitment to social justice; recognises "Strip 4 Shelter Day" as an opportunity for people to show their real concern and support for Shelter Scotland and homeless and badly housed people in a less traditional but fun way by wearing their favourite sporting strip to school, college or work, and recommends that MSPs should also take this opportunity to demonstrate their support by getting involved with "Strip 4 Shelter Day". Supported by: Margaret Smith*, Tricia Marwick*
