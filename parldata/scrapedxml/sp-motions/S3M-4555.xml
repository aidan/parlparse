S3M-4555 Hugh O’Donnell: Reported Kidnapping of International Humanitarian Activists—That the Parliament condemns the reported kidnapping of 21 international humanitarian activists, including Theresa McDermott from Scotland, and hijacking by the Israeli Defence Force of the peace ship the Spirit of Humanity and its aid cargo in international waters as it travelled to bring some relief to the besieged people of Gaza; believes that this unprovoked attack is in direct contravention of international maritime law and is contrary to all international moral standards of behaviour for a civilised state, and, *notwithstanding the negative activities of Hamas,* believes that the international community, European Union and President Obama should condemn the actions of Israel and bring to bear such pressure on the state of Israel as is necessary to relieve the three-year long suffering of the innocent civilian population of Gaza. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick, Rob Gibson, Shirley-Anne Somerville, Bill Kidd, Sandra White, Bill Butler, Bill Wilson*, Mike Pringle*
