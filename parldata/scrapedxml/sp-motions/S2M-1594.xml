*S2M-1594 Mr Brian Monteith: Economic Damage from New York Smoking Ban—That the Parliament notes the results of the New York Nightlife Association study, The Economic Impact of the New York State Smoking Ban on New York’s Bars, that found that the state-wide smoking ban has resulted in direct economic losses in bars and taverns of 2,000 jobs which is 10.7% of bar employment, $28.5 million in wages and salary payments and $37 million in gross state product; further notes that the study showed the economic losses in businesses that supply and service bars were 2,650 jobs, $50 million in earnings and $71.5 million in gross state product; welcomes the news that state legislators are now sponsoring new legislation to allow smoking in bars where there is good ventilation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider the evidence of the economic impact on Scotland’s leisure and tourist sector that any ban on smoking could have and to consider, in partnership with the licensed trade, what measures are required to improve ventilation in bars, clubs and restaurants that choose to allow smoking by customers.
