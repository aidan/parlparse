*S1M-2933 Ms Margo MacDonald: Alain Baxter—That the Parliament condemns the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for its failure to institute a standard of testing methamphetamine in Alain Baxter’s test sample which would have shown conclusively that the Olympic Bronze medallist did not enhance his performance in the Winter Olympics by the illegal use of the stimulant d-methamphetamine but that the nasal spray which caused amphetamine to be registered in his test contained l-methamphetamine which is acknowledged by Professor Arnold Beckett, formerly a member of the IOC medical commission, to be a non-stimulant which would have had no effect whatsoever on Alain Baxter’s performance, and therefore urges the IOC to re-instate Alain Baxter’s Olympic medal.
