*S1M-3759# Christine Grahame: Dealing with Young Offenders-That the Parliament notes that the Audit Scotland report, Dealing with offending by young people, makes 38 recommendations for action in dealing with young people who offend; in particular, notes the report's statements that (a) the system for dealing with young people is slow, taking on average five and a half months for a child to reach a children's hearing and around eight months to get a court decision on a young person, (b) young people are dealt with unevenly across Scotland, (c) large numbers of young people, 2,300 or 16% of those convicted, are imprisoned and that 60% of those re-offend within two years of release, (d) more money, around 60% of the total spending on youth justice, is spent on prosecuting and reaching decisions about young offenders than on services to tackle offending behaviour, (e) there is a chronic shortage of social workers in children's services and 13% of posts for children's services social workers were vacant and (f) information about offending and about the quality of services is inadequate, and considers this thorough report a damning indictment of the Scottish Executive's youth crime policies and that after nearly four years in office, these policies have failed Scotland's young, their parents, their communities and Scotland at large.
