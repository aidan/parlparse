 * S3M-5604 Alasdair Allan: West Harris Estates Transfer—That the Parliament notes that, on Monday 25 January 2010, the three West Harris estates of Luskentyre, Scaristavore and Borve, which includes the villages of Seilibost and Horgabost, were formally transferred to the community ownership of the West Harris Trust; notes that this historic land transfer is the first land buyout that sees a community take over Scottish Government-owned land; hopes that this is the first step towards a brighter future for people in the west of Harris that sees those who live on the estates become their own landlords; believes that community ownership will provide a great incentive for these communities to develop economically and socially and to retain and grow their populations, and wishes the communities every success with their future ventures. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Rob Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Brian Adam*, Stewart Maxwell*, Sandra White*, Aileen Campbell*, Bill Kidd* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
