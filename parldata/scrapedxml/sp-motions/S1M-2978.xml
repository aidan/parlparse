*S1M-2978# Karen Whitefield: Social Workers-That the Parliament appreciates the positive difference that social work services make to the lives of the people of Scotland; recognises the increasingly difficult and complex role that social workers play; further recognises the current serious problem in recruiting and retaining social workers in Scotland, particularly within certain specialisms; acknowledges the need to challenge the often negative perception of social work and to attract more people into the profession; believes in the importance of high quality generic social work training at undergraduate level with the opportunity for post-graduate specialisation, and further believes that the social work qualification should be upgraded.
