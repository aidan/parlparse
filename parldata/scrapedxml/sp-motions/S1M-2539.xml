*S1M-2539# Mr Duncan McNeil: Research into Cancer Levels in the Semiconductor Industryâ€”That the Parliament notes the publication Cancer Among Current and Previous Workers at National Semiconductor (UK) Ltd, Greenock: Results of an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive; further notes that the study gives cause for concern which can only be addressed through further research across the semiconductor industry; believes that steps should be taken to ensure that GPs and other health professionals are well briefed and prepared for any enquiries from concerned current or former members of the workforce, and further believes that Ministers and officials of the Scottish Executive should work in partnership with all those concerned to ensure that issues arising from this research are addressed as a matter of priority.
