*S3M-250♦ Bill Kidd: Positive Behaviour Orders—That the Parliament, while recognising the real need to tackle antisocial behaviour, shares the concern expressed by many young people and organisations that antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) can unnecessarily focus on the negative behaviour of young people at the expense of the many positive attitudes young people have and actions they take; agrees with many official organisations in Glasgow and throughout Scotland which regard ASBOs as a route to be explored only after other, more positive, initiatives have been tried, one such initiative being the use of positive social behaviour orders (PoSBOs), which have recently been introduced in Yorkshire for young people who make communities brighter and better places, and believes that initiatives like the one above should be explored along with others to tackle the problem of antisocial behaviour.
