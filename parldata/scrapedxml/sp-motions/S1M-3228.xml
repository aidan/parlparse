*S1M-3228 Alasdair Morgan: Investment in Public Infrastructure-That the Parliament notes the recommendations of the Audit Scotland/Accounts Commission report on Private Finance Initiative (PFI) procurement in schools, Taking the Initiative - Using PFI contracts to renew council schools, and believes that PFI has proved to be a costly experiment, that local authorities and other public bodies should be free to use traditional public procurement and that, where "off balance sheet" solutions are desirable or necessary, these should be on a not for profit basis through bodies such as not for profit trusts and community trusts.
