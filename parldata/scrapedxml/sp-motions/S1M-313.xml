*S1M-313 Mr Jim Wallace: Land Reform—That the Parliament commends the openness of the Scottish Executive’s approach to land reform, as demonstrated by the extensive consultations on the Land Reform White Paper published in July; recognises the scale of their overall commitments to legislation and other action on land reform as set out in the Land Reform Action Plan published in August, and welcomes the progress to date as shown in the first Progress Report published earlier this month.
