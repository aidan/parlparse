*S2M-4379 Bill Aitken: HBOS/Barnardo’s Tug of War 2006—That the Parliament notes that the 2006 HBOS/Barnardo’s Tug of War Competition will take place on 1 June in Holyrood Park, Edinburgh; further notes that last year’s event helped raise just under £4,000 in total for the charity to use for its excellent work; understands that the Labour Party is considering putting its name in the hat this year, although it has yet to confirm whether the Liberal Democrats will be helping it to make up numbers, and hopes that this year the other parties will have more luck in challenging the defending champions and pre-tournament favourites, the all-conquering Scottish Conservatives. Supported by: Alex Johnstone*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Margaret Mitchell*, Dave Petrie*, Murdo Fraser*
