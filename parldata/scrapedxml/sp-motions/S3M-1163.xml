*S3M-1163 Kenneth Gibson: Violent Crime—That the Parliament notes with concern the rise in violent crime in Scotland in 2006-07 with homicide rates showing a 27% increase on last year’s figures; is disturbed that almost 30% of those accused were reportedly under the influence of alcohol and drugs or both, and that the most likely murder weapon used was a knife or sharp implement; is alarmed that offences in which firearms were alleged to have been used increased by 17% over the same period with a corresponding increase in firearms casualties of 25%, one in three of them children; is perturbed that assaults on police officers are 50% higher than 2000-01 levels; is seriously concerned that treating injuries from violent crime is estimated to cost the NHS in Scotland between £300 million and £500 million per year; welcomes the Scottish Government’s endorsement of the Violence Reduction Unit’s 10-year plan to tackle the culture of rising violent crime, including the Safer Scotland campaign and the interventionist COVAID (Control of Violence for Angry, Impulsive Drinkers) project; supports the Scottish Government’s determination to prioritise public safety whilst tackling the root causes of crime, and recognises the need to tackle the scourge of weapons crime and to crack down on guns and knives that blight communities and the misuse of alcohol that fuels this violent crime.
