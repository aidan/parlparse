 *S2M-2048# Christine May: Support for Community Arts—That the Parliament congratulates Donna Hazelton of Leven in Fife for her success in Channel 4’s Musicality contest; commends the hard work that won her the role of Mamma Morton in the West End production of Chicago for a night; notes that she was the only Scottish contestant; recognises the contribution that she has made to amateur musical performance in Leven Amateur Musical Association, Glenrothes Amateur Operatic Society and as a solo artiste, whilst working in the box office at the Byre Theatre; acknowledges the extent of the benefit to Scottish society of the work of amateur performers in music, drama and all forms of arts activity; notes that the community arts inquiry being carried out by the Enterprise and Culture Committee will report in the near future; encourages all members to watch Donna’s performance which will be broadcast on Channel 4 on 1 December 2004, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how arts in the community may be further supported for the benefit of all communities in Scotland.
