*S3M-3857 Christina McKelvie: Defend Afghan Women’s Human Rights—That the Parliament expresses deep concern at news reports that President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has recently signed into law a Shia family law bill that is believed to deny the most basic human rights to Afghan women, including the right to refuse sex within marriage, to leave their homes without permission from a husband or father or to seek custody of their children following divorce; recalls that the denial of human rights to Afghan women by the Taliban was cited as a justification for the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001; believes that those countries involved in military action in Afghanistan then and since have a duty to protect Afghan women’s rights; calls on the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office to establish urgently exactly what provisions are contained in the Shia family law and to place diplomatic pressure on President Karzai to repeal all legislation that violates the human rights of women and children, and urges the UK Government to condemn in the strongest possible terms these latest attacks on the basic humanity of Afghan women and to exhort its international partners to do the same.
