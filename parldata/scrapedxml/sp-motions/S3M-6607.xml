 * S3M-6607 Bob Doris: Reducing VAT on Educational e-Resources—That the Parliament expresses concern at the current practice of applying full-rate VAT at 17.5% on electronic resources such as e-journals, e-books and online databases; recognises that e-resources are increasingly important to the education sector, are particularly vital to the sciences and technology and are increasingly being used as core materials in the arts and humanities; notes that, according to the British Universities Finance Directors’ Group (BUFDG), library VAT costs in a typical research institution amount to £175,000 per annum and that in larger institutions this figure is far higher; supports calls from BUFDG in advance of the UK budget for VAT in this area to be reduced in common with recent developments in other European countries, including a reduced rate of 4% in Spain and proposals to reduce VAT to 6% in the Netherlands; believes that the estimated £10 million cost to universities across the United Kingdom of having full-rate VAT applied to e-resources is significant and will become a yet greater burden in future years as usage increases and the constrained financial environment intensifies; considers that a VAT reduction on e-resources would do much to encourage research, and urges the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider well founded claims that such a reduction in VAT may be either revenue-neutral or positive in the longer term.
