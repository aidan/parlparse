*S3M-7061 Murdo Fraser: The Reverend Ian Galloway’s Comments—That the Parliament fully supports the armed forces for their dedication and service to Scotland and the United Kingdom, especially the Scottish soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan; notes that the Reverend Ian Galloway, convener of the Church of Scotland’s Church and Society Council, stated in evidence to a parliamentary committee that medals should not be awarded to soldiers who kill their enemy on the battlefield; deeply regrets what it considers Reverend Ian Galloway’s lack of understanding about the award of medals for valour; recognises that medals are awarded to soldiers for their courage and the sacrifice that they make on behalf of Scotland and the United Kingdom; believes that Reverend Ian Galloway’s opinion does not represent the view of the majority of members of the Church of Scotland, and further believes that his comments have caused offence to church members and others and that he should reflect on whether he is an appropriate person to hold the prominent office that he occupies as a public spokesman for the Church of Scotland.
