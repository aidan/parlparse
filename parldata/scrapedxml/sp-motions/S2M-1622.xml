*S2M-1622 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Landslip at Glen Ogleâ€”That the Parliament commends the bravery, speed and professionalism of the emergency services, RAF and Royal Navy, who took part in the rescue operation following the recent landslip on the A85 at Glen Ogle, rescuing 57 people; also praises the people of Lochearnhead and Killin for the community spirit that saw local people rush to offer assistance to all those involved in the incident; recognises that the risk of such landslips, and flash floods as seen in Boscastle, is likely to increase due to the effects of climate change, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with Stirling Council and other relevant agencies to minimise the risks of such landslips and also ensure that Scotland delivers on its obligations to reduce greenhouse gases in order to tackle the causes of climate change.
