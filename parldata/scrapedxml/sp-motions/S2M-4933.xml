 *S2M-4933 Chris Ballance: Faslane 365—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Faslane 365, a civil resistance project focused in Scotland to apply critical public pressure for the decommissioning of Britain’s nuclear weapons by a continuous peaceful blockade of the Trident base at Faslane; commends the action of women associated with Greenham Common, Aldermaston Women’s Peace Campaign and Women in Black in the first few days of the blockade of Faslane; notes that arrests have been made as a result of non-violent protest; appreciates that groups and organisations from Scotland, England, Wales and beyond, have pledged to join the blockade in the coming months, and notes that groups interested in taking part can contact info@faslane365.org.
