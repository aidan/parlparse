*S2M-3173 Mr Mark Ruskell: Fair Trade for Scottish Dairy Farmers—That the Parliament supports farmers who have been driven to the point where they feel that their only chance of getting a fair price for milk is to engage in direct action protest; notes the loss of 700 dairy farms in the last five years in Scotland; further notes that the profit levels of the big four supermarkets, who control 80% of grocery trade, now amount to Tesco - £2.03 billion, Morrisons - £281 million, Sainsburys - £254 million and Asda/Wal-mart - $10.3 billion worldwide; recognises the failure of the Office of Fair Trading to intervene to ensure fair trade; repeats its call for a stronger code of practice or regulation throughout the food supply chain to control unfair trading practices, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make a statement as a matter of urgency on what it intends to do to help the remaining dairy farmers and protect rural Scotland from further decline.
