*S1M-3941# Christine Grahame: Children of Iraq - Collateral Damage—That the Parliament notes the concerns of Save the Children regarding the humanitarian consequences of military action against Iraq, that half the Iraqi population is comprised of children under the age of 14, that 70% of the population lives in towns and cities, that 60% are poor and dependent on food rations, that 11.4% of Iraqi children in North Iraq and 23.1% in Central and South Iraq are still chronically malnourished, that under-five child mortality in Central and South Iraq has deteriorated by 160% due to sanctions, that a cut in the food ration provided under the Oil-for-Food programme would trigger even greater poverty, that Iraqi children are forced to drink water that often contains up to ten times the acceptable level of contamination and that the number of internally-displaced persons is already estimated to be between 700,000 and one million; further notes that, against this background, Save the Children is "deeply concerned" at the possibility of renewed conflict as military action would have serious humanitarian consequences for Iraq's vulnerable children, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make all possible representations to prevent this war by addressing the likely impact on the vulnerable and innocent children of Iraq.Supported by: Brian Adam*
