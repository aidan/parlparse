*S3M-4292 Helen Eadie: Scottish Government Fails Fife’s Children at Risk—That the Parliament is gravely concerned that senior Fife Council officials have been judged, in a report published in April 2009 by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education, as leaving some children in Fife in situations of risk or without adequate support; considers that council leaders have failed to put in place systematic scrutiny, at policy and financial management level, of all matters pertaining to child protection policy and management in Fife; expresses profound concern that inspectors were not confident that every child needing help to keep them safe from abuse and neglect had been properly identified, assessed and protected; observes that key developments such as multi-agency screening of children for whom there was concern were not taken forward; recalls the First Minister’s statement that this sort of neglect was unacceptable when senior Aberdeen City Council officials were severely censured for the same reasons last autumn; demands that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, Fiona Hyslop MSP, meets Helen Eadie MSP urgently to discuss the case of a child who has been in need of child protection services; is outraged that Fiona Hyslop has, after almost six weeks, not yet called an emergency meeting with senior officials and politicians in Fife to ensure that urgent and vitally important steps are taken immediately to ensure the protection of all of Fife’s children, and considers that this illustrates complacency on her part.
