 *S3M-784.4 Robin Harper: A National Food Policy for Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S3M-784) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "commends the positive work of Soil Association Scotland’s Food for Life (FFL) programme in promoting food education and school meals that are 75% fresh and unprocessed, 50% locally produced and have 30% organic ingredients; urges the Scottish Government to consider how a national food policy could drive the implementation of FFL standards across the public sector in Scotland; further believes that sourcing ingredients locally is crucial for the future viability of Scottish producers and independent shops, supporting strong and cohesive local economies as well as reducing food miles and climate change emissions; is seriously concerned, however, that supermarket domination has undermined local economies, and calls on the Scottish Government to consult on replacing the Supermarket Code of Conduct with independent regulation without delay in order to protect consumer choice and the environmental, social and economic benefits of local food."
