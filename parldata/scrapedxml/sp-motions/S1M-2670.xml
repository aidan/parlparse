 *S1M-2670 Tommy Sheridan: Asylum Policy of Austrialian Government-That the Parliament condemns the Australian Government for its inhumane asylum policy which has led directly to over 300 desperate and imprisoned asylum seekers embarking on hunger strikes to highlight their case for asylum and their appalling treatment by the Australian Government; finds this inhumane treatment particularly offensive having recently witnessed Holocaust memorial services across Scotland; regards it as a shameful fact of history that, had those seeking asylum from Nazi Germany been allowed into neighbouring countries, many lives could have been saved, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Australian Government to register our opposition to its asylum policy.
