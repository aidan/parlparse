*S3M-7565 Bill Kidd: Use of Glasgow City Council Resources—That the Parliament is concerned at reports of improper use of Glasgow City Council resources for party political purposes; understands that this reported improper use ceased following an investigation prompted by the Scottish National Party Glasgow City Council group; believes that it is regrettable that public resources should ever have been used for party political purposes, and hopes that the review reported to have been undertaken by Glasgow City Council will ensure fair and proper use of public resources in future.
