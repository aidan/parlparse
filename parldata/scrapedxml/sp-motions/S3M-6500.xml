*S3M-6500 Bill Wilson: Civil List Review—That the Parliament welcomes Early Day Motion (EDM) 123, which states "That this House is opposed to any increase in the Civil List while public spending is being cut and until Royal finances are subject to the same standards of accounting, auditing and reporting as all other public finances; and calls for an immediate freeze on Civil List payments and for an urgent and independent inquiry into Royal finances, with a view to reducing the overall cost of the Monarchy to well below the current estimated bill of £100 million to £200 million a year.", and thinks that such action is overdue.
