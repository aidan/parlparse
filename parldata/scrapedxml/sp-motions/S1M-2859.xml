*S1M-2859 Mr Gil Paterson: Eurostar: A Return for our Money—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the Strategic Rail Authority’s failure to secure a link from Scotland to the continent within its current ten year plan, despite a Court of Session ruling three years ago, and calls on the Executive to support Strathclyde Passenger Transport in securing this link as soon as possible to pass on some of the benefit currently enjoyed by the south east of England, particularly considering that Scotland has paid its fair share toward this project but has received no benefit in return.
