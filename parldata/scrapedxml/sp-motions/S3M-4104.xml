*S3M-4104 Maureen Watt: Foster Care in Aberdeen Cityâ€”That the Parliament recognises the invaluable service that foster carers play in providing children with safe and caring homes while they are unable to live with their own families; congratulates Aberdeen City Council for its recent efforts to recruit additional foster carers, which has resulted in an increase in the number of carers from 111 in January 2008 to 129 in January 2009; notes that the Foster Care Fortnight campaign will run across the United Kingdom from 11 to 24 May 2009, and hopes that this campaign and other initiatives will help further boost the numbers of foster carers in Aberdeen city and across Scotland.
