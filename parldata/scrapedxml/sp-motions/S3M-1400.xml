*S3M-1400 Bill Wilson: Independent People’s Tribunal on the World Bank Group in India—That the Parliament notes the Independent People’s Tribunal on the World Bank Group in India, which involves retired justices of the supreme and high courts, leading writers, religious leaders, activists and academics; agrees with its condemnation of the World Bank for approving loans that "have caused extensive social and environmental harm", unduly influenced the Indian policy-making process and promoted the establishment of common effluent treatment plants that failed to meet environmental norms, and further notes that Indian Government and World Bank officials failed to represent themselves at the tribunal despite two weeks’ notification.
