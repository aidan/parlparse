 *S3M-5230 Joe FitzPatrick: Homophobic Bullying—That the Parliament welcomes Stonewall’s Education for All campaign, which aims to tackle homophobic bullying in schools; notes with concern research that shows that 9 in 10 secondary school teachers and more than two in five primary school teachers report that their pupils currently experience homophobic bullying, name-calling or harassment; further notes that homophobic bullying can result in lower educational achievement and also increase the rate of self-harm and suicide among young lesbian, gay and bisexual people; welcomes Stonewall’s Some people are gay. Get over it! poster campaign, which was created by young people and will be used to directly target young people travelling to and from school on buses during National Anti-Bullying Week from 16 to 20 November 2009; further notes the steps taken by the Scottish Government to combat homophobic bullying with the toolkit resource for teachers, Dealing with Homophobia and Homophobic Bullying in Scottish Schools, and hopes that the forthcoming national anti-bullying strategy will further address the issue of homophobic bullying in order that all young people can enjoy the full benefits of learning in a safe and an inclusive environment.
