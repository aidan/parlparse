*S2M-5138 Alasdair Morgan: Business Start-Up Grantsâ€”That the Parliament believes that the current Scottish Enterprise business start-up grant scheme for 18 to 30-year-olds discriminates unfairly against older applicants and, in particular, can place unnecessary barriers to growth by excluding from access to grant assistance applicants who would otherwise be sufficiently qualified and experienced to build thriving and successful businesses.
