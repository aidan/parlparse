*S3M-2519♦ John Scott: Introduction of Sellers’ Single Survey—That the Parliament notes with concern the fragile state of the housing market in Ayrshire and Scotland; believes that adding to the cost of moving house will further damage Scotland’s housing market; notes the intention of the Scottish Government to introduce from December of this year a sellers’ single survey, which, it is forecast, could add between £500 and £700 to the cost of moving home, and considers therefore that it would be unhelpful to introduce a sellers’ single survey at this time.
