*S2M-1044 Mr Brian Monteith: Degas Exhibition-That the Parliament recognises the success of the recent "Degas and the Italians in Paris" exhibition at the National Galleries of Scotland which attracted upwards of 50,000 visitors; commends the National Galleries and the Bank of Scotland, whose generous funding made the exhibition, only the second to be held in the newly-refurbished Royal Scottish Academy building, possible, and looks forward to the completion of the Playfair development which is due to open in August, having succeeded in receiving extensive support from businesses in Scotland.
