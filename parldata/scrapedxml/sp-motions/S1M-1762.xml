 *S1M-1762 Lewis Macdonald: Community Nurses and Health Visitors—That the Parliament notes the key role of community nurses and health visitors in community care, and that use of a car is essential in carrying out that role; believes that the practices of requiring these health workers to pay parking charges in the course of their work, and of providing car leasing arrangements on different terms in different Trusts, should be reviewed in the interests of efficiency and equity, and further believes that a uniform approach to these issues should be established throughout the National Health Service in Scotland. R Supported by: Trish Godman*, Elaine Thomson*, Karen Whitefield*
