*S3M-685 Sarah Boyack: Removing the Barriers to Microgeneration—That the Parliament notes that most Scottish householders installing microgeneration technologies, including solar panels, heat pumps and mini-wind vanes, are currently required to apply for planning permission; notes research commissioned by the previous administration and published on 30 March 2007 which recommended that the requirement to apply for planning permission should be removed from most microgeneration technologies in specific circumstances; agrees that microgeneration can make a significant contribution to tackling climate change, ensuring reliable energy supplies and helping to tackle fuel poverty, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a public consultation on removing the requirement for planning permission for microgeneration at the earliest practical opportunity and thereafter to act promptly on the findings of that consultation.
