*S3M-735.1 Jackson Carlaw: Charlotte Louise McKechnie: Young Chorister of the Year—As an amendment to motion (S3M-735) in the name of Stuart McMillan, leave out from "on winning" and insert "on becoming the first Scot to be named British Broadcasting Corporation Young Chorister of the Year after out-singing three other finalists from across the United Kingdom at St Paul’s Cathedral, London, on Saturday 27 October 2007; notes that 15-year-old Charlotte is a choir member at Giffnock South Parish church, a choral scholar at St Bride’s in Hyndland, a member of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra junior choir and a pupil at Glasgow’s excellent Hutchesons’ Grammar School; further notes that Charlotte’s performance, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 at 8 pm on Sunday 4 November 2007, illustrated just how fully deserved her outstanding victory was, and wishes her all the very best for the future."
