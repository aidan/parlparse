*S3M-6207 Patricia Ferguson: North Glasgow 5K—That the Parliament congratulates all the runners, walkers and pram pushers who took part in the fifth annual North Glasgow 5K; notes that a record 2,900 people took part, helping to raise awareness of the importance of physical activity and raising thousands of pounds for charity in the process, and also recognises the hard work of the organisers, Strathclyde Police and the staff of Glasgow City Council’s Land Services Department in making this event such a huge success.
