*S3M-4356 Willie Coffey: Bicentenary of Galston Parish Church—That the Parliament notes that Galston Parish Church, erected in 1808 and opened in 1809, will be celebrating its bicentenary on Thursday 18 June 2009; recognises that worship has taken place on this site for over 750 years, with the original church, which was dedicated to St Peter and granted to the Red Friars in 1252; acknowledges the church’s place in Scotland’s history with its ministers including Dr George Smith, great-grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson and who was mentioned by Robert Burns in his poem, The Holy Fair, and Robert Stirling, 19th century inventor of the Stirling Engine, which re-emerged in use as an alternative to the steam engine, and its covenanting links commemorated in the grave of Andrew Richmond, who was shot by Graham of Claverhouse in 1679, and by a Covenanters’ memorial; further recognises that the present church, occupying a prominent site over the village, was designed by John Brash of Glasgow to a plan described as most simple, convenient and elegant, was renovated in 1879 and 1999, had a chancel added in 1912 and contains stained glass windows by Oscar Paterson, a contemporary of Charles Rennie Mackintosh; notes also that the Right Reverend Bill Hewitt, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, who was born and raised in nearby Kilmarnock, will preach at the bicentenary event, and wishes the parish minister, the Reverend Graeme Wilson, and his parishioners all the best for this important event and for the future.
