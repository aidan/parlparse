 *S3M-5109♦ Sandra White: Detention of Children at Dungavel—That the Parliament expresses serious concern over figures obtained from the UK Border Agency that show that, between October 2008 and September 2009, 103 children were detained at Dungavel in Scotland; notes that, in the last five years, 889 children from 488 families throughout the United Kingdom have been held for over 28 days, thus requiring UK ministers to personally approve continued detention; considers that these figures show that, despite the welcome commitment and efforts of the previous administration and the current Scottish Government to end the practice of the detention of children at Dungavel, children and families from Glasgow and throughout Scotland are still being subjected to this unacceptable practice, and would welcome further efforts from all political parties in Scotland to ensure that this practice is ended.
