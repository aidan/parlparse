 *S1M-3319.1 Brian Adam: Aberdeen City Council Planning Application for a Football Stadium and Other Facilities at Kingswells-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3319) in the name of Mr Mike Rumbles, leave out from "Aberdeen" to end and insert "that only two of the twelve Liberal Democrat councillors on Aberdeen City Council supported a proposal to the Scottish Executive for a public inquiry into a planning application for a new football stadium and other facilities at Kingswells; further notes with concern the conduct of one of Mr Mike Rumbles MSP's employees, who is a member of the council; agrees that the recent allegations of wrongdoing within the council have undermined the public's confidence in the openness and transparency of the planning process, and calls on the Scottish Executive to hold a public inquiry on the application as a matter of urgency."
