 *S2M-3743 Colin Fox: Welcome Decision of Edinburgh Council Tenants to Reject Stock Transfer—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of City of Edinburgh Council tenants to vote against housing stock transfer; believes the decision of 53% against to 47% for the transfer represents a victory for people power against all the odds and is a hammer blow against the privatisation of public housing provision throughout Britain, and demands that the £1 billion, which was apparently available for privatisation, should now be available to write off the council’s housing debt, to invest in improvements to the existing housing stock and to build 6,000 affordable, quality, publicly owned houses that the city badly needs.
