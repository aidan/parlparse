 *S1M-1647# Richard Lochhead: Scottish Ambulance Service Control Rooms—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals by the Scottish Ambulance Service to reduce the number of their control rooms from eight to three; notes that the Aberdeen control room, which is among those earmarked for closure, also manages Scotland’s Patient Air Transport Service, a service it has successfully provided since 1993, and urges the Scottish Executive to arrange a further appraisal of the proposals and to consult the Scottish Parliament Health and Community Care Committee before taking any decision on this matter, given the expressed opposition to the proposals from staff, unions, health professionals and the general public.
