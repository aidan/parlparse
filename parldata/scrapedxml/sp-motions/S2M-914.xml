*S2M-914# Mr John Home Robertson: Better Access to Small Claims Courts-That the Parliament believes that the thresholds of £750 for small claims and £1,500 for summary cause are unrealistically low and that these limits are preventing many Scottish citizens from securing the settlement of legitimate claims; notes that the equivalent procedure in England can be used for claims up to the value of £5,000, and believes that the Scottish Executive should amend the regulations to set more appropriate thresholds for the small claims procedure in Scotland.
