*S3M-4236 Karen Whitefield: Congratulations to MacMillan and CAB Partnership in Lanarkshire—That the Parliament congratulates the MacMillan and CAB Partnership in Lanarkshire on its achievements; notes that, since the partnership was launched in May 2003, over £10 million has been secured for clients in Lanarkshire and that the service has received over six thousand referrals, with many clients coming back again and again for continuing support; further notes that since the expansion of the partnership in May 2008, with the support of North and South Lanarkshire councils and NHS Lanarkshire, client numbers have increased by 29%, reaching a referral rate of over 57% of newly diagnosed patients; commends also the partnership’s most recent initiative, identifying potential claims for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, a success illustrated in March 2009 when client financial gains of £104,207.50 were reported; recognises the concrete benefits that the MacMillan and CAB Partnership is delivering to the local economy in Lanarkshire, with £11 being returned to the local economy for every £1 invested in the service; believes that the partnership’s success should be viewed as a model of good practice across Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to encourage the Development of similar partnership approaches to local service delivery.
