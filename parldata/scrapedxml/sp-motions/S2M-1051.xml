 *S2M-1051 Roseanna Cunningham: GM Crops-That the Parliament notes the recommendations of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee's report GM Foods - Evaluating the Farm Scale Trials; believes that the cultivation of Chardon LL maize should not be considered in Scotland until a full inquiry has been undertaken into the potential commercial, environmental and health impacts of such an introduction, and believes that, pending the outcome of such an inquiry, all existing legal powers should be used to block the approval of Chardon LL maize in keeping with the precautionary principle.
