*S3M-1265 Keith Brown: Sub-standard Military Housing—That the Parliament condemns the sub-standard nature of military accommodation in Scotland; notes that some 50% of barracks fall into this category as defined by the UK Government; further notes as one example that 60% of units are sub-standard at the Scottish base of 45 Commando Royal Marines, who have served with distinction in conflicts from the Falklands to Iraq and Afghanistan; believes that service personnel deserve adequate accommodation; considers the UK Government’s scheduling of improvements over 20 years to be shameful, and calls for the improvement of these facilities to take place much more quickly so that no service personnel or their families are forced to live in housing that is substandard or inadequate.
