*S3M-2343 George Foulkes: Putting Network Rail Back Into Public Hands—That the Parliament welcomes the Co-operative Party’s campaign to make Network Rail the people’s rail; supports the premise of the campaign to make Network Rail more democratic and accountable to the taxpayer and passengers and not just those appointed by the board; acknowledges that since it was created as a not-for-profit replacement for Railtrack, Network Rail has reduced delays and improved safety but is still a long way from the service that customers deserve; notes the findings of the House of Commons Transport Committee that the current governance structure of Network Rail is inadequate; believes that by introducing a mutually-owned and publicly-run rail network passengers will have more say in how the service is run and should be improved; further believes that it is obscene that Network Rail executives receive excessive bonuses while misery and inconvenience is regularly suffered by passengers, and calls on all MSPs to add their support to the Co-operative Party’s campaign to give passengers back their rail service.
