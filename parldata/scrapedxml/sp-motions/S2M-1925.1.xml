 *S2M-1925.1 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Ambitious, Excellent Schools—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "acknowledges the Scottish Executive’s agenda described in Ambitious, Excellent Schools; recognises, however, that, in order to achieve its aim of promoting ambition and encouraging excellence, schools must be granted greater autonomy and that public funds must be allowed to follow the pupil to any school of the parents’ choosing so that parents can exercise genuine choice between schools and not just within schools, encouraging the expansion of popular schools and the upgrading of unsuccessful schools."
