 *S3M-104 Sandra White: Classroom Assistant Action Group—That the Parliament notes the increasingly vital role that classroom assistants play in supporting teachers and pupils, with many now taking groups for reading and maths and working with disruptive or special care pupils, but expresses serious concern over the Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland’s recent report which found that Scotland’s classroom assistants receive "scandalously low wages" and are undervalued; welcomes the recommendations contained in the report calling for a national action group led by local authorities in partnership with the Scottish Executive and trade unions, and urges the Executive to give due consideration to these proposals. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Ken Macintosh*, Stuart McMillan*, Patrick Harvie*, Rob Gibson*, Alex Neil*, Bill Wilson*, Christina McKelvie*, John Wilson*, Gil Paterson*
