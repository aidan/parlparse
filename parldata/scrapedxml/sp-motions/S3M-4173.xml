 *S3M-4173 Robert Brown: Withdrawal of Funding from Couple Counselling Glasgow—That the Parliament is extremely concerned and disappointed at the withdrawal by Glasgow City Council of funding from Couple Counselling Glasgow; notes that this organisation, formerly the Glasgow Marriage Guidance Council, has been in existence since 1947 and that it provides relationship and counselling services to around 1,000 couples a year; is concerned that the need for such services both in Greater Glasgow and across Scotland is growing during the present economic crisis; further notes that the type of family support and counselling provided by Couple Counselling Glasgow and related organisations across Scotland contributes to reducing relationship breakdown and stress for many couples and affected children; calls on Glasgow City Council to reconsider its decision as a matter of urgency, and, noting that the UK Government has just provided £1 million to Relate in England, urges the Scottish Government to discuss the situation with the council and other relevant bodies with a view to securing ongoing funding to support the vital work of Couple Counselling Glasgow within a strategic framework of family support for Scotland.
