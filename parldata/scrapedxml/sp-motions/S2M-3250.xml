*S2M-3250 Ms Sandra White: Implement the National Language Strategy—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to accelerate the timetable for introducing a national language strategy in Scotland as a means to improving access to services for Scotland’s ethnic minority population; recognises that many people from an ethnic minority background have unequal access to a range of public services because of inadequate provision and the lack of a national language framework; notes that despite being part of the Executive’s Partnership Agreement, signed in 2003, no apparent work on this strategy appears to have taken place, and finally further notes that the subsequent lack of strategy is leading to greater social exclusion, isolation and inequality among Scotland’s ethnic minorities.
