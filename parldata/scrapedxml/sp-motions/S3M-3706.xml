 *S3M-3706 Rob Gibson: Primark’s New Ethical Trading Director—That the Parliament welcomes the appointment of Katherine Kirk as Primark’s first ever Ethical Trading Director; notes that, since being ranked the least ethical of the main clothing stores in 2005 by Ethical Consumer magazine, Primark has raised its rank to the upper half of the league table; notes with concern the ongoing investigation by the Ethical Trading Initiative into Primark’s use of child labour in India but acknowledges the appointment as a basic step forward in ending human rights abuses and poverty wages in its supply chain, and calls on Primark to continue demonstrating its new-found commitment to ethics reform through firm actions and results, not simply through job appointments.
