 *S1M-2745# Nicola Sturgeon: Acute Services-That the Parliament notes recent developments in the on-going acute services review in the NHS Greater Glasgow Health Board area; supports the efforts of the board to modernise hospital services, but considers that "modernisation" must equal improvement; further notes continuing public concern about aspects of the review, including the proposed reduction of accident and emergency departments, the viability of stand-alone ACADs, and the number of in-patient beds across the city, and believes that those responsible for taking the final decisions should ensure that these concerns are adequately addressed.
