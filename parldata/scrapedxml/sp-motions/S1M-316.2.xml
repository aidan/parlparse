*S1M-316.2 Mr Alex Salmond: Law and Order—As an amendment to motion (S1M-316) in the name of Phil Gallie, leave out from "expresses" to end and insert "notes with concern the decreasing numbers of serving police officers; expresses deep concern at the prison closure programme, as a result of the Scottish Executive’s re-allocation of £13 million of Scottish Prison Service funding, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to recognise that effective criminal justice is one in which adequate resources are provided for the police and the prison service as well as victims of crime, none of whom are well served under the present system."
