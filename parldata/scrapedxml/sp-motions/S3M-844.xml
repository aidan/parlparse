*S3M-844 Rhona Brankin: Wheels of Time—That the Parliament notes the success of Wheels of Time, a joint project between National Museums Scotland and the Rural and Urban Training Scheme, part-funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, which saw 10 young people who had not been attending school for a variety of reasons restore a 1914 motorcycle; notes that participants developed a variety of skills and a personal sense of achievement by researching the motorcycle industry, learning about mechanics and conservation and seeing the final display at the National Museum of Scotland; notes that six participants obtained SQA modules and two are now in full-time further education as a result of the project; notes the potential of such projects to help disadvantaged or troubled young people; congratulates all participants, and urges MSPs to support this and similar projects across Scotland by raising awareness and working to ensure adequate funding and support.
