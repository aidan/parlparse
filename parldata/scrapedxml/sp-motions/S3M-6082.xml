 *S3M-6082 Patrick Harvie: Save Our Sound UK Campaign—That the Parliament agrees with the Save Our Sound UK campaign that wireless microphones are essential to live music, musical theatre, television production and sporting, community and charity events throughout the country; notes that Ofcom’s impending clearance and sale of the 800 MHz and 600 MHz frequency bands currently employed for these purposes will render valuable stocks of wireless microphones useless; further notes that Ofcom has consulted on a compensation package for affected organisations and businesses, yet understands that it is the UK Government and not Ofcom that will make the final decisions; is deeply concerned that any package based on residual value will be insufficient to cover the full costs of replacing redundant equipment and inevitably leave those affected worse off, and, finally, considers that, in order to protect vital cultural and creative events across the United Kingdom, the UK Government must step in where Ofcom cannot and spend what will inevitably be a small proportion of the proceeds from the frequency auction to ensure that affected organisations are fully reimbursed for the financial costs that they will bear as a result of the UK Government’s decision to make this change.
