*S2M-1820 Rosie Kane: Waste Recycling at Holyrood—That the Parliament notes with concern the lack of recycling facilities available within the new Holyrood complex; is further concerned that a new building which accommodates an Executive dedicated to addressing Scotland’s waste problems had no recycling facilities installed as a matter of course, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to install proper recycling facilities for all paper, plastic, tin and glass waste as a matter of urgency.
