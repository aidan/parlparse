 * S2M-2842# Tommy Sheridan: Make 2 July 2005 Free Transport Day—That the Parliament recognises the obscene reality of 30,000 human lives being prematurely snuffed out by poverty across our world each day; further recognises the opportunity presented to Scotland for a huge protest against such unnecessary and unacceptable poverty in a world as rich as ours on 2 July 2005 in Edinburgh at the Make Poverty History march and rally, and, to facilitate the maximum participation in this one-off opportunity for Scots to stand up in the name of the world’s poor, considers that 2 July should be declared “Free Transport Day” to and from Edinburgh and the necessary arrangements made for trains, buses and ferries to be free for those travelling to the Make Poverty History demonstration on that day.
