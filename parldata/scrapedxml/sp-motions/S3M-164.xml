*S3M-164 Christine Grahame: Dynamic Teleswitched Tariff—That the Parliament notes with concern that some 200,000 consumers in Scotland are affected by Scottish Power’s dynamic teleswitched tariff which, because of its complexities of metering and billing, effectively deprives them of choice as the difficulty and cost of operating these switches deters alternative suppliers from competing for customers; further notes that some of these consumers are on fixed and low incomes and that the lack of a realistic alternative also deprives consumers of choices such as online accounts, green tariffs or capped rates, and urges Ofgem to amend condition 32 of the standard licence conditions to stipulate the range and specific type of tariffs to be made available to consumers.
