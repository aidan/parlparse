*S3M-6337 Christine Grahame: Social Enterprises and Food—That the Parliament supports the work of the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition in raising the profile of Scotland’s growing numbers of dynamic social enterprises working in food cultivation, processing, distribution, education, catering and retail; recognises the contribution that they make to Scotland’s £7.5 billion food and drink industry, providing jobs and training in the local community, reducing food miles and education on healthy eating, and further believes that these social businesses will play a key role in growing Scotland’s economy in 2010, a year that is focusing on Scotland’s food and drink industry.
