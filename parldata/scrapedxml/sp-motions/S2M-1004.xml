*S2M-1004 Mr Mark Ruskell: Westminster Committee on GM Crops-That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Westminster Environmental Audit Committee's report, GM Food - Evaluating the Farm Scale Trials, and its conclusion that the commercialisation of genetically modified (GM) crops on the basis of the results of the farm scale trials would be irresponsible and calls on the Scottish Executive to endorse this view and uphold the precautionary principle in relation to GM crops.
