*S1M-1254 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Scotland's Participation in Future Olympic Games—That the Parliament congratulates all British participants in the recent Sydney Olympic Games; notes that the 199 countries participating excluded one of Europe’s oldest nations, Scotland; notes that, despite the Minister for Children and Education’s statement on 28 September (Official Report, col. 792-3), there is no recognised Olympic Committee for each nation state; is pleased that American Samoa, Aruba, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Guam, Hong Kong, Netherlands Antilles, Palestine, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands all entered teams in the Olympics despite their non-independent status; recognises that Scotland competes in the cricket, football and rugby union world cups and Commonwealth Games in its own right; believes that Scotland should compete in the Athens and subsequent Olympic Games in its own right, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to work to that end.
