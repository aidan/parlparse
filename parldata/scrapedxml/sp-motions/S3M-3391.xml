 *S3M-3391 Robin Harper: Public Supports Pollution-linked Parking Charges in Edinburgh—That the Parliament notes that a scheme proposed by Green councillors in Edinburgh to link parking permit charges to car pollution has won overwhelming, three to one, public support after a three-month consultation; also notes that the initiative is designed to encourage the use of more climate-friendly vehicles and discourage gas guzzlers by creating a sliding scale of permit charges according to vehicle carbon dioxide emission ratings in place of the current fixed charge; further notes that the City of Edinburgh Council will not raise any extra revenue from the proposed scheme; notes that, under the proposal, charges for 80% of vehicles will be reduced or remain the same, including family-sized vehicles, with only the most polluting, or luxury, vehicles in band G paying more; considers that the result of the consultation sends an important message that public appetite for action on climate change needs a response from politicians to achieve cuts in carbon emissions, and hopes that the groundbreaking initiative is introduced in Edinburgh and other areas of Scotland.
