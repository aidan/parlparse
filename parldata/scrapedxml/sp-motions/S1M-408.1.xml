*S1M-408.1 Bill Aitken: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S1M-408) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the Executive’s proposals to achieve this and notes that the Executive will bring forward a Housing Bill; calls upon the Executive to include within this Bill measures to deal with the alarming problem of homelessness which has increased dramatically since May 1997; welcomes the Executive’s commitment to extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants, but emphasises that measures may be necessary to safeguard individual Associations where the take-up of this right could prejudice the operation, viability or success of these Associations."
