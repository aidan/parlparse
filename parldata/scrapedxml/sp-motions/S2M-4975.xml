*S2M-4975 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Congratulations to LGBT Youth Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates LGBT Youth Scotland on its work in tackling homophobic bullying in schools; notes that this campaign raises awareness of inequality and injustice for LGBT youngsters in schools and promotes acceptance and tolerance amongst children and young people, not just for the LGBT community but for all of Scotland’s children and young people, and calls on all organisations working with young people, including the established churches, to recognise and support the work of LGBT Youth Scotland. Supported by: Campbell Martin*, Tommy Sheridan*
