S2M-04036.2 Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD): As an amendment to motion S2M-04036 in the name of Rob Gibson (Scottish Water), leave out from ",despite" to end and insert "Scottish Water’s draft business plan of April 2005 stated that achieving Scottish Ministers' objectives for 2006 to 2010 would require a capital investment programme of £3.7 billion and a doubling in customer charges; notes that the Water Industry Commission’s determination of charges for 2006 to 2010 allowed Scottish Water a capital investment programme of £2.1 billion and charges rising by less than the rate of inflation to achieve the objectives; notes that Scottish Water accepted the determination but its plan demonstrating how it would deliver the objectives within the limits set by the determination was judged by the Executive, supported by the regulators, not to meet the requirements in a number of material aspects; notes that the Executive has required Scottish Water to produce a new plan which will command the confidence of Ministers and regulators,and considers these actions by the Executive to represent good stewardship of Scottish Water in the public and customer interest."
