*S3M-2401 Rob Gibson: Highlands and Islands-Friendly Quality Mark—That the Parliament supports a proposal from Sanday Community Council in Orkney for the Scottish Government to award a Highlands and Islands-friendly quality mark for those mail order companies and couriers that do not charge extra for delivering goods to postcodes in the Highlands and Islands; considers that the extra charges that some firms impose for customers in remote and rural areas are unfair, unjust and effectively treat those residents as second-class citizens; welcomes the idea of promoting firms that practise a "one price for all" policy, and calls on those firms that impose extra costs for deliveries to rural areas and islands to follow best practice examples such as Amazon and the Royal Mail.
