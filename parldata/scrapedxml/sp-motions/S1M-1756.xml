*S1M-1756 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Scottish Working People's History Trust and Working Class History Museums—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Working People's History Trust on the publication of the 2nd volume of oral recollections entitled Bondagers (female bonded farm workers); notes that the Trust is committed to preserving for future generations, through deposit in public libraries and museums in Scotland, all surviving documentary and oral sources of working people's history north of the Border; further notes that the Trust receives no National Lottery funding as it is revenue based, depends entirely on voluntary donations and operates with only one part-time researcher and volunteers, yet continues to produce invaluable work on the history of Scotland, and is concerned at the threat for the future faced by other outlets dedicated to working class history such as Springburn Railway Museum.
