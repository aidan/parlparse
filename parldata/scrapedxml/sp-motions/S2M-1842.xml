*S2M-1842# Robert Brown: Right to Read Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates RNIB Scotland, and other Right to Read consortium members, on organising activities to mark Right to Read Week in Scotland, beginning on 15 November 2004; supports the call for many more books to be made available in alternative formats such as large-print or audio, at the same time and same price as print versions, so that the estimated 300,000 people in Scotland who are either blind or partially-sighted, or have dyslexia or other impediments to reading ordinary print can, nonetheless, enjoy the right to read; is aware that around 95% of books are currently never made available in alternative formats; is conscious that the large majority of unabridged books that are made available in formats such as audio or large-print are transcribed by charities relying on public donations and is concerned that some blind and partially-sighted school pupils in Scotland do not always receive curriculum materials in their preferred format at the same time as their sighted classmates, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review and develop the support offered to the small network of charitable transcription services in Scotland, fund the roll-out across Scotland of the successfully-piloted "DAISY" cd-rom technology which allows blind and partially-sighted pupils and students to access their curriculum texts, encourage local authorities to fully fund membership fees to the RNIB Talking Books service, work to develop the best means of co-ordinating Scottish efforts to advance the Right to Read agenda in conjunction with local government, publishers, authors, bookshops and libraries and make representations to Her Majesty’s Government to zero-rate VAT on audio books.
