*S2M-167 Tommy Sheridan: Escalating Costs of the Parliament Building-That the Parliament calls for the inquiry into the escalating costs of the new Parliament building to identify both the politicians and senior public servants responsible for the current crisis; believes that those responsible should be required to resign or be disciplined, including the relevant finance ministers who approved the increased costs; further calls for the bill for the new Parliament building to be sent to Her Majesty's Government, where the original decision and flawed contract was decided, and believes that the people of Scotland should not see their essential public services cut to pay for this white elephant.
