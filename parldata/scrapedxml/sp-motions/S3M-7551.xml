*S3M-7551 Bill Butler: Glas-goals Spectacular Success—That the Parliament celebrates what it considers the spectacular success of the Evening Times Glas-goals campaign and its three targets of encouraging Glaswegians to walk or run a million miles, stub out a million cigarettes and shed half a million pounds in weight over the course of 2010 through a series of imaginative and highly successful events; applauds the fact that Glas-goals has smashed all three targets; praises the Evening Times for reporting positively over the course of the campaign on a wide range of activities throughout the city that promote healthy lifestyles and challenge the city’s poor public health record, and views Glas-goals as the perfect springboard to begin building a lasting physical and sporting legacy in the approach to the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
