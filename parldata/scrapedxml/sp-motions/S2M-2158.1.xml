 *S2M-2158.1 Colin Fox: Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffendingâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2158) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "the way" to end and insert ", since 80% of male and female prisoners represent no danger to the public, non-custodial sentences should be given much greater consideration and support; calls on the Scottish Executive to provide more specially-trained community police officers accountable to the communities that they serve in order to increase public confidence in the justice system, and reaffirms that, in cases where serious crimes have been committed, remission should be earned and fully recognised by both the wider community and the prison population itself."
