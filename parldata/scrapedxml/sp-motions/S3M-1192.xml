*S3M-1192 Cathy Jamieson: A Bypass for Maybole—That the Parliament recognises the significant traffic problems on the A77 in Maybole, South Ayrshire, and the dangers faced by pedestrians using Maybole High Street on a daily basis; welcomes the recognition of a bypass as the most effective solution to these problems, as identified by the STAG Report of June 2006, and the preferred bypass route identified and published by Transport Scotland in October 2007; acknowledges the value for money of constructing a bypass and the benefits that a bypass would bring to the safety and quality of life of Maybole residents, as well as to the historic buildings located on Maybole High Street; commends the efforts and dedication of the Maybole Bypass Committee, local campaigners and the wider community who have campaigned tirelessly for improvements to road safety and for a bypass of the town, and eagerly anticipates an early commitment from the Scottish Executive that will give the go-ahead for the construction of a bypass for Maybole.
