*S1M-2434 Christine Grahame: Prioritising the Borders Economy—That the Parliament notes the report of 7 November 2001 by the Director of Lifelong Care at Scottish Borders Council on the impact in the area of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and, in particular, paragraph 12.1, Economic Impact, where it is estimated that the losses to the Borders economy over the coming year will be £30 million to tourism, £14 million to agriculture and related industries and £27 million to the electronics industry, representing 7% of Borders GDP; expresses concern that Signum Circuits, Selkirk, which re-employed many former Viasystems workers, has now gone into receivership with the immediate redundancy of some 49 employees and with bleak prospects for the remaining 132 employees, in an area with the lowest average earnings in Scotland and an ageing population, and calls upon the Scottish Executive, in the light of these circumstances, to prioritise the Borders as a matter of urgency for future economic investment and funding, including support for local businesses, in order to modernise the area’s infrastructure and thus halt this economic haemorrhage.
