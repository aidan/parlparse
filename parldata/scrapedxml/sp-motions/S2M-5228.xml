*S2M-5228 Jackie Baillie: Scottish Fire and Rescue Services Youth Development Plan—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish fire and rescue services’ youth development plan; recognises that the plan represents a blueprint for the improvement of communication and engagement between the Scottish fire and rescue services and Scotland’s young people; welcomes the plan’s recognition of the positive contribution made by young people in our society and the determination to work with communities, services, agencies and youth organisations to ensure the health, safety and welfare of young people; notes the plan’s positive and practical approach to reducing antisocial behaviour directed against the fire services, and applauds the collaborative efforts of the Scottish Commissioner for Children and Young People, YouthLink Scotland, the Scottish Youth Parliament, the Prince’s Trust, Young Scot and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in inputting to the plan.
