*S2M-2676 Mr Stewart Maxwell: World Health Organisation World Health Day—That the Parliament congratulates the World Health Organisation on World Health Day 2005: Make every mother and child count; acknowledges that the world needs to make the process of childbirth safer for both women and babies; recognises the great strides forward in maternal and child health that have taken place in the developed world in the last 50 years; regrets that the Scottish Executive intends to publish just one of the 29 indicators on the World Health Organisation’s European health for all database, and calls on the Executive to publish the Scottish figures for all the indicators to enable everyone to see where Scotland sits in the league table of maternal and infant health.
