*S3M-37# Elaine Murray: Success of Community Warden Scheme in North West Dumfries—That the Parliament applauds the success of the community warden scheme in north-west Dumfries in tackling antisocial behaviour, promoting alternative activities for young people and working with the police to improve safety in the local community; welcomes the extension of the scheme into other parts of Dumfries and Galloway, such as Annan, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider making further funding available to enable local authorities to increase the numbers of community wardens working in their communities.
