*S3M-5208 Bill Kidd: Boost for Glasgow 2014—That the Parliament welcomes the additional funding for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, which will see an extra £81 million being made available for the success of the Games, with £59 million coming from the Scottish Government, £9 million from Glasgow City Council and £13 million from the Organising Committee’s commercial activities, and believes that the constructive negotiations that have led to this announcement are a clear demonstration of the determination of the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council to work together in ensuring the successful delivery of Glasgow 2014 and its legacy project to the benefit of Glasgow and Scotland as a whole.
