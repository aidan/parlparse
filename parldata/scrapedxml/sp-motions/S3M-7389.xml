*S3M-7389 Gil Paterson: Recognition of Unsung Hero—That the Parliament congratulates Mr Tom Scott of Inchmurrin Island on reaching the grand age of 85 and, in doing so, recognises what it considers his magnificent contribution to society, with his record of rescuing over 60 people from the waters of Loch Lomond over many years; considers Mr Scott’s actions valiant and notes that he acted as a private citizen and not as a recognised, organised entity; further appreciates and supports his legacy being carried forward by his family members, and wishes to record its thanks for what it sees as a vital voluntary public service.
