*S3M-4357 Jack McConnell: Good Luck to Edinburgh Global Partnerships Students—That the Parliament wishes all of the students of Edinburgh Global Partnerships (EGP) well with their volunteering projects over the summer; notes that the aim of EGP is not to conduct large-scale aid projects but rather to get involved with local people in communities in the developing world, helping them financially and physically to realise projects that they believe are of most importance to their communities; notes that projects will take place in Malawi, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, India and Mongolia, and hopes that all of the volunteers enjoy taking part in the projects that will not only be beneficial to them but to the many people whom they are helping.
