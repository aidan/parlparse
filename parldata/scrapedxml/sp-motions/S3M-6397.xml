*S3M-6397Helen Eadie:Scottish Gas Contractorsâ€”That the Parliament condemns reports that a Fife resident who applied for the energy assistance package (EAP) was visited by contractors from Perth, Dundee and Shotts, but not from Fife; considers that, as the administrator of the EAP, the Scottish Executive holds ultimate responsibility for how the package is managed and for ensuring that its key objectives are met; believes that, as Scottish Gas has been contracted as managing agents to administer the scheme, it has a duty to ensure that, where packages are awarded, they are sub-contracted out to as many local independent firms as possible, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review how the tender process for contracts for stage four assistance is managed so that local jobs and services can be protected and regeneration further assisted in those areas where unemployment rates are still what is considered to be unacceptably high.
