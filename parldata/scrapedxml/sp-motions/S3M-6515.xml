*S3M-6515 Robin Harper: Young Carers in Scotland—That the Parliament, during Carers Week 2010, acknowledges the contribution made by Scotland’s 100,000 young carers in providing support to family members who are disabled, ill, frail or affected by drugs and alcohol misuse and commends the work of young carers projects across Edinburgh, the Lothians and Scotland as they provide both the time and space to enable young carers to be children first and the support needed to help them achieve their full personal and academic potential in increasingly challenging economic circumstances.
