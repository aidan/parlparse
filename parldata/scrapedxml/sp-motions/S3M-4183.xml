 *S3M-4183 Bill Kidd: Further Radiation Leaks from British Submarines—That the Parliament notes with concern reports of a further two leaks of radioactive waste from British submarines, including one at Devonport in March 2009; notes that the number of radioactive waste leaks from nuclear submarines now stands at nine in the last 12 years, which includes a number of safety breaches at the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarine base at Faslane, near Glasgow; believes that these safety breaches bring into doubt the ability of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) sufficiently to administer rudimentary safety regulations, and, considering that the United Kingdom’s entire nuclear submarine fleet is to be based at Faslane from 2017, believes that the MoD cannot remain immune to regulation by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in Scotland in light of this catalogue of grave failures.
