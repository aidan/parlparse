*S3M-7633 Margaret Mitchell: Buchanan Centre, Coatbridgeâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges the state-of-the-art, purpose-built Buchanan Centre in Coatbridge, which officially opened in December 2010; welcomes the centre, which houses a first-stop-shop registration office and library as well as GP and dental practices; notes that the building is home to the Dental Outreach Centre for dental students, which offers facilities for dental postgraduate training; further notes that the centre is the result of a partnership between North Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Education for Scotland and the University of Glasgow, and hopes that the centre, which it considers brings together community services in an accessible, open and friendly environment, will prove to be an example for others to follow.
