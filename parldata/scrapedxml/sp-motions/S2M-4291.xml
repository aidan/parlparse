*S2M-4291 Christine Grahame: Gardening Scotland and Forth Road Bridge Closures—That the Parliament recognises that Gardening Scotland has become established, since its inception some six years ago, as Scotland’s premier national horticultural show, incorporating an ever-widening range of arts, crafts and environmentally friendly and cultural aspects, with just over 400 exhibitors and traders; notes that some 40% of exhibitors are Scottish and that some 26,000 to 33,000 people attend over the three days of the show at Ingliston; is concerned that in the last two years lane closures on the Forth Road Bridge have had a detrimental impact on attendances, with consequential impact on businesses; notes that for the duration of the Royal Highland Show bridge works are apparently to be suspended, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to require equivalent concessions for Gardening Scotland.
