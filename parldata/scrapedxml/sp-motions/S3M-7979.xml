*S3M-7979 Robert Brown: British Stammering Association—That the Parliament commends the work of the British Stammering Association Scotland (BSA Scotland), which seeks, among other things, to promote the successful self-management of stammering as a long-term condition; notes that the organisation is currently engaged in the delivery of a project funded by the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland, which focuses on giving support to new and existing self-management groups, using new technology and social media to reach those people who find it difficult to access those groups and developing a self-management toolkit for people who stammer; further notes that BSA Scotland recently held what was considered a very successful public awareness and engagement event, the Glasgow Open Day, and is now planning another similar event for Edinburgh; considers that the release of the film, The King’s Speech, has created unprecedented interest in stammering and through its success with audiences, critics and awards-givers alike continues to draw attention to this complex, multifactorial and much-misunderstood communication disability; recognises that children, young people and adults who stammer will often experience bullying in education and discrimination in the workplace and, as such, will sometimes underachieve educationally, economically, socially and culturally, and supports the ongoing good work of the association in campaigning on behalf of and supporting people of all ages whose lives are affected by stammering.
