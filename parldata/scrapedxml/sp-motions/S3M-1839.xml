*S3M-1839♦ Nigel Don: Family Law Disputes—That the Parliament recognises that current arrangements for settling family law disputes could be improved and that current law still discriminates against parents who are not married; notes that parents can find it difficult or impossible to enforce contact orders where the other parent is unco-operative and that disputes where broken families live in more than one jurisdiction within the United Kingdom are unnecessarily difficult to resolve; further notes that these issues are particularly relevant due to recent cases in the north east; encourages current moves by Scotland’s legal profession towards collaborative dispute resolution, and notes with interest the new system of less adversarial trials being developed in Australia.
