*S2M-2117.2 David Mundell: Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebrides—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2117) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "notes the continued uncertainty inflicted upon Caledonian MacBrayne, its employees and customers as a result of the Scottish Executive’s handling of the tendering process; regrets that Clyde and Hebridean ferry services are going out to tender purely to satisfy the wishes of the European Commission, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put the interests of our island communities before those of the European Commission."
