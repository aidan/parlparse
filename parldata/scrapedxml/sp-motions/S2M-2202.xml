*S2M-2202 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Cessation of Dumping of Sewage Sludge at Auchlin and Upper Beoch, Ayrshire—That the Parliament believes that, in light of the contamination of water courses at Auchlin, Skares and the subsequent cessation of land remediation using sewage sludge at Upper Beoch and Auchlin, Ayrshire, there should be a moratorium on the use of sewage sludge in land remediation pending a full scientific inquiry, and calls on the Scottish Executive to initiate such an inquiry as a matter of urgency, which should include (a) a full scientific investigation of the effects of the use of sewage sludge on land reclamation, (b) a full scientific investigation of health risks of the use of sewage sludge on land reclamation, (c) a full scientific investigation into environmental effects of the use of sewage sludge, taking account of the proximity principle regarding the transportation of such material, (d) the financial arrangements with regard to the transportation and dumping of sewage sludge, (e) the democratic principle of involving the community in the decision to allow the dumping of sewage sludge and a third party right of appeal and (f) an investigation of all the alternative means to dispose of sewage sludge.
