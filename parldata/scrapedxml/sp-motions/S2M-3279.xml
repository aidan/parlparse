 *S2M-3279 Dr Jean Turner: NHS Greater Glasgow - Bed Review Consultation Time Should Be Longer—That the Parliament urges NHS Greater Glasgow to reconsider the consultation period for the future of acute in-patient beds in greater Glasgow; notes that the bed-modelling document was only made public at a NHS Greater Glasgow board meeting on 26 July 2005, with views and comments to be received by mid-September 2005; further notes that a consultation of this magnitude needs more that seven weeks, especially given that the consultation started during the summer, and believes that NHS Greater Glasgow’s own statement that "developing proposals for service redesign and the related requirement for in-patient beds for a decade in advance is a difficult and challenging endeavour" should reinforce the call for a longer consultation period so that all interested parties and members of the public should be able to have their views considered.
