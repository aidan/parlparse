*S2M-4484 Jackie Baillie: Maid of the Loch—That the Parliament commends the work of the Loch Lomond Steamship Company in its efforts to make the Maid of the Loch seaworthy; notes that the ship was built in 1953 and is registered as a historic vessel, but was taken out of commission in 1981 and has since been moored at Balloch; recognises that in 2005 the Loch Lomond Steamship Company rebuilt the slipway in order for the ship to be taken out of the water to assess what work must be undertaken for it to become seaworthy again; considers that tourism is vital to the local economy and that the Maid of the Loch would further enhance the reputation of local attractions; congratulates all those volunteers who have been involved in fund-raising and the preservation of the ship, and believes that one day soon the Maid of the Loch will sail again.
