*S3M-2276 Dr Richard Simpson: Congratulating Fife Drug and Alcohol Services—That the Parliament congratulates all those working in statutory and voluntary sector drug and alcohol services in Fife on the massive improvements achieved in reducing waiting times for access to services; further congratulates them for developing an increased range of services, particularly the introduction of triage assessment in April 2008 via easy access/drop-in clinics, which are likely to help more substance misusers to achieve progress in tackling their problems more quickly, and looks forward to the application of the new funding for alcohol problem identification, brief intervention, treatment and support, helping to consolidate and develop these services in a fully integrated way.
