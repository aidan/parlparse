*S3M-31 Jeremy Purvis: Support a Rail Link to the Borders—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the commitment in the SNP’s 2007 election manifesto to redirect funding from the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link (EARL); believes that the scheme approved by the Parliament is a crucial complementary scheme to the Waverley rail project, ensuring connectivity of the Borders and Midlothian to Edinburgh Airport without a change, and further believes that a halting of the EARL scheme also brings with it concern over any subsequent scheme and that the Parliament should reassert support for both the Waverley rail project and the EARL scheme.
