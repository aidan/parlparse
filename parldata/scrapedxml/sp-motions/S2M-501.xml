*S2M-501 Iain Smith: Unauthorised GM Material in Crop Trials-That the Parliament notes with concern the results of the Scottish Agriculture Science Agency's GM Inspectorate's investigation into the GM seed used in the latest round of farm scale trials in Scotland, which revealed that approximately 5.5% of material planted was genetically modified seed not authorised under the terms of the release consent for the trials; welcomes the investigation by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment into recommendations for improvements to the inspection and enforcement systems in place; further welcomes the referral of this case by the Scottish Executive to the Procurator Fiscal, and believes that since some GM seedlot suppliers are unable to provide the necessary level of biosecurity for the field trials, they should not be involved in commercial planting and therefore calls on the Executive to refuse any further licences for the planting of genetically modified material, for either field trials or commercial purposes.
