*S3M-3476 Angela Constance: Send My Friend to School Campaignâ€”That the Parliament applauds the ideals of the Send my Friend to School campaign and the work that it is doing to remind and lobby the United Kingdom and other countries across the world about their promised commitment to provide the monetary support needed to make primary schooling available to all children worldwide by 2015; commends the work that the campaign is undertaking to educate schoolchildren in the UK about the value of education; congratulates Meldrum Primary School in Livingston and other schools in the UK involved in this initiative for their efforts in learning and promoting the ideals of the Send my Friend to School campaign; is concerned that 72 million children across the world, or one in nine children, are missing out on an education, and offers its sincere hope that all governments that promised funding will be true to their promises and to the spirit of the agreement so that all children worldwide will receive a free primary education by the target year of 2015.
