*S2M-69# Sarah Boyack: Fair Credit Schemes—That the Parliament welcomes the recently published in-depth report into personal debt in the UK, In Too Deep, produced by the citizens advice bureau (CAB) service in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland; acknowledges the Scottish context of the report; notes with concern the report's findings that more people in Scotland blamed low incomes than elsewhere in the UK and more people coped with their debt problem by taking out further borrowing than elsewhere in the UK; further notes that personal debt is nearly always connected to other problems in people’s lives such as loss of job or ill-health; notes that the number of debt cases brought to citizens advice bureaux in Scotland is at an all-time high with nearly 60,000 new debt enquiries last year; recognises the link between CAB clients and MSPs’ constituents and therefore supports the invaluable work of Scotland’s CAB service as a vital provider of free, independent, impartial and comprehensive advice and as the leading voice on the issue of personal debt in Scotland today; welcomes the commitments in A Partnership for a Better Scotland to support the extension of the money advice service, building on the work of the CAB and other bodies to assist those burdened by multiple debt, and considers that the Scottish Executive should increase access to affordable credit for people on very low incomes and, as a matter of urgency, take action on the commitment from A Partnership for a Better Scotland to work with the Department of Trade and Industry to introduce fairer credit schemes and protection from exorbitant interest rates.
