 *S3M-1353 Margaret Curran: British Heart Foundation—That the Parliament congratulates British Heart Foundation Scotland for the third phase of its Food 4Thought campaign encouraging children to eat more healthily; notes that 34% of primary 7s are overweight or obese and that radical action is required to tackle the rising tide of obesity; welcomes the campaign’s focus on the marketing tricks used by manufacturers of foods high in fat, sugar and salt to target children; is concerned that current regulations on broadcast advertising are insufficient as they do not offer a complete pre-watershed ban on advertising unhealthy food, meaning that some of the most popular shows with children, such as The X Factor, are not covered; notes that non-broadcast marketing of unhealthy food on the internet, via text messages, on cinema advertisements and on packaging remains unregulated; believes that young people deserve to be protected from advertising of this kind, which undermines the fight against obesity in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government to act decisively to protect children from insidious junk food marketing in all settings.
