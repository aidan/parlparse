*S2M-5186 Shiona Baird: Commercial Whalingâ€”That the Parliament deplores the continuation of commercial whaling, whether overtly or under the guise of scientific research, by Iceland, Norway and Japan; condemns the economic folly of this activity, in the absence of a market for whalemeat, in addition to its moral indefensibility; further condemns the expansion of whaling from minke whales to include fin whale and other species and, while recognising the right of indigenous peoples to hunt whales on a subsistence basis, congratulates the UK Government for its firm stance against whaling, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations, both through the UK Government and directly where possible, to the whaling nations to cease whaling immediately.
