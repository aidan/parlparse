 *S3M-2590 Helen Eadie: We are Proud of Lochgelly’s Little Jack Thomson—That the Parliament congratulates three-year-old little Jack Thomson of Lochgelly who saved his mum’s life by phoning 999 not just once but a second time after the first mobile failed; congratulates and commends all of the emergency service staff who took Jack’s call for help so seriously and tracked the call to the address to which the ambulance services attended; is thankful for the collective effort in saving Jack’s mum Leanne’s life, and hopes that leaders of all our political parties will join in welcoming little Jack, his family and all the emergency services teams from Fife who played their part in securing such a phenomenal achievement, to the Parliament where we shall celebrate him.
