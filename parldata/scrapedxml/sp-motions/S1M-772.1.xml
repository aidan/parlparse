*S1M-772.1 Mr Jim Wallace: Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill—As an amendment to motion (S1M-772) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert " notes that the Scottish Executive will:- (a) during the 2001/02 Parliamentary year bring forward legislation to introduce a new system to: (i) abolish the present system of poindings and warrant sales which in many of its aspects is archaic and inhumane and replace it with a modern system that protects those who can’t pay, ending the indignities they suffer, and supports the interests of those who pay their bills regularly; (ii) ensure that those who can pay but won’t are rigorously pursued, including for debts incurred in the course of business; (b) in the meantime, introduce secondary legislation to expand the list of goods exempt from domestic poindings and warrant sales; and (c) establish a working group to consult widely and develop proposals for reforming the law of diligence against moveables, including proposals for debtor protection and debt arrangement schemes; and for these reasons, while agreeing to the principle of abolition of the poindings and warrant sales system, does not agree to the general principles of the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill."
