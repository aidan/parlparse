*S1M-3774# Robert Brown: Lead Pipes in Drinking Water Supplies—That the Parliament notes the continued presence of lead pipes in both parts of the Scottish Water infrastructure and many domestic and business water supplies; notes the serious health hazards associated with lead in drinking water; notes the implications for the treatment of water supplies by Scottish Water and the unreliable nature of information as to the location of such lead pipes, and considers that an urgent review of the issue is needed and that action should be taken to ensure the removal of all lead pipes from drinking water supplies in Scotland as soon as possible and, specifically, to tackle the removal of lead pipes in Glasgow’s older tenement areas.
