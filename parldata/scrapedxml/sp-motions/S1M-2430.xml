*S1M-2430 Tommy Sheridan: Funding of Further Education Colleges-That the Parliament notes the increasing number of industrial disputes affecting Scotland's further education colleges; believes that these disputes are overwhelmingly the result of a flawed funding system arising from colleges being removed from local authority control, thus compelling colleges to adopt aggressive cuts packages in order to satisfy their banks at the expense of proper further education provision; further believes that our further education colleges are tremendous assets to the local communities they serve and to Scotland as a whole, and, in recognition of their value to Scotland, resolves to investigate the re-incorporation of Scotland's colleges under local authority control with democratic and accountable management to ensure secure, long-term funding dictated by educational priorities and not commercial concerns.
