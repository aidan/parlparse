*S3M-7351♦ John Wilson: St Andrew’s Day 2010—That the Parliament reiterates support for the passing of the St Andrew’s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007 to mark St Andrew’s Day on 30 November as a national holiday; considers with regret that very few public bodies have taken on board the spirit of the legislation to fully appreciate that St Andrew’s Day should be granted full public holiday status, and would welcome widespread support for St Andrew’s Day throughout Central Scotland in 2010.
