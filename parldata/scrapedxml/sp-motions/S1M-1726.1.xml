 *S1M-1726.1 Fergus Ewing: Crisis in Rural Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1726) in the name of Alex Johnstone, insert at end "; further resolves that the urgent priority in this crisis is to contain and eradicate foot and mouth disease by means of a policy of slaughter of infected animals, disinfection and movement control; notes that the nature and extent of restrictions upon life in rural communities should be based upon advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer; recognises that the restrictions are creating real financial hardship for those working in tourism, haulage and many other related industries in rural Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government, once the outbreak is brought under control, to consider as a matter of urgency the plight of all of those whose livelihood has been materially affected as a result of this crisis. Supported by: Alasdair Morgan*, Mr Duncan Hamilton*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*
