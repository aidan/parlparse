*S1M-67 Mr Alex Salmond: That the Parliament condemns the privatisation of health, education, transport and other public services through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) schemes; notes the mounting body of evidence that PFI and PPP, introduced by the Conservative Government and continued by the Labour Government, are an inefficient and expensive method of funding vital public services which also undermine the pay and conditions of public service staff; calls upon the Scottish Ministers to disclose the annual expenditure commitments associated with each public project involving private finance, and the rate of return that private partners receive for the capital that they commit; urges the Scottish Ministers to examine alternatives to such private financing, and calls on the Scottish Ministers to bring forward proposals to introduce Scottish Public Service Trusts. Supported by: Mr John Swinney, Ms Nicola Sturgeon, Mrs Kay Ulrich, Fiona Hyslop, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Mr Andrew Wilson, Mr Kenneth Gibson, Michael Russell, Ms Margo MacDonald, Bruce Crawford JP,
