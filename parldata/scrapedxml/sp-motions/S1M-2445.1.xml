*S1M-2445.1 Roseanna Cunningham: Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill - UK Legislation—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2445) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "and agrees" to end and insert "; calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward legislation dealing with the relevant devolved matters, if necessary under the Parliament’s emergency bill procedures, in order that there can be proper consultation with the relevant authorities, companies, agencies and organisations in Scotland, and furthermore notes with concern the new proposals in regard to detention without trial in clauses 21 to 32 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill which are a suspension of the normal Scottish criminal justice procedures and which would breach the European Convention on Human Rights.
