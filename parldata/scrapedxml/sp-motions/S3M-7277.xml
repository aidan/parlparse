 *S3M-7277 Malcolm Chisholm: Congratulations to the Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop—That the Parliament congratulates the Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop, based at Newhaven in the Edinburgh North and Leith constituency, on winning the £3 million Edinburgh Arts Funding Prize gifted by an anonymous donor; understands that the creative laboratories that it will fund will provide a mix of inspiring outdoor and indoor working spaces that will support ambitious artistic projects and support new ways of thinking, learning and relating to the arts; acknowledges the sustained fundraising drive that will also see a new sculpture centre replacing the existing building on the same site, and believes that these two projects will not only benefit artists and open up the workshop to a far wider range of disciplines and partners but will also make it much easier for the local community and the wider public to engage with its activities. Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Kenneth Gibson*, Patricia Ferguson*, Hugh Henry*, Jackie Baillie*
