 *S3M-4858 Tom McCabe: Tomorrow’s People, 25th Anniversary in Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates the national employment charity, Tomorrow’s People, on its 25th anniversary in Scotland; notes that, since its inception in 1984, the charity has been operating in deprived communities across the central belt of Scotland, helping over 10,000 long-term unemployed people on their journeys back into work; acknowledges that, in this time, Tomorrow’s People has been very focused on the plight of socially-excluded and marginalised young people, running successful programmes for 16 to 24-year-olds since 1999; applauds its announcement that, over the next five years, it will expand its Working It Out programme into four new areas across the central belt and Ayrshire; recognises that this programme focuses on disadvantaged young people who have left school with no formal qualifications or who have been involved in drugs, gangs or alcohol-related crime and gives them the opportunity to learn new skills through working on projects in their local communities, and further congratulates Tomorrow’s People on giving these young people the confidence and self-belief to help them change their lives forever and get out of the dangerous cycle of unemployment and crime that many find themselves in today.
