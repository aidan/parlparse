 *S2M-5099# Mr David Davidson: World Diabetes Day 2006—That the Parliament expresses its support for World Diabetes Day 2006 on 14 November and the launch of the year-long campaign to raise awareness of the impact of diabetes among disadvantaged and vulnerable groups; notes the campaign’s message that every person with diabetes, or at risk of diabetes, deserves the best quality of education, prevention and care that is possible; is concerned that people on the lowest incomes are around twice as likely as those on the highest incomes to develop type 2 diabetes and that the prevalence of diabetes in the most deprived areas is over two-thirds higher than in the most affluent; further notes that black and minority ethnic groups are at least five times more likely to develop diabetes than their Caucasian counterparts and are more likely to live in more deprived areas; recognises the developing epidemic of diabetes in young people in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups are fully addressed in the roll-out of the Scottish Diabetes Framework Action Plan and that resources for diabetes awareness, screening and early intervention treatment to reduce long-term costs to the NHS are made available to all of Scotland’s NHS boards. Supported by: Mrs Nanette Milne*, Carolyn Leckie*, Frances Curran*, Rosie Kane*, Mike Pringle*, Christine Grahame*, Tommy Sheridan*, Rob Gibson*, Eleanor Scott*, John Scott*, Scott Barrie*, Alex Fergusson*, Dave Petrie*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, John Swinburne*, Murdo Fraser*, Donald Gorrie*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Kate Maclean*, Chris Ballance*, Robin Harper*, Bill Butler*, Bill Aitken*
