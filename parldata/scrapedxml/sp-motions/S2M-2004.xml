*S2M-2004 Patrick Harvie: Fluoridation—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive on its decision to abandon plans to introduce fluoride into the public water supply; believes that the quality of research into the health impacts of fluoridation of drinking water has been too poor to establish whether or not it is harmful; recognises that the European Convention on Human Rights clearly states that individuals have the right not be medicated without their consent; acknowledges the appalling state of oral health in Glasgow; welcomes the proposals on proactive dentistry, maintaining good oral hygiene and tackling poor diet contained in NHS Greater Glasgow’s Oral Health Strategy, and urges the board to use the Executive’s announcement on fluoridation as an opportunity to categorically rule out any future proposal to introduce fluoride to Glasgow’s drinking water supply.
