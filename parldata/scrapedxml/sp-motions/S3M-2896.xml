*S3M-2896 Nigel Don: Aberdeen Bus Fare Reductions—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by First that it intends to reduce a number of bus fares in Aberdeen; considers that this is a positive step in the right direction in the city of First’s birth, which has seen the highest fares in Scotland for a number of years; hopes that there will be an ongoing review of the fare levels in Aberdeen to ensure that bus fares are pegged at a level that is both affordable and attractive to customers in order to encourage them to leave their cars at home; congratulates the administration of Aberdeen City Council for raising the issue with First, and calls for a continued dialogue between the council and First to ensure that the needs of the public are given full consideration in future.
