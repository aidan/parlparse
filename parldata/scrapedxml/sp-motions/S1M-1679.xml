 *S1M-1679 Michael Russell: Additional Funding to Scottish Opera—That the Parliament notes that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Culture has yet to give the Parliament and the people of Scotland any reason for allocating an additional £1 million to Scottish Opera from the budget of the Scottish Arts Council despite being given an opportunity to do so in response to question S1O-2955 at Question Time on Thursday 15 February 2001; reminds the Minister that having a power of direction is not sufficient justification for using it as he himself indicated during the Scottish Qualifications Authority crisis, and calls upon the Minister to make a full Ministerial statement to the Parliament giving his reasons for the decision and considers that, until he does so, he is failing to meet the founding principles of openness and accessibility which are meant to underpin the work of the new Scottish democracy.
