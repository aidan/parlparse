 *S3M-7993 Pauline McNeill: Support for the Libyan People—That the Parliament supports the citizens of Libya in what it considers their brave fight for freedom; calls on the Scottish and UK governments to condemn unequivocally Muammar Gaddafi for the reported brutal murder of hundreds of unarmed protesters in Libya; recognises and applauds those sections of the Libyan armed forces who, in an echo of what it sees as the noble and uplifting scenes in neighbouring Egypt, have defected from the Libyan regime to join the protesters, and further calls on the international community to support the Libyan people in their struggle for democracy and peace.
