*S3M-712.1 Sarah Boyack: Disappointment at Labour Group Voting Against Rescue Package for Scotland’s Farmers and Crofters—As an amendment to motion (S3M-712) in the name of Aileen Campbell, leave out from "grave" to end and insert "its support for Members across the Parliament who have worked to support Scotland’s farmers, crofters and rural communities during the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease; notes that Labour’s amendment on 24 October 2007 supported a more comprehensive package for farmers, crofters and rural communities than that put forward by the SNP Government; welcomes the role played by Labour MSPs and others in securing a derogation on drivers’ hours, and encourages Members across the Parliament to work together in the interests of Scotland’s rural communities to secure a sustainable footing for farmers and crofters into the future." Supported by: Elaine Murray*, Elaine Smith*, Rhoda Grant*, Peter Peacock*, James Kelly*, David Stewart*, Mr Frank McAveety*, George Foulkes*, Des McNulty*, Iain Gray*, Claire Baker*, John Park*, Marlyn Glen*, Hugh Henry*, David Whitton*, Bill Butler*, Michael McMahon*, Pauline McNeill*, Ken Macintosh*, Rhona Brankin*, Jackie Baillie*, Johann Lamont*
