*S2M-3810# Campbell Martin: North Ayrshire Schools PPP Project—That the Parliament notes that North Ayrshire Council, through a PPP project, intends to amalgamate St Andrew’s Academy in Saltcoats with St Michael’s Academy in Kilwinning and to build a “superschool” to be erected on Laighdykes playing fields in Saltcoats, the only playing fields serving the towns of Saltcoats and Ardrossan; is concerned that the council’s plans will impact adversely on the educational attainment of pupils and on the provision of open space and sports pitches in Saltcoats and Ardrossan; is further concerned that questions remain over aspects of the bidding and procurement processes adopted by North Ayrshire Council in its PPP for Schools Project, and considers that public private partnerships do not represent best value for local taxpayers and local communities.
