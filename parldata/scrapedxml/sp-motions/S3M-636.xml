*S3M-636 Robert Brown: Protection of Green Spaces in Glasgow—That the Parliament is concerned at the action by Glasgow City Council in including in the planning brief for the sale of Anniesland College’s Balshagray Annexe a small piece of green space owned by it at Broomhill Avenue, Glasgow, without consulting local residents or councillors and without regard to the need to protect and enhance green space in the city; supports the campaign by Broomhill Avenue Conservation Group to retain the green area for the local community, and urges the council to give higher priority to supporting recreational and green spaces in the city.
