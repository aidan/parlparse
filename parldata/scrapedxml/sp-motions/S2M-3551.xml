 *S2M-3551 Murdo Fraser: T in the Park Success at UK Festival Awards 2005—That the Parliament congratulates T in the Park on its success in winning the awards of "Best Major Festival" and "Best Facilities and Organisation" at the UK Festival Awards 2005; recognises that T in the Park deserves these awards as its organisers put on a spectacular festival for over 60,000 fans each day, all with the backdrop of the stunning Kinross-shire countryside; further believes that these awards confirm that T in the Park is the United Kingdom’s friendliest festival; welcomes the festival’s work in promoting new breaking Scottish talent on the T Break Stage, X-Tent and Futures Stage; notes the importance of the festival to the Kinross-shire economy, and wishes the organisers continued success with future T in the Park festivals.
