*S2M-4997 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Gretna Football Club—That the Parliament congratulates Gretna Football Club on its continued success, both on the field and in its work in community-based projects with young people all over south-west Scotland and beyond; notes that the club has fulfilled a crucial and important role in providing a range of services to the community, free of charge, which include school visits, health visits, access for rural schools, festivals, work experience, youth club visits, environmental projects, a girls’ and women’s project, a disability programme and an education programme, and that it has worked closely with the Dumfries-based First Base drugs group in delivering crucial advice to children and young people; notes that the recent decision by Dumfries and Galloway Council to grant planning permission to build two new 3,000 seat stands at its Raydale Stadium would help facilitate Gretna’s entry into the Scottish Premier League if it is successful in securing the Scottish First Division title, and recognises that this would represent a tremendous and unique achievement for a small team from the south of Scotland which has prided itself on being a local community-based football club.
