*S2M-2601# Roseanna Cunningham: City of Perth—That the Parliament notes that the foundation of Perth as a royal burgh dates back to a charter granted by King William the Lion in 1210 and that the first reference to Perth as a city came in the Golden Charter granted by King James VI in 1600; recognises that between 1600 and the early 19th century the use of the terms "city", "burgh" and "town" was interchangeable and that from the early 19th century Perth was consistently referred to as a city in official documents such as Acts of Parliament; further recognises that this use continued in the 20th century when the terms "City of Perth" and "Royal Burgh of Perth" appeared in many official documents, and welcomes Perth and Kinross Council’s intention to reaffirm Perth’s status as one of Scotland’s historic and modern-day cities with a declaration in the old Council Chambers and a series of events leading up to the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the City of Perth in 2010.
