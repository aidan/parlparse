*S3M-3576 Jamie Hepburn: Admission of UK Government of Rendition of Suspected Terror Suspectsâ€”That the Parliament expresses its concern, following the revelation that, despite official assurances to the contrary, terror suspects detained by British soldiers in Iraq were secretly flown by the United States of America to Afghanistan; states its belief that extraordinary rendition is an errant practice with no legal basis, in which no decent government should engage, and calls on the UK Government to accede to the numerous demands for a full inquiry into the various allegations that the United Kingdom has been involved in facilitating the extraordinary rendition of individuals to countries where they face torture.
