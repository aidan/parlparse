 *S3M-3640 Margaret Curran: Congratulations to FARE in the East End of Glasgow—That the Parliament congratulates Family Action in Rogerfield and Easterhouse (FARE), which has recently been awarded a grant of £334,988 from the Big Lottery Fund’s Investing in Communities project; is delighted that the money will be used to replace existing facilities at FARE, with a new family community centre providing increased opportunities for local families and residents to participate in a range of services including youth clubs, homework clubs, family advocacy and the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme; acknowledges with gratitude the continued hard work, dedication and innovation that the young people and staff of FARE have brought to the east end of Glasgow, and believes that this grant is a tribute to this work and to that of Bob Holman who has dedicated so much to the people and communities of Greater Easterhouse.
