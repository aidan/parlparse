*S3M-1832 Robin Harper: Replacing GDP with Wellbeing Indicators—That the Parliament welcomes the recent research report, produced by Forward Scotland in partnership with the Scottish Council Foundation, entitled A wellbeing framework for Scotland: A better way of measuring society’s progress in the 21st Century; notes that the report proposes a range of subjective indicators which could be used as an alternative to GDP; believes that GDP, the current measure of economic growth, makes no distinction between beneficial and harmful economic activity, ignores many socially beneficial and highly desirable practices and treats the depletion of natural capital as income and is therefore a very poor indicator of economic development; further notes that Greens and others across Europe have been calling for alternative indicators to economic growth for many years that focus on wellbeing, and so measure the health, happiness and aspirations of people instead of merely the speed with which their money circulates around the economy, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider alternatives to GDP with a view to adopting more suitable measures of national progress.
