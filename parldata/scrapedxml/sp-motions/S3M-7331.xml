*S3M-7331 Bill Butler: Dundee FC—That the Parliament notes the 25-point deduction imposed on Dundee FC by the Scottish Football League for entering administration; notes also the penalty of a player-signing ban and the threat of further sanctions; further notes that this is the highest such deduction imposed in British senior football and places the 117-year-old former League Champions and European Cup semi-finalists in what it considers to be an extremely precarious position; believes that this decision will come as a further blow to Dundee supporters who, for the second time in a decade, are trying to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds to save their club from liquidation and have already raised almost £100,000 since the club entered administration in October 2010; notes the recent Back on the Ball? report by PKF, which warned that many Scottish clubs were paying out too much of their turnover on player wages, thus leaving them overly reliant on external investment from club owners for survival; considers that the situation at Dundee FC highlights the real need for the sport’s governing bodies to work with the Scottish Government and supporters’ trusts to create a more accountable and transparent system of financial governance of clubs in order to ensure that Scottish football is run primarily for the benefit of supporters; wishes the Dee4Life supporter’s trust all the best in its campaign to save Dundee FC by funding a supporters’ buy-out, and calls on the sport’s governing bodies to stand up for ordinary football supporters by backing such initiatives.
