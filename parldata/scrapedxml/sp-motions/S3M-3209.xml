S3M-3209 Claire Baker: A Scottish Tenancy Deposit Schemeâ€”That the Parliament notes that the next meeting of the Working Group on Safeguarding Tenancy Deposits is at the start of February 2009; further notes the completion of research looking at the issue of unfair deductions and withholding of tenancy deposits in Scotland; looks forward to the findings of the research being the basis for development of a tenancy deposit scheme in Scotland; acknowledges the successful working of schemes in the rest of the United Kingdom, and calls on the Scottish Government to use powers in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 to create a Scottish tenancy deposit scheme that offers the same protection to tenants and responsible landlords in Scotland as is afforded to the rest of the United Kingdom.
