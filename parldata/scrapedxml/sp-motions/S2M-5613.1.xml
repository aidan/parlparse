 *S2M-5613.1 Johann Lamont: Double Jeopardy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5613) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "recognises the issue of the double jeopardy rule in the operation of the criminal justice system; recognises that this issue must not be seen in isolation, but instead should be considered within the wider context of the Scottish Executive’s ongoing reform and modernisation programme; commends the Executive’s commitment to placing the needs of victims at the heart of the criminal justice system and its achievements over the last four years in fundamentally modernising and reforming that system, including the introduction of the Victim Information and Advice Service across Scotland and the Victim Notification Scheme, and further recognises that any decision on the future of double jeopardy should be taken within the context of Scots law."
