*S1M-2581 Roseanna Cunningham: Perth Royal Infirmary Laboratory Services-That the Parliament notes the discussion document produced by Tayside University Hospitals NHS Trust on the future of laboratory services at Perth Royal Infirmary (PRI); recognises that upheaval and uncertainty have been the hallmark of health service provision in Perthshire in recent years and that patients, staff and the general public require a period of stability; welcomes the recognition within the document that, as an Acute Hospital with the full range of District General Hospital Services, PRI will require on-site laboratory services for biochemical medicine, haematology and blood transfusion "at the very least"; acknowledges the strong arguments put forward for relocating laboratory facilities closer to the wards, and rejects suggestions that pathology and microbiology services be relocated to Ninewells Hospital. Supported by: Mr John Swinney*, Bruce Crawford*
