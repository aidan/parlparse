*S2M-3840&lt;&gt; Alex Johnstone: Scotland’s Tartan Day—That the Parliament welcomes moves by several Scottish local authorities, led by Angus Council, to seek ways of promoting Tartan Day as a national event in Scotland; commends Perth and Kinross, Dundee, Stirling and Edinburgh City councils who already help to make Scotland the focus of Tartan Day; notes that Tartan Day, celebrated on the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath, has been the subject of large-scale celebrations in America and elsewhere, and urges the Scottish Executive to provide more assistance to facilitate a national celebration of Tartan Day in Scotland to encourage Americans and others of Scottish descent to come to Scotland to celebrate the event, which will bring economic and cultural benefits to Scotland.
