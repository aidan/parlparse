 *S1M-2368 Dr Richard Simpson: People Management in Scottish Universities—That the Parliament notes the statements made by the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in her letter of 23 November 2000 to the Chairman of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) that "staff are the key resource of universities and colleges" and that the Scottish Executive "must continually strive to improve people management, staff development and succession planning"; agrees with the minister’s comment in the same letter that "a particular area where improvements are required is in human resource policies and management"; is concerned that pay levels for female academic staff are almost 20% lower than those for their male counterparts; recognises the importance of research staff in Scotland’s knowledge economy; further recognises that over 90% of such staff are employed on insecure fixed-term contracts; believes that greater job security in the higher education sector can better enable the use of our science and social science research base for the benefit of Scotland’s economy and society; welcomes the Executive’s commitment, outlined in its publication, A Science Strategy for Scotland, to "encourage funders and employers to ensure good career and staff development for those engaged in scientific research"; calls upon the minister to press for improvements in people management by more detailed guidance to SHEFC and to encourage SHEFC to promote and monitor such improvements through specific conditions of grant and by ensuring that contracted members of research staff are considered a key part of implementation of the science strategy, and recommends to the minister, to SHEFC and to universities the advantages of an approach in partnership with recognised unions to tackle these key issues.
