*S2M-3657.1 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Sea Fisheriesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-3657) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "an outcome" to end and insert "urges the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to press for significantly increased quotas for nephrops and monkfish, coupled with no reduction in haddock total allowable catch and the confirmation of the proposed pelagic quotas to secure a sustainable future for our remaining fishermen and processors, as well as for our beleaguered coastal communities, but ultimately believes that the only solution for the Scottish fishing industry is to leave the discredited Common Fisheries Policy and to regain national and local control of UK waters."
