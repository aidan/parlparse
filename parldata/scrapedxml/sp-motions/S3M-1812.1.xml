*S3M-1812.1 Robert Brown: Housingâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1812) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "believes that" to end and insert "recognises that local councils are best placed to assess and meet varied local housing needs and to determine their local housing strategies; believes that the role of community-based housing associations and housing co-operatives is vital to such diverse local strategies which should also include the ability to mould right to buy policy to fit local needs, and calls on the Scottish Government to produce clear figures on its housing plans including the number of affordable rented houses to be built from 2008 to 2011."
