*S3M-747 Jamie Hepburn: Independence is the Only Solution to West Lothian Question—That the Parliament notes that the Conservative Party is actively considering campaigning for the creation of an English Grand Committee, while there are others who support the creation of a federal structure for the United Kingdom; further notes that these two schemes are often floated as answers to the West Lothian Question; recognises that, even if either scheme was instituted, it would leave Scotland powerless to affect change in certain areas such as the renewal of Trident, which was opposed by a majority of Scottish members of the Westminster Parliament as well as of members of the Scottish Parliament but would still go ahead even in the context of an English Grand Committee or a federal UK, and believes that there is only one sensible answer to the West Lothian Question and that is independence for Scotland.
