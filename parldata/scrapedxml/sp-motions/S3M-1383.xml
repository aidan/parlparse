*S3M-1383 Ian McKee: Action for War Veterans—That the Parliament notes the publication of the House of Commons Defence Committee’s seventh report of 2007-08 which draws attention to shortcomings inherited from the previous Labour/Liberal Democrat administration by the Scottish Government with regard to NHS treatment for veterans in Scotland; congratulates the SNP government on the action that it has taken to reverse this trend; welcomes the guidance issued to NHS boards on how priority treatment should be extended to all armed forces veterans, not just those who receive war pensions, and commends the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing for ensuring that all our servicemen and women receive the highest quality of healthcare.
