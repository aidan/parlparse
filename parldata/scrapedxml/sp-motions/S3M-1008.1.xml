 *S3M-1008.1 Robin Harper: The Benefits of Woodland and Greenspacesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1008) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end "but recognises that these opportunities will be limited both by the risk-averse culture that has developed in Scottish schools and care establishments, based on variable local policies about risk, and by lack of investment and encouragement, until the Scottish Government creates a long-term plan to ensure that every school child in Scotland can take part in outdoor education with a requirement for school inspectors to appraise and report on access to, and use of, greenspace, and calls on ministers to start work on such a plan."
