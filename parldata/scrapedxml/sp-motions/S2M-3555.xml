*S2M-3555 Alex Neil: Compensation for Hearing Loss for Ex-Servicemen and Women—That the Parliament notes that around 90% of those ex-servicemen and women who apply for compensation due to having suffered hearing loss because of their service are refused such compensation; calls on Her Majesty’s Government to reduce the threshold for compensation from its present level of 50 decibels to 35 decibels, in line with other countries such as the United States of America and the Republic of Ireland, and commends the Royal National Institute for Deaf People for its campaign on this issue.
