 *S3M-4162 Cathy Jamieson: Robert Burns Humanitarian Award 2009—That the Parliament congratulates Guy Willoughby, director of the Halo Trust, on being chosen to receive the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award 2009; notes that the Halo Trust is a not-for-profit organisation based in south west Scotland, which specialises in the removal of the hazardous debris of war; further notes that it has 8,000 full-time mine clearers in nine countries, with ongoing surveys into new regions; also notes that, since it was founded 21 years ago, it has destroyed over one million landmines, 10 million items of larger calibre ordnance, over 50 million bullets, over 2,800 heavy weapon systems and over 85,000 assault rifles and has cleared over 6,000 minefields, making thousands of hectares of land and roads safe; believes that this is a testament to the dedication of the staff who are working in some of the most dangerous jobs on earth, and thanks everyone who has worked with Guy Willoughby to undertake this immensely valuable work in some of the poorest countries in the world.
