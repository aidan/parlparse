*S2M-3539 Fiona Hyslop: Scottish History—That the Parliament notes with serious concern the proposals by the Scottish Executive to make history history in S1 and S2; asserts the importance of children in Scotland having a firm understanding and appreciation of Scottish heritage, culture and history; recognises and supports creative ways to weave this into every subject in the curriculum providing a Scottish perspective; rejects, however, any attempt to remove the stand-alone subject of history from S1 and S2 in schools in Scotland, and regrets this suggestion by any Scottish education minister, reflecting that such a move would not be even countenanced in other countries who have a pride in promoting their nation’s history. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Richard Lochhead*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Mr John Swinney*, Bruce Crawford*, Brian Adam*, Eleanor Scott*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Robin Harper*, Rob Gibson*, Christine Grahame*, Alex Neil*, Fergus Ewing*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Tommy Sheridan*, Shona Robison*, Campbell Martin*, Jim Mather*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*
