*S3M-99 Hugh O’Donnell: Darfur and Chad: Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the ongoing crisis in Darfur and Chad which has affected 4.5 million people, almost equivalent to the population of Scotland, that more than 2 million people in Darfur have been forced to flee for their lives into camps due to the conflict, that 4 million people in Darfur are dependent on humanitarian aid for survival and that nearly 250,000 refugees have fled from Darfur into Chad since the crisis began in 2003; further notes that the looming rainy season heightens the risk of deadly conditions like diarrhoea and malaria, and supports the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal in order to save lives in Darfur and Chad, to raise much-needed funds to help people affected by the conflict, giving shelter, clean water and sanitation, emergency food and vital items such as water buckets, blankets and soap and enable medical teams to provide emergency care.
