*S3M-2297 Sandra White: Funding Boost for Science Centres—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of extra funding for Scotland’s science centres; notes that this funding will be specifically earmarked to encourage children to become more interested in science, and believes that, given the recent report showing underachievement and lack of interest in science, this extra funding along with other initiatives such as the science engagement scheme, is positive and encouraging.
