*S1M-3205# Mr Adam Ingram: Neurosurgery for Mental Disorderâ€”That the Parliament notes the imminent introduction of regulations regarding the use of neurosurgery for mental disorder (NMD); acknowledges the resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations A/RES/46/119 17 December 1991, Principle 11 (14) which states "Psychosurgery and other intrusive and irreversible treatments for mental disorder shall never be carried out on a patient who is an involuntary patient in a mental health facility and, to the extent that domestic law permits them to be carried out, they may be carried out on any other patient only where the patient has given informed consent and an independent external body has satisfied itself that there is genuine informed consent and that the treatment best serves the health needs of the patient", and considers that the Parliament and the Health and Community Care Committee should assess the implications of such regulations for basic human rights whilst taking into consideration the report from the NMD service in Dundee which does not support the use of such procedures on patients who are incapable of giving informed consent.
