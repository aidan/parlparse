*S2M-3956 Mark Ballard: Google and the People’s Republic of China—That the Parliament is disappointed by Google’s decision to join hands with the Government of the People’s Republic of China in its propaganda efforts; notes that Google has launched a web search platform, custom-built to the Chinese authorities’ specifications, that blocks access to information about Tibet, human rights, and other topics sensitive to Beijing; believes that in doing so Google is not just helping the Chinese Government by censoring "sensitive topics", but enabling the Chinese Government’s propaganda by returning search results tailored to Beijing’s repressive policies; further notes that searching for "Tibet" in the custom-built platform will bring up only official Chinese Government information on Tibet and that searching for "Dalai Lama" will bring up only sites portraying him as a "splittist"; further believes that under the current Chinese regime the internet is a critical tool for Chinese and Tibetans to improve their political situation and that the effect of Google’s partnership with the Chinese Government will be to thwart these efforts by denying them the information they seek, and asks that Google review its engagement with the Government of the People’s Republic of China with a view to allowing free use of the internet.
