 *S1M-1545# Johann Lamont: Celtic Football Club—That the Parliament congratulates the many organisations in Scotland which work to challenge religious bigotry; welcomes the initiative taken by the Celtic Football Club in its Social Charter and its Bhoys Against Bigotry Campaign in seeking to promote equality and challenge bigoted attitudes through a programme of work with young people and their schools; notes that, in recognising the power it has to influence the way young people see their world and in showing a willingness to use that power positively, Celtic Football Club provides an excellent model for those who wish to tackle bigotry and discrimination; acknowledges the immense potential of such an approach; urges Scotland’s football and other sports clubs to consider pursuing similar initiatives, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how it might support the development of this work across Scotland.
