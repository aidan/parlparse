 *S2M-5307 John Scott: Support for Prescribing of Tysabri for MS Sufferers in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) that Tysabri should not be prescribed on the NHS; further notes that Scotland has the highest proportion of sufferers from multiple sclerosis in the world, that the SMC accepts that the clinical case for the use of Tysabri was sound and that the recommendation not to prescribe it on the NHS was taken on purely financial grounds, and therefore urges that this decision by the SMC be overturned and that Tysabri be made available on the NHS. Supported by: Mrs Nanette Milne*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Tommy Sheridan*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Dave Petrie*, Murray Tosh*, Rosie Kane*, Robin Harper*, Carolyn Leckie*, Phil Gallie*, Derek Brownlee*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Alex Johnstone*, Alex Neil*, Eleanor Scott*, John Swinburne*
