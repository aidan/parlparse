 *S3M-2417Bashir Ahmad:Plight of the Roma Community—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the issues facing the Roma people in Scotland; welcomes the publication of Oxfam’s recent Report on the Situation of the Roma Community in Govanhill, Glasgow; deplores the reality that many Roma people live in poverty and poor housing; finds it further deplorable that many are open to exploitation from gangmasters; recognises the problems in current legislation caused by the "no recourse to public funds" principle; asks the various stakeholders to consider the recommendations of the report, and calls on all levels of government in Holyrood, London and Brussels, as well as Scotland’s local authorities, to improve support for the Roma community.
