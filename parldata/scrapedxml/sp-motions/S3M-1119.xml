*S3M-1119 Bill Wilson: Derek Pasquill, the Duty of Civil Servants and Rendition—That the Parliament congratulates Derek Pasquill on the dropping of charges against him following his leaking of Foreign Office documents pertaining to CIA rendition flights and the United Kingdom’s contact with radical Islamic groups; believes that Mr Pasquill’s actions were in the best interests of the UK; is of the opinion that the first duty of civil servants is to uphold the greater good of UK citizens and human rights in general, rather than to protect politicians; deplores the UK Government’s actions against him, and condemns all acts of terror and infringements of human rights, including rendition flights, torture and detention without trial, regardless of who perpetrates them, as counterproductive and morally repugnant.
