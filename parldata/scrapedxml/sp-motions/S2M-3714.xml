 *S2M-3714 Tommy Sheridan: Strike Action by Irish Trade Unions Against Irish Ferries—That the Parliament notes that over 100,000 workers marched in Ireland on Friday 9 December 2005, with 60,000 in Dublin alone, to protest against attempts by the Irish Ferries company to re-flag their ships to Cyprus in an attempt to slash the conditions of the ferry workers and undermine the basic minimum wage; congratulates the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for organising the protest which resulted in the widest industrial action seen in Ireland for 20 years; believes that this action exposes the real agenda of the "Celtic Tiger" economy and proves that working class solidarity can take on big business and at the same time cut across racist sentiments against immigrant workers, and gives its full support to workers on Scottish ferries who may face similar attacks on their wages and conditions in future.
