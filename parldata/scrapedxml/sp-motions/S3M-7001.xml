*S3M-7001 Liam McArthur: Orkney Education—That the Parliament notes that the recent study by Save the Children into the gap in the educational success between children from low-income homes and their peers found that Orkney had the second lowest gap in Scotland, with its 20% under a third of the Scottish average; considers that, while this still leaves a gap to be closed, the lower figure reflects the successful way that Orkney’s education service tackles the challenge of overcoming the disadvantages that pupils from low-income homes all too often suffer - through quality pupil support, engagement and support of parents and committed teaching that involves and inspires children; believes that that is one of the reasons that 94% of Orkney pupils go on to positive destinations such as higher and further education, vocational training or work and is one of the best rates in Scotland, and considers that, while Save the Children is to be commended for highlighting this issue, its recycling of a generic headline when regionalising its press campaign, so that it claims that Orkney has a "scandalous" education gap, undermines the credibility of its work and is yet another unfortunate example of central belt-based bodies taking a one-size-fits-all approach, an approach that all too often discriminates against Scotland’s islands.
