*S1M-2336 Nicola Sturgeon: Free Personal Care for Elderly People-That the Parliament notes that the £125 million set aside by the Scottish Executive will be insufficient to fund the recommendations of the Care Development Group unless Her Majesty's Government agrees to allow those currently eligible for Attendance Allowance to retain that benefit notwithstanding their entitlement to free personal care; condemns Her Majesty's Government's refusal to continue those payments as a deliberate attempt to undermine the will of the Scottish Parliament, and therefore calls on Her Majesty's Government to make the necessary amendments to the social security regulations or, alternatively, to transfer the £21.7 million that will be saved as a result of the withdrawal of Attendance Allowance to the Scottish Executive.
