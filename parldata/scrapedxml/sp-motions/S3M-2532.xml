*S3M-2532 Jim Hume: Flooding in the Borders—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the devastation caused to communities in the Bowmont Valley, south of Kelso, as a result of the recent flooding; further notes that the level of unprecedented rainfall caused isolation for many households, severe damage to telephone lines, electricity supplies, homes, roads and bridges and other local infrastructure; recognises the dependency of rural communities on agriculture for livelihoods and the serious implications for farming activity on the ground where animals are now unable to be transported, and calls on the Scottish Government to put in place, through Bellwin funding, the financial means to restore crucial infrastructure to allow this rural community to function properly. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Ross Finnie*, Mike Pringle*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Jamie Stone*
