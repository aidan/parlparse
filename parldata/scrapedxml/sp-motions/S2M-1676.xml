*S2M-1676# Mark Ballard: Student Loans Payment Date—That the Parliament notes that the student loan is currently paid in three instalments through the academic year, designed to correspond to three academic terms; further notes that the majority of students in Scotland attend higher education institutions that have a semester system; believes that the payment of student loan instalments in Scotland should correspond to the academic year followed by the majority of students in Scotland; believes that making a third of the student loan unavailable until a few weeks before the end of the academic year is likely to result in unnecessary student hardship, higher drop-out rates and increased administration costs for higher education institutions distributing welfare payments, and considers that the Student Loans Company, the Department for Education and Skills and the Student Awards Agency for Scotland should co-operate with student organisations and higher education institutions to arrange for student loans to be paid to all students studying in Scotland monthly or at intervals appropriate to the pattern of the academic year predominant in Scotland.
