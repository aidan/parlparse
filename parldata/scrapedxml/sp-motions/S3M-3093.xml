 *S3M-3093 George Foulkes: 34 Labour Schools to SNP’s One—That the Parliament cautiously welcomes City of Edinburgh Council’s announcement that Portobello High School will be rebuilt and open by 2014; notes with concern that a funding gap of £8.5 million to rebuild Portobello High still remains; considers that the SNP government has broken its promise to match Labour’s school building programme brick-for-brick and that the parents and children of James Gillespies, Boroughmuir, St John’s and St Crispin’s schools will all be extremely disappointed; recalls that in seven years, between 1999 and 2006, the Labour-led council commissioned 34 new schools, and believes that over the next seven years, 2007 to 2014, the Lib Dem/SNP-led council will have commissioned just one new school.
