*S1M-1292 Richard Lochhead: Lack of Fisheries Minister in the Scottish Executive—That the Parliament notes that the new Scottish Executive has no dedicated Fisheries Minister and condemns the First Minister’s insult to Scotland’s fishing communities by deciding to downgrade the importance of one of Scotland’s oldest and most vital industries; further notes that prior to devolution, even under the old Scottish Office regime, there was always a dedicated Fisheries Minister, and finally notes that Henry McLeish, in his former role as Scottish Office Minister for Devolution, steered through the Scotland Act which enabled the transfer of thousands of square miles of our fishing waters from Scottish to English jurisdiction and is therefore no friend of Scotland’s fishing communities.
