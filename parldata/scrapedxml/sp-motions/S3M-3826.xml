*S3M-3826 Robert Brown: Social Networking Websites and Government Surveillanceâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the consideration by the Home Office of a government database to monitor the activity of law-abiding citizens on social network websites such as Facebook, Bebo and MySpace; highlights that these sites contain sensitive data on individuals that the government has no right to know; further notes recent failures by government departments in keeping confidential data secure; also notes that the police can already obtain a warrant to monitor the social networking accounts of people suspected of criminality, and believes that the UK Government should drop any plans for the blanket monitoring of all users of social networking websites.
