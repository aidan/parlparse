*S2M-5765 Peter Peacock: Mobile Post Office Services in the Highlands and Islands—That the Parliament commends all those involved in the setting up and operation of the mobile post office in Caithness, particularly the sub-postmaster, Glynn Jackson, who has worked hard to retain postal services to five villages in Caithness; further commends Robin Dagleish at Muir of Ord who has been piloting outreach services to Marybank and Achterneed in Ross-shire, both pilots developing a new type of postal service delivery capable of meeting rural needs, and encourages the Post Office to apply the lessons learned from these pilots more widely throughout the Highlands and Islands.
