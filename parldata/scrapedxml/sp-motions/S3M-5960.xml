 *S3M-5960 Sandra White: Build Trust not Homes—That the Parliament welcomes efforts by the US administration to establish proximity talks between Palestinians and Israelis aimed at reinvigorating the peace process; notes the comments by US Vice President Joe Biden in response to Israel’s announcement to approve planning permission for 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, considered by the international community to be occupied territory and therefore illegal to build on, that "The substance and timing of the announcement, particularly with the launching of proximity talks, is precisely the kind of step that undermines the trust we need right now and runs counter to the constructive discussions that I’ve had here in Israel" whose sentiments were echoed by the United Nations, the European Union and the British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, who commented that "This is a bad decision at the wrong time. It will give strength to those who argue that Israel is not serious about peace", and hopes that all those interested in a peaceful resolution to the conflict will accept that the need for trust and goodwill as a precursor to meaningful discussions is a fundamental prerequisite.
