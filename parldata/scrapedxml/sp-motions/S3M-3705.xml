*S3M-3705 Maureen Watt: Sale of Stonehaven Radio Stationâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the poor state of repair that Stonehaven Radio Station has fallen into since its closure in 2000, despite its status as a listed building and its unique history; applauds the efforts of the Stonehaven Maritime Radio Heritage Halls charity to purchase and preserve the site as a museum and community building, and calls on British Telecommunications PLC and Telereal to recognise the social value to the local community that the buildings could have and to enter sale negotiations with Stonehaven Maritime Radio Heritage Halls before placing the site on the open market.
