 *S3M-971 Lewis Macdonald: Golf Resort Development in Aberdeen City and Shire—That the Parliament deplores the decision on 29 November 2007 by the Infrastructure Committee of Aberdeenshire Council to reject Donald Trump’s application to develop a world-class golf resort in the north east; believes that decisions of such strategic importance ought to be taken by all members of a planning authority and determined on the basis of the interests of the wider community and Scotland as a whole; calls on Aberdeenshire Council to act urgently to review and if possible reverse its decision, and calls for any appeal by the developer to be dealt with as a matter of urgency by Scottish ministers.
