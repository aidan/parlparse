*S3M-7422 Mary Scanlon: Care Home Costsâ€”That the Parliament recognises the changing demographics of Scotland and the increasing financial pressures on services providing care for older people; notes that independent and local authority-run care homes in Scotland are regulated in accordance with standards set by the Care Commission; further notes the wide disparities that exist between different service providers with regard to fees and costs and the disparities in the amounts paid by or on behalf of service users for the same service, and accordingly calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that its public engagement process, Reshaping Care for Older People, reviews existing models of funding and provision to ensure that value for money is coupled with continuing high standards of care.
