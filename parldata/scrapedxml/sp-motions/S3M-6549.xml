*S3M-6549 Jamie Hepburn: Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Campaign to Defend Public Sector Jobs and Services—That the Parliament commends the creation of the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Campaign to Defend Public Sector Jobs and Services by the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Trades Council; notes that the Conservative/Liberal Democrat government at Westminster has proposed significant cuts to UK expenditure, leading to concerns about the future of public sector workers in the employ of the UK Government and an expectation that these cuts will lead to a substantial reduction to the Scottish budget; supports the efforts of the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Campaign to Defend Public Sector Jobs and Services to raise awareness of these concerns; calls on the UK Government to follow the example of the Scottish Government and institute a policy of no compulsory redundancies; believes that, if the UK Government is so concerned about public finances, it should commit to not renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system, which, it is estimated, will cost the public purse up to £100 billion, and further believes that, the UK Government’s commitment to putting public finances in order would be better demonstrated by working to collect the billions of uncollected taxes estimated by the Public and Commercial Services Union.
