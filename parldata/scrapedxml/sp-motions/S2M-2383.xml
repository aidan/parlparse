 * S2M-2383# Alex Fergusson:The Museum of Lead Mining at Wanlockhead—That the Parliament recognises the 30 th anniversary of the Museum of Lead Mining at Wanlockhead in Upper Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire, Scotland’s highest village; applauds the trustees in attracting over 40,000 visitors over that period and recognises the many awards which have been achieved, including the 1993 Gulbenkian Award for “Most Improved Rural Gallery”, the Small Museum of the Year Award 1993 and the Kintore Trust Award for Conservation 1996; further recognises its economic importance to Upper Nithsdale as a recognised four-star tourist attraction and as the employer of up to 20 people during the opening season and commends Dumfries and Galloway Council on its ongoing financial support; notes with concern that all these achievements, and others, have been won through local funding alone with no central recognition of this unique monument to Scottish lead mining, and believes that the Scottish Executive should recognise Wanlockhead as a museum of national importance by bringing it under the auspices of the National Museums of Scotland. Supported by: David Mundell*, Bill Aitken* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
