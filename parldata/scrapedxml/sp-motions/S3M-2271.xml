*S3M-2271 Lewis Macdonald: Twentieth Anniversary of the Piper Alpha Disaster—That the Parliament notes the twentieth anniversary of the Piper Alpha disaster which claimed the lives of 167 offshore workers on 6 July 1988; celebrates the contribution of members of the Piper Alpha Families’ and Survivors’ Association, whose tireless campaigning in the aftermath of the disaster helped to raise the standards of offshore safety to the benefit of many thousands of other offshore workers over the last 20 years; believes that the regulation of offshore safety by the Health and Safety Executive, the provision for offshore safety representatives, support for safety initiatives, such as Step Change in the context of the government/oil and gas industry PILOT taskforce, and the recognition of trade unions offshore have supported a more positive safety culture, and looks forward to continuing active engagement in promoting that safety culture by all concerned in the North Sea and other oil provinces around the world.
