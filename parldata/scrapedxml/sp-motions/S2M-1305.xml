*S2M-1305# Donald Gorrie: Employee Equal Opportunities within the Parliament-That the Parliament believes that staff employed by MSPs are a valuable resource of the Parliament, provide essential services and are at the forefront of representing the public image of the Parliament in their dealings with constituents, institutions, members of the public and the wider community in Scotland and help MSPs to develop policy ideas and respond rapidly to events; recognises that they should be entitled to the same personal and career development opportunities funded by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) as staff employed directly by the SPCB, and considers that a staff training and development budget should be provided to MSPs in order that their directly employed staff have equal career and personal development opportunities.
