*S3M-3403 Bill Kidd: Child Poverty and UK Benefits System—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of Child Poverty, a report to the Local Government and Communities Committee, and in particular the finding that "for single parents, with young children in particular, in the current labour market and benefits system, moving into the labour market is unlikely to result in people being financially much better off. Even if child care can be provided at an affordable cost (which is very debatable) the way the benefits system works seems likely to mean that, even with tax credits, most will not be much better off"; additionally notes that housing benefit is withdrawn at a rate of 65% and for council tax benefit that the figure is 20%, giving a net claw-back of 85p in the pound for income over the benefit threshold, and considers that the UK Government’s plans to impose progression-to-work conditionality and sanctions on parents of young children are therefore misplaced.
