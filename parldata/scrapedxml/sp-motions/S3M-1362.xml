*S3M-1362 David Stewart: WWF Campaign for Strong Scottish Climate Change Bill—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of WWF Scotland’s campaign for a strong Scottish Climate Change Bill, which will engage with communities across the country through 25 public events over the course of the public consultation on the Bill proposals; believes that, in tackling climate change, Scotland as a nation can lead the way and, alongside those backing this campaign, supports calls for the Bill to establish the legal framework to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a statutory annual target of at least 3% emission reductions year on year and to include reductions in emissions from aviation and shipping, and further notes that these calls are supported across the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland coalition, a broad coalition of environment, development, community and faith groups and UNISON Scotland.
