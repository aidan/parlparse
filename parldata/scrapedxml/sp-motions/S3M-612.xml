*S3M-612# Paul Martin: Car Parking Charges at Stobhill Hospital—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to introduce car parking charges at Stobhill Hospital later this year; recognises the impact that this proposal will have on the local community through inconsiderate parking by car commuters in residential areas surrounding the hospital; is concerned that current provision of public transport to and from Stobhill Hospital is insufficient, and considers that a new car parking policy that would remove car parking charges at Stobhill Hospital should be developed. Supported by: Hugh O’Donnell*, Alex Neil*, Karen Gillon*, Cathie Craigie*, Michael McMahon*, David Whitton*, David Stewart*, Bill Butler*, Patricia Ferguson*, Elaine Smith*, Des McNulty*, Trish Godman*, Cathy Peattie*
