*S3M-6821Kenneth Gibson:Multiple Sclerosis Society—That the Parliament congratulates the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Society on its year-long respite care review which signals a new, more personalised, approach to developing care services that will help more people living with MS, and their carers, to access short breaks and respite care that they want and need; applauds the MS Society’s determination to act on the findings of this review to improve the way it meets the varying needs of people affected by MS across the country and how to use its resources for maximum benefit; acknowledges that the MS Society recognises that whilst its care centres are resourced to meet the needs of people with complex needs, the current assessment model shows that those with the highest dependency levels are the lowest user group; welcomes the fact that the MS Society is now pursuing a range of alternatives to support individuals and families in taking short breaks that include focusing on designing a new grants programme available to help people affected by MS to have breaks of their choosing, often in more conventional holiday style settings rather than a care centre; expresses its support for the MS Society’s accreditation scheme of other services, and its focus on providing better information about where people can access short breaks, influence other providers and campaign to make sure that short breaks and respite care are properly resourced by central and local government in partnership with other charities such as Parkinson’s UK and Motor Neuron Disease Association to develop short break services and support across Scotland.
