*S3M-5296 Bill Kidd: Carer’s Allowance and Attendance Allowance—That the Parliament is concerned at the uncertainty around the future of carer’s allowance, caused by proposals contained in the UK Government’s green paper about the future of adult care in England, Shaping the future of care together, seeking to introduce a change throughout the United Kingdom in order to integrate the proceeds of attendance allowance directly into social care and considers that one of the current qualifying conditions for carer’s allowance is that the carer spend at least 35 hours a week looking after someone receiving attendance allowance and that therefore it is unclear how carers, caring for someone over the age of 65, would in future qualify for carer’s allowance, as a consequence of the proposals to integrate attendance allowance into social care budgets.
