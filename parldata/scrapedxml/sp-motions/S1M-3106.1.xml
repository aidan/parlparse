*S1M-3106.1 Nicola Sturgeon: Investment and Reform in Health and Community Care-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3106) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from first "welcomes" to end and insert "regrets that the sustainability of investment in health is dependent solely on decisions taken by Her Majesty's Government rather than determined by the Scottish Parliament; agrees that reform in the delivery of health care is essential if we are to create a modern NHS which improves health and tackles health inequalities throughout Scotland, is transparent in its operation and publicly accountable, and prioritises the needs and expectations of patients and service users; is concerned that the Scottish Executive's use of the Private Finance Initiative and private healthcare capacity to redress decades of under-funding by the Tories damages the NHS and undermines the principle of a universal service that is free at the point of need; is further concerned that waiting lists and times are manipulated to the point of being meaningless, and believes that continuing reduction in the NHS acute sector capacity and staff shortages across the range of healthcare professions must be reversed if the NHS is to tackle effectively the crucial issues of bed blocking, waiting lists and times and hospital-acquired infection which remain fundamental obstructions to improving the health of the people of Scotland."
