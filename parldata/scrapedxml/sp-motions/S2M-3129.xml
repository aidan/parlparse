 *S2M-3129 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Multiple Sclerosis Researchâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges the fact that Scotland has the highest rates of multiple sclerosis in the world, with over 10,500 people currently affected; recognises the pain and distress this disease causes to both those affected and their families; acknowledges and fully supports the hard work undertaken by the many charities in this field, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make a commitment to invest in research into multiple sclerosis and further to invest in support for those affected and their families as a matter of priority.
