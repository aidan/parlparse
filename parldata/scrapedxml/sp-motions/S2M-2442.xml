 *S2M-2442 Pauline McNeill: Trafficking in Peopleâ€”That the Parliament applauds the action by Amnesty International and Anti-Slavery International against trafficking in people; notes that every year thousands of women, children and men fall victim to trafficking for the purposes of sexual or other exploitation, both within and over European borders; further notes the Council of Europe draft Convention on action against trafficking in human beings; acknowledges the view of the Council of the European Parliament that "this phenomenon has reached such unprecedented levels that it can truly be called a new form of slavery"; believes that the human rights of trafficked persons must be fully protected and that steps taken by European member states to criminalise trafficking and prosecute traffickers must be accompanied by the protection and support of the rights of trafficking victims, and supports the Scottish Executive funding for Glasgow City Council to begin to explore the emerging issue of trafficking in women for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation, to ascertain the extent of trafficking in Glasgow and to develop appropriate services to assist women to flee their traffickers and recover from their experiences.
