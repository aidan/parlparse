 * S2M-2365 Murdo Fraser: Wind Farm on Salisbury Crags—That the Parliament welcomes the proposal by Calton Hill Energy to construct a wind farm on Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh and the contribution that this proposal will make to public attitudes in the city towards onshore wind turbine developments; agrees that it makes sense to construct wind turbines close to areas of population density where most power is consumed rather than in remote and rural areas; looks forward to seeing proposals for the construction of wind turbines on the roofs of prominent Edinburgh buildings such as Edinburgh Castle, St Giles, the Balmoral Hotel and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, and believes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should investigate the possibility of erecting 125-metre-high turbines on the roof of the Holyrood building.
