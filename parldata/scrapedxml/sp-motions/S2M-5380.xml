*S2M-5380 Shona Robison: VAT on Fresh Fruit Juice—That the Parliament notes that VAT on fresh fruit juice is charged at the same rate as that payable on other soft drinks such as lemonade, other fizzy drinks and diluting squashes, many of which are high in sugar or artificial sweeteners, colouring and other additives; recognises the comments of European Commissioner, László Kovács, that the rate of VAT which could be applied to fresh fruit juices in the United Kingdom under the Sixth VAT Directive is a reduced rate of 5%, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to the UK Government that it should investigate the benefits of reducing VAT on fresh fruit juice to encourage children, in particular, to choose fresh fruit juices rather than less healthy drinks.
