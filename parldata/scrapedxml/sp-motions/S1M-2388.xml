 *S1M-2388# Mr Lloyd Quinan: Son-Rise Program—That the Parliament acknowledges the Son-Rise Program in Massachusetts, USA, and its unique approach to autism; recognises the programme’s remarkable and successful results as shown by Edinburgh parent Sue McLernon, her daughter Danielle and son Sean, and believes that the Scottish Executive should finance and resource similar projects throughout Scotland in order to ensure that autistic children and adults receive the greatest possible care and education available that is specific to their individual needs.
