*S3M-3062 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Lighthouse Arts Centre Saved from Closure—That the Parliament welcomes the fact that the Glasgow Lighthouse Arts Centre has been saved from closure; notes that the Scottish Government’s decision not to invest in the 2010 Six Cities Design Festival seriously impacted on the Lighthouse’s funds and contributed to its £300,000 deficit; congratulates Glasgow City Council for devising the rescue package, and welcomes the fact that the Lighthouse, one of the largest temporary exhibition venues for architecture and design in Europe and which nurtures, champions and promotes Scotland’s architecture and design, both nationally and internationally, will be able to continue to bring world-class thinking and projects to Glasgow through its wide range of projects, exhibitions, events, networks, festivals, awards and publications.
