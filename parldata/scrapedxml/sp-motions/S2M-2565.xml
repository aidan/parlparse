*S2M-2565 Fergus Ewing: Scottish Rail Passenger Committee—That the Parliament believes that the abolition of Regional Rail Passenger Committees, formerly Rail Users Consultative Committees, to be replaced by a national Rail Passengers Council, as provided for in the UK Railways Bill, is a retrograde step; calls on the Scottish Executive to secure the establishment of a Scottish Rail Passenger Committee that would be equipped with identical powers, enshrined in statute, to the new Rail Passengers Council that would require the provision of information to it by Network Rail and the Executive; applauds the work of the Rail Passenger Committees, and believes that the new UK body will fail to fulfil the role of a customer watchdog.
