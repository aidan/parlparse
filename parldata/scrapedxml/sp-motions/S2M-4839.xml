*S2M-4839 Tommy Sheridan: £76 Billion Cost to Replace Trident—That the Parliament notes that the latest cost estimate to replace and maintain a new nuclear weapons system in place of Trident has reached an incredible £76 billion, as revealed in House of Commons parliamentary answers; re-affirms its opposition to nuclear weapons on grounds of morality and consistency with international law but notes that the economic arguments against replacing Trident are now also unanswerable; believes that £76 billion committed over the next 30 years to wage war on poverty and grotesque inequality would concretely raise the quality and standard of life of all pensioners, children and families across the United Kingdom, and further believes that the latest astronomical cost estimate to replace Trident also adds political urgency to the cause of independence and that an independent, nuclear-free and socialist Scotland offers the best guarantee of peace and security for all Scotland’s citizens.
