*S2M-327# John Swinburne: Fiscal Autonomy-That the Parliament notes that a majority of Scots believe that the Scottish Parliament should have increased powers; recognises that devolution is a dynamic process and therefore calls for dialogue amongst the political parties within the Parliament with regard to securing additional powers, particularly fiscal autonomy, and further recognises that such powers would enable the Parliament to use the resources of Scotland to fully address the social and economic problems facing senior citizens and other excluded members of Scottish society.
