*S3M-565 Jim Hume: Scottish Enterprise Restructure—That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government’s changes to the Scottish Enterprise network and the potentially negative impact on the south of Scotland economy; considers that, by removing the current 21 local enterprise companies and local boards, each with local decision-making powers, and replacing them with only six regional operations, only one of which will be situated in the south of Scotland which is the second largest region in Scotland, the invaluable resource of having very localised advice, support and investment will be lost and regrets in particular that the local decision-making powers with the inclusion of private sector board members with real business experience and knowledge will be removed; further considers that the loss of the expertise and experience of their local economy gained by local enterprise companies’ staff will be detrimental to all local economies and Scotland as a whole, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses; further notes with concern that there is no clear indication of how the new set-up will be funded both in terms of the functions transferred to local authorities and the way in which funding will be made available to the new tourism structures; recognises the integral role played by local enterprise companies in nurturing their local areas, particularly in the Scottish Borders where the economy has grown at twice the rate of the national Scottish average; questions how the south of Scotland’s competitiveness strategy will now be delivered, and recognises with great sadness that the changes will result in job losses across the south of Scotland.
