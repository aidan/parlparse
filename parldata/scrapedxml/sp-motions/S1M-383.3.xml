*S1M-383.3 Mary Scanlon: Health—As an amendment to motion (S1M-383) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "but condemns Labour’s centralisation and increase in bureaucracy within the NHS and the Executive’s folly of pursuing a raw waiting list target that has led to the negation of its promises on health; notes with concern the overspend by health boards in the current year, the increasing levels of bed blocking and the failure of the Arbuthnot Report to address inequality in health spending; believes that the development of a modern NHS depends on a sustained programme of service redesign, greater public accountability and involvement and true partnership working across the NHS in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make the reduction of waiting times and access to treatment on the basis of clinical need its top priority for all the NHS in Scotland."
