 *S3M-6966.1 Murdo Fraser: Save Our Ships—As an amendment to motion (S3M-6966) in the name of Stuart McMillan, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "welcomes what it considers the sudden interest from members of the Scottish National Party in the future of the Royal Navy; believes that an independent Scotland would require a navy presence of, at best, a handful of fishery protection vessels; further believes that it is inconceivable that, in the unlikely event of Scotland becoming independent from the rest of the United Kingdom, the residual UK Government would place naval shipbuilding orders with a foreign country, and condemns what it considers to be the hypocrisy of SNP politicians calling for the UK Government to maintain orders for two aircraft carriers when, in the Parliament’s view, their flagship policy of independence would be devastating for the Scottish defence industry and mean the death knell of Scottish shipbuilding on the Clyde and at Rosyth."
