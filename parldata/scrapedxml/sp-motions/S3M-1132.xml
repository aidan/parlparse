*S3M-1132 Bill Kidd: Welcome Victory for Scots Literature—That the Parliament welcomes the US Library of Congress’s reversal of its decision to reclassify Scottish literature as a subsection of English literature, therefore keeping it as Scottish; notes that Scottish literature will be at the top of the table in the coming weeks as Burns Night is celebrated throughout the world, and hopes the words of Burns when he says "And there’s a hand, my trusty fiere! And gies a hand o thine! And we’ll tak a right guid willie waught, For auld lang syne" will ring true for all those celebrating his life and works. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Alasdair Allan*, Rob Gibson*, Aileen Campbell*, Jamie Hepburn*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bashir Ahmad*, Robin Harper*, Mike Pringle*, Stuart McMillan*, Sandra White*, Bill Wilson*, Christine Grahame*, Brian Adam*, Gil Paterson*, Bob Doris*
