*S2M-2064.2 Mr Brian Monteith: Doctors’ Responsibility to the Public Sector—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2064) in the name of Dr Jean Turner, leave out from "NHS Scotland" to end and insert "the vast majority of general practitioners and GPs’ practices, as well as dentists and dentists’ practices, work as private contractors to the NHS and believes that, if immediate steps were taken to address this by making all doctors and dentists salaried employees of the NHS, many would go fully private and accordingly waiting lists and waiting times would then lengthen even more than they have under the current Scottish Executive."
