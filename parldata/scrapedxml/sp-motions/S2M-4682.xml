*S2M-4682 Chris Ballance: US Use of Prestwick Airport—That the Parliament notes with grave concern reports that Prestwick Airport has been used by the United States of America for flights carrying bombs to Israel for use in Lebanon; notes that this follows repeated allegations that the same airport has been used to facilitate the illegal rendition of terrorist suspects by the US; welcomes the reported intervention of UK Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett in noting her concerns to the US Government but calls for much stronger and unequivocal representation urging that any such flights stop immediately, and calls on the UK Government, First Minister Jack McConnell and the Scottish Executive, and the Prestwick Airport authorities to take all possible action to prevent future use of the facility by any aircraft carrying materials or equipment that could be used in the escalating Israel/Lebanon conflict.
