*S2M-5374 Donald Gorrie: Indian Music and Dance Co-operative—That the Parliament is concerned at the ending of the funding of the Indian Music and Dance Collective by the Scottish Arts Council from January 2007; values the contribution that the collective has made over 11 years by bringing together people from all races, backgrounds and cultures through learning and performing Indian music and dance; recognises that the collective provides the only regular classes in Scotland for sitar music and related instrumental and vocal music and that these have attracted a big increase in participants; believes that such projects should be supported as important pillars of a culturally vibrant and diverse Scotland, and urges the Scottish Arts Council to rethink its position and the Scottish Executive to support the Indian Music and Dance Collective through cultural and educational funding such as the Youth Music Initiative and through community development and diversity funds.
