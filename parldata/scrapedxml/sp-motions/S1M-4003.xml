*S1M-4003# Tavish Scott: Island Transport-That the Parliament recognises that reliable, regular and affordable air and sea transport links are vital to the social and economic well-being of the Scottish islands; welcomes the proposal from the Highlands and Islands Strategic Transport Partnership for improved air services in the Highlands and Islands backed by public service obligations; believes that the introduction of public service obligations provides an opportunity to ensure that the specified air services' timetables link in with those for ferry and bus services, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take this opportunity to provide the islands with a properly integrated transport service.
