*S3M-2287 Jamie Stone: Dounreayâ€”That the Parliament notes the importance of the nuclear and renewable energy sectors to the current and future economy of the north highlands; recognises that the decommissioning at Dounreay nuclear facility has created a valuable source of transferable skills; notes also the potential for developing a strategic reserve of renewable energy from the Pentland Firth, and encourages future investment in the generation of energy of all forms, that in future could help underpin the economy of the far north.
