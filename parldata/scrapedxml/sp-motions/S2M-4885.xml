 *S2M-4885 Rosie Kane: US Intelligence on Consequences of War in Iraq—That the Parliament agrees with the conclusions of the US intelligence agencies that the war in Iraq has helped cultivate "supporters for the global jihadist movement" and that the conflict has bred "a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world" and therefore calls for the immediate withdrawal of UK troops and an end to the occupation of Iraq, which many consider to be illegal.
