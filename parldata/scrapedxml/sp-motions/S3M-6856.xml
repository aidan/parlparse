*S3M-6856Murdo Fraser:Battle of Britain—That the Parliament commemorates with pride the 70th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain; pays tribute to the brave men and women who gave their lives during the Battle of Britain; acknowledges the role that Scottish forces played in the battle and the squadrons based in Scotland that, as part of 13 Group, helped defend Scotland and the north of England; recognises the nation’s debt to those serving in the RAF today, particularly those on operations in Afghanistan, and remembers Winston Churchill’s famous words of 20 August 1940, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."
