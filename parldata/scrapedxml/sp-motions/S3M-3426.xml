*S3M-3426 Margaret Mitchell: Elizabeth Montgomerie Building—That the Parliament welcomes the proposed Elizabeth Montgomerie Building at Monklands Hospital, the first cancer centre to be funded by a foundation established by Scottish golfer Colin Montgomerie; considers that the benefits for the hospital will be enormous and the vital service provided by the NHS can only be complimented by this kind of initiative, and therefore wishes Colin Montgomerie and Maggie’s Cancer Care Centres the very best of luck in getting the project off the ground.
