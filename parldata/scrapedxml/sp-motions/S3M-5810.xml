*S3M-5810 Bill Kidd: Japan’s Support for a World Free of Nuclear Weapons—That the Parliament welcomes that Hideo Hiraoka, a member of Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament and of the House of Representatives in the National Diet of Japan, and 203 other Japanese legislators have sent a letter to President Obama encouraging the United States of America to conclude negotiations with Russia on stockpile reductions, supporting the call for the US to adopt a sole purpose policy and avowing that Japan will not seek the possession of nuclear weapons if the US enacts such a policy; considers that signatories of the letter include leading members of all political parties, including Yoriko Kawaguchi of the Liberal Democratic Party, Co-chair of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament and a former foreign minister, Taro Kono of the Liberal Democratic Party, former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator Tadashi Inuzuka of the Democratic Party of Japan, Mizuho Fukushima of the Social Democratic Party and Masao Akamatsu of the New Komeito Party, and commends this cross-party consensus and the capacity of Japanese legislators, irrespective of political allegiances, to speak with one voice in affirming their commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons.
