 *S2M-5475# Margaret Mitchell: Motor Neurone Disease—That the Parliament acknowledges that motor neurone disease (MND) is a serious, progressively disabling and fatal condition, which can affect any adult and for which medical science currently has no known cause or cure; understands that there are currently 64 people in central Scotland and 280 people throughout Scotland with MND and that this figure is rising; congratulates the Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association for its commitment to improve the lives of suffers of MND and to help people living with MND; notes that in the financial year 2005-06 the association incurred costs of £63,836 in relation to the services provided by the MND care teams within central Scotland; further notes that there was no financial contribution towards the cost of providing these services from NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Forth Valley or NHS Ayrshire and Arran, the three NHS boards covering the central Scotland area; believes that there is a compelling case for NHS boards to meet some of the costs of providing these care teams which would make a huge difference in terms of the care received by those with MND, and considers that NHS boards should consider the provision of this funding as soon as possible. Supported by: Alex Johnstone*, David McLetchie*, Dave Petrie*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Phil Gallie*, Frances Curran*, Tommy Sheridan*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Murray Tosh*, Alex Neil*, Eleanor Scott*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Patrick Harvie*, Murdo Fraser*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, Shona Robison*, Ms Sandra White*, Carolyn Leckie*
