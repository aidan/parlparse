*S3M-178 George Foulkes: Right to Roam—That the Parliament notes the recent court ruling in favour of Ann Gloag, making her the first private individual in Scotland to exempt her land from right-to-roam legislation; considers this to be a regrettable decision that undermines the intention of The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, which was meant to enshrine right-to-roam laws and was one of the first flagship policies of the first term of the Parliament; notes that the legislation establishes a statutory right of responsible access to almost all land and water along with guidance on responsible behaviour for recreational users and land managers under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code; recognises the desire for people to enjoy and experience our beautiful countryside and landscape responsibly and respectfully, and calls on the Scottish Executive to honour this desire and undertake an immediate review of the legislation in light of this judgement in order to pre-empt similar challenges which would undermine the intention of the Parliament.
