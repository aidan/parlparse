*S2M-1504 Brian Adam: Bear Necessities-That the Parliament condemns BEAR Scotland for failing to maintain the central reservations and verges of Aberdeen's trunk roads to an acceptable standard; commends Aberdeen City Council officials and elected members for endeavouring to resolve this intolerable situation, and furthermore calls on the Scottish Executive to review the current contract with BEAR Scotland to ensure that these landscape maintenance works are carried out to a satisfactory standard.
