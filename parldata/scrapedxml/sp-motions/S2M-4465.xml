 *S2M-4465 Frances Curran: Trade Union Freedom Bill—That the Parliament recognises that free and independent trade unions are a force for good in UK society and around the world and are vital to democracy; welcomes the positive role which modern unions play in providing protection for working people and winning fairness at work; notes that the 1906 Trades Disputes Act granted unions the legal freedom to take industrial action; regrets that successive anti-union legislation has meant that trade union rights are now weaker than those introduced by the Trades Disputes Act; notes the overwhelming support at both the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party Conference for the Gate Gourmet workers and for improvements in union rights, including measures to simplify ballot procedures and to allow limited supportive action, following a ballot, in specificcircumstances; further notes that these conferences called for legislation which conforms to International Labour Organisation conventions ratified by the United Kingdom, and therefore welcomes the decision of the 2005 Trades UnionCongress to campaign for a trade union freedom Bill to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1906 Trades Disputes Act.
