*S3M-2510 Roseanna Cunningham: Perth Street Pastorsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the work done by the multi-denominational voluntary Perth Street Pastors; notes that, while the only location in which street pastors currently operate in Scotland is Perth city centre, there are moves to extend the concept into Aberdeen, Inverness, Glasgow, Dunfermline, Stirling and Edinburgh; further notes that in England, where the street pastor movement is widespread, some studies indicate that street crime falls by around 84% for the period of time when street pastors are out on the streets, and commends the many volunteers who are prepared to give up time at night to help make city streets safer and therefore make a night out a more enjoyable experience.
