*S3M-2433 Rob Gibson: Green Pig Project Begunâ€”That the Parliament welcomes news of the trialling of animal feed made from home-grown protein; in particular, congratulates the Scottish Agricultural College for backing the international research collaboration on the Green Pig project, which plans to use appropriate home-grown legume varieties to reduce the importation of expensive soybean meal; recognises the need to drastically reduce both soya imports that impact adversely on the environmental and social needs of producer countries and the expensive long-distance transport costs of this high-protein animal feed for use by Scottish livestock producers; further notes the likely benefits of the lower input of nitrogen required by home-grown alternatives such as oilseed rape, and believes that the excellent pedigree earned by Scottish scientists in conventional plant breeding can best be deployed to develop high-protein animal feed on Scottish farms and crofts that will take a natural and essential place in national food policy.
