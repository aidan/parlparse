*S3M-1928 John Park: Train to Gain—That the Parliament notes the plans, announced by the Prime Minister on 14 May 2008, to give employees in England the legal right to request time to train from their employers; believes that such moves are necessary to increase the number of people who can gain more skills, become more productive and develop more fulfilling careers; further notes that consultation will be undertaken by the UK Government on how workers can be legally empowered to make such requests to undertake training and that the arrangements for employers would be modelled on the existing right to request flexible working; considers that such moves will increase employer and employee awareness of the training and funds available, including the Train to Gain service which helps businesses identify and address skills needs and is further supported by the UK Government funding rising to over £1 billion per year by 2010-11, and hopes that the Scottish Government will bring forward similarly progressive proposals that will benefit both employees and employers, help develop a skilled workforce for Scotland and provide a boost to the Scottish economy.
