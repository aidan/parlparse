*S2M-816# Irene Oldfather: The Importance of Modern Language Learning-That the Parliament welcomes the First Minister's commitment in his New Year message to encourage Scots to promote our nation abroad, as well as inviting more foreign nationals to live and work in Scotland; is aware that the Lisbon Strategy highlights the importance of language skills in the economic life of the European Union; recognises that, as part of an enlarged European Union, the people of Scotland have an obligation to become linguistically diverse; recognises that linguistic diversity not only assists communication and increases economic opportunities, but also allows children to grow to respect different cultures; welcomes the European Commission's report Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: An Action Plan 2004-2006 and notes its aim of encouraging member states to make language learning a priority for pre-school and primary school children; agrees that early language learning is the basis for future language competency; notes that current policy in Scotland is that all students are entitled to experience learning a modern language no later than P6 and that the Scottish Executive recognises that pre-school years are an ideal age to enrich children's language experiences; welcomes the success of partial immersion projects in introducing children to a modern language at the early stage of primary school, and considers that the Executive should build on this experience.
