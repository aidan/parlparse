*S3M-7120 Jamie Hepburn: Opening of Scotland’s Largest Food Waste Recycling Facility—That the Parliament welcomes the official opening of Scotland’s largest waste recycling facility at Deerdykes in Cumbernauld by the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment on 28 September 2010; considers that this state-of-the-art anaerobic digestion facility will make a considerable contribution to reducing waste and provide a boost not only for Cumbernauld but Scotland as a whole as the first such facility in the country, and expresses its hope that the opening of this combined anaerobic digestion and in-vessel composting plant is the first of many such facilities being opened in Scotland, which will help Scotland on the way to meeting its world-leading climate-change targets and provide a cleaner, greener and more sustainable environment. Supported by: Anne McLaughlin*, Mike Pringle*, Bob Doris*, Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson*, Jim Tolson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Stuart McMillan*, Sandra White*
