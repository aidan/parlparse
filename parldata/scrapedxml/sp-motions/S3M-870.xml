*S3M-870 Rhona Brankin: Failure to Invest in Higher Educationâ€”That the Parliament recognises the vitally important contribution made by Scottish universities in equipping our people with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in an increasingly competitive world; expresses disappointment that as a result of the spending review statement universities will face a real-terms cut in their funding in the coming year; notes that this is the first such cut in the history of devolution; believes that this will place Scottish universities at a competitive disadvantage to other universities in the United Kingdom and abroad; supports a full review of the long-term future of the higher education sector and its contribution to Scotland; considers the proposed higher education budget to be inadequate, and pledges to work for a more equitable funding settlement to ensure that our university sector remains world class.
