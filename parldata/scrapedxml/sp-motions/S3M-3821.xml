 *S3M-3821 Bill Wilson: Increased GDP, Reduced Satisfactionâ€”That the Parliament notes the recent remark at the Sustainable Third Sector conference by Lucy McTernan, acting chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, that growth in UK GDP over the last 30 years has coincided with a reduction in life satisfaction; agrees with her that the global recession could be a good time for a shift to alternative ways of measuring welfare and that investment should be not only in physical infrastructure but in social infrastructure as well; further notes that the Child Poverty Action Group has called for more to be done to eliminate child poverty if targets for this are to be met; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Government has increased funding for the third sector by 37%, and calls on the Scottish and UK governments and other governments of developed nations when developing their policies to give more weight to measures of economic progress that elevate the wellbeing of people and therefore prioritise the reduction of inequality rather than GDP.
