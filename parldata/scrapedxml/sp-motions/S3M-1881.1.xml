 *S3M-1881.1 Jim Tolson: The National Game on Terrestrial Television—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1881) in the name of Keith Brown, leave out from "the new findings" to end and insert "that Scotland’s World Cup qualifying games for the competition in South Africa were awarded to both Sky and Setanta after they outbid their broadcasting rivals; regrets the call from some that Scotland’s qualifying games should be made a Group A listed sports event; recognises that such a move would undoubtedly have enormous detrimental financial implications for grassroots football as well as terrestrial broadcasters unable to equal the monies offered by Sky and Setanta; notes the enormous investment that Sky and Setanta have made in encouraging grassroots football across the country through their coverage of both the national team and the SPL; does however believe that the World Cup finals and the European Championship tournament should continue to be Group A listed sports events, and supports calls for Scotland’s World Cup and European Championship qualifying games to be Group B listed."
