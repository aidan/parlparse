 * S2M-2392 Rosie Kane:Excessive Profits on BP and Shell Oil Companies—That the Parliament notes that the BP and Shell oil companies have announced record annual profits of over £18 billion; further notes that Shell and BP intend to pay out over £15 billion in dividends in 2005 and concludes that neither therefore requires their excessive profits for investment purposes; believes that, if carbon emissions are to be reduced, it will require the delivery of a fully-integrated public transport system, and therefore urges the Chancellor of the Exchequer to introduce a windfall tax of 50% on oil companies’ pre-tax profits, the windfall to be used solely to improve public transport in Britain such as improving ferry services to Scotland’s islands, improving rural bus services and restoring the Borders rail link. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Carolyn Leckie*
