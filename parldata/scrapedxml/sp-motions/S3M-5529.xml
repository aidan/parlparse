*S3M-5529 Bob Doris: Applauding an Era, Maintaining the Link—That the Parliament acknowledges the outstanding services provided by the Queen Mother’s Hospital in Glasgow over the last 46 years and the dedication and professionalism of its doctors, nurses and midwives; appreciates the suggestion by Professor Andrew Calder, who led plans to bring maternity, paediatric and adult hospital services together in Glasgow, that "Queen Mother’s" should be retained in some form in the title of the new maternity unit at the Southern General Hospital as a link to the proud record of this pioneering hospital; looks forward to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children currently at Yorkhill being co-located with the new Southern General unit in 2015 when it moves to that site; commends the Evening Times and all those involved in the campaign to have these new facilities co-located, and looks forward to the tradition of excellence and innovation established at the Queen Mother’s Hospital continuing at the new facility for many years to come.
