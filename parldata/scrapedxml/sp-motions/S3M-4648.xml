*S3M-4648 Aileen Campbell: Launch of Iraq Inquiryâ€”That the Parliament notes the launch of the Iraq inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot; believes that the launch will be welcomed by the many individuals and organisations, including the Scottish Parliament, who have been calling for such an inquiry; reiterates its call for as much of the inquiry to be held in public as possible; further believes that the inquiry must cover issues relating to the legality of the decision to go to war in the first place, that any witnesses, including the current and former prime ministers, should positively respond to a call for evidence and that an interim report should be published if at all possible before the UK general election, and hopes that lessons learned by the inquiry will ensure that an illegal and unnecessary conflict like the war in Iraq never happens again.
