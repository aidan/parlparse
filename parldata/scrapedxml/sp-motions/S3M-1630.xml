 *S3M-1630 Rhona Brankin: Scottish Mining Museum—That the Parliament notes with concern that a report has identified that the buildings of the Lady Victoria Colliery, Europe’s best preserved 19th century pit complex, denoted as being of international significance by Historic Scotland and recently nominated as Scotland’s most treasured place, are increasingly fragile and urgently require £2.5 million to preserve them and urges Scottish Ministers to ensure that the fabric of the colliery buildings is secured for the enjoyment and education of future generations; considers the colliery to be a hugely important part of Scotland’s industrial heritage, and believes that appropriate support for the future care of the buildings and operation of the Scottish Mining Museum must be made available.
