 *S3M-1960# Jackson Carlaw: Holocaust Education in Scotland—That the Parliament accepts the crucial importance of ensuring that the genocide of the Jewish and other peoples and minority groups inflicted during the Holocaust is never allowed to slip from public consciousness; welcomes the commitment of successive Scottish governments to developing a permanent National Holocaust Museum based in East Renfrewshire and looks forward to the fulfilment of that commitment; applauds the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust, among other organisations, for the role it plays in educating young people from every background about the Holocaust and the important lessons that can still be learned from it today, and considers that sufficient resources should be made available to allow schools across the west of Scotland and beyond to provide ongoing Holocaust education, with visits to the Auschwitz concentration camp being considered as part of that educational mix. Supported by: Margaret Mitchell*, Murdo Fraser*, Bill Aitken*, John Lamont*, John Park*, Cathy Jamieson*, Ted Brocklebank*, Bill Kidd*, David McLetchie*, Elizabeth Smith*, Nanette Milne*, Jamie McGrigor*, Bill Butler*, Mike Pringle*, Mary Scanlon*, Robin Harper*
