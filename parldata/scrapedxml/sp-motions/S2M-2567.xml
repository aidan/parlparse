 *S2M-2567 Carolyn Leckie: Congratulations to the Principled Trident Protestors—That the Parliament congratulates the Trident Ploughshares protestors, including Rosie Kane MSP, for their principled and direct stand against Britain’s weapons of mass destruction including Trident, which is capable of destruction 2,000 times that of Hiroshima at a cost of £1 billion per year, money that would be better spent investing in society’s future, not its destruction; believes that the protestors should be rewarded for their community service; understands that, in the absence of a parliament with the power or political will to dismantle these weapons, extra-parliamentary direct action is legitimate, and hopes that such protest is successful in its aims. Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Tommy Sheridan*, Rosie Kane*
