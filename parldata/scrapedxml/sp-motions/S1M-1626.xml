*S1M-1626 Tommy Sheridan: Local Authority Housing Capital Debt—That the Parliament notes the introduction of capital receipt set aside rules by the previous Tory government in April 1996, diverting significant resources from council expenditure across Scotland; further notes the universal opposition of Labour MPs, councillors and CoSLA to these set aside rules when they were introduced; also notes that since financial year 1997-98 a total of £641 million has been diverted from investment in council housing stock and from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 a total of £315,536,000 has been lost from council housing budgets; finally notes that the sum lost from council housing budgets since 1999 could have delivered 126,214 households with whole-house central heating and insulation and/or double-glazed window units, and therefore agrees to rescind the capital receipt set aside rules with immediate effect, thus releasing in excess of £150 million in the current year and a similar amount in financial year 2001-02.
