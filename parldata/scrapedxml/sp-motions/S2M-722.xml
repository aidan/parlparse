*S2M-722 Trish Godman: The Commonwealth and Zimbabwe-That the Parliament commends those Commonwealth leaders who stood firmly against the lifting of the suspension of Zimbabwe from the organisation; is of the view that that stance will hearten Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition and currently on trial in that country, and will also send a message of hope to Mr Tsvangirai's colleagues, trade unionists, journalists and others who have been brave enough to oppose President Mugabe's oppressive regime, but believes, at the same time, that more affluent Commonwealth nations have to do much, much more in order to help eradicate the grinding poverty that blights the lives of so many Commonwealth citizens and, if there is a failure of political will in this regard, then those suffering people will inevitably question the value, or the point, of membership of the organisation.
