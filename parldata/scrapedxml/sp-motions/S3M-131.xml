*S3M-131 Bill Wilson: Lancet Publisher Withdraws from Defence Exhibitions—That the Parliament notes the valuable contribution to society made by The Lancet and that it was the aptly named Lancet that cut through the fog of war to reveal the true extent of casualties in Iraq during the present conflict; notes the very considerable support that the staff of The Lancet gained in their recent campaign to encourage its publishers, Reed Elsevier, to withdraw from the defence exhibitions industry, and wishes to congratulate both The Lancet staff and Reed Elsevier for the decision by the latter to withdraw from the defence exhibitions industry.
