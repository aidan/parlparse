 *S2M-4695 Alex Johnstone: Aberdeen’s Tartan Day—That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of, and participants in, Aberdeen’s Tartan Day celebration held on 5 August 2006; notes the wide variety of well-run fun, educational and cultural activities and events that promoted the city’s important role in Scottish history, and calls on the Scottish Executive to place more emphasis on home-grown events that will encourage people of Scottish descent and those with an interest in Scottish culture to celebrate Tartan Day in Scotland.
