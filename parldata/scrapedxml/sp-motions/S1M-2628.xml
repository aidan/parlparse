*S1M-2628 Christine Grahame: Scottish Borders Education Meltdown-That the Parliament notes with great concern that Scottish Borders Council has announced a further £7 million of cuts may be made by Scottish Borders Council which would result in (a) eliminating continuing education in the Borders leading to the closure of community wings and centres, including the Abbey Row Centre in Kelso which has 44 dependent organisations, such as mother and toddler and pensioner groups, and the loss of 100 or more jobs; (b) the cessation of funding for 15 voluntary organisations including Borders Womens Aid which will lose £50,000 of core funding and Gala Youth Project which will lose £60,000; (c) the threatened closure of the swimming pools at Jedburgh, Selkirk and Eyemouth, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to enter into immediate discussions with the Council administration with a view to providing special borrowing in order that these swingeing cuts are reversed.
