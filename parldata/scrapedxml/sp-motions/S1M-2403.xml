 *S1M-2403# Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Tourism Action Group-That the Parliament acknowledges the work and success of Edinburgh Tourism Action Group (ETAG) in a difficult financial and international climate; commends its work as a model of best practice in private and public sector partnership, between private companies and the City of Edinburgh Council, Edinburgh and Lothian Tourist Board and Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian; acknowledges Edinburgh's position as a tourist gateway to Scotland and one of the world's premier city destinations, and believes that the Scottish Executive should do all it can to support ETAG and the 25,000 people who work in the tourist industry in Edinburgh.
