 *S2M-1089.2 Alex Johnstone: Zero Waste-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1089) in the name of Shiona Baird, leave out from "urges" to end and insert "notes that Scottish local authorities need to improve their recycling performance by 15.4% over the next two years, three times the figure they have achieved in the last four, to meet the Executive's target of 25% of waste recycled by 2006; calls on the Executive to admit that its top-down approach is not working, and, as an alternative to a zero waste policy, urges it to allow local authorities the flexibility to deliver the best solutions for their areas in the long term."
