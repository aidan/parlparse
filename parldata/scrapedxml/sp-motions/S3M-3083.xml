*S3M-3083 Alex Neil: Calling Network Rail to Account in Scotland—That the Parliament expresses disappointment and concern at the attitude and behaviour of Network Rail in dealing with local organisations and individuals in relation to its preparations for reinstating the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link; believes that its intransigence has cost local people many thousands of pounds unnecessarily in legal fees; considers that it has treated complaints with almost total disregard for the concerns of people and organisations affected by compulsory purchase orders, and calls on the Scottish Government to examine ways of making the senior management of Network Rail in Scotland more accountable for its actions in relation to individual complaints, including bringing it within the remit of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman and the Scottish Information Commissioner.
