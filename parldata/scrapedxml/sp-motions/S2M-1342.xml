 *S2M-1342 Rosie Kane: Dietary Needs of Infants in Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre-That the Parliament is concerned about the health and well-being of two-year-old Eric Nakimbugwe who was recently removed from Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre with his mother, Deborah, where, due to inadequate provision of food suitable for the dietary needs of infants, the child has lost weight which is causing his mother great concern; demands, furthermore, that Her Majesty's Government hands over powers to the Parliament in order to allow it to take action in relation to this and other child protection issues that are outside its powers, and recognises that the children of detainees in Dungavel should be allotted the same levels of protection and care as any other children in Scotland.
