*S2M-5608.1 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Community Safetyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5608) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "recognises the concern and anxiety in our communities caused by both low-level antisocial behaviour and serious and violent crime; appreciates the increased burden placed on our police forces by new legislation and additional requirements; believes that the best way of tackling both serious crime and antisocial behaviour is a visible police presence to reassure the public and deter criminals, and therefore commits to the recruitment of 1,000 additional police officers for our communities."
