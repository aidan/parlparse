 *S3M-688 Dave Thompson: Drink Drive Limit Reduction—That the Parliament recognises the needless loss of life on Scotland’s roads each year due to drink driving; notes that the United Kingdom is now one of only four EU member states that have an 80mg per 100ml of blood drink driving limit; believes that a reduction in the legal drink drive limit to 50mg per 100ml of blood would save many lives; acknowledges that reducing the limit is not currently a devolved power and that implementation would require either legislation at Westminster or devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament; recognises that, in order for the reduction to have maximum impact, a considerable media and enforcement campaign would be required, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to take appropriate measures to reduce the drink driving limit for Scotland, in line with the majority of our European counterparts. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Bill Kidd*, Christina McKelvie*, Gil Paterson*, Rob Gibson*
