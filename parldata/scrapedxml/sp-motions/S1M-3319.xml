 *S1M-3319 Mr Mike Rumbles: Aberdeen City Council Planning Application for a Football Stadium and Other Facilities at Kingswells-That the Parliament notes with concern Aberdeen City Council's willingness to approve a planning application for a new football stadium and other facilities on a green belt site at Kingswells; further notes that many residents in the north east feel that this site lacks the necessary infrastructure to support such a development; agrees that the recent allegations of wrong doing within the council have undermined the public's confidence in the openness and transparency of the planning process, and calls on the Scottish Executive to hold a public inquiry on the application as a matter of urgency.
