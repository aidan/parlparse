*S3M-2671 Linda Fabiani: Scottish Broadcasting Commission—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Broadcasting Commission’s final report and recognises the cross-party engagement that enabled the commission to carry out its work in a constructive and consensual fashion; notes that the report reflects the importance of broadcasting to the cultural and economic life of Scotland and accepts that the Parliament should take an active role in considering the broadcasting industry and services as they relate to Scotland; welcomes the key recommendation for the creation of a new public service Scottish digital network, which represents a major opportunity to develop Scotland’s broadcasting industry; notes that the commission’s recommendations require action by a range of parties, and calls on the Scottish Government to respond positively to the report within its responsibilities.
