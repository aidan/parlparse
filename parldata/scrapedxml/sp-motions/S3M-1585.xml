Garnock Valley FMâ€”That the Parliament is pleased to note that Garnock Valley FM (GVFM) community radio station will go live to the public on 17 March 2008; recognises that the original 2006 launch of GVFM was due to the success of similar community radio stations in Saltcoats, Stevenston, Ardrossan and Girvan; commends the project partners, including North Ayrshire Council Community Learning and Development, University of the West of Scotland, Careers Scotland, Garnock Academy, NHS Ayrshire and Arran, the MATES community education project and Jobcentre Plus, as well as the many volunteers who will make the 28-day broadcast a success; recognises the value that the station will provide by broadcasting local news and featuring local bands and voluntary organisations, as well as focusing on health issues to increase awareness and access to health services within the community, and heartily encourages individuals who will be in the Beith, Kilbirnie, Dalry and Kilwinning areas to tune in to Garnock Valley FM on 87.9FM from 17 March to 13 April 2008.
