 *S3M-7458 Brian Adam: UK Government to Remove Emergency Towing Vessels—That the Parliament notes with anger the decision of the UK Government to remove the four emergency towing vessels (ETV) stationed around the UK from September 2011; believes that the ETVs play a key role in allowing a rapid response to emergency situations at sea, including fire fighting, rescue of personnel, pollution response and salvage; notes the importance of the country’s coastal water to local economies through fishing, aquaculture and tourism; further notes Lord Donaldson’s report, Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas, which recommended the introduction of the vessels after the Braer tanker disaster in 1993 during which nearly 85,000 tonnes of crude oil were spilled off the Shetland Islands, and calls on the UK Government to conduct a full assessment of the effects of the cuts on maritime safety and the capacity of the UK to respond to a Deepwater Horizon type event in, or another oil spill around, UK coastal waters.
