S2M-1869# Shona Robison: Scottish Air Ambulance Control Centre—That the Parliament supports the retention of the Scottish air ambulance control centre in Dundee; appreciates the professionalism of the current staff who between them have 184 years experience; recognises the comprehensive knowledge of Scotland’s geography and the capabilities of the aircraft as well as their experience of the needs of patients and clinicians; further notes that the control centre in Dundee is also responsible for processing a large number of overspill calls from other ambulance control centres in Scotland; and therefore believes that any move to mothball the Dundee Air Desk would be a retrograde step which could compromise patient safety.
