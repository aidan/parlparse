 *S2M-2751 Dr Jean Turner: International Nurses’ Day 2005: Patient Safety and Targeting Counterfeit and Substandard Medicines—That the Parliament pledges its support for International Nurses’ Day, which is celebrated around the world every 12 May on the anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birth; notes that the theme for 2005, "Nurses for Patient Safety: Targeting Counterfeit and Substandard Medicines", is to increase awareness of the existence and consequences of counterfeit medicines which the World Health Organisation estimates make up more than 10% of the global medicines available in the market and are found in both developed and developing countries; further notes that the World Health Organisation also estimates that up to 25% of the medicines used in developing countries are counterfeit or substandard; recognises that nurses are on the front line of health, administering or prescribing medicines and are well positioned to monitor drug effects and side effects; believes that, by choosing this theme for International Nurses’ Day, the International Council of Nurses highlights the serious threat to patient safety that counterfeit medicines have become, and urges that every effort is made to provide tools to identify counterfeit drugs and to report any suspicious medicines, especially these with improper packaging and labelling. Supported by: Fergus Ewing*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Rob Gibson*, Brian Adam*, Eleanor Scott*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Shiona Baird*, Tommy Sheridan*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Christine Grahame*, Robin Harper*
