 *S1M-3257# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Death of Mrs Annie Davies—That the Parliament notes with concern the tragic death of Mrs Annie Davies, 84, of Aytoun Drive, Erskine on 30 May 1998; is aware of ambiguities surrounding her death, with eminent forensic pathologists expressing a view that there is strong evidence of foul play that conflicts with official police reports of accidental death and the Renfrewshire Procurator Fiscal considering Annie’s demise as "highly suspicious"; considers that previous investigations into this case may not have been independent or looked at all available evidence, and believes that the best way to ensure that this case is resolved to the satisfaction of all parties is for the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice to instigate an independent inquiry to review all the evidence, details and circumstances relating to Mrs Davies’ death.
