*S2M-939# Cathy Peattie: Stop Violence Against Women-That the Parliament notes that 8 March 2004 is International Women's Day; further notes that throughout the world women and children continue to suffer from violence and abuse; congratulates Amnesty International who on 5 March 2004 launch their global "Stop Violence Against Women" campaign; notes that in Scotland only a small percentage of domestic abuse incidents result in successful prosecutions, and believes therefore that the Scottish Executive should build on existing partnership work to ensure that the justice system affords protection to victims and acts as a deterrent to perpetrators.
