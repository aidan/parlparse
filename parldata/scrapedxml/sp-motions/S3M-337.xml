*S3M-337 Mary Scanlon: Clydeville Centre, Buckieâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Mags Fowler and her staff following the official reopening of the Clydeville Centre in Buckie; praises the Moray Council and NHS Grampian for their excellent example of partnership working which helped to bring about a project which neither could have developed on their own, and fully supports this much-needed health and social day care centre in the east of Moray which will have places for 10 to 12 young people and 14 places for elderly people needing psychiatric care, and which could become a model for similar ventures elsewhere in Moray.
