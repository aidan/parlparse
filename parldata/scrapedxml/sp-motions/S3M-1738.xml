 *S3M-1738 George Foulkes: Teachers Right to Anonymity—That the Parliament supports the Educational Institute of Scotland and Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People in their call for teacher anonymity to be protected until the point that they are convicted by a court and encourages the Scottish Government to establish a review of current practices involving all stakeholders, including unions, the commissioner, teachers, lawyers and representatives of the media, to consider what is an extremely sensitive but also very important issue of fairness and justice.
