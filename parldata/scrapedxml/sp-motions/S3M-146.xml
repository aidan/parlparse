*S3M-146 Sandra White: 2010 Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty—That the Parliament entreats all Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty signatories to make every endeavour to ensure that the preparatory committee for the 2010 review conference is afforded full support in its principal aims of facilitating and making recommendations in respect of the treaty, which is regarded as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and is designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to further the goal of nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament and to promote co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; considers it appropriate for Scotland to be accorded observer status to the committee in view of the precedent set by Palestine and the fact that Britain’s nuclear deterrent, the Trident missile system, is stationed in Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Executive to consider what course of action could be taken to achieve this end.
