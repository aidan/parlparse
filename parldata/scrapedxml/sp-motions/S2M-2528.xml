*S2M-2528 Shiona Baird: Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and the Scottish Parliament’s Climate Change Inquiry—That the Parliament notes with concern that the Scottish Executive has today launched a public consultation into the route options for the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (WPR); recognises that the WPR and other major road projects will increase traffic and increase greenhouse gas emissions that will contribute to climate change; condemns Scottish ministers for going ahead with major new road projects, including the WPR, before the Environment and Rural Development Committee has made its report to the Parliament on its inquiry into climate change; recognises that the WPR has been estimated to cost between £200 and £400 million whilst only reducing congestion by 2%, whereas government-commissioned research has demonstrated that improving public transport and other measures could achieve congestion reductions of 5 to 21%, giving returns of £10 in reduced congestion for every £1 spent; calls on the Executive to seriously consider alternatives to the WPR, and further calls on the Executive to recognise the seriousness of proceeding with projects that will contribute to climate change and to respect the Parliament by halting any decision on the WPR, at least until after the Committee has reported on its climate change inquiry.
