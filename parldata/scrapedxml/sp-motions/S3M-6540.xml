*S3M-6540 Kenneth Gibson: Achieving Smoke-free Mental Health Services in Scotland—That the Parliament believes that action should be taken to bring NHS mental health facilities into line with other NHS premises concerning smoking in the grounds; believes that the no smoking policy on NHS premises sends out a positive lifestyle message and helps protect patients, staff and visitors from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke; agrees that mental health facilities should also adopt such a policy, considering that they are currently exempt from doing so; notes with concern that smoking rates are higher among people with mental health issues in comparison with the general population; acknowledges that people with mental health issues are more likely to smoke heavily, and recognises that recent trials have proven that such policies have been introduced successfully with little or no negative impact and that fears over patient behaviour and increased aggression were not justified.
