 *S2M-3282# Bill Butler: Drumchapel High School Pupils’ Support for the Vucaj Family—That the Parliament expresses its admiration for the pupils of Drumchapel High School in Glasgow who have organised a petition which has already attracted hundreds of signatures in support of their friends and fellow pupils, Nimet, aged 16, and Saida Vucaj, aged 13, who were taken from their home in Scotstoun at 7.00 am on Tuesday 13 September 2005 following the rejection of their family’s asylum application; conveys concern at the apparently heavy-handed nature of the family’s eviction which saw Elvis Vucaj handcuffed by one of several immigration officials drafted in to extract the family from their home and the youngest child, Saida Vucaj, removed in her pyjamas; hopes that the pupils’ petition will play an important part in attempting to convince the Home Office to grant the family a stay of removal pending a case review; agrees that these acts of solidarity and support, including staff members at Drumchapel High School writing to Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, in support of the Vucaj family’s case, not only exemplify the goodwill which exists towards asylum seekers in Scotland but also demonstrate the philosophy behind the Scottish Executive’s "One Scotland, Many Cultures" campaign, and considers that the pupils should be congratulated for their stance. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Nicola Sturgeon*, Tommy Sheridan*, Mr John Swinney*, Stewart Stevenson*, Rob Gibson*, Des McNulty*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Linda Fabiani*, Jackie Baillie*, Tricia Marwick*, Kate Maclean*, Robin Harper*, Chris Ballance*
