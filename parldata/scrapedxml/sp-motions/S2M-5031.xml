*S2M-5031 Tommy Sheridan: Excess Winter Deaths in Glasgow and Clydeâ€”That the Parliament notes with grave concern the massive increase in excess winter deaths in the 0 to 64 age group in the Glasgow and Clyde area in 2005-06, which have risen from 20 in 2004-05 to 130 in 2005-06, a rise of some 550%; notes that these are excess winter deaths; recognises that many families and individuals in Glasgow and Clyde remain trapped in cold damp housing which can exacerbate existing underlying health conditions, such as heart and respiratory conditions, and that multiple housing deprivation has been recognised as posing a health risk that is of the same magnitude as smoking and, on average, greater than that posed by excessive alcohol consumption; further notes that air quality in Glasgow remains very poor, which can also exacerbate underlying health conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to undertake an inquiry to ascertain the cause of the rise in excess winter deaths in the 0 to 64 age group and, further, to address the problems of cold damp housing and to fully implement the air quality strategy for Glasgow.
