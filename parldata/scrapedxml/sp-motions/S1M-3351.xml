*S1M-3351 Cathy Jamieson: Throughcare and Aftercare of Looked After Children-That the Parliament recognises that young people leaving care need effective support to make a successful transition to independent, adult living; welcomes publication of the report by the Throughcare and Aftercare Working Group and the Executive's intention to consult on its recommendations, and believes that the policy initiatives led by the Executive will close the opportunity gap for these young people and lead to real improvements in their lives.
