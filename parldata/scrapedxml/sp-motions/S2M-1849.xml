*S2M-1849# Colin Fox: Review of NHS Prescription Charges—That the Parliament notes the remit of the Scottish Executive’s review of NHS prescription charges which will take place in two phases, firstly a five-month comparative study of international prescribing and exemption regimes followed by a three-month public consultation and believes that, following the recent decision of the National Assembly for Wales to abolish these charges, the review should also consider this option.
