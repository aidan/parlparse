*S2M-5373 Ms Sandra White: Concern Over New Glasgow Children’s Hospital—That the Parliament voices serious concern at the proposed reduction in beds at the new Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow which, according to Alasdair Fyfe, one of Scotland’s most senior paediatric surgeons, is happening because "the judgments of clinicians and other staff regarding the planned clinical requirements are being significantly challenged on the basis of the financial restraints in place"; agrees with Mr Fyfe’s statement that a better financial package needs to be provided in order to cope with the predicted increase in patient numbers; notes that the emotive decision to close Yorkhill Hospital gained acceptance only as a result of the Scottish Executive’s commitment to provide a replacement children’s hospital that was equal to, if not better than, the previous hospital; questions whether the Minister for Health and Community Care’s commitments have been reneged on, and believes that the Executive should investigate this issue with utmost urgency with a view to having a full debate after the parliamentary recess.
