 *S3M-2413.1Patrick Harvie:British Airports Authority—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2413) in the name of Charlie Gordon, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "deeply regrets that the Competition Commission’s investigation into the future of the United Kingdom’s airports gave no consideration to the industry’s contribution to climate change; considers any examination of aviation which ignores this vital issue to be little more than absurd, and urges the UK and Scottish governments to abandon the aspiration for endless aviation growth, which would make their climate change targets unreachable before 2050."
