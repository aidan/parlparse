*S3M-5706 Brian Adam: Renewable Investment in Aberdeen—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of Technip to locate its North Sea offshore renewables head office in Aberdeen, which will bring 20 jobs to the city with potential for more; further welcomes the Scottish Enterprise report, Scotland’s National Renewable Infrastructure Plan, which identified Aberdeen as a potential location to support renewable energy in offshore waters; notes the Scottish Government’s efforts to attract further renewable innovation with the £10 million Saltire Prize and evidence pointing to Scotland’s considerable renewable energy potential, and believes that these developments, which build on the oil and gas industry’s highly skilled workforce who have extensive experience in offshore installations and energy production, will help secure Scotland’s place at the forefront of renewable energy and Aberdeen the title of Europe’s energy capital.
