*S3M-5449 Kenneth Gibson: High-speed Rail Linkâ€”That the Parliament notes the failure of the UK Labour government to include any plans yet to proceed with a high-speed rail link north of the Midlands; acknowledges the economic benefits that such a rail link will have, and believes that not only should such a link include Scotland but that, for once, such a project should start in Scotland and extend south rather than the other way around with Scotland only being included decades later, as has happened notably in relation to motorway construction.
