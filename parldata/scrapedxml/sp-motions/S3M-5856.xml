* S3M-5856 Robin Harper: Stop the Illegal Killing of Birds of Prey—That the Parliament notes the submission of a petition by RSPB Scotland entitled Stop the illegal killing of birds of prey; remains extremely concerned that birds of prey continue to be killed in Scotland despite it having been illegal for the last 50 years; urges ministers to do more to protect birds of prey through the speedy and effective implementation of the recommendations of the 2008 joint thematic inspection of wildlife crime; is aware that the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 gives courts powers to jail those involved in serious wildlife crime for up to six months but that, so far, this penalty has only been applied to egg collectors; further notes that in January 2010 the Natural Protection Service of the Guardia Civil in Spain found a stockbreeder guilty of placing poisoned meat baits in the same area where a bearded vulture from a regional government environmental reintroduction programme had been found dead around five days previously and that subsequently the perpetrator was sentenced to a year and a half in prison and 18 months of disqualification from hunting, fishing and public employment or position; commends the Spanish authorities for handing down a sentence that it believes will act as a deterrent to others who would consider such an activity, and urges the authorities in Scotland to follow this example of good practice and ensure that penalties reflect the seriousness of the crime and act as a real deterrent.
