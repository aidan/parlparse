 *S1M-2447# Mr Kenny MacAskill: Congestion and Pollution caused by Edinburgh "Bus Wars"—That the Parliament notes with concern the escalation of the "bus wars" in the city of Edinburgh, a situation which is detrimental to routes, services and passengers and which results in congestion and pollution in some areas, at the same time as routes and services are lost in others, and urges all responsible parties to take appropriate action to address this situation and to allow Scotland’s capital city to develop an integrated transport network in the 21st Century.
