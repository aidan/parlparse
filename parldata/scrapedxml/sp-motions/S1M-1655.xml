*S1M-1655# Johann Lamont: Tackling Religious Discrimination—That the Parliament congratulates the many organisations in Scotland which work to challenge religious bigotry; welcomes the initiative taken by the Celtic Football Club in its Social Charter and its Bhoys Against Bigotry Campaign in seeking to promote equality and challenge bigoted attitudes through a programme of work with young people and their schools; notes that, in recognising the power it has to influence the way young people see their world and in showing a willingness to use that power positively, Celtic Football Club provides an excellent model for those who wish to tackle bigotry and discrimination; acknowledges the immense potential of such an approach; urges Scotland’s football and other sports clubs to consider pursuing similar initiatives; believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how it might support the development of this work across Scotland; congratulates Glasgow City Council, in partnership with Rangers FC, Celtic FC, the Catholic Church, the Church of Scotland and the 'Nil by Mouth' campaign, in securing funding from the Millennium Award Partnership Scheme to pursue initiatives which tackle religious bigotry and discrimination, and urges the Scottish Executive and the appropriate committees of the Scottish Parliament, in co-operation with this project, to examine how such aims might be progressed and to explore the possibility of legislation to make discrimination on the grounds of religion an offence.
