*S2M-4123 Donald Gorrie: Excessive Paperwork—That the Parliament believes that many aspects of Scottish life suffer from an excess of regulation and paperwork, which is created and imposed by the European Union, Whitehall, the Scottish Executive, councils and health and other authorities, and suggests that, to help reduce this burden and to free the energies and initiative of those burdened, relevant Parliamentary committees should each set up a reduction of bureaucracy sub-group which would work with the initiators of, and sufferers from, excessive regulation and paperwork with the aim of significantly reducing its volume.
