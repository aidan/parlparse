*S2M-3520# Alex Fergusson: A76 - The Case for Improvement—That the Parliament notes with regret the two recent deaths on the A76 in separate incidents north of Sanquhar and near Auldgirth; recognises that the upgrading of the A77 to motorway standard from Glasgow to Kilmarnock has brought about a steady increase in the amount of traffic using the A76; notes that there have been three deaths in five years on the same stretch north of Sanquhar which would have been upgraded by now had the Scottish Executive not shelved plans agreed in the route action plan in favour of an easier option south of Sanquhar; recognises the formation of the A76 Action Group, and considers that the Executive should identify priority stretches of the A76 for urgent upgrading on safety grounds before further lives are lost.
