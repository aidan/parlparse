*S3M-2439 Alasdair Allan: Barra and Vatersay Climate Change Challenge Funding—That the Parliament welcomes the recent steps taken by the communities of Barra and Vatersay to reduce their carbon footprints by successfully applying for £62,000 funding from the Climate Challenge Fund; welcomes the effect that this £18.8 million Scottish Government initiative will have in helping Scottish communities to make a real difference by significantly reducing their carbon emissions; congratulates Barra and Vatersay on their success in winning this funding to allow more local food to be produced, which will allow the amount of produce shipped over from Oban to be reduced; also believes that this funding will lead to more clean community renewable power, greater home energy efficiencies and a major improvement in the level of recycling on these islands; further welcomes the great scale of ambition shown by these communities to cut their carbon emissions along with improving quality of life and investing in the local economy, and notes that in the Western Isles the costs of relying on fossil fuels are high but the opportunities for various forms of community renewable energy are massive.
