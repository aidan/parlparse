 *S2M-4700 Christine Grahame: Edinburgh Crystal and Selkirk Glass—That the Parliament notes with concern that Edinburgh Crystal, with its headquarters in Penicuik, has been put into administration with the loss of 70 local jobs and that this represents a substantial blow to the local economy and to the individuals who have lost their employment and to their families; notes that Edinburgh Crystal is an internationally recognised Scottish company and calls on the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to intervene to ensure that the company remains productive in Scotland, and, noting that Caithness Glass is also in administration, calls on the minister to support that company and its other sister company, Selkirk Glass, which is a success story in the Borders, diversifying as it has through its visitor centre and highly successful café/restaurant.
