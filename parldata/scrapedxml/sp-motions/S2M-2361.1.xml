 * S2M-2361.1 Murdo Fraser: The Economy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2361) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first “calls” to end and insert “agrees that fluctuating prices and finite supplies make oil revenue an unreliable source of income; notes that, even if all revenue from North Sea oil had been allocated to Scotland in 2002-03, net borrowing would still have been £4.4 billion; further notes that Scotland’s businesses, who are the core drivers of wealth and economic growth, are demanding concrete action, not constitutional change, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take immediate steps to create a more business-friendly environment by reducing business rates and water charges and cutting red tape, thereby encouraging business development and boosting Scotland’s economic competitiveness.”
