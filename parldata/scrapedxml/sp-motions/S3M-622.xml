*S3M-622 Bill Kidd: Destitution of Refused Asylum Seekers—That the Parliament welcomes the Still Human, Still Here campaign, supported by organisations including Amnesty International and the Scottish Refugee Council, which is dedicated to highlighting the plight of "refused asylum seekers who are being forced into abject poverty in an attempt to drive them out of the country"; believes that the denial of any means of subsistence to refused asylum seekers is inhumane, degrading and ineffective; recognises that many refused asylum seekers cannot return to their country of origin for reasons beyond their control and believes that the threat and use of destitution should not be used as a tool against refused asylum seekers, and further believes that refused asylum seekers should be granted permission to work until such time as they have left the United Kingdom or continue to receive financial support, that they should also continue to have access to accommodation, healthcare and education, that they should be granted some form of legal status until they can return to their country of origin and that humane solutions can and should be found to work with people at the end of the asylum process. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*, Alex Neil*, Robert Brown*, Rob Gibson*, Ian McKee*, Christina McKelvie*, Dave Thompson*
