*S1M-392 Michael Russell: Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme—That the Parliament welcomes the report published today by the Rural Affairs Committee on the original and revised ABIS schemes; expresses its concern that there are still around 4000 outstanding applications which, under European rules, will fall if not approved before 31 December 1999; notes that the rules of the revised scheme required applicants in many cases to undertake considerable expenditure in order to meet the approved criteria; accepts the conclusion of the Rural Affairs Committee that the Executive must honour the commitment made in February 1999 by a pre-devolution minister for agriculture to fund all eligible applications, and therefore calls upon the Minister for Rural Affairs to seek from Her Majesty's Government sufficient funds to meet all eligible applications, for all approvals to be made by 31 December 1999 and by so doing to accept the moral obligation that the Executive must carry in this matter given the previous commitment by a Labour Minister for Agriculture in the former Scottish Office.
