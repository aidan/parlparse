 *S3M-2060 Shirley-Anne Somerville: No to New Nuclear Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by the UK Government of its intention to expand its nuclear programme; further notes that no nuclear power stations have ever been developed and maintained without substantial public subsidy which inevitably comes at the cost of investment in other areas such as developing clean renewable technologies; recognises the soaring costs of dealing with the existing legacy of radioactive waste from ageing nuclear facilities, with the decommissioning bill set to rise above £73 billion; notes that in 2006 Scotland could have supplied 92.5% of its electricity needs from non-nuclear sources, with electricity generated by non-hydro renewables having increased by 46% over the previous year; believes that further investment in nuclear energy would be a wasteful, dangerous and unnecessary distraction from developing Scotland’s renewable industry, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s reaffirmation that there will be no new nuclear stations in Scotland.
