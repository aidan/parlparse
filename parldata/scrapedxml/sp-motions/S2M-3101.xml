 * S2M-3101 Jackie Baillie: Way Out West—That the Parliament applauds the achievement of young people from West Dunbartonshire’s high schools who participated in song writing workshops resulting in the production of “Way out West”; notes that funding for the project came from a number of agencies including West Dunbartonshire Community Safety Partnership as part of the Local Action Fund; believes that, given the necessary resources, the energies of young people can be positively directed and enhance their local communities, and supports continued investment in youth services and programmes provided by the Scottish Executive in such forms as local action funds.
