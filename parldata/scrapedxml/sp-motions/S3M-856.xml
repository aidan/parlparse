*S3M-856 John Wilson: Return of Darfuri Asylem Seekers to Sudan—That the Parliament expresses its disapproval of the recent decision by the House of Lords and its ruling to return Darfuri asylum seekers to Sudan, citing the research of Dr James Smith, Executive Director of the Aegis Trust, who confirmed that there are documented cases of torture, unlawful imprisonment and disappearances of those who are forcibly returned to Sudan and notes the hypocritical decision of the UK Government to condemn publicly the human rights abuses in Darfur by the Sudanese authorities and the Janjaweed militia, while forcing refugees, seeking the help of a supposedly supportive nation, to return to such a dangerous and volatile country.
