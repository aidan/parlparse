*S2M-3194 Brian Adam: Single Status Agreementâ€”That the Parliament expresses grave concern that the single status agreement reached in 1999 is clearly collapsing; regrets the manner in which Moray Council and Aberdeen City Council have tried to implement it, believes that this is a matter for collective bargaining and not for the courts; urges the Scottish Executive to encourage COSLA and the trade unions to revisit the proposals, and calls on ministers to help them to arrive at a viable national solution to a national agreement.Supported by: Alasdair Morgan*, Fergus Ewing*, Alex Neil*, Mr John Swinney*
