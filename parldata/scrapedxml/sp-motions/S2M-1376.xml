*S2M-1376 Frances Curran: Solidarity with Colombian Workers-That the Parliament condemns the attempt to sell off the Cali municipal services company, EMCALI, in Colombia; supports the occupation by 1,600 workers, including members of the trade union Sintraemcali, of the central hall of the Central Municipal Administration tower, calling for the resignation of EMCALI's managing director, Carlos Alfonso Potes, who has been found guilty of involvement in corruption and falsification of figures by the Attorney General who recommended his disqualification from working in the company and for holding public office for seven years; notes that, in spite of this, the Superintendent of Public Services, Eva Maria Uribe, confirmed that Potes would carry on in his position, and therefore calls for this corrupt official, Potes, to be sacked and for international solidarity with the workers of Cali.
