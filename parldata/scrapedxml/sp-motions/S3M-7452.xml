*S3M-7452 Malcolm Chisholm: Lothian Supported Carers Scheme—That the Parliament congratulates Barnardo’s Scotland on the launch of the Lothian Supported Carers Scheme (LSCS), a new Lothian-wide project based in north Edinburgh and funded for five years by the Big Lottery Fund in partnership with all of Lothian’s local authorities; understands that young people often leave care with multiple and complex needs and are vulnerable to the risk of homelessness and social exclusion; recognises that the scheme will provide what it believes will be much-needed accommodation and support for 65 young care leavers not ready to live independently; considers that LSCS will play a vital role in working with young care leavers and providing a positive role model from which to develop meaningful relationships and reduce the risk of antisocial or offending behaviour; commends the engagement of young people in the scheme; applauds the contribution that carers will make in helping young people through the important transition from adolescence to adulthood, and looks forward to seeing the young people realise their full potential.
