*S3M-5564 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Centre for Cities’ Report—That the Parliament welcomes the Centre for Cities’ report, Cities Outlook 2010, which places Edinburgh as one of the top UK cities to bounce back to recovery from the recession; highlights the think-tank’s claim that the turnaround of the UK’s largest cities will be critical to national recovery and that Edinburgh has the right ingredients to succeed after the recession has passed; considers that, with a key percentage of highly-skilled workers, low youth unemployment and a number of knowledge-intensive businesses, the city continues to be a strong financial European capital, and congratulates the City of Edinburgh Council’s Economic Resilience Action Plan, which has supported the capital in being a good place to live and work during these tough economic times.
