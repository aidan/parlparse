*S3M-4218 Maureen Watt: Laurencekirk Station—That the Parliament welcomes the improved access to rail services for passengers in the north east, brought about by the reopening of Laurencekirk Station; commends the Scottish Government on its delivery of the station after repeated delays under the previous administration, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s continued determination to reverse years of neglect by delivering improved transport links throughout the north east.
