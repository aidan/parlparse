*S2M-3889 Fiona Hyslop: Sale of BB Guns at Marketsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the market organisers, Spook, to adopt a new policy that no BB guns or similar articles may be sold at any of their sites in Scotland, following a joint police/trading standards visit to the market at Bonnyrigg and discussions with organisers, and considers this an excellent move given a recent incident when two armed police response units attended a call reported as a man with a handgun, only to find it was a BB gun.
