 *S2M-5729# Colin Fox: Welcome for the First of Midlothian’s 1,000 New Council Houses—That the Parliament congratulates Midlothian Council on completing the first of 1,000 new council houses to be built under its ambitious housing plans; notes that the properties at Bill Russell Grove in Dalkeith are the first significant number of council houses to be built in Scotland in 20 years; hopes that the new tenants will be very proud of their superb new homes; recognises the very significant contribution that the £105 million project across Midlothian will make in providing much-needed social housing in the area; looks forward to seeing further new homes built in due course in Penicuik, Bonnyrigg, Gorebridge and throughout Midlothian, and believes that all councils in Scotland should follow Midlothian’s lead and cater for the significant need for social housing that exists in every local authority area.
