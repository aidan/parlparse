 *S2M-3848.1# Donald Gorrie: Cumbernauld Town Centre—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3848) in the name of Margaret Mitchell, leave out from "congratulates" to end and insert "recognises that many of Cumbernauld’s problems result from the reorganisation of Scotland’s local authorities by the Tory party, including the dissolution of Cumbernauld District Council; believes that a lack of government funding for the past development corporation and the insistence by the Tory government that the town centre be sold off to commercial interests are contributory factors to the current condition of the centre because they restrict the ability of North Lanarkshire Council to tackle the problems, and considers that the council should initiate a consultation with the residents of Cumbernauld and that the owners of the town centre should engage in meaningful discussions on the future of the centre as a matter of urgency."
