 *S3M-1879 Bashir Ahmad: Muslim Police Association—That the Parliament congratulates Scotland’s first Muslim Police Association (MPA); believes that the MPA will play an important dual role in both tackling the ever-increasing problem of Islamophobia and confronting any institutional fears that may exist within the force, and welcomes the move to recruit more people from diverse backgrounds into the police force.
