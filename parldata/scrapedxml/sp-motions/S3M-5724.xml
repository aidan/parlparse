 *S3M-5724 Aileen Campbell: UK Parties Support Referenda on Constitutional Change—That the Parliament welcomes the unanimous decision of the Welsh Assembly to begin the process of holding a referendum on the future powers of the Assembly before the end of its current term in 2011; also notes the vote in the UK Parliament in favour of holding a referendum on electoral reform before October 2011; notes that in each case the proposals were backed by the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties; believes that this represents a growing consensus in support of referenda as the best way to determine a country’s constitutional future, and hopes that this consensus extends to the Scottish Parliament when the Scottish Government brings forward its proposals for a referendum on Scotland’s constitutional future. Supported by: Willie Coffey*, Alasdair Allan*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Stuart McMillan*, Anne McLaughlin*, Bill Kidd*, Jamie Hepburn*, Christopher Harvie*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Sandra White*, Bob Doris*, Brian Adam*, Kenneth Gibson*, Stewart Maxwell*, Bill Wilson*
