 *S3M-873 Sarah Boyack: Threatened Closure of the King’s Theatre in Edinburgh—That the Parliament notes with concern that the King’s Theatre in Edinburgh faces closure following a decision by the City of Edinburgh Council not to fund a refurbishment plan until at least 2010; notes the comments of the Chief Executive of the Festival City Theatres Trust which runs the venue on the council’s behalf that such a delay threatens the King’s Theatre with closure on health and safety grounds within two years; recognises the important contribution that the Tollcross venue has made in its 101-year history to the cultural life of Edinburgh, the Lothians and the east of Scotland and which continues today, including its role in Edinburgh’s festivals; believes that funding for refurbishment should be prioritised accordingly, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to enter into funding negotiations with the Scottish Government and the Festival City Theatres Trust with a view to securing a viable future for the King’s Theatre.
