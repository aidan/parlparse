*S3M-739.1 Des McNulty: The Environment—As an amendment to motion (S3M-739) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end "further notes the involvement of artists, architects and urban designers with housing associations, local authorities and others in efforts to regenerate urban as well as rural environments; notes the importance of the Environmental Justice Fund and the Community Regeneration Fund in enabling communities that have suffered from degraded environments to gain support to regenerate their communities, and calls on the Scottish Government to do more to protect and enhance Scotland’s landscapes, particularly in light of the challenges brought by climate change, and to link together cultural entitlements with environmental justice."
