*S2M-5696# Ms Sandra White: Congratulations to Glasgow Save Our Homes Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow Save Our Homes (GSOH) campaign on its ongoing support for those owner-occupiers of houses factored by Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) who have been under the burden of imposed one-year time limits for the payment of bills of £6,000 to £8,000 and who through their own unity and the considerable support of GSOH have won recent court victories that have allowed the extension of payment times to between two and four years, and believes that for these ordinary families, pensioners and low-paid Glasgow citizens this has been a rightful and well-deserved movement on the road to sanity in the dealings of GHA with these owner-occupiers.
