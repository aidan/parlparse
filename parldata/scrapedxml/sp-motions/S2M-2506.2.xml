*S2M-2506.2 Roseanna Cunningham: The Right to Protest at Gleneaglesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2506) in the name of Rosie Kane, leave out from "notes that the G8 summit" to end and insert "notes that the G8 summit will be meeting in Strathearn in July this year; resolves to uphold and support the right to peaceful assembly and protest in Scotland, in particular in Edinburgh at the Make Poverty History demonstration and at the summit itself in Strathearn; recognises, however, that those who reside close to the location of the G8 summit also have the right to privacy and to be able to pursue their lives and livelihoods free from harassment from whatever quarter, and considers that the important issues to be debated at the summit should be given as much publicity and consideration as the reported security arrangements."
