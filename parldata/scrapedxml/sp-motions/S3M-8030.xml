*S3M-8030 Bill Butler: Fairtrade Fortnight 2011—That the Parliament welcomes Fairtrade Fortnight, which runs from 28 February to 13 March 2011; applauds the efforts of church groups, charities, businesses, schools and individuals in promoting the benefits of fair trade in Scotland; believes that the fair trade movement has made a huge difference to the lives of thousands of people and communities across the globe; considers that the co-operative movement has played a pioneering role in the advancement of fair trade; further considers that the fair trade concept is based on traditional co-operative principles of community ownership, concern for communities and democratic membership control; notes that estimated sales of fair trade products across the United Kingdom rose by 40% last year to more than £1 billion; considers that the Scottish Fair Trade Forum (SFTF), established in January 2007, is a continuing success, and encourages schools, local authorities, further and higher education establishments and businesses to sign up to the SFTF’s Countdown Campaign, which will feature a year of events building up to 2012 when the forum will submit Scotland’s bid to become a Fair Trade Nation.
