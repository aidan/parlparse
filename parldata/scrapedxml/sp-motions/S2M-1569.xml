 *S2M-1569 Robin Harper: World Heritage Site for St. Kilda-That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive, Scottish Natural Heritage, the National Trust for Scotland and other bodies involved in securing extension of St. Kilda's World Heritage Site status to the marine environment; notes that decisions on cultural heritage aspects of the site have been deferred pending comparative studies and notes the difficulty of conducting such studies given the archipelago's uniqueness, and calls on the Executive to act to ensure that all Scotland's marine environment receives appropriate levels of protection, starting with the creation of a department of marine affairs with a dedicated minister.
