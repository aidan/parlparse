 *S3M-7224 Elaine Smith: Women’s National Commission—That the Parliament is concerned by the UK Government’s plans to close the Women’s National Commission (WNC); believes that the WNC is an important and cost-effective mechanism to give women a direct voice to government; believes that this is yet another blow for women across the United Kingdom at a time when the comprehensive spending review is likely to hit women and families disproportionately; understands the importance of continuing to combat the numerous inequalities that women suffer economically, socially and politically, and would welcome a reconsideration of the UK Government’s position on closing the WNC.
