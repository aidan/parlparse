*S1M-2520 Cathy Jamieson: Improving Scotland's Youth Justice System to Build Safer Communities-That the Parliament confirms its support for the Executive's objective of decreasing offending and disorder among young people, particularly persistent offending by a very small minority of young people; recognises the importance of early intervention measures, of youth work and of increased sports, leisure and educational opportunities in enabling all young people to fulfil their potential and to steering many young people at risk of offending away from a life of crime; welcomes the proposals to achieve these objectives including (a) mapping the coverage and effectiveness of community-based programmes to tackle persistent offending, (b) using the partnership opportunities provided by the multi-agency youth justice teams to develop more systematic early intervention measures and to improve the quality of information provided to the children's hearing about the offending behaviour and how re-offending could be prevented and (c) identifying how restorative justice approaches can prevent the offender re-offending and build the confidence of victims in our youth justice system and increase the safety of communities.
