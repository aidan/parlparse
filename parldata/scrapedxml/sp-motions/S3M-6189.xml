 * S3M-6189 Dr Richard Simpson: Success of Fife’s Alcohol Diversion Scheme—That the Parliament congratulates the police and alcohol support services in Fife on the success of the Alcohol Diversion Scheme, which ran in Kirkcaldy for six months until January 2010; notes that 190 people were hit with fixed penalty notices for antisocial behaviour and that 60 of those agreed to attend a three-hour awareness session run by Fife Alcohol Support Service to learn more about the dangers and consequences of binge drinking, including the increased risk of liver cirrhosis and certain cancers; notes that this was a higher number than predicted and that the response to counselling has been acknowledged as positive; further notes that the Scottish Government has said that it is up to other police authorities to take up this successful pilot, but calls on all alcohol and drug partnerships to follow the lead of Fife.
