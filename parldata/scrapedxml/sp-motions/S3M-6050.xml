 *S3M-6050 Bill Wilson: Ethiopia’s Gibe 3 Dam, Europe Must Not Fund Environmental Devastation—That the Parliament is alarmed by reports by Campagna per la Riforma della Banca Mondiale, Counterbalance, Friends of Lake Turkana and International Rivers that the European Investment Bank is considering financing the construction of the Gibe 3 Dam in Ethiopia; notes that these NGOs believe that this dam threatens the land and livelihoods of 500,000 tribal people in Southern Ethiopia and Northern Kenya and that, by ending the river’s natural flood cycle, it would destroy harvests and grazing lands along the river banks and fisheries in Lake Turkana and that it would devastate the unique culture and ecosystems of the Lower Omo Valley and Lake Turkana, both recognised as UNESCO World Heritage Sites; further notes their contentions that the dam violates Ethiopia’s constitution, international conventions, the environmental safeguard policies of international financial institutions and the strategic priorities of the independent World Commission on Dams, that most of the affected people know very little about the project, that the Ethiopian Government is clamping down on dissent and that affected people are not able to express their views or get independent information about the project; calls on the European Union to investigate the truth of these claims and to oppose the dam’s completion, rather than fund it, should even some of these fears and allegations be true, and calls on all interested parties to consider signing the petition at http://www.stopgibe3.org.
