*S2M-1178 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Congratulations to Fife Constabulary-That the Parliament congratulates Fife Constabulary for the successful pilot scheme of housing satellite police stations in rural post offices; notes how this programme has benefited communities in Fife by providing a police presence in remote areas as well as maintaining postal services at a time when many rural post offices are being closed, and hopes that this scheme will be rolled out to other rural areas throughout Scotland.
