 *S3M-4130 John Wilson: National Minimum Wage Increases—That the Parliament condemns the UK Government’s decision to accept the Low Pay Commission’s recommendation of a mere 1.25% increase in the national minimum wage, from £5.73 to £5.80 per hour; notes that this comes at a time when Glasgow City Council has indicated a figure of £7 per hour as a minimum for its employees, and calls on the UK Government to reconsider its decision so that people on the lowest pay scales receive an increase that genuinely makes a financial contribution to eradicating in-work poverty.
