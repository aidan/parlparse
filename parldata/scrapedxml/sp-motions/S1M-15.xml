S1M-15 Mr David Davidson: That the Parliament agrees that the current expensive implementation proposals for the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive [91/271/EEC], in so far as they apply to the Scottish fish processing industry, will effectively close many of the three hundred Scottish companies engaged in the industry, which provide around ten thousand skilled jobs, and calls upon the Scottish Ministers to delay the implementation for at least one year, to allow for proper consideration of the technical review currently being undertaken to produce cost effective solutions for the industry, and to allow for the development of effective affordable solutions enabling the industry to continue as a major employer in Scotland (lodged on 26 May 1999). Supported by: Mr Jamie McGrigor, Phil Gallie, Mr Nick Johnston, Miss Annabel Goldie, Alex Fergusson, Bill Aitken
