 *S3M-2793 Cathy Peattie: Scottish Safety Anomaly—That the Parliament notes with concern that Health and Safety Executive statistics published on 29 October 2008 show that in 2007-08 there were 32 fatal injuries and 2,721 major injuries to workers in Scotland, compared to 229 and 27,976 in the United Kingdom as a whole, and that the rate of fatal and major injuries in Scottish was 115.1 per hundred thousand, compared to 105.8 for the UK as a whole; further notes that only 52% of related prosecutions were successful in Scotland, compared to 89% in the rest of the UK; believes that, despite improvements across the UK, there is a persistent anomaly in the figures for Scotland that needs to be addressed, and further believes that serious consideration should be given to steps that can be taken within devolved powers to address this anomaly.
