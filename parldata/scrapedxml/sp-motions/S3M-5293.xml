*S3M-5293 Johann Lamont: Congratulations to Maria Fyfe—That the Parliament congratulates Maria Fyfe on her recent special award from the Scottish Trades Union Congress Women’s Conference; notes her critical role in the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and in her championing of 50:50 representation of women in the Scottish Parliament, and believes that the most fitting legacy for her long-term commitment to equal pay, the rights of women workers and equality for women would be to see a refreshed determination to secure increased representation for women at every level of government, in public bodies and in industry and to ensure greater priority for the rights of women at home, in the community and at work.
