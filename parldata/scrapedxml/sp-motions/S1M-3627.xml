 *S1M-3627 Ms Wendy Alexander: Straight Out Advisory Group—That the Parliament commends the work of the Straight Out Advisory Group (SOAG) in co-ordinating and assisting the delivery of social justice within the Paisley Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) area; recognises the particular emphasis SOAG places on assisting the most excluded young people resident in the SIP area to return to active citizenship, through, for example, the devising of pre-vocational and personal development support, in the form of counselling aimed at tackling an individual’s offending behaviour such as substance abuse and anger management, for former offenders that require additional assistance to join local training and employment projects; notes that the programme was the product of research by Scottish Enterprise, which stated that 80% of employers would not recruit someone with a known offending background; acknowledges the support given to SOAG by the Job Centre Plus Service which identifies the group as a crucial resource in cutting the number of men that sleep rough, fail to seek employment, or present themselves as destitute within the first week of their release from prison, and understands the difficulty faced by fast-growing organisations such as SOAG in maintaining the momentum of current claims and meeting the needs of new recruits.
