 * S2M-3100 Christine Grahame: The Red Cross in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament recognises the sterling contribution by the Red Cross acting under its seven founding principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality, both abroad and here in Scotland where it provides services in key areas such as emergency response and assisting the vulnerable; notes that in 2004 and, in particular, on 11 May 2004 with the explosion at the plastics factory at Maryhill, Glasgow, its volunteers assisted at the site for 70 hours following the explosion with other agencies, dealing with very distressed people, comforting relatives and treating minor injuries; further notes that its medical loan service provided equipment such as wheelchairs and walking frames to some 6,500 people and that its transport and escort service made nearly 30,000 journeys in 2004; applauds its network of 4,500 volunteers Scotland-wide and its 350 staff, and, in these challenging times, is mindful that it is a member of the International Red Cross Movement and Red Crescent Movement in which all societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other worldwide.
