*S2M-2037 John Swinburne: Stop Smoking Message at Football Grounds—That the Parliament agrees that positive action is necessary to help ease the crisis facing Scottish football clubs due to the withholding of copyright payments by pools companies for the use of fixture lists on their pools coupons at a cost to all clubs of £20,000 per annum and therefore believes that, in order to alleviate this crisis, to promote healthy-living issues and to sustain the future development of youth football, the Scottish Executive should divert some of its extensive budget, which is currently spent on television advertising, to renting from the Scottish Football Association the 20-foot-diameter centre circle at all major Scottish football grounds to exhibit a 314 square feet "No Smoking" logo which will advertise an anti-smoking message, reaching millions of people every week during televised matches and simultaneously sending out an SoS to "Stop our Smoking" and "Save our Soccer".
