*S3M-1770 George Foulkes: The SNP’s Real 10p Tax—That the Parliament notes the 10p rise in Lothian Buses standard adult fare to £1.10 and the recent findings of the Competition Commission on bus subsidies; believes that this rise, and those of other bus operators across the Lothians, are principally due to the Scottish Government’s decision not to pass on to Scottish bus operators the fuel duty rebate which the UK Government has provided for bus operators in England; notes that the Scottish Government’s budget indicates that no further fuel duty will be rebated in the next three years, meaning that bus passengers in Scotland will effectively pay a greater amount of tax on their journeys than passengers elsewhere in the United Kingdom; regrets the extra expense and inconvenience this fare rise will cause passengers at a time when the Scottish Government claims to be encouraging greater use of public transport and hopes that this fare increase is not an omen for the abolition of the national concessionary travel scheme for the over 60s which the Scottish Government is currently reviewing, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to rule this out at the earliest opportunity, to reassure passengers that any cap on future funding for the scheme will not put more pressure on fare-paying passengers and to reverse its decision not to follow the example of the UK Government and to protect bus passengers from rising fuel costs.
