*S2M-3340 Mr Brian Monteith: Skateraw Project—That the Parliament congratulates the Demarco European Art Foundation which, in collaboration with Johnny and Sandra Watson of John Watson Seeds, is presenting the Skateraw Project, an exhibition which celebrates the 75th birthday of artist and impresario, Ricky Demarco, by bringing together under one roof his 40-year-old archive of artworks of all kinds, photographic records, catalogues, correspondence and other artistic manuscripts of the Scottish and European avant-garde; marvels at the use of an insulated seed barn set in the inspiring East Lothian countryside to bring together the worlds of farmer and artist under the concept of Agri-Culture, where work can be seen, conceived and created, allowing people to discover that we are all artists; encourages members of the Scottish Parliament to make the journey on the road to Meikle Seggie and see how new horizons are in the offing at Skateraw; further congratulates other sponsors, such as Lloyds TSB (Scotland), British Energy, the Russell Trust, and Prestonfield House for their support, and wishes the event, which runs until 29 October 2005 at the Barn Gallery, Skateraw Farm, Dunbar, every success.
