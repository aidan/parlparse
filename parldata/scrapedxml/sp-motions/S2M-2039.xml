*S2M-2039 Mike Rumbles: Fluoride in Public Water Supply—That the Parliament commends the Scottish Executive for listening to the views expressed in response to its consultation on improving the oral health of Scotland’s children; welcomes the Executive’s commitment not to change the current legislation on fluoridation of water supplies, and believes that Scotland’s poor oral health record can be more effectively tackled by promoting increased action in schools and through the health visitor network than by adding fluoride to the water supply. Supported by: Margaret Smith*, Jeremy Purvis*
