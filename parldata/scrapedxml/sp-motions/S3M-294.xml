 *S3M-294 David McLetchie: Scotland are the World Schools Debating Champions—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish team of Stuart Cullen from George Heriot’s School, Neil Dewar from the High School of Dundee, Netan Dogra from Grove Academy, Joanna Farmer from Robert Gordon’s College and Calum Jones from George Heriot’s School on winning the World Schools Debating Championship held in Seoul, South Korea on 11 July 2007, in a competition with teams from 40 countries, and hopes that this will encourage more of our schools to offer young people the opportunity to participate in debates.
