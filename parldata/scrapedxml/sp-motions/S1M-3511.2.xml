*S1M-3511.2 Ross Finnie: Fishing—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3511) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "rejects the wholesale closure of Scottish fishing grounds as politically unacceptable and economically ruinous for Scotland’s fishing communities; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Executive is working in close collaboration with the Scottish fishing industry to identify alternative approaches, and urges all concerned to pursue a longer-term strategy that will reverse the historic decline in key fish stocks and secure a sustainable basis for our fisheries-dependent communities."
