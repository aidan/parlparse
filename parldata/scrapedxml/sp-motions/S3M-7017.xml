*S3M-7017♦ Ian McKee: Self Management Week—That the Parliament welcomes Scotland’s first Self Management Week, taking place between 4 and 8 October 2010;considers the Self Management Fund administered by the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland (LTCAS) on behalf of the Scottish Government to be successful; congratulates the work ofthe 81 diverse voluntary sector-led projects, which it considers are making a difference to the lives of people with long-term conditions across Scotland; notes in particular the Lothian Centre for Inclusive Living that is currently developing a national telephone counselling service run by trained councillors who are living with long-term conditions; considersthat, with around 40% of Scotland’s population living with at least one long-term condition, this group is likely to be among the worst affected by falling public spending; welcomes LTCAS’s new self-management awareness-raising campaign, to be launched on 29 September, and believes that the self-management agenda is now more vital than ever to ensure a high quality, person-centred and cost-effective approach.
