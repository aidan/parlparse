*S3M-369 Bill Kidd: Single Equality Bill—That the Parliament expresses concern that the proposals by the Westminster Government to harmonise discrimination law, in order to produce a simpler framework, will not have the desired effect due to the reality that each group facing discrimination has different needs and that these differing needs will not be recognised by streamlined legislation; expresses further concern in relation to Inclusion Scotland’s fear that the proposal for the Single Equality Bill, which will allow public bodies to select aspects of equality to work on over a period of three years and also permit them to take cost into account, will result in potentially not addressing the needs of disabled people for several years; recognises that this could be a concern of all such organisations interested in equality for specific groups, and, while still encouraging a review of discrimination legislation, calls on Westminster to reverse its promotion of a Single Equality Bill in respect of anti-discrimination laws.
