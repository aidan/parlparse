*S2M-1663# Mark Ballard: Second Forth Road Bridge—That the Parliament notes the relaunch of the campaign against a second Forth Road Bridge, under the title ForthRightAlliance, including Friends of the Earth Scotland, the Cockburn Association, TRANSform Scotland and others; further notes that 70% of cars crossing the bridge at peak times do so with a single occupant, and believes that the investment proposed for a new bridge would be better spent on providing public transport alternatives to allow drivers an alternative to using their cars.
