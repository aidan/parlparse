*S3M-7693 Jim Mather: Electricity Market Reform—That the Parliament notes the UK Government’s electricity market reform proposals and their importance to the delivery of the Parliament’s climate change and low-carbon energy objectives for Scotland; agrees that the related UK review of Ofgem and the transmission charging regime is an opportunity to deliver a more equitable system that is fit to help deliver Scotland’s massive low-carbon energy potential that will bring economic and other benefits to communities across Scotland; further notes the Parliament’s existing powers with regard to renewables and carbon capture and storage (CCS), which it believes should, at a minimum, be left intact; believes that the Parliament should continue to use these powers in support of the development of Scotland’s low-carbon energy potential; urges the UK Government to work closely with the Scottish Government to ensure that reforms further incentivise clean energy and incentivise energy demand reduction, as set out in the Draft Electricity Generation Policy Statement 2010; calls on the UK Government and Scottish Government to work together to help fulfil Scotland’s low-carbon potential, and further urges the UK Government to ensure full and immediate consultation with the Parliament on these proposals.
