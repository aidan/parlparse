*S2M-2551 Carolyn Leckie: Lebanon Resolution—That the Parliament notes with incredulity comments made by US President, George Bush, in his weekly radio address of 7 March 2005 in relation to Lebanon "that Lebanon’s sovereignty be respected, that all foreign forces be withdrawn, and that free and fair elections be conducted without foreign influence"; further notes that Iraq has recently conducted an election under the barrel of the guns of armies of occupation of the United States of America and the United Kingdom; believes that the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, permitted the Bush administration to shift attention from its Iraq failure to Syria’s presence in Lebanon, just as the US invasion of Iraq shifted attention from President Bush’s failure to capture Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and believes that President Bush’s remarks are further evidence of the US Government’s rank hypocrisy in relation to foreign policy and that any advice from President Bush has no credibility whatsoever.
