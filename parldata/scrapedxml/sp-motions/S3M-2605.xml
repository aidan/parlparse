*S3M-2605 Cathy Peattie: Pay Matters - Support Local Government Workers—That the Parliament congratulates all involved in the All Scotland March and Rally, which took place in Edinburgh on Wednesday 24 September 2008, the second day of action and strike for fair pay by public sector workers, involving members of the GMB, UNISON and Unite the Union; notes that some local government staff are paid little more than the minimum wage, below the level that poverty experts say is the minimum needed to provide our lowest paid workers with a living wage; further notes that the action is hitting council services across Scotland, disrupting schools, nurseries and community education, social care services, cleansing and environmental health, housing, planning, roads and transport – including closing ferry services in Argyll and the Highlands – registry services, parks, leisure and recreation, libraries and museums, halls and theatres and many other services, and believes that the Scottish Government has a duty to intervene, facilitate renewed negotiations and provide adequate funding for an improved offer to staff. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Jackie Baillie*, Elaine Murray*, David Whitton*, Cathy Jamieson*, Marlyn Glen*, Elaine Smith*, Bill Butler*, Des McNulty*, Hugh Henry*, Mary Mulligan*
