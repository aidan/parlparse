*S3M-3494 Kenneth Gibson: Not a Penny More—That the Parliament notes the cost of the Edinburgh trams project to be £545 million, of which £500 million is to be provided by the Scottish Government; considers that this sum is enough to complete the project, as previously agreed by the contractor; totally rejects any demands for additional funding, which would impact on projects elsewhere, and believes that not a single extra penny should be forthcoming.
