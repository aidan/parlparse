*S3M-1703♦ Liam McArthur: The Unforeseeable Outcome of SNH Management Agreements—That the Parliament notes that some 150 farmers in Orkney and across Scotland, who entered into management agreements with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) under which they reduced the livestock numbers on their land during the single farm payment scheme reference period, suffer a loss of income after their SNH management agreement and the associated compensation ends as their single farm payment is based on their reduced livestock numbers rather than on the numbers they would have had if they had not entered into an SNH management agreement; further notes that, in September 2007, SNH made a proposal to ministers for payments to the farmers who suffered the loss on income, a proposal which required ministerial agreement before any payment could be made; believes that the SNH proposal offered a practical way of reducing the losses which the farmers suffered and which they could not have foreseen when they entered into the SNH management agreements; expresses its grave concern that ministers have withheld their agreement to the SNH proposal so that the farmers receive no compensation for their losses, and is concerned that this is not only an attack on natural justice but that it will also make farmers wary of entering into further agreements with SNH if they risk suffering unforeseeable losses in the future.
