*S1M-289 Mr Kenny MacAskill: GM Foods—That the Parliament notes that research indicates that the current 50m exclusion zone around trial sites is inadequate, because pollen can be carried more than four km from the site and that the current scientific research does not provide conclusive proof that genetically modified foods are not harmful to health; believes that nature has no boundaries and that undertaking genetically modified trials in Scotland could contaminate conventional crops and land, irrevocably jeopardising Scotland’s reputation as a quality food producer; and recommends the implementation of environmental legislation under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Parliament with the aim of making Scotland a nation free of genetically modified crops and foods.
