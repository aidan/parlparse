*S1M-2438 Susan Deacon: Renewing Mental Health Law—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Executive’s policy statement Renewing Mental Health Law; agrees that the statement provides a sound framework for new legislation which responds to the needs, rights and aspirations of people who use mental health services, while having regard to the public interest, and looks forward to the introduction of a Mental Health Bill, thus fulfilling the Programme for Government commitment to modernise mental health legislation in the light of the Millan Committee’s review of existing law.
