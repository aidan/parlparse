*S2M-1242 Tommy Sheridan: Cost of Invasion and Occupation of Iraq-That the Parliament notes that Her Majesty's Government has spent £6.3 billion on the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq to date and that the cost of maintaining Trident nuclear weapons of mass destruction at Faslane is £1.5 billion a year and believes that these billions spent on illegal war and maintaining weapons of mass destruction would be much better invested in radically improving pensions across the United Kingdom and expanding and improving housing, education and health services for all.
