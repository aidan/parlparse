*S1M-829# Mr Lloyd Quinan: Kvaerner Energy, Clydebank-That the Parliament notes that the Kvaerner Energy employees at Clydebank face an uncertain future under the planned change of management; further notes the modest reassurances sought by the employees over their future employment, namely the maintenance by the new owners of all current Kvaerner employment conditions including the enhanced redundancy package for all employees and written guarantees from the new owners that the current Kvaerner pension plan arrangements and conditions will be honoured, that there will be no new redundancies after the takeover and the securing of a General Electric workload before the end of 2002, and that, in the event of redundancies after 2002, any redundancy payments will be on at least the same enhanced terms as Kvaerner offered during 1999-2000; and fully supports the workforce in its efforts to secure these conditions, and believes that government intervention through the already established Kvaerner Energy Working Party should be geared to secure these aims.
