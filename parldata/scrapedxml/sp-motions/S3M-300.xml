*S3M-300 Nicol Stephen: Aberdeen’s Bid for the UK Energy Technology Institute—That the Parliament recognises Aberdeen’s position as Europe’s energy capital; considers that Aberdeen would be the prime site for the United Kingdom’s Energy Technology Institute and believes that the best prospect for Scottish success is with Aberdeen as the hub; notes the support of CBI Scotland, Oil and Gas UK, the Scottish Council for Development and Industry and a significant number of major UK energy companies for locating this institute in Aberdeen, and calls on the First Minister to take immediate action to intervene to ensure that Aberdeen goes forward as the hub for the Scottish bid and on Scottish ministers to make the appropriate representations to the UK Government in order to push for this institute to be sited in Aberdeen.
