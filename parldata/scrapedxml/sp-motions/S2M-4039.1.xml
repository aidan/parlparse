*S2M-4039.1 Colin Fox: Shirley McKie—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4039) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first "issues" to end and insert "the public is still not satisfied that the truth of the matter is all available; recognises that the McKie family campaign is not satisfied that there was no conspiracy against her; also recognises that the four Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) fingerprint workers are furious that their competence and reputation has been sullied; believes that the Scottish Executive has a duty to address all these concerns, and calls for a public inquiry to get to the truth of this matter and to restore public confidence in the SCRO and the fingerprint service as soon as possible."
