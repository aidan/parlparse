 *S3M-7475 Ian McKee: BAA Domestic Charges—That the Parliament expresses concern at BAA’s proposals to increase domestic departure charges at London Heathrow from April 2011, which would see the charge rise from £13.43 to £20.25, an increase of over 50%; notes that the move would bring the charges in line with those for international passengers; considers that this is completely unjustifiable given that domestic passengers do not use the same facilities asinternational passengers, such as customs and immigration channels; believes that the charges would discriminate against Scottish travellers, including local businesses and leisure travellers, and would damage Scotland’s economy, which in its view depends on air connectivity to and from Heathrow; further believes that, in the absence of a high speed rail network connecting London to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland must rely on good value domestic air links, and calls on BAA to reconsider its proposal.
