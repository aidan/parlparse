*S3M-7371 Liam McArthur: Westray Wins EAS EnergySavers Award 2010—That the Parliament notes that the Energy Action Scotland (EAS) EnergySavers Award 2010 for the best local energy-saving initiative that tackles fuel poverty and improves domestic energy efficiency has been won by the Westray Community Housing Project, a collaborative venture involving Energy Action Westray and the Westray Development Trust; commends the project for tackling the high levels of fuel poverty in Westray that it considers are caused by hard-to-treat housing stock and the high cost of living caused by additional transport costs; considers it impressive that the combination of bulk-purchased ground source heat pumps and free loft insulation has been so successful that, in one case, heating costs went from £17 per day using storage heaters to £2.50 per day with the heat pump, and congratulates all involved in the project for what it believes is their well-deserved success in winning the award.
