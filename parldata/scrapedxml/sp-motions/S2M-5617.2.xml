 *S2M-5617.2 Tricia Marwick: Affordable Housingâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5617) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that between 1999 and 2004 fewer houses were built for social rent under the Labour/Liberal Democrat government than in 1995 under the Conservative government and that waiting lists and those presenting as homeless are at record levels; notes the failure of the Scottish government to keep the promises made to Glasgow tenants on second stage stock transfer, and considers that this Scottish government has failed to adequately address the housing crisis in Scotland."
