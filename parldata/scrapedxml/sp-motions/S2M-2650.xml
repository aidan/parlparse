 * S2M-2650# Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Protected Geographical Indicator Status for Scotch Whisky—That the Parliament believes that EU Protected Geographical Indicator (PGI) status for Scotch whisky would provide a further selling point for the end product; welcomes the fact that this would require the use of Scottish-only grain in the manufacture of Scotch whisky; believes that the industry should apply for PGI status to help ensure the long-term sustainability of Scottish cereal growing, and considers that any such application should be supported by the Scottish Executive.
