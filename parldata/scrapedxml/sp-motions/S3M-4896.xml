*S3M-4896 Helen Eadie: Patients in Scotland being Required to Pay £900 Prescription Charges for Drugs for Infertility Services—That the Parliament expresses profound concern that NHS patients are being asked if they will pay £900 for drugs to assist with their infertility treatment and that patients in Fife are being told not even to ask to go on the waiting list because by the time they reach the top of the list they will no longer be eligible under the criteria for treatment and regrets that many young couples are to be left with a childless future owing to the lack of action and disregard by the Scottish Government.
