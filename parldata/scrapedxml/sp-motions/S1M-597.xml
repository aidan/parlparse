*S1M-597 Mrs Margaret Ewing: Crooked Charities—That the Parliament recognises that the existing law does not prevent the registration of crooked charities; notes that official advice on how to prevent fraudulent collections at supermarkets, stations and pubs is ineffective; endorses the rights of owners of such premises to insist that validation is acquired from a reputable source on charity collection and hopes that fraudulent collections can be stopped, enabling owners of commercial premises to allow legitimate charitable collections to continue.
