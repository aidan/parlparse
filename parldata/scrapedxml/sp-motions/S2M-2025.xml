 *S2M-2025# Alex Johnstone: Food Supply Code of Practice—That the Parliament calls for a strengthened Supermarket Code of Practice, legally enforced, to ensure fair trade in the food supply chain; recognises that the current Supermarket Code of Practice is ineffective, not enforced and does not cover all parts of the supply chain; notes the Office of Fair Trading’s report that fear amongst suppliers of being de-listed by the major supermarkets has prevented anyone complaining under the current code, and recommends that a strengthened code is proactively enforced to ensure fair play for all those in the food supply chain and to safeguard against reprisals.
