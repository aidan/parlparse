 *S2M-4019 Robin Harper: Ingrid Betancourt and Other International Hostages—That the Parliament notes with dismay the fourth anniversary of the abduction of Colombian Green Party leader, Ingrid Betancourt, and her colleague, Clara Rojas, by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the failure of the Government of Colombia to negotiate a humanitarian prisoner exchange; calls on the UK Government to join with the governments of France, Spain and Switzerland in brokering such an exchange; further notes the deteriorating human rights situation in Iraq where kidnap and extortion are now commonplace, as in Colombia, and where UK citizen and peace worker, Norman Kember, is still being held hostage; condemns the abduction of a UK citizen in the oil fields of Nigeria along with workers from Egypt, the Philippines, Thailand and the United States, and further calls on the UK Government to set an example to the international community by condemning the extrajudicial imprisonment of any person, whether by agents of the state or those who oppose them.
