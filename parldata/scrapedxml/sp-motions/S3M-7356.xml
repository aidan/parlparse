 *S3M-7356♦ Shirley-Anne Somerville: Moratorium on Large-scale Biomass Plants—That the Parliament recognises the concerns of local communities in Leith, Dundee, Grangemouth and Rosyth at being faced with planning applications for large-scale biomass plants; notes that these concerns relate to emissions, air quality, odour, noise, traffic and visual impact; believes that such plants will also cause problems for wood markets and related industries; is concerned that the sustainability and environmental benefits of biomass power stations are very much in doubt because of fuel-sourcing issues and emerging research suggesting that they may not help Scotland meet its CO2 reduction targets in the short term; notes also that biomass plants could expect significant subsidies under the Renewables Obligation Scheme, and considers that, until such time as the environmental impact of large-scale biomass power stations has been independently assessed, a moratorium on building such plants would be appropriate.
