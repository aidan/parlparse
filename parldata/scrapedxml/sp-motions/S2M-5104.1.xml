*S2M-5104.1 Bill Aitken: Housing Stock Transfer—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from first "calls on" to end and insert "supports the transfer of local government housing to communities run by locally accountable housing associations, co-operatives and companies and notes the recent Audit Scotland report which concluded that the handover of more than 100,000 council homes to new landlords since 1998 has brought more investment in properties and promoted tenant control as well as facilitating increased repairs and maintenance and the building of new homes and keeping rent increases down; therefore urges all tenants to seriously consider voting for the stock transfer of their homes, but notes, however, that the Scottish Executive now needs to address urgently the issues preventing the second stage transfer in Glasgow and to publish what it and the City of Edinburgh Council now plan to do for the future of Edinburgh’s housing stock, with a view to assisting in future investment for vital affordable housing."
