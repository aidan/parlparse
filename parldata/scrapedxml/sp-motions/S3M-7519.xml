*S3M-7519 Jeremy Purvis: The Scottish Economy—That the Parliament believes that creating jobs and strengthening the economy is central to Scotland’s future prosperity; further believes that for Scotland to meet a goal of being one of the most innovative and entrepreneurial economies in the world it needs to reform the enterprise bodies; considers that a network of regional development banks, bringing together business support, lending and grant making, skills and training support and destination management, would be an effective way to support jobs and economic growth across Scotland; further considers that Scotland should have a single body to offer equity finance support for businesses and a single promotional, marketing and inward investment body, and believes that this would create a framework for success in the long term to help more businesses grow and to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurialism over the next decade.
