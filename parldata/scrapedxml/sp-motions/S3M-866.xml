*S3M-866 John Scott: Water and Sewerage Charge Exemption for Charitable and Voluntary Organisations—That the Parliament applauds the valuable work done in Ayrshire and communities across Scotland by charitable and voluntary sector organisations; recognises that many of these organisations work on very limited budgets; notes that the existing exemption from water and sewerage charges granted to smaller voluntary organisations is to end in 2010 and believes that the ending of this exemption may place a very considerable additional financial pressure on voluntary organisations and churches in Scotland, and therefore calls for the Scottish Government to consider introducing a mandatory 80% relief from water and sewerage charges for all Scottish charities below a £60,000 income threshold in relation to their premises, as recommended by the Scottish Charity Law Review Commission.
