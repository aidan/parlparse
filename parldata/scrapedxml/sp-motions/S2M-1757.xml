*S2M-1757# Mr Jamie McGrigor: Moray’s RAF Bases at Kinloss and Lossiemouth—That the Parliament notes a report by Highlands and Islands Enterprise which revealed that 5,000 jobs in Moray are supported directly and 750 indirectly by the RAF bases at Kinloss and Lossiemouth; further notes that £72 million of income is generated directly and £21 million indirectly by the bases; is deeply concerned at the announcement of 390 job losses at RAF Lossiemouth, at the uncertainty over further job losses at RAF Lossiemouth and over possible losses at RAF Kinloss; believes that Moray’s bases play a vital part in the economic and social life of Moray, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make immediate representations to the Ministry of Defence to ensure the future of both bases and to avoid the devastating impact that the loss of these RAF bases would have on Moray’s economy.
