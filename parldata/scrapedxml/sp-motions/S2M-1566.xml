*S2M-1566 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Care Home Funding in Scotland-That the Parliament notes that the difference between what local authorities pay to private care homes and what the actual cost per person, per week amounts to is an average of £71 per person, per week across Scotland; further notes that the cost to the taxpayer of care in council residential homes is some £200 per person, per week, more than is received by the private care homes from the same local authorities; acknowledges that private care homes cannot be expected to provide care at less than the actual cost and are therefore forced to charge top-up fees; further acknowledges that independent care homes cannot bring forward improvements with such inequitable funding; recognises that private homes care for some 26,000 elderly people in long-term care in Scotland and employ a work force of 50,000, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review funding for all care homes in Scotland and ensure that there is a fairer solution.
