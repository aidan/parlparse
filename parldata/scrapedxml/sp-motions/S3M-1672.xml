*S3M-1672 John Scott: Church of Scotland Housing and Loan Fund—That the Parliament notes that Church of Scotland ministers, upon their retirement, having been required during the course of their working lives to reside in tied accommodation, are often obliged to seek a loan from the Church of Scotland Housing and Loan Fund in order to secure a home for their retirement; further notes that The Employer-Financed Retirement Benefits (Excluded Benefits for Tax Purposes) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/3537), exempts accommodation provided to retired ministers of religion from the terms of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 but that no corresponding exemption is made in respect of beneficial loans; recognises that as a result many retired ministers and their families applying to the Housing and Loan Fund in order to help secure accommodation upon leaving their tied home are penalised as a result of this lack of exemption, and calls on the UK Government to exempt beneficial loans from the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.
