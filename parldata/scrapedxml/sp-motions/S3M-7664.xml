*S3M-7664 Christina McKelvie: Montenegroâ€”That the Parliament distances itself from comments made by Iain Gray MSP in the chamber on 23 December 2010 that Montenegro regained its independence in "40 days, two world wars, the Balkan conflict, ethnic cleansing, a war crimes tribunal and a United Nations peace-keeping mission"; apologises to the Montenegrin people for this being said in the Parliament, and calls on the Member concerned to make a personal statement, with the permission of the Presiding Officer in line with Rule 13.1, correcting his previous assertion and apologising to Montenegro.
