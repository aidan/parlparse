*S2M-3542 Campbell Martin: Teaching of Scottish History—That the Parliament notes with concern media reports that the Minister for Education and Young People, Peter Peacock, favours teaching history as part of other subjects, such as modern studies; considers that this would be a retrograde step and that, instead, the Scottish Executive should ensure that the teaching of the history of Scotland should be a specific core element of the general education of every pupil in Scottish schools; further considers that Scottish history is the retelling of the stories that shaped our nation; agrees with the view of Nigerian writer, Ben Okri, that “to poison a nation, poison its stories”, and considers that diluting the teaching of Scottish history or incorporating it into another subject would be to poison Scotland’s stories.
