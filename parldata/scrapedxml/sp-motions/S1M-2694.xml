*S1M-2694# Tricia Marwick: Fife Council and Third Age Group—That the Parliament notes that it is a matter of public record that Fife Council paid a total of £40,178 from 1998 to 1999 to the Third Age Centre in Glenrothes at a time when it was no longer a properly constituted organisation; further notes that the first employee of the Third Age Group was a serving Fife Labour councillor, the second employee was a Labour activist and that the Council's link worker with the Group was the election agent to the MP, Henry McLeish; is concerned that all the papers relating to the grant applications were shredded by the Council; considers that the report of 4 December 2001 by Douglas Sinclair, the Council's Chief Executive, which contained the following extracts— "The Third Age Centre was a properly constituted voluntary organisation...and merited financial support from the Council"; "it would appear that all normal procedures were followed when processing the Group's applications for grant"; "it was necessary to destroy the files as insufficient storage space was available"; "that the Council's actions with regard to the Third Age Group are beyond reproach" ; and "No further action requires to be taken." calls into question the ability of the Council to investigate this matter further in a manner which will satisfy the people of Fife, and therefore considers that Audit Scotland should carry out an investigation as a matter of urgency which should consider the Council's conduct in relation to the Third Age Centre during the period 1995 to 2000 when grant assistance was being paid and conduct a thorough review of the practices currently employed by the Council.
