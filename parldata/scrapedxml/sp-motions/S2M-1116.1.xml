 *S2M-1116.1 Jim Mather: The Effect of Strip Stamps on the Whisky Industry-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1116) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "agrees with the Scotch Whisky Association that the Chancellor of the Exchequer's decision in the 2004 UK Budget to impose tax stamps on whisky and other spirits will damage the industry's competitiveness at home and abroad but do little to tackle spirits fraud; deplores the damage that successive Westminster governments have done to this vital Scottish industry, and therefore agrees that, to reverse the tax stamp decision and ensure that the competitive position of Scotch whisky is not further eroded, the Scottish Parliament should be responsible for the setting of all national taxation within Scotland."
