*S1M-3168# Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow Airport-That the Parliament supports the development of Glasgow Airport as the main centre of scheduled aviation services, by means of as many direct, non-stop flights as possible, between the west of Scotland and the rest of the world; applauds Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority's decision to commit Â£500,000 to finalising preparation for the construction of a heavy rail link between Glasgow Central Station and the airport; recognises that this new rail link should be routed via Paisley Gilmour Street and Paisley St James; believes that the Scottish Executive should commit itself politically and financially to this new rail link immediately; further recognises that any measures to enhance the capacity of Edinburgh Airport could pose a threat to the future of Glasgow Airport and, consequently, to the west of Scotland's economy; invites the Office of Fair Trading to consider whether the interests of the travelling public are best served by the retention in ownership of both Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports by Scottish Airports Ltd, a subsidiary of British Airports Authority, and further invites the First Minister, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Office of Fair Trading and all Glasgow MSPs and MPs to take note of the terms of this motion.
