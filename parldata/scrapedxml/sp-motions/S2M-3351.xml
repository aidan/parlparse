*S2M-3351 Fiona Hyslop: Lothian and Borders Fire Services—That the Parliament expresses concern at the Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Services Service Improvement Plan 2005-10 which proposes cuts in night-time and weekend cover for the Livingston area, served by the Craigshill fire station, from two full-time tenders to one full-time tender and one tender served by retained firemen; notes that this will lead to slower response times with implications for safety and rescue opportunities and service generally across the whole of West Lothian; further notes that this service improvement plan is the first of the plans required under the recent Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 for each and every fire and rescue board in Scotland and expresses its fears that, should reduced fire cover at night and dependency on a retained service be approved by the Labour-dominated Lothian and Borders board, other boards across the country may take this as the green light to initiate similar cuts when they come to produce their service improvement plans, and commends local community campaigners in Livingston for highlighting the issue and its implications for the safety of their own and other communities.
