*S2M-1977 Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Airport Rail Link—That the Parliament supports a comprehensive rail link to Edinburgh Airport; recognises that the consultation period has started and welcomes the opportunity for people to input their views; believes that value for money and impact of construction concerns must be taken into account; nonetheless believes that direct rail links to Edinburgh Airport from Fife, Glasgow and other parts of Scotland have the potential to benefit the local, regional and national economy, increase the number of people travelling by public transport to the airport, reduce congestion, improve integrated transport in west Edinburgh and tackle pollution; therefore condemns the Scottish Green Party’s opposition to the airport rail link; believes that its policy of renationalising the railways is not a current remedy for tackling congestion or air pollution, and further believes that it is the delivery of new and improved public transport links that will improve Scotland’s environment.
