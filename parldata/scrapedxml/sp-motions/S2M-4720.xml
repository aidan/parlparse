*S2M-4720 Eleanor Scott: Congratulations to the Burra Rowersâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the rowing team from Burra, Shetland, for their tremendous effort in rowing an epic 84-mile voyage from Sumburgh in Shetland to Kirkwall in Orkney to raise money for the provision of a CAT scanner for Shetland; recognises this as an impressive feat of endurance and stamina, and notes that a CAT scanner for Shetland would reduce waiting times and minimise the number of transfers to Aberdeen for scans, reduce trauma for patients, cause less disruption to families and aid faster diagnoses.
