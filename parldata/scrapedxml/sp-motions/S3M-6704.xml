*S3M-6704 Gavin Brown: Drop-Off Rip-Off at Edinburgh Airport—That the Parliament regrets the decision by BAA to introduce a £1 drop-off charge at Edinburgh Airport; considers that BAA failed to consult widely with passengers ahead of its decision; further considers that for a lot of people, including older residents and those with young families, taking public transport to the airport is not a viable option, and urges Edinburgh Airport to abandon the introduction of this ill-thought out charge.
