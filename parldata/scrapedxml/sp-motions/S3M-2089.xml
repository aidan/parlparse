*S3M-2089 Margaret Smith: Scottish Crime Survey—That the Parliament notes the moves by the Home Office to extend the British Crime Survey to include under 16-year-olds; further notes that young people across the United Kingdom are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators; recognises that young people are less likely to share details of minor incidents with their parents or the police; acknowledges the spate of serious and violent attacks in recent months across the UK; believes that extending the British Crime Survey will offer a greater understanding of how crime affects young people in England and Wales, allowing the gathering of more information which will better shape messages on encouraging young people not to carry knifes or engage in antisocial behaviour, and calls on the Scottish Government to extend the Scottish Crime Survey to cover under 16s.
