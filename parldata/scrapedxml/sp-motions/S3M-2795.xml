 *S3M-2795 Marlyn Glen: Support the PCS Pay Strike on 10 November 2008—That the Parliament expresses its solidarity with the members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) in Scottish and UK government departments in their national industrial action over a 2% pay cap; notes that, amid spiralling food, fuel and transport prices, financial insecurity and Retail Price Index and Consumer Price Index inflation rates at 5% and 5.2% respectively, low-paid public sector workers should not be condemned to below-inflation effective pay cuts; commends Scotland’s civil servants for the sterling work that they do in providing vital services to the public, and urges Scottish and UK ministers to review pay policies that are penalising their own workforces at this time of unprecedented significant developments in the economic climate.
