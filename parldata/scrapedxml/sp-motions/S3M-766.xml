*S3M-766 John Wilson: Benefits Attack on Lone Parents—That the Parliament expresses its concern about a recent UK Government welfare proposal that, while endeavouring to get more lone parents into work, would, according to the Trades Union Congress, "push more families into poverty" by encouraging lone parents to undertake unpaid work experience in order to maintain benefits; notes that by moving lone parents from income support to job seekers allowance, lone parents who are unable to find adequate and affordable childcare and who therefore turn down a job could lose their benefits, and recognises that parents’ first considerations should be to their children and that if the UK Government is committed to raising employment rates for lone parents it should instead focus on what lone parents require from the government, namely more affordable childcare and flexible work.
