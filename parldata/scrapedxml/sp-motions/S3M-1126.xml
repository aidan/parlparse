 *S3M-1126 Bill Wilson: Deprivation and Health—That the Parliament recognises that the relationship between deprivation and poor health is acknowledged by many bodies, including ASH Scotland, Have a Heart Paisley, NHS Scotland, the British Heart Foundation and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; deplores the level of poverty in the United Kingdom despite its high GDP as noted, for example, by motions S3M-60, S3M-724, S3M-995, S3M-1005 and S3M-1094; is of the opinion that unless significant progress is made in reducing wealth inequalities then strategies to reduce health inequalities will have limited impact; believes, therefore, that a failure to significantly reduce wealth inequalities can only have three possible explanations: incompetence, ignorance of the relationship between deprivation and health, or the deliberate condemnation of many thousands of people to premature death, and, in light of the foregoing, urges the UK Government urgently to reassess its priorities and specifically to reconsider the use to which it puts oil revenues, its planned expenditure on nuclear weaponry and identity cards and its policy on tax loopholes for the super-rich.
