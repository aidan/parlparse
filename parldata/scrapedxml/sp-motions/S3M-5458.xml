*S3M-5458 Elaine Smith: Lifting the Spirit of Those in Need—That the Parliament commends the work of Spirit Aid, founded by David Hayman and friends in 2001; notes that the humanitarian relief organisation is dedicated to alleviating the suffering of children and young people whose lives have been devastated by war, poverty, genocide, ethnic cleansing and all forms of abuse; recognises that this is a voluntary organisation that relies solely on the goodwill and donations of its supporters, committing 100% of all donations to humanitarian aid; further recognises that Spirit Aid has successfully undertaken projects in places such as Kosovo, Guinea Bissau, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Scotland, and supports Spirit Aid’s aim to attempt to hand back a better, healthier, safer and more just world to the children of the Earth.
