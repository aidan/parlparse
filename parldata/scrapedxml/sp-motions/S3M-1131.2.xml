*S3M-1131.2 Rhona Brankin: OECD Report into Scottish Education: the Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1131) in the name of Maureen Watt, insert at end "recognises the challenge in closing the gap in achievement associated with poverty and deprivation and the need for improved vocational education and high quality training; calls on the Scottish Government to take leadership and place an emphasis on literacy and numeracy, devolve power further to head teachers, develop leadership in schools and further develop vocational studies linked to high quality training, and regrets that this government has failed to address these priorities and has failed to deliver on key pledges made in the SNP manifesto."
