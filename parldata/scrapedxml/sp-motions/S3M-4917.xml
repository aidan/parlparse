*S3M-4917 Bill Kidd: Gordon Brown’s Gesture to Cut Trident Fleet—That the Parliament, while welcoming any and all cuts in the levels of nuclear weapons, believes that Gordon Brown’s unilateral gesture to cut the United Kingdom’s fleet of Trident missile-carrying submarines is entirely to do with cost-cutting and not with a solid commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament; notes that, according to Professor Ron Smith, a defence economist at Birkbeck College, the scaling down of the number of Trident nuclear submarines from four to three is unlikely to have much effect on the UK’s nuclear capability; believes that this move to reduce the so-called deterrent amounts to a bare minimum, especially when compared with the fresh impetus that President Obama has recently given to the international disarmament movement, and calls on the UK Government to take real and practicable steps towards full disarmament.
