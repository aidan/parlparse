*S3M-6558 Mr Frank McAveety: Start of the World Cup 2010â€”That the Parliament welcomes the start of the World Cup with South Africa playing Mexico; wishes South Africa well in hosting the most popular sporting event in the world; wishes all teams well in the tournament; looks forward to a fantastic exhibition of the best of international football; wishes any Scots travelling to South Africa a safe journey, and looks forward to cheering on Scotland in Brazil in four years time in another South American adventure similar to 1978 but with hopefully a better outcome.
