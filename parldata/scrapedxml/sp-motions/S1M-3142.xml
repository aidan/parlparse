*S1M-3142 Michael Russell: Conservative Support for Creationist Schools—That the Parliament notes with astonishment the remarks made by Mr Murdo Fraser MSP, the Deputy Education Spokesperson for the Tory Party in Scotland, on BBC Scotland Television on 17 May 2002, in which he expressed support for groups promoting "creationist" views on science running state schools in Scotland; notes that members of such groups totally reject evolution and have nothing to do with the great religious faiths in Scotland and the wider world; further notes that creationists have taken control of a state-funded secondary school in Gateshead, where they are undermining the teaching of science; rejects the foolish position of the Tory Party in Scotland, which seems now to be not only against devolution but also evolution, and asserts that misguided creationist groups should not be placed in charge of children’s education in Scotland.
