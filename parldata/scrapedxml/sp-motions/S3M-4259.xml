*S3M-4259 Pauline McNeill: 4,000 Mile Cycle Journey from Glasgow to Gaza—That the Parliament commends the four Glasgow-based students who set off on their incredible 4,000 mile journey from Glasgow’s George Square to Gaza on 27 May 2009 in order to raise funds for Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP); notes that the journey will take 40 days, passing through at least 14 countries; further notes that the cyclists’ Pathways to Palestine (P2P) idea stemmed from the continuing blockade of Gaza; congratulates the P2P team members on their innovative use of phlogging, which will allow their sponsors and supporters to follow their progress via their website and by email, and commends MAP’s continued work, which, following the recent conflict, is concentrated on providing support to young mothers and victims with burn injuries. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Bill Butler*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Kidd*
