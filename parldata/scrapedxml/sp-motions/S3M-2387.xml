 *S3M-2387 John Scott: Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive—That the Parliament notes that herbal remedies and food supplements are widely used by many people in the United Kingdom; further notes that since the adoption of the traditional herbal medicinal products directive (THMPD) by the European Parliament only 14 products have so far been approved for use; expresses grave concern that the THMPD will lead to thousands of safe and popular herbal remedies and food supplements becoming unavailable, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to urge the European Union to review this legislation to remove the threat it poses to the herbal remedies sector.
