 *S3M-16 Robert Brown: The Best Start in Life—That the Parliament believes that investment in the early years of children’s lives is the most vital investment to ensure their future success; notes the success of free nursery places for three and four-year-olds in Scotland; further believes that the existing entitlement should now be extended to 15 hours a week to allow additional time for children to socialise and eat healthy meals together and that provision should cover 38 weeks of the year to match the school year, and calls on the Scottish Executive to create an equivalent entitlement for all two-year-olds to have a free place in a local playgroup, with more investment in the playgroup sector to give all children in Scotland the best possible start in life. Supported by: Tavish Scott*, Jim Hume*, Jim Tolson*, Alison McInnes*, Liam McArthur*, Jeremy Purvis*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Iain Smith*, Margaret Smith*, Mike Rumbles*, Mike Pringle*, John Farquhar Munro*, Ross Finnie*, Nicol Stephen*, Hugh O’Donnell*
