*S3M-260 Sandra White: Pingat Jasa Medal—That the Parliament extends its fullest support to the veterans and families of veterans involved in the continuing struggle to gain the right to wear the Pingat Jasa Medal, the Malaysian service medal, awarded to Commonwealth forces who served Malaysia in its fight to preserve its newly won independence against terror and aggression between 1957 and 1966 for distinguished chivalry, gallantry, sacrifice or loyalty in upholding Peninsula of Malaya or Malaysian sovereignty during the period of emergency and confrontation; believes that the refusal to grant permission to wear the medal is an insult to all the British servicemen and women who defended Malaysia in its hour of need and to the Malaysian government which issued the medal; notes that Australian and New Zealand veterans have received royal assent to accept and wear the medal, and calls on the British Honours and Decorations Committee to overturn its decision. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Rob Gibson*, Angela Constance*
