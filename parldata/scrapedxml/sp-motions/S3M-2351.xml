 *S3M-2351 Liam McArthur: Threat to Scotland’s Farmers from Changes to Livestock Transport Regulations—That the Parliament notes that the European Commission is consulting on further changes to the regulations governing livestock transport; further notes the concerns expressed by the NFU Scotland that, if the regulations are changed so that journey times and livestock densities are cut, many journeys within the United Kingdom would be impossible, in particular, the movement of cattle and sheep from the Scottish highlands and islands and the transportation of pigs to England; shares these concerns believing that such changes would threaten the viability of livestock farming in Scotland where farmers are already struggling with increased fuel and other costs; believes that no good animal welfare reasons have been provided that would justify amendments to the regulations less than two years since they were last revised, and calls on the Scottish Government to make the strongest possible representations to the European Commission arguing that the livestock transport regulations should not once again be altered and making the commission fully aware of the dangerous implications for Scottish livestock farming if farmers are burdened with still more increased costs.
