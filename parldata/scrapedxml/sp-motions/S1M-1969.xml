*S1M-1969# Irene McGugan: Colour of Scotland's National Flag—That the Parliament notes ongoing concern that the blue background of the St Andrew’s Cross or Saltire, probably the oldest national flag in the world, varies in shade ranging from light blue through dark blue to navy; disputes the argument that the Executive cannot take a view on this matter on the grounds that heraldic responsibility lies with Westminster, since the Lord Lyon King of Arms has been in charge for many centuries of all aspects of heraldry in Scotland; believes that the relevance of heraldry to national flags is questionable not least because there is no heraldic definition of colours, which is why many countries define the colours of their national flag in law; and believes that the Executive should acknowledge that it is entirely appropriate for any modern Parliament to take a view on the proper colour of its national flag and that a legal definition of the Saltire’s colours would be welcomed.
