*S3M-2464 Alasdair Allan: Zoom Airline Collapses—That the Parliament commiserates with the plight of all those who have suffered as a result of the collapse of Zoom Airlines, an example of whom would be Flying Fiddles, a group of outstanding young musicians from the Western Isles which has lost out on around £7,000 worth of flights for its forthcoming tour of Canada, money which was largely raised from within its own community, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to protect travellers from airlines which seem more than willing to take bookings from passengers in the apparently full knowledge that their companies are in profound financial difficulties. Supported by: Bob Doris*, Bill Kidd*, Bashir Ahmad*, Rob Gibson*, Stuart McMillan*
