*S3M-1788 Christine Grahame: The Essentials for the Scottish Economy—That the Parliament, in light of the threat to Scotland’s fuel supplies because of the dispute at the Grangemouth refinery which has the potential to have a devastating impact on the Scottish economy and day-to-day lives of ordinary people and the monopolistic private ownership of other key national resources, such as the distribution of gas and electricity, considers that, at the very least, legislation should be put in place, after widespread consultation, with an option of public ownership of these assets, in order to secure continuity of supply in the interests of the people and economy of Scotland.
