 * S2M-2964 Shiona Baird: Inside Deep Throat—That the Parliament deplores the decision by the City of Edinburgh Council to allow the screening at the Cameo Cinema of Inside Deep Throat, a documentary about the notorious 1972 pornographic film in which the late Linda Marchiano later claimed she was forced to perform against her will; considers that the documentary of a film, which is widely held to have no cultural or artistic merit, is no more than an attempt to legitimise pornography and condone the abuse and degradation of women, and believes that, in failing to address the issue of Ms Marchiano’s lack of consent, this documentary serves to undermine the role of women in society and runs contrary to the Parliament’s and Scottish local authorities’ clearly stated commitment to equality for women and the elimination of all forms of abuse against women.
