 *S3M-3472 Christine Grahame: Volunteer Development Scotland, 25th Anniversary—That the Parliament congratulates Volunteer Development Scotland, Scotland’s Centre for Excellence in volunteer development, as it celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2009; notes that since 1984 Volunteer Development Scotland has played a key leadership role in creating a distinctly Scottish approach to volunteer development by responding to the needs of the people of Scotland; acknowledges that in partnership with many organisations, in particular Scotland’s volunteer centres, it has established internationally recognised ways of working that continuously enhance the quality of the volunteering experience, and looks forward to Volunteer Development Scotland continuing to work throughout its silver jubilee year and beyond to ensure that the importance of volunteering is recognised throughout Scotland.
