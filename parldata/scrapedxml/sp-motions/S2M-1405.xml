*S2M-1405 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Norway's Ban on Smoking in Public Places-That the Parliament congratulates Norway on its decision to ban smoking in all public places; notes that the proposal comes after heavy pressure from restaurant workers' unions who say that their members have a higher incidence of lung cancer than others due to passive smoking and that the Norwegian Health Ministry states that between 300 and 500 people die of passive smoking in Norway each year; notes that, even before the ban came into force, the smoking rates had dropped from 29% to 26%, suggesting that many smokers are looking for a reason to give up smoking and that a ban such as this assists them in doing so, and recommends that members follow the example set by Norway by supporting such measures as the Prohibition of Smoking in Regulated Areas (Scotland) Bill to protect the health of both workers and patrons of eating establishments.
