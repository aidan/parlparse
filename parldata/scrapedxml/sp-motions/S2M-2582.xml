*S2M-2582 Bill Butler: Executive Funding of Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (Scotland)—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Scottish Executive to provide funding for the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (Scotland) (MOJO) so that it may offer advice, assistance and support to the victims of miscarriages of justice; applauds the efforts of MOJO and its volunteer base in highlighting this gap in provision and lobbying for it to be bridged; recognises that the emotional impact on the innocent victims of miscarriages of justice can be devastating and that intensive support is necessary to help them return to society; views MOJO as a positive and imaginative initiative, and asks the Executive to continue looking at ways in which the very specific needs of those who have been wrongly imprisoned can be met in the future. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Carolyn Leckie*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Pauline McNeill*, Margaret Jamieson*
