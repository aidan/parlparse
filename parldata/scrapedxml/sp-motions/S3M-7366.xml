*S3M-7366 Nanette Milne: Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland (LTCAS), which will exhibit in the Garden Lobby between Tuesday 16 and Thursday 18 November 2010; notes that, with around 40% of Scotland’s population living with at least one long-term condition and the number steadily rising, LTCAS is calling for a cost-effective, joined-up and fair response to meet this growing challenge; considers that empowering individuals to take ownership of their conditions through supporting self-management will not only improve quality of life for individuals but is also essential to making best use of public funds, and welcomes LTCAS’ recently launched My Conditions, My Terms, My Life campaign.
