 *S3M-6749 Stuart McMillan: Paisley Community Champions—That the Parliament recognises the new partnership formed by Renfrewshire Council for Voluntary Services (RCVS) and Paisley.org.uk to promote the good work being done by Renfrewshire’s charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises; congratulates Councillor Kenny MacLaren for establishing Community Champions as a way to promote those local charities and voluntary groups that work hard for people in Renfrewshire but don’t often get the recognition it is believed that they deserve; notes that the website www.paisley.org.uk/community aims to be a hub for information relating to such organisations, and wishes the partnership well in its future endeavours to highlight the work of important organisations in the area.
