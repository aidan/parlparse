*S3M-7998 Brian Adam: Positive Outlook for Oil and Gas Industry—That the Parliament welcomes the latest activity survey from Oil and Gas UK, which shows that last year the industry supported around 440,000 jobs, paid more than £9.3 billion in production taxes and provided around 60% of the United Kingdom’s energy needs; welcomes the reported 60% increase in capital investment in UK exploration and production over the last two years, which has slowed the rate of decline from the UK continental shelf (UKCS), and the potential for an additional 10,000 to 15,000 jobs to be created if investment continues; understands that most of the growth in reserves has been from west of Shetland fields, and calls on the UK Government to improve incentives for further developments in the UKCS to secure future jobs, prosperity and energy security. Supported by: Stewart Stevenson*, Stuart McMillan*, Nanette Milne*
