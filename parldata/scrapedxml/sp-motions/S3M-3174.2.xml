*S3M-3174.2 Bill Aitken: Protecting Scotland’s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "recognises that in some cases custody is the only appropriate disposal and prison should offer a greater opportunity for rehabilitation; believes that it is vital where community penalties are imposed that there is a much tighter and rigorous control of these orders, including making community penalties more robust and visible to the community and, in particular, to the victims of crime, and notes that only when these measures are in place will the public start to have more confidence in the criminal justice system."
