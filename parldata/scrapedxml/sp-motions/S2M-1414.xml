*S2M-1414 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Seducing our Children to Smoke-That the Parliament abhors any attempt by tobacco manufacturers to try to seduce people, particularly youngsters, into continuing, or starting, to smoke cigarettes; recognises that in Scotland approximately 12,000 people die each year through tobacco-related illnesses and registers its contempt for British American Tobacco's latest attempt to replace these deceased smokers by new and younger ones; agrees that any attempt to make smoking more attractive should be repelled, and urges members to support any legislation that encourages the people of Scotland to give up smoking and helps persuade non-smokers not to start.
