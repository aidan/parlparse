 *S2M-4788.3 Murdo Fraser: Access to Higher Educationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4788) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from "with concern" to end and insert "the growing levels of student debt and bankruptcies among graduates; believes that an extension to the current student loans scheme with larger non-means-tested loans available at low commercial rates of interest would reduce student reliance on unsecured bank overdrafts and credit card borrowings and provide additional funds for higher education, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce such a scheme in preference to the current unsatisfactory arrangements and unrealistic and unaffordable proposals to replace loans with grants."
