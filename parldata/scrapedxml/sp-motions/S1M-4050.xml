*S1M-4050 Mr John Swinney: The Current International Situation—That the Parliament deeply regrets the commencement of military action in Iraq; believes that the failure to settle this crisis by peaceful means will have long-term repercussions for world security and peace; recognises the overwhelming strength of feeling in Scotland that opposes such action; further recognises that Scottish servicemen and women are now involved in this action and extends its support to them and their families at this time; demands that every effort must be made to protect the civilian population of Iraq from direct military threat, from starvation and from the consequences of disease and hardship caused by the destruction of civil infrastructure such as water treatment and power plants, and calls for this conflict to be brought to a speedy conclusion. Supported by: Michael Matheson*, Bruce Crawford*, Ms Sandra White*, Christine Grahame*, Andrew Wilson*, Nicola Sturgeon*, Fiona Hyslop*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Kay Ullrich*, Irene McGugan*, Colin Campbell*, Fiona McLeod*, Tricia Marwick*, Alex Neil*, Fergus Ewing*, Mr Gil Paterson*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Linda Fabiani*, Brian Adam*, Michael Russell*, Shona Robison*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*, Richard Lochhead*, Alasdair Morgan*
