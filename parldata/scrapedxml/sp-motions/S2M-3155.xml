 *S2M-3155# Mr John Swinney: Accident Record on the A9—That the Parliament notes with concern the statistics recently published by the Scottish Executive that show that 82 fatalities occurred on the A9 in the last five years; recognises that this is the highest number of fatalities for any trunk road in Scotland; notes the local concern at the delays that have occurred in undertaking promised junction improvements at Ballinluig and Bankfoot in Perthshire, and recognises that, even when these improvements are made, the road will remain fundamentally unsafe until it is reconstructed as a dual carriageway from Perth to Inverness. Supported by: Jim Mather*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Richard Lochhead*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Fergus Ewing*, Bruce Crawford*, Stewart Stevenson*, Alasdair Morgan*, Christine Grahame*, Linda Fabiani*, Fiona Hyslop*, Alex Neil*, Shona Robison* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
