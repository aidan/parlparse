*S2M-3497.1 Jim Mather: The Decline of Scottish Manufacturingâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-3497) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "having previously" to end and insert "considers that this was partly the result of the failure of earlier policies which attracted many foreign direct inward investors who did very little research and development in Scotland and which on their own were neither sufficient nor a substitute for real economic power and the full ability to compete, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise this fact and the evidence that makes the status quo untenable and damaging to Scotland."
