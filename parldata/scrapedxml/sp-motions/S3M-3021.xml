 *S3M-3021 Jamie Hepburn: One Third of People in Scotland Defined as Breadline Poor—That the Parliament notes with concern findings by a BBC investigation that almost a third of people in Scotland can be classified as "breadline poor", defined as a poverty line so low that people are excluded from participating in the norms of society; believes that the existence of such poverty, at any level, in modern Scotland, is a scandal; further notes that the powers over welfare and taxation, which could tackle the root causes of poverty, remain reserved to Westminster, and that the interim report of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution has ruled out devolving such fiscal powers to the Scottish Parliament, and further believes that only independence will therefore equip the Scottish Government with the powers it needs to finally end extreme poverty and deprivation in Scotland.
