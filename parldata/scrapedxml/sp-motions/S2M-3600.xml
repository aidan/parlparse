*S2M-3600 Dr Jean Turner: Outsourcing of NHS Laboratory Services—That the Parliament condemns any proposals that laboratory services provided in the NHS should be outsourced to private laboratories, either in the United Kingdom or abroad; recognises that laboratory services are an essential clinical component in the management of patients and are not "figure factories"; notes that close consultation between laboratory consultants and the referring clinician is essential to maintain a safe clinical environment for patients, and believes that it is essential that laboratories continue to provide training and expertise at both medical and scientific levels and that acquired skills are not lost.
