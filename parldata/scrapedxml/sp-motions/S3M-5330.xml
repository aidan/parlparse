S3M-5330 Bill Wilson: Mohammad Othman and Israel’s Use of Administrative Detention as a Substitute for Prosecution—That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-05062, notes reports that Israel not only continues to hold Mohammad Othman in administrative detention but has also threatened and pressured him into confessions and that no external evidence was brought to the military court that renewed his detention; understands that international human rights organisations and the United Nations have repeatedly condemned Israel’s recourse to military justice systems that do not meet international standards of due process, and condemns Israel for this and other breaches of human rights, believing that such actions do nothing to make the people of Israel safer in the long term but rather serve to perpetuate that country’s troubles. Supported by: Bill Kidd, Shirley-Anne Somerville, Gil Paterson, Malcolm Chisholm, Jackie Baillie, Elaine Smith, Jim Hume, Dave Thompson, Sandra White*
