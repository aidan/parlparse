*S2M-3141 Shiona Baird: Office of Fair Trading Failure on Supermarket Codeâ€”That the Parliament expresses its concern and dismay at the conclusion of the Office of Fair Trading investigation into supermarket trading practices that no further regulation is needed; recognises the significant implications that these conclusions have for the many independent businesses and farms already struggling to compete against the stranglehold of the four main supermarket chains; calls on the Scottish Executive to use its influence to ensure that the Supermarket Code of Practice provides effective protection for those in Scotland and abroad who produce our food, and urges the Executive to take action, as other countries have done, in maintaining diversity and real choice in the high streets by supporting a fair and transparent planning system able to encompass wider considerations of the fair trade benefits for the whole community.
