 *S3M-7963 Johann Lamont: Supporting Rape Survivorsâ€”That the Parliament is gravely concerned that the crime of rape continues to be underreported; believes that no woman is ever to blame for being raped, and recognises the need to change public attitudes to rape to ensure that survivors feel able to report or speak out about being raped without the fear of being blamed or disbelieved.
