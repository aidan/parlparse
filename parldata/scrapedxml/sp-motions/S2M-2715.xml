 *S2M-2715 Michael Matheson: Racism Ban’d—That the Parliament supports the efforts of the pupils of Graeme High School, Falkirk; commends them in setting up a young enterprise company, "Revolutionary", to promote awareness about racism in Scotland; welcomes the fact that most of Scotland’s senior football clubs are supporting their red "racism ban’d", with all profits going to "Show Racism the Red Card", and urges MSPs to show solidarity with the campaign by wearing their red "racism ban’d" sent by the school.
