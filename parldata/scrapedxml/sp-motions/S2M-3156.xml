 *S2M-3156 Shiona Baird: Memorial to Scottish Women’s Hospitals and the "Dames Ecossaises"—That the Parliament offers its wholehearted support to the campaign to erect a permanent monument in Edinburgh’s Royal Mile as a lasting memorial to the Scottish women who risked their lives to tend wounded soldiers during the First World War; recognises the courage, determination and achievements of these "Dames Ecossaises" who eventually established 13 hospitals across France, Belgium, Serbia, Romania, Greece and Russia; acknowledges the particular contribution made by Dr Elsie Inglis, who pioneered social medicine and founded the Scottish Women’s Hospitals movement; believes that official commemoration of the wartime role of these Scottish women is long overdue, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide funding for the erection of a permanent memorial to their remarkable achievements.

 Business Bulletin No.135/2005: Monday 26 September 2005 Contents An A B C D E F G H I J Section F – Motions and Amendments Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text. Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members’ business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#). Motions submitted for members’ business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (u). Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an "R". An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn. A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at Current Motions (http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm).  A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at: http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsAndAmendments/index.htm New and altered motions and amendments *S2M-3339# Euan Robson: South of Scotland Structural Funds—That the Parliament welcomes the investment in Roxburgh and Berwickshire, the Borders and the south of Scotland from EU structural funding, such as at Springwood Park in Kelso and at Ettrick Riverside in Selkirk; notes that the current round of such funding ends in March 2006, and believes that the south of Scotland has a clear case for continuing investment to support its economy and communities. S2M-3338 Mr Mark Ruskell: Ship-to-Ship Oil Transfer in the Firth of Forth—That the Parliament notes the application by Melbourne Marine Services to introduce ship-to-ship transfer of heavy crude oil at deep water anchorages in the Firth of Forth; acknowledges the devastating impact on the ecology and economy of the Forth estuary that would occur in the event of a heavy oil spill; further notes the suspension of heavy oil transfers in 2004 at Lyme Bay in Dorset following concerns voiced by local authorities, and calls on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to heed the concerns of Fife Council, the City of Edinburgh Council and  East Lothian Council by rejecting the application for heavy oil transfer in the Firth of Forth. *S2M-3337 Fergus Ewing: Inverness Harbour—That the Parliament congratulates the Inverness Harbour Trust on its continuing success, as shown in its recent annual report for the year to September 2004; believes that the port is vital to the economic well-being of the city of Inverness; welcomes the expansion plans which have been brought forward by the trustees, as outlined in the annual report, and hopes that the plans will be translated into reality. S2M-3336 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Financial Straits Faced by Dairy Farmers—That the Parliament recognises the dire financial straits faced by Scotland’s dairy farmers; acknowledges the financial constraints placed on them by the large companies wielding too much power and pursuing a completely blinkered short-term buying policy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene in the supply chain to compel major processors and supermarkets to adopt a long-term perspective that protects supplies and dairy farmers. S2M-3335# Mr Duncan McNeil: Jimmy Cowan, The Prince of Goalkeepers—That the Parliament notes the nomination by the Greenock Morton Supporters’ Trust of legendary goalkeeper, Jimmy Cowan, for induction into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame; welcomes the enthusiastic backing which the bid has already received from the people of Greenock and Inverclyde and The Greenock Telegraph; notes that the 25 international caps that Cowan won during his illustrious career included the 3-1 win over England at Wembley in 1949, in which his heroic performance led to its being dubbed “Cowan’s Match”, and therefore considers that the Scottish football authorities should look beyond the usual suspects of the Old Firm when they come to consider on whom should be bestowed this most prestigious of honours and elevate “The Prince of Goalkeepers” to where he belongs. S2M-3334 Margaret Jamieson: 40th Anniversary of Ataxia UK—That the Parliament congratulates Ataxia UK on its 40th anniversary on 25 September 2005 and commends Louise Hunter of Kilmarnock who has written a book entitled Hey, I’m Alive which describes her life as a sufferer of Friedreich’s Ataxia, the proceeds of which will be donated to the continuing research by Ataxia UK into neurological disorders and to the information and support it provides to sufferers and their families. S2M-3333 Robin Harper: Barnardo’s/HBOS Tug of War—That the Parliament congratulates all those MSPs and staff who took part in the inaugural Holyrood Tug O’War organised by HBOS plc and Barnardo’s Scotland which raised £2,750 for the charity; congratulates the Scottish Conservatives’ “Pullman Class” team on its victory; recognises the support of all the other competing teams and that they enjoyed themselves hugely, and thanks HBOS plc, Barnardo’s Scotland and the Scottish Tug of War Association for providing an entertaining and welcome addition to the parliamentary calendar. Supported by: Alex Johnstone* S2M-3332 Pauline McNeill: Family Law (Scotland) Bill - Order of Consideration at Stage 2—That the Justice 1 Committee agrees to consider the Family Law (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: sections 1 to 7, sections 10 to 23, sections 8 and 9, sections 24 and 25, schedule 1, sections 26 to 33, schedules 2 and 3, section 34 and the long title. S2M-3331 Nora Radcliffe: Science and the Parliament: Wednesday 2 November 2005—That the Parliament welcomes the Science and the Parliament event being held on 2 November 2005 in Our Dynamic Earth and organised by the Royal Society of Chemistry in association with Scotland’s leading science organisations; notes the contribution of Scotland’s 40,000 scientists to our economic, environmental and social development; further notes that Scotland is a world leader in many scientific disciplines; recognises the need to foster an environment that enhances pupil and student participation in science, to invest in the science infrastructure and equipment of our educational establishments, to increase investment in research along with supporting greater industrial research and assist in the practical application of our world-beating research, and welcomes the review of the Scottish Executive’s science strategy. S2M-3330 Lewis Macdonald: The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 11) (Scotland) Order 2005—That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 11) (Scotland) Order 2005 be approved. Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr S2M-3329 Tricia Marwick on behalf of the Waverley Railway Bill (Scotland) Committee: Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill - Preliminary Stage—That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill and that the Bill should proceed as a Private Bill. Supported by: Gordon Jackson S2M-3328 Ms Margaret Curran: Civil Aviation Bill - UK Legislation—That the Parliament agrees that the provisions in the Civil Aviation Bill, so far as they confer functions on the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament. Supported by: George Lyon S2M-3327 Ms Margaret Curran: Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill - UK Legislation—That the Parliament agrees that the provisions in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill relating to devolved matters and those that confer executive functions on the Scottish Ministers should be considered by the UK Parliament. Supported by: George Lyon S2M-3326# Mr Jamie Stone: Affordable Housing in the Highlands—That the Parliament is concerned that the lack of affordable housing in the Highlands undermines economic development in the area and threatens the future of many Highland communities. S2M-3325# Mr Kenny MacAskill: HMV/Waterstones Takeover of Ottakar’s Book Stores—That the Parliament voices its grave concern over, and opposition to, the proposed takeover of Ottakar’s book stores by HMV/Waterstones; notes that, if the takeover goes ahead, there will be effectively a monopoly on bookselling in many towns and cities in Scotland; regrets that, despite Edinburgh being the World City of Literature, in recent times it has witnessed the demise of independent Scottish-owned book stores such as Bauermeister and James Thin, meaning that there is now no Scottish-owned book chain in Edinburgh or indeed Scotland; recognises that the internal structure of Ottakar’s genuinely reflects the distinctive Scottish book market, with a Scottish range and marketing manager and two Scottish operating managers; contrasts this with the highly centralised structure and purchasing policy of HMV/Waterstones, which has led to a decrease in in-store diversity and availability of Scottish books through Waterstones; thus recognises that this takeover is potentially very damaging for the Scottish publishing industry, the Scottish printing industry and Scottish writers and will have the effect of limiting choice for the Scottish book-buying public and harming our national culture and identity, and considers that the Competition Commission should investigate this takeover on the grounds of market dominance in Scotland. Supported by: Mike Pringle, Jim Mather, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Mr Adam Ingram, Tricia Marwick, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Alasdair Morgan, Mr Bruce McFee, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Sandra White, Robin Harper, Brian Adam, Chris Ballance* S2M-3324 Jackie Baillie: Report of the Working Group on Debt Relief—That the Parliament welcomes the report of the Working Group on Debt Relief, established by the Scottish Executive; commends those involved, representing both creditor and debtor interests, for arriving at a series of positive recommendations to address the debt problems experienced by people with no income and no assets; notes the recommendation to provide a single gateway procedure for those without access to other forms of debt relief; considers that this will ensure that no person without income or assets will fall through the net, and therefore encourages the Executive to include the proposal in the forthcoming legislation to reform bankruptcy and diligence. Supported by: Sarah Boyack, Ms Wendy Alexander, Alex Neil, Mr Jamie Stone, Cathy Peattie, Mr Kenneth Macintosh, Marlyn Glen, Trish Godman, Paul Martin, Bill Butler, Mrs Mary Mulligan, Mike Pringle*, Karen Whitefield*, Chris Ballance* S2M-3322 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Peace Day—That the Parliament recognises and supports international world peace day on 21 September 2005; believes that the day should be marked in the Parliament in future years using Time for Reflection as a formal call for world peace, and calls on the Scottish Executive to institute an educational programme in every primary and secondary school to highlight world peace day and a national day of peace. Supported by: Campbell Martin, Mike Pringle, Tommy Sheridan, Bill Butler, Marlyn Glen, Ms Sandra White, Dr Jean Turner, Linda Fabiani, Cathy Peattie, Chris Ballance* S2M-3320# Sarah Boyack: Promoting Energy Saving Using Micro and Small-Scale Renewable Technology—That the Parliament believes that micro and small-scale renewable technology offers huge opportunities to tackle both fuel poverty and the causes of climate change; notes the Scottish Executive’s target of achieving a 20% improvement in energy efficiency on 2000 levels by 2010; believes that, to help achieve this target, building standards should be amended to include micro-renewable technology as permitted developments and should require generation capacity to be included in all new developments; particularly notes examples of good practice in Edinburgh Central such as Dunedin Canmore Housing Association’s European award-nominated Slateford Green Development; believes that local authorities should be required to consider the role that micro-generation targets could deliver in achieving sustainable energy and to set appropriate targets accordingly; notes the Energy Savings Trust’s proposal of a flat rate reduction on council tax or its replacement for houses which incorporate certified energy efficiency or micro-renewable technology, and believes that fiscal measures such as these should be actively considered. Supported by: Jackie Baillie, Shiona Baird, Cathie Craigie, Bruce Crawford, Helen Eadie, Trish Godman, Patrick Harvie, Dr Sylvia Jackson, Pauline McNeill, Nora Radcliffe, Mr Mark Ruskell, Mrs Mary Mulligan, Robin Harper, Mike Pringle, Maureen Macmillan, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Des McNulty, Marlyn Glen, Marilyn Livingstone, Margaret Jamieson, Christine May, Euan Robson, Mr Kenneth Macintosh, Cathy Peattie, Ms Wendy Alexander S2M-3319 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Renewable Energy Opportunities—That the Parliament supports the view that Scotland should initiate more fuel projects based on oil-producing crops, thus helping to increase the energy supplied from sustainable sources as required by international obligations, particularly Kyoto; further welcomes the recent announcement by the Scottish Executive that farmers who wish to grow energy crops can now apply for grants of up to £1,000 per hectare; notes that Scotland’s only bio-fuel project, Argent, is a welcome start as it only recycles existing waste vegetable oils; notes that a new market for relevant crops would be a valuable new opportunity for Scottish farmers, and recognises that there are literally thousands of acres of uncropped land lying in set-aside which, if turned into production, could help to meet Scotland’s sustainable energy targets. Supported by: John Farquhar Munro, Mike Pringle, Mike Rumbles, Jeremy Purvis, Mr Jamie Stone, Euan Robson, Nora Radcliffe, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Chris Ballance* S2M-3318 Bruce Crawford: Deprivation in Scottish Coalfield Communities—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings contained within the Coalfields Communities Campaign’s report, Deprivation in Scottish Coalfield Communities, which highlights that two-thirds of former mining communities have levels of deprivation above the Scottish average and that deprivation affects communities whose combined population is 600,000; calls on the Scottish Executive to make Her Majesty’s Government, and in particular the Chancellor of the Exchequer, aware of the report, and further calls on the Executive and Her Majesty’s Government to outline their action plan for former coalfield communities to ensure that such levels of deprivation and poverty are eradicated from communities in energy-rich Scotland. Supported by: Christine Grahame, Jim Mather, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Alex Neil, Mr Adam Ingram, Tricia Marwick, Mr Bruce McFee, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Sandra White, Alasdair Morgan, Brian Adam, Mr John Swinney, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Chris Ballance* S2M-3317 Miss Annabel Goldie on behalf of the Justice 2 Committee: Report on Inquiry into Youth Justice—That the Parliament notes the recommendations contained in the Justice 2 Committee’s 9th Report 2005 (Session 2): Report on Inquiry into Youth Justice (SP Paper 370). Supported by: Bill Butler S2M-3315 Mr Mark Ruskell: Action on Climate Change—That the Parliament notes the publication of satellite data showing that the extent of Arctic sea ice is at an all-time minimum and considers that this shortage of sea ice may be part of a positive feedback loop that will lead to further global warming; further notes the findings of a recent article, published in the journal, Science, that category 4 and 5 hurricanes have become more frequent over the past 35 years, coinciding with an increase in sea surface temperatures; considers, in the light of these findings, that global climate change is now the most serious and most urgent political issue facing us, and calls on all political parties to engage in a mature debate in an attempt to achieve consensus on ways to minimise Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions. S2M-3300 Mary Scanlon: City of Inverness Recognised in RBS £50 Banknote—That the Parliament notes the historic decision by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), one of the world’s largest banks, to issue its first £50 banknote in almost 300 years; welcomes its recognition of the growing significance of the Highland capital through its portrait of Inverness Castle on this banknote, and believes that this image is a symbolic and worthy gesture in respect of Inverness’s award of Scottish city status in 2000 and its ongoing expansion. Supported by: Derek Brownlee, Fergus Ewing, Christine Grahame, Mr Jamie McGrigor, Margaret Mitchell, Mr David Davidson, Murdo Fraser, Rob Gibson, Mrs Nanette Milne, Eleanor Scott, Dr Jean Turner, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Mr Brian Monteith* S2M-3299# Helen Eadie: Coalfields Communities in Fife—That the Parliament commends the work of the Coalfields Communities Campaign and, in particular, its publication, Deprivation in Scottish Coalfields Communities, which is based on an analysis of the Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2004; further notes that coalfields communities continue to struggle some twenty years since the pits closed, the extent of which deprivation has not always been noticed because of the concentration of deprivation in Glasgow; recognises that Fife includes the former coalfield with the largest population in Scotland and that this coalfield remains disproportionately deprived in relation to the Scottish national average with some of the most deprived data zones in Scotland being in Fife, the poorest of which areas are contained in the wards of Ballingry, Lochore, Methil, Smeaton and Overton and that, across the central Fife coalfield area, one in three people are on state benefit or unemployed or are in the lowest grade of workers; finally notes that health indicators are particularly concerning with Lochore, for example, where the rate of people unable to work due to illness of disability is 89% above the Scottish average and the rate of claimants with disability living allowance is 103% above the Scottish average, and hopes that the Scottish Executive will urgently consider establishing a taskforce to develop a matrix of targeted support from all agencies involving the public and private sector. Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Jackie Baillie, Sarah Boyack, Christine May, Tommy Sheridan, Scott Barrie, Marilyn Livingstone, Trish Godman, Pauline McNeill* S2M-3298 Campbell Martin: National Rally for Independence—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of the second National Rally for Independence, to be held on Saturday 1 October 2005, at the designated “protest” area outside the main entrance of the Parliament and immediately opposite Holyrood Palace; considers this to be a most appropriate venue for a national rally calling for the establishment of an independent Scottish republic; looks forward to a repeat of the very successful inaugural National Rally for Independence held last year at Edinburgh’s Calton Hill on the day the Queen officially opened the Scottish Parliament, and looks forward to welcoming to Edinburgh on 1 October all those who consider themselves to be “citizens not subjects” and who support the broad-based movement for the establishment of an independent Scottish republic. S2M-3297 Mr Jamie McGrigor: The Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup Final 2005—That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the 2005 Camanachd Association Challenge Cup Final and its sponsors, Glenmorangie; further congratulates Lochaber’s Kilmallie and Fort William teams for providing an excellent final with such a nail-biting end at An Aird, and Fort William for winning the cup for only the second time and for the first time since 1992; welcomes the BBC’s live coverage of the game and hopes that it will stimulate interest in the sport across Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support the new board of directors of the Camanachd Association to ensure that shinty, so much a part of Scotland’s heritage and an important focus for so many Highland communities, continues to develop with a secure long-term future. Supported by: Eleanor Scott, Mary Scanlon, John Scott, Alex Johnstone, Bruce Crawford, Phil Gallie, Murdo Fraser, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Margaret Mitchell, Mr David Davidson, Mrs Nanette Milne, Dr Jean Turner, Donald Gorrie, Bill Aitken, Mr Jamie Stone, Mr Brian Monteith* S2M-3296 Mrs Nanette Milne: Children’s Hospice Week—That the Parliament welcomes Children’s Hospice Week, which runs from 17 to 24 September 2005; notes that Children’s Hospice Week was launched in 1998 to raise public and professional awareness of children with life-threatening and life-limiting conditions and their families, and recognises the hard work of CHAS, the Scottish charity committed to the provision of children’s hospice services in Scotland. Supported by: Derek Brownlee, Brian Adam, Alex Johnstone, Murdo Fraser, Stewart Stevenson, Bill Butler, Michael McMahon, Mary Scanlon, Mr Ted Brocklebank, Christine Grahame, Des McNulty, Patrick Harvie, Mike Pringle, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Shiona Baird, Margaret Mitchell, Jackie Baillie, Tricia Marwick, Murray Tosh, Alex Fergusson, Dr Jean Turner, Donald Gorrie, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Bill Aitken, Tommy Sheridan, Mr David Davidson, Ms Sandra White, Robin Harper, Cathy Peattie, Mr Brian Monteith* S2M-3162# Mr David Davidson: Role of Firefighters in Remote and Rural Areas—That the Parliament applauds the excellent work and invaluable role carried out by those firefighters in remote and rural parts of north east Scotland on the retained duty system but acknowledges the chronic shortage of such firefighters in some Scottish towns; notes that figures published by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Fire Services in Scotland in 2003-04 show levels of retained staff in Scotland running at some 30% below the authorised establishment; considers that these staffing shortages place considerable strain on existing retained staff to support their local communities, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider innovative ways in which businesses could support recruitment into the retained sector and undertake to examine new mechanisms to encourage businesses and the self-employed to understand the benefits of releasing staff to perform the role of retained firefighters in their communities. Supported by: John Swinburne, Derek Brownlee, Murray Tosh, Mr Stewart Maxwell, John Scott, Mr John Swinney, Murdo Fraser, Nora Radcliffe, Mrs Nanette Milne, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Phil Gallie, Richard Lochhead, Mr Ted Brocklebank, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Shiona Baird, Fergus Ewing S2M-2911# John Home Robertson: Affordable Rented Housing—That the Parliament is concerned about the shortage of affordable rented housing in East Lothian and many communities and the fact that some applicants in overcrowded or unsuitable accommodation can be stuck on waiting lists for years, while others may be compelled to buy or rent housing that they cannot afford; suggests that there is a need for a clearer definition of affordability for the purposes of housing policy; welcomes initiatives by the Scottish Executive to help councils and registered social landlords to increase the supply of affordable housing, including prudential borrowing to fund new building; recognises that the high cost of development land is hindering that policy, and believes that there is a case for further measures to help local authorities to acquire and secure land for affordable housing in the Executive’s proposed Planning Bill.
