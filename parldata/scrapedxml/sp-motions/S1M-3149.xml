 *S1M-3149 Mr Jim Wallace: Alternatives to Custody—That the Parliament commends the Scottish Executive’s commitment to developing a range of high quality alternatives to custody which fit the changing pattern of offending behaviour across Scotland, and recognises the importance of ensuring the delivery of consistently effective community disposals which have the confidence of the judiciary and the public and also have the potential to reduce re-offending without compromising public safety.
