*S2M-715.1 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Fisheries 2004-As an amendment to motion (S2M-715) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from second "that" to end and insert "in contrast to last year's negotiations which saw draconian cutbacks in white fish quotas with accompanying hardship for our coastal communities and urges the Executive to support the view of the vast majority of Scottish fishermen that it is time to end the discredited Common Fisheries Policy and to regain national control of UK waters."
