*S3M-1647 Sandra White: Scottish Labour MPs Fail to Represent Constituents’ Concerns—That the Parliament condemns the actions of Scottish Labour MPs in voting against an inquiry into the war on Iraq by an independent committee, particularly Glasgow MPs John Robertson, Ann McKechin and Mohammad Sarwar who despite voting against the Iraq war in 2003, voted on 25 March 2008 against holding an independent inquiry into the UK Government’s conduct in the run up to and during the war itself; believes that these MPs’ views do not represent the views of the Scottish people and therefore could be seen to constitute a dereliction of their duties in representing the interests of their constituents, and further believes this to be another example of disingenuous representation of their views by Glasgow Labour MPs, given their public declarations against the post office closures while voting with the UK Government to close post offices and their subsequent failure to vote to stop the closures.
