*S2M-2231 Margo MacDonald: The Continuing Failure of the BBC to Hand Over Tapes to the Fraser Inquiry—That the Parliament, believing it to be in the best interests of efficient governance and the maintenance of the Scottish people’s trust in, and respect for, their elected representatives and institutions, wishes to assist Lord Fraser to formally complete his inquiry into the Holyrood Project, now overdue by a considerably longer period than originally envisaged due to the delayed transmission of "The Gathering Place", and to that end reminds BBC Scotland of its public responsibility and requests that Lord Fraser should be allowed access to the material in interviews recorded for the programme as soon as possible and before ownership passes to the independent company contracted by the BBC to produce "The Gathering Place".
