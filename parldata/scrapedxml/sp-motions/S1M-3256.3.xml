*S1M-3256.3 Tommy Sheridan: Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3256) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "warmly" to end and insert "condemns the Scottish Executive’s failure to address the growing gap in Scotland between the ‘Haves’ and the ‘Have Nots’; believes that this failure exposes a lack of political courage and an inability to introduce radical income and wealth redistribution measures for fear of offending the millionaire and big business minority on whose behalf the New Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive appears to govern Scotland; further condemns the Executive’s record on tackling Scotland’s shameful child and pensioner poverty levels, and believes that replacing the unfair council tax with a redistributive and progressive personal income-based Scottish service tax would effectively close the gap in Scotland’s communities."
