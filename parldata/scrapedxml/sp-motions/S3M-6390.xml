 *S3M-6390 Jamie Hepburn: Royal Mail Privatisation Revived by UK Government—That the Parliament expresses its concern and disappointment at the plan by the UK Government, announced in the coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, to part-privatise the Royal Mail; considers that the previous Labour administration was forced to drop its plan to part-privatise mail services following massive opposition from the public, trade unions and Labour backbenchers; believes that any such part-privatisation will put pressure on the Royal Mail’s universal service obligation, increase the risk of price rises and threaten jobs in the Royal Mail group and the businesses that rely on it, and calls on the UK Government to drop what is considered to be a damaging plan.
