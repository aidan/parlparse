*S3M-7369 Jackie Baillie: China To Protect Scotch Whisky—That the Parliament welcomes the news that China will now recognise and protect Scotch Whisky as a geographical indication; notes that this is the culmination of three years of discussions between the Scotch Whisky Association and the Chinese Government; understands that the agreement will ensure that China recognises that Scotch Whisky can be made only in Scotland; further understands that the decision ensures that local consumers in China will be protected from imitations and also that the integrity of Scotch Whisky is protected, and considers this a significant landmark in an increasingly important market for Scotch Whisky distillers.
