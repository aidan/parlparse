*S2M-4277 John Home Robertson: Tribute to Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun 1653-1716, Patriot and Unionist—That the Parliament recognises the courageous role of Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, Member for East Lothian, in the debate on the Treaty of Union in 1706; endorses his wise statement that "it is certainly in the interest of all good men to promote a nearer union with our neighbours in England"; believes that 67 members of the old Scottish Parliament, including Fletcher and Patrick Home, Member for Berwickshire, were right to vote against the abolition of Scotland’s Parliament; notes Fletcher’s warning that "the Scots deserve no pity, if they voluntarily surrender their united and separate interests to the mercy of an united Parliament" and regrets the fact that an incorporating union was delivered by 110 votes, later described as the "parcel of rogues"; welcomes the fact that the Scotland Act 1998 has achieved a fair and final resolution to the constitutional status of Scotland within the United Kingdom, and rejoices in the fact that Scotland now has the benefits of both union and autonomy, as advocated by Andrew Fletcher in 1707, as we approach the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union and the immensely successful historic partnership of the United Kingdom. Supported by: Mr Alasdair Morrison*, Mr Jamie Stone*
