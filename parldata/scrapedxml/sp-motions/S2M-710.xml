 *S2M-710# Mr Kenny MacAskill: Office of Fair Trading Proposals for Taxi Deregulation-That the Parliament notes the vital and important public service provided by well-regulated taxis and private hire vehicles in Scotland; further notes with concern the Office of Fair Trading's (OFT) consideration of deregulation of vehicle numbers; supports the representations made by the Scottish Taxi Federation to the OFT; believes that such deregulation would be detrimental to the interests of passengers and drivers alike, and considers that the interests of both are best served by a well-regulated sector that is democratically accountable to elected local authorities and legislated for by the Parliament. Supported by: Tricia Marwick*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Fergus Ewing*, Robert Brown*, Shona Robison*, Bruce Crawford*, Linda Fabiani*
