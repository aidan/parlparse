 *S3M-3823 Bill Butler: "¡No pasarán!" - the Legacy of the International Brigades—That the Parliament notes that 1 April 2009 marks the 70th anniversary of the end of the Spanish Civil War; salutes the heroic contribution of the hundreds of Scots who joined the international brigades to defend the democratically elected Government of the Spanish Republic against fascism; acknowledges that the remains of several Scots who died during the war are still unaccounted for; encourages people to take part in the series of events being held across Scotland to honour the memory of those who gave their lives in the defence of democracy, and vows to uphold the brigaders’ legacy by continuing to oppose fascism in all its forms. Supported by: Michael McMahon*, Stewart Maxwell*, Jamie Hepburn*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Brian Adam*, Elaine Murray*, Patricia Ferguson*
