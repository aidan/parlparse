*S3M-3250.2 Robin Harper: Common Agricultural Policy Health Check—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3250) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from second "the Scottish Government’s" to end and insert "Scotland’s environmental, social and economic priorities through food production and the environmental management of our agricultural land, combined with the delivery of other economic and social public goods; accepts the decision by an overwhelming majority of the European Parliament that new controls need to be placed on the use of agricultural chemicals; notes that once these new controls are implemented there will be a level playing field in Europe, allowing the competitiveness of Scottish agriculture to be maintained, and further notes that environmental security and sustainability will be key to delivering a competitive and dynamic agricultural industry in the future."
