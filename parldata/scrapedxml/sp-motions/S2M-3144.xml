*S2M-3144 Christine Grahame: Sir William Wallace - Guardian of Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament recognises the seminal role of William Wallace in securing the status of Scotland as a nation which endures to this day; celebrates his historic victory at Stirling Bridge in 1297 against military odds through his imaginative and inspiring patriotism and devotion to restoring independence to Scotland; recognises that at Selkirk, in the "forest kyrk", the Kirk of the Forest, supported by nobles and clergy, he was declared Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland, and further recognises that, though betrayed and brutally executed as a commoner on 23 August 700 years ago, his patriotic spirit inspires many Scots seven centuries on, when his legacy is still "Guardian of Scotland".
