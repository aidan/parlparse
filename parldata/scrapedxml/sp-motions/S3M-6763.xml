 *S3M-6763 Mary Scanlon: Aberdeen Forensic Service—That the Parliament notes publication of the Scottish Police Services Authority’s Forensic Service Modernisation Options Paper, which includes options proposing the closure of the Aberdeen Forensic Service; recognises the importance of this service to policing and crime detection in the Highlands and Islands and Grampian, which benefits from the resources and expertise situated in the current laboratory in Aberdeen; expresses concern that this facility could be closed and the service centralised under modernisation plans; acknowledges the concerns raised about the loss of specialised jobs in Aberdeen and future service delivery across Northern and Grampian constabularies should the Aberdeen Forensic Service close, and supports the campaign to retain this service in Aberdeen to ensure that communities in the Highlands and Islands, Grampian and across Scotland can continue to benefit from what it considers the excellent service provided by the Aberdeen Forensic Service.
