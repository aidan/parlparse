 *S3M-4643 Bill Aitken: Exhibit Untitled 2009â€”That the Parliament notes the number of complaints that have been made with regard to the Untitled 2009 exhibit at the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow; considers the exhibit, which encourages the vandalism of a bible, to be of questionable taste and displaying a lack of respect toward those who value the bible as a holy book; further considers it inappropriate that Culture and Sport Glasgow has used public money to promote this particular exhibit, and calls for the immediate withdrawal of the exhibit. Supported by: Gavin Brown*, Kenneth Gibson*, Jamie McGrigor*, Bill Kidd*, John Lamont*, Margaret Mitchell*
