 *S3M-7717.1 Robin Harper: Discards—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7717) in the name of John Scott, insert at end "; considers that most North Sea fish stocks, especially cod, have been at an all-time low for at least a decade due to relentless overfishing and that most proposals from the European Commission have been successfully undermined year on year by an alliance of EU politicians and fishing interests, and urges the Scottish Government and all EU partners to cooperate in reducing the catching capacity of the entire EU fishing fleet as a precursor to the landing of all catch and the development of a more sophisticated strategy that will allow for the introduction of further targeted conservation policies to be introduced, understood and properly implemented".
