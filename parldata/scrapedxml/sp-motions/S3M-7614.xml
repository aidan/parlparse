*S3M-7614 Patrick Harvie: National Day of Protest against Welfare and Housing Benefit Cuts—That the Parliament recognises the National Day of Protest against Welfare and Housing Benefit cuts on Wednesday 15 December 2010 and applauds all of those involved in peaceful protest on this day; believes that Scotland will be hit hard by these changes, since over 84% of Scotland’s councils will see households losing £30 a month or more in housing benefit; expresses grave concern that households affected by these changes will become trapped in a spiral of debt and be placed at greater risk of rent arrears, eviction and homelessness; believes that the Scottish Government is simply implementing what it considers the UK Government’s unprecedented, unnecessary and ideologically driven cuts agenda without undertaking any concerted action to raise revenue, and therefore urges it to reconsider its own cuts to Scotland’s housing and regeneration budget, which has been the single biggest loser in its draft 2011-12 budget.
