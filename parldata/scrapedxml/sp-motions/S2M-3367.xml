*S2M-3367 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Pesticide Safety—That the Parliament notes the recent publication of Crop Spraying and the Health of Residents and Bystanders by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which highlighted the potentially damaging effects of pesticides on our health; recognises the potential conflicts of interest within the current system and the need to revise the way the Pesticides Safety Directorate operates, and calls on the Scottish Executive to institute a fundamental overhaul of the risk assessment of pesticides, a monitoring programme for health and exposure that will determine the real scale of the problem, a mandatory right for the public to be notified of which pesticides are being used, both in advance and with on-site signage, and to introduce buffer no-spray zones as a precautionary measure.
