*S3M-3806 John Park: Greater Transparency in Global Financial Transactions—That the Parliament recognises the opportunity that the Group of Twenty (G20) summit presents to reform the global financial system; notes the current lack of transparency, which, Christian Aid estimates, deprives developing countries of $160 billion per year due to two forms of corporate tax evasion; believes that Christian Aid is correct in calling for an accounting standard requiring country-by-country reporting, which would equip developed and developing countries with the information that they need to identify quickly where tax is being evaded; believes that the G20 should implement a global agreement that requires all jurisdictions to share tax information automatically, with strong sanctions for non-cooperative jurisdictions, and considers that this would equip developed and developing countries with information on companies and individuals shifting profits offshore.
