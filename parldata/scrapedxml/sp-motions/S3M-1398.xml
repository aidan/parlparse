*S3M-1398 Bill Wilson: Death of Last Eyak Speaker and the Importance of Linguistic Heritage—That the Parliament notes the extinction of the Eyak language with the death of 89-year-old Marie Smith Jones, peace campaigner and campaigner for indigenous languages, who was believed to be the last full-blooded member of the Eyak tribe of Alaska and the last fluent speaker of the language; notes that it is reported that none of her nine children learned Eyak because "they grew up a time when it was considered wrong to speak anything but English"; notes the similarities between the history of Eyak and other languages, notably Scots, and is of the opinion that the best way of honouring the life and work of Smith Jones is to promote a positive attitude to our own indigenous languages and culture.
