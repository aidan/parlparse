 *S3M-7095 Joe FitzPatrick: Victoria and Albert Museum—That the Parliament considers as a major step forward in the development of the Victoria and Albert Museum in Dundee the showcasing of the six shortlisted designs at the University of Abertay in Dundee from 29 September 2010 at an exhibit entitled, V&amp;A at Dundee - Making it Happen; welcomes the fact that this free exhibition will be open to all residents and visitors of Dundee as late as 9pm and at weekends to allow everyone the opportunity to view the designs and express their opinion; views the project as an excellent opportunity for Dundee, bringing both extra employment and tourism to the city, following on from recent successes, such as the showcasing of Titian’s Diana and Actaeon in the newly refurbished McManus Galleries, and believes that this will add to Scotland’s wealth of internationally renowned culture.
