 *S3M-6822Robin Harper:Glenmorangie Pictish Throne—That the Parliament congratulates Glenmorangie and National Museums Scotland on their successful partnership to investigate early historic Scotland; notes the partnership has created a new archaeological research post at the National Museum of Scotland, with the aim of the publication of new findings in 2011; welcomes the partnership’s work with contemporary craftspeople to provide insight into the skills of the Picts; recognises the sophistication of Pictish society as reflected in the throne created by master furniture maker Adrian McCurdy and displayed earlier this year in the Parliament; notes that thrones were a symbol of power and governance throughout this formative period of Scottish history, and believes Scotland’s ancient past continues to have parallels and lessons for modern Scotland.
