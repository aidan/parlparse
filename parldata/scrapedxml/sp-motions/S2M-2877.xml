 * S2M-2877 Patrick Harvie: Environmental Injustice in Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern the publication of Investigating environmental justice in Scotland: links between measures of environmental quality and social deprivation by the Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research (SNIFFER); further notes the report’s findings that Scotland’s poorest communities are more likely to experience poor air quality and be living near to industrial pollution, derelict land or rivers with poor water quality and that in rural areas opencast mines and quarries are more likely to be located closer to poorer communities; believes that the report clearly demonstrates that Scotland’s most deprived communities bear the burden of living in the worst environments and that this demonstrates the lack of progress in securing environmental justice for Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to renew its commitment to environmental justice and to explain what steps it will take to remedy the situation; considers the recent decision by ministers to approve the M74 Northern Extension to be a step in the wrong direction, and believes that the Executive should demonstrate its commitment to environmental justice by heeding calls for a planning system which is fair at all stages, including the appeal stage.
