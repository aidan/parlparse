 *S2M-865# John Swinburne: Challenge to Voting System-That the Parliament notes with concern the recent interference by a Westminster committee to change the voting pattern for the Scottish Parliament; believes it is yet another blow to the autonomy of Scottish governance; recognises that two elections for the Scottish Parliament have now taken place where the electorate have voted in 56 list MSPs; considers, therefore, that it would appear that the Scottish electorate understand the current system; suggests that the current system in Westminster where Scottish MPs vote on English legislation is confusing to voters in England, and considers that it would be more prudent and efficient to give greater fiscal power to the Scottish Parliament resulting in cost savings to taxpayers by reducing the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster.
