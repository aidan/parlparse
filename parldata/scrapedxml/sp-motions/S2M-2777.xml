 *S2M-2777 Campbell Martin: Battle of the Atlantic—That the Parliament recognises the courage of all who served with the Royal Navy and merchant fleet during the Battle of the Atlantic between September 1939 and May 1945; remembers that during the battle around 30,000 merchant seamen, 8,000 allied servicemen and 6,000 Coastal Command personnel were killed and that about 29,000 German submariners perished; considers that it is regrettable that no official service medal was struck to recognise the contribution of the personnel who took part in the battle; commends the government of Russia for awarding to British personnel the Commemorative Medal of Victory in the Great Patriotic War in recognition of the role played by the allied convoys in supplying food, fuel and equipment to the Soviet Union to allow the Soviet military to engage Nazi forces on the eastern front, and urges Her Majesty’s Government to set aside the five-year rule covering the striking of service medals and formally recognise the contribution of all British personnel who served in the Battle of the Atlantic by issuing an official service medal for the conflict.
