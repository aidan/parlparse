*S2M-148 Carolyn Leckie: Pay Bargaining in the NHSâ€”That the Parliament recognises the unanimous decision of the UNISON Scotland health conference to pursue a fully devolved and democratic bargaining machinery for NHS staff in Scotland, its rejection of the UK-wide proposals contained in Agenda for Change - Modernising the NHS Pay System and its determination to achieve a negotiated settlement in Scotland for NHS workers and calls on the Scottish Executive to give a commitment to maintaining current agreements in relation to the principles of lifetime protection and no detriment as a result of organisational change, establish discussions with the relevant trade unions in order to establish a proper Scottish bargaining machinery and seek to negotiate an alternative to the proposals in Agenda for Change - Modernising the NHS Pay System that is acceptable specifically to the NHS workforce in Scotland.
