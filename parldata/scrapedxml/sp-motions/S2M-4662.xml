*S2M-4662 Mr Mark Ruskell: Clearwater Forth Oil Spill Contingency Plan—That the Parliament notes the conditional approval of the revised Clearwater Forth oil spill contingency plan by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which will allow ship-to-ship oil transfers to proceed in the Firth of Forth, subject to the consent of Forth Ports plc; is concerned that this decision disregards a consensus from experts, statutory agencies such as Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, wildlife organisations such as the RSPB, and local authorities opposed to ship-to-ship transfers in the Forth; believes that there is a major conflict of interest between the role of Forth Ports plc as a competent authority under the EU Habitats Directive and as a public limited company set to financially benefit from the oil transfer operations in the Forth, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use all relevant powers to ensure that ship-to-ship transfer operations are not given approval if Forth Ports plc cannot show that there will be no impact on the area’s birds and marine mammals as a result of the oil transfer operations.
