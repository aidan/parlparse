 *S3M-6703.1 Lewis Macdonald: It’s Scotland’s Oil—As an amendment to motion (S3M-6703) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from first "considers" to end and insert "recognises that the industry sustains 440,000 jobs across Britain, many of which are highly skilled, high-quality jobs, and that the oil and gas services sector alone earned over £5 billion in 2009 through exports; believes that the PILOT partnership established between government and industry in 1999 has enabled continuing production from the North Sea at a time when it might otherwise have gone into decline, increasing employment in the sector over that period by some 10,000 jobs, and further believes that the keys to continuing employment, wealth creation and government revenues over the next 40 years are political and economic stability in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole together with a fiscal and regulatory regime designed to maximise production of oil and gas from the UK continental shelf."
