 *S2M-2791 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Jack Nicklaus - St Andrews Community Council Snub—That the Parliament condemns the decision by St Andrews Community Council to snub the legendary American golfer Jack Nicklaus by denying him the title of Honorary Citizen of the Royal Burgh of St Andrews; demands clarification as to how each member of the council voted in the ballot; recommends that a new ballot should be held in public to reconsider the original decision, and, if that decision is reversed, considers that an unequivocal apology should be sent to Mr Nicklaus before he comes to St Andrews for his last ever appearance in the Open in July.
