*S3M-7867 Kenneth Gibson: War in Congo—That the Parliament is aware of the ongoing suffering in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a nation ravaged by the effects of war since the mid-1990s; considers that, despite being regarded as a forgotten conflict, the near constant state of war and chaos over the last three decades has claimed over five and a half million lives and, as such, lays claim to the tragic status of the most deadly conflict since the Second World War; considers that the people of Congo have borne witness to a most horrific series of war, rape, torture, murder and genocide since the mass influx of over one million Hutu refugees in 1994 resulted in a spate of conflicts between Congo and Rwanda; further notes that the series of wars in Congo included the armed forces of eight different African nations, Angola, Burundi, Chad, Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe plus innumerable armed militias and rebel groups, leading many to label it Africa’s World War and the Great African War; welcomes the recent UN report on the atrocities committed by both state and non-state forces on both sides; hopes that this report is a step toward bringing the guilty parties to justice and will help Congolese society come to terms with its past and face its contemporary challenges in a manner that prevents the reoccurrence of such atrocities, and calls on the international community to focus its efforts on delivering a lasting peace in Congo.
