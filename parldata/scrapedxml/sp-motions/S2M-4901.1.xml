*S2M-4901.1 John Swinburne: Scotland’s Duty to its Senior Citizens—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4901) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "is therefore" to end and insert "and that the Scottish Executive should immediately take action to increase the income of every pensioner household in Scotland in a legal manner which is entirely compliant with the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 and thereby follow up on that excellent social experiment by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown MP, in 2005 which should result in the first drop in winter-related deaths in Scotland in recent years."
