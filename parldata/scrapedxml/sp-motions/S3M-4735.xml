*S3M-4735 Sandra White: Rangers Charity Foundation Teams up with Glasgow Old People’s Welfare Association—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement from the Rangers Charity Foundation that the Glasgow Old People’s Welfare Association (GOPWA) will be its new community charity partner for season 2009-10; acknowledges that the support that GOPWA provides, such as its heat-and-eat service, which gives older people the opportunity to get out and socialise with one another before being safely returned home, is essential in maintaining and enhancing the wellbeing of many older people, and believes that the generosity of the Rangers Charity Foundation, which will help to provide a dedicated bus for this invaluable service, will ensure that many older people continue to benefit from this excellent service.
