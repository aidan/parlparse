 *S2M-3315 Mr Mark Ruskell: Action on Climate Change—That the Parliament notes the publication of satellite data showing that the extent of Arctic sea ice is at an all-time minimum and considers that this shortage of sea ice may be part of a positive feedback loop that will lead to further global warming; further notes the findings of a recent article, published in the journal, Science, that category 4 and 5 hurricanes have become more frequent over the past 35 years, coinciding with an increase in sea surface temperatures; considers, in the light of these findings, that global climate change is now the most serious and most urgent political issue facing us, and calls on all political parties to engage in a mature debate in an attempt to achieve consensus on ways to minimise Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions.
