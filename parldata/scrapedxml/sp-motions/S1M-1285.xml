*S1M-1285# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Establishment of a Children's Fund—That the Parliament applauds the decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to establish a Children’s Fund south of the border as a way of providing funding to local organisations and communities to tackle child poverty; believes that such a fund will go a long way to help young people develop their own projects and solutions to everyday problems, fund existing initiatives, support voluntary and local community projects and help promote children’s involvement in services; is concerned that the Scottish Executive appears hesitant about establishing a Children’s Fund in Scotland, and calls for consultation with community children’s organisations and young people on the establishment of an innovative and creative Children’s Fund, without the complex system of partnerships and funding mazes that bedevil so many other of their strategies.
