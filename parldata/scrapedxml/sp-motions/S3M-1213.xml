*S3M-1213♦ Elaine Murray: Marketing and Communications Sector in Scotland—That the Parliament notes that the marketing and communications sector in Scotland is worth £350 million a year and employs around 40,000 people, making the industry an important service sector for Scotland, including in rural areas such as Dumfries and Galloway; welcomes the presence of the Scottish Marketing Communications Action Group in the Parliament on 19 February 2008; notes that the group is requesting the Scottish Government to enter into a partnership to work with the industry to build on its strengths and agrees that work should continue between the government and the industry to increase the income retained by businesses in Scotland and to increase the skills within the sector, generating a potential increase in income of over £100 million; furthermore recognises that marketing and communications, as part of Scotland’s service sector, is an essential element in driving Scotland’s business growth and attractiveness to inward investors, and therefore pledges to do what it can to assist in this initiative.
