 *S2M-2978 Rosie Kane: Gleneagles Plan of Action—That the Parliament condemns the new Gleneagles Plan of Action on climate change, due to be submitted to next month’s G8 summit at Gleneagles; calls for the immediate withdrawal of this draft plan which removes proposals to fund research and calls into question top scientists’ warnings that global warming is already under way, has no specific targets or timetables for action and explicitly endorses the use of "zero-carbon" nuclear power, and further calls on the leaders of the G8 to accept unequivocally that global warming exists and to act immediately to address this issue. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Carolyn Leckie*
