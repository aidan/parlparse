*S2M-4821 Frances Curran: Scotland’s Long Walk for Peace Arrives at the Parliament—That the Parliament welcomes Scotland’s Long Walk for Peace which arrived at the Parliament on the afternoon of 19 September 2006 and congratulates all the walkers who have walked 85 miles from the Trident nuclear submarine base at Faslane to Edinburgh over the last six days; thanks the 36 MSPs who have signed the on-line petition supporting the walk for peace, and hopes that those MSPs who came out to welcome the marchers will have the courage of their convictions and vote in the Scottish Parliament at the next opportunity to rid Scotland of Trident’s nuclear weapons, noting that ordinary voters are disappointed by politicians who patronise them by doing one thing for the cameras of the assembled media but another at voting time.
