*S1M-3256 Ms Margaret Curran: Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the publication of the Scottish Executive’s community regeneration statement Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap; agrees that despite past successes in community regeneration more needs to be done to improve the quality of life of people in Scotland’s deprived areas; fully endorses the policy proposals for improving public services in deprived communities, placing community regeneration more firmly within the strategic framework of community planning, giving more priority to community learning and development and improving monitoring and evaluation, and agrees that these measures will make a significant contribution to closing the gap between deprived areas and the rest of Scotland.
