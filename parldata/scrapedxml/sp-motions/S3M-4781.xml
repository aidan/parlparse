 *S3M-4781 Liam McArthur: Eday Partnership Climate Change Fund Success—That the Parliament congratulates the Eday Partnership on its success in being awarded £46,851 from the Climate Change Fund to support the Eday Carbon Reduction Programme; notes that the funding will allow the partnership to appoint a full-time carbon reduction coordinator who will lead the work to increase the sustainability of the Eday community and to reduce the island’s annual carbon emissions by 34 tonnes by 2016; believes that this will build further on the excellent work of the partnership carried out over a number of years and covering a range of innovative projects, which, among other things, are helping to address the population decline, a problem affecting many of Scotland’s small islands, and wishes all those connected with the partnership every success for the future.
