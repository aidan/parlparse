*S3M-3869 Bill Kidd: UK Nuclear Submarines Involved in 14 Collisions and Over 200 Firesâ€”That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the admission that UK nuclear submarines have been involved in 14 collisions since 1979 and that over 200 fires have occurred on board nuclear submarines since 1987; considers that a number of these fires occurred when the nuclear submarines were at base resulting in the need for external help to contain the situations, and believes that the real possibility of a nuclear disaster, which could potentially cause untold suffering to the people of Scotland, demonstrates why it is time to remove these weapons of mass destruction from Scottish waters and for the UK Government to abandon its plans to renew Trident.
