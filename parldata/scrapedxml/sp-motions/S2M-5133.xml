*S2M-5133 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Remains of Bothwell—That the Parliament supports the desire to repatriate from Denmark the remains of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell and Duke of Orkney, consort to Mary Queen of Scots; notes that the remains of Tsarina Maria Fyodorovna, widow of Tsar Alexander III, have recently been removed from Denmark for internment in St Petersburg, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the UK Government to request that Bothwell’s remains similarly are returned for reburial in his native Scotland, in accordance with the wishes of the Earl and his descendants around the world.
