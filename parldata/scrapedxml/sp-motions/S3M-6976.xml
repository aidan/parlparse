*S3M-6976 Pauline McNeill: Protect Glasgow’s Shipyards—That the Parliament notes the consequences of cancelling the aircraft carrier projects at the Clyde shipyards; is concerned by the impact that this would have on the shipyard workers, especially those in Scotstoun, and the 300 apprentices currently working at the shipyards; understands that this could lead to the potential closing of the shipyards, and calls on the UK Government to safeguard these contracts and protect Glaswegian jobs.
