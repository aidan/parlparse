*S1M-3263 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Development of RAF Turnhouse Site—That the Parliament notes that BAA Lynton has earmarked the former RAF Turnhouse site or "Airwest" for medium- to long-term commercial development in support of the expanding cargo operations at Edinburgh Airport following the grant of outline planning consent in June 2000; further notes that the entire site is currently being marketed to potential commercial occupiers for a variety of airport-related uses; expresses its concern that Home Office plans for a possible accommodation centre for asylum seekers on that site are creating uncertainty and thus the site is in danger of becoming blighted, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive and the City of Edinburgh Council to ask the Home Office to state clearly that it has no interest in the site and thereby permit BAA Lynton to proceed with its plans which are in the best interest of jobs and economic development in Edinburgh and the east of Scotland.
