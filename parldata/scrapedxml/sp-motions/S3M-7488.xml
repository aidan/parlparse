*S3M-7488 Dr Richard Simpson: Silently Stressed, NUS Scotland’s Research on Student Stress—That the Parliament welcomes NUS Scotland’s report on research into student stress, Silently Stressed: a survey into student mental wellbeing, which follows on from NUS Scotland’s Think Positive project, which aims to create a mentally healthier student population across Scotland’s universities and colleges; considers that the report underpins the Think Positive campaign by showing that the needs of Scotland’s students are not only not being met but are increasing; regrets that, despite the growing success of the national anti-stigma mental health campaign, over 80% of those students surveyed felt that the stigma perceived around the issue of mental illness prevented them from asking for support, and calls for discussions with NUS Scotland on how the issue of stigma might be better tackled.
