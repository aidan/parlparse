*S2M-2155.4 Carolyn Leckie: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "continuing" to end and insert "radical continuing action is needed to turn around the poor health of many people in Scotland, most of it poverty-related; further notes that the Scottish Executive needs to do much more if mortality and morbidity are to be drastically reduced, life expectancy increased and health inequalities removed; recognises that the most effective health promotion measure would be the eradication of poverty; recognises that, while Scotland’s people continue to suffer unacceptable levels of ill-health, the NHS needs to have the capacity to treat patients quickly, effectively and as close to their homes as possible; believes that the NHS in Scotland has suffered unprecedented and unsustainable reductions of capacity, particularly through bed cuts, hospital closures, PFI and budget deficits in the last 10 years and that there needs to be an immediate reversal of that trend by securing the NHS as a publicly-owned, publicly-delivered, universal, comprehensive service free at the point of need with the capacity to meet the needs of the population, and considers private health care to be a parasitic drain on NHS assets, resources and staff that merely converts public money into private profit whilst undermining the founding principles of the NHS and threatens its very existence as envisioned by Aneurin Bevan."
