*S2M-4120 Chris Ballance: Outreach Services—That the Parliament congratulates the staff of its Outreach Services on their work in the provision of the "MSPs in Schools" programme by facilitating sessions in schools to enable children and young people to gain a greater understanding of the work of the Parliament and participate directly in bringing real issues, through a variety of innovative methods, to the attention of their MSPs; believes that this programme has enabled children and young people to become directly involved with the political process and encourages political awareness in voters of the future, and congratulates the Outreach Services team for providing a valuable service in active citizenship complementary to the sessions offered to schools within the Parliament.
