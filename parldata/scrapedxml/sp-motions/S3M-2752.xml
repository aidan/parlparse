*S3M-2752 Patrick Harvie: Congratulations to Shawlands Academy—That the Parliament congratulates the staff and pupils at Shawlands Academy on Glasgow’s Southside for their award as the United Kingdom’s greenest school; notes that the school fought off competition from schools throughout Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland; recognises the contribution that schools can make both to direct environmental improvements and to fostering a lasting culture of sustainable living; considers that many parts of the public sector can learn from the examples shown by Shawlands Academy and the other schools in the competition, and urges the Scottish Government to use the forthcoming climate change bill to provide incentives for urgent action throughout Scotland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of environmental damage.
