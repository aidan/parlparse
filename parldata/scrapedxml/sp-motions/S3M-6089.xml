 *S3M-6089 Kenneth Gibson: Time to Curb Excessive Interest Rates—That the Parliament notes with concern the sky-high interest rates being charged by short-term credit agencies, such as Wonga.com, which advertises loans of up to £1,000 on television at up to 2,689% APR of interest; believes that such companies take advantage of some of the most vulnerable people in Scotland’s society, and calls on the UK Government to act to limit maximum interest rates, as already happens in other EU countries.
