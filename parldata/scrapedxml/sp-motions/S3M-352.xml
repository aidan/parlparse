*S3M-352 Robin Harper: Review of Court Procedure in Relation to Industrial Accidents—That the Parliament welcomes the imminent implementation of legislation to create an offence of corporate manslaughter; recognises the further pain and heartache inflicted on the families of men and women killed or injured in industrial accidents through delays in court proceedings, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review the processes of the Scottish court system with the aim of removing all impediments and restraints on the swift and efficient administration of justice in relation to industrial accidents.
