*S2M-3603# Dr Elaine Murray: One Plus Grow Your Own Training Programmeâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the support given to lone parents and other excluded groups by One Plus and its partner organisations, including offering access to vocational training and employment, and believes that the "Grow Your Own" training programme for community workers in north west Dumfries, organised by the Maxwelltown Umbrella Group and One Plus, is an excellent example of partnership working.
