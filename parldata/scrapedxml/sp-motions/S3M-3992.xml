*S3M-3992 Patricia Ferguson: Maryhill Burgh Halls—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the announcement of the award of £980,910 of Big Lottery funding to the Maryhill Burgh Halls Trust, which will see a refurbishment and new-build extension of the Maryhill Burgh Halls; congratulates the local management committee for taking this project forward; further notes the significant policy change that sees Glasgow City Council transferring the asset at no cost to the local community; recognises that the success of projects like this through Growing Community Assets will advance the asset-based community development agenda in urban Scotland; further congratulates the leadership role played by Glasgow City Council in helping to achieve this, and urges other public bodies to follow its lead thereby creating even more opportunities for communities to benefit from the surge in community ownership.
