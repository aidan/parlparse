*S2M-3824 Fiona Hyslop: Britain Day Proposal—That the Parliament notes Gordon Brown MP’s proposals for a British Day to celebrate issues of British identity which reflects more his aspiration to be leader of the British state than an understanding of issues of identity in Scotland; regrets that the Labour Party supports a national day for the state of Britain but has rejected a national day for the nation of Scotland by not approving the St Andrew’s Day Bill; particularly regrets any suggestion that a day of sombre remembrance should be hijacked for such a purpose; notes that many countries’ national day of celebration in fact marks the end of British rule from the days of empire, now diminished; notes that Britain is a political state originally established out of specific economic and political self-interest, and further notes that, in order for young Scots to understand and appreciate their own identity, it is essential that the history of Scotland and a Scottish world view of events is taught as a discrete subject in our schools in order that Scots, including politicians, have a grasp of what economic, cultural and political influences have forged the current nation of Scotland.
