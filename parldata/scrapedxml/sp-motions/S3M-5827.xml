*S3M-5827 Elaine Murray: Scottish Defence League Not Welcome in Lockerbie—That the Parliament deplores the announcement by the so-called Scottish Defence League that they intend to march in Lockerbie on 27 March 2010; believes that this is an extremist group trying to use the Lockerbie tragedy of 1988 to spread its racist and anti-Islamic views; further believes that this event would be an affront to the people of Lockerbie, to the 270 people who lost their lives in the tragedy and to their families, and calls on the Scottish and English Defence Leagues to call off this march forthwith.
