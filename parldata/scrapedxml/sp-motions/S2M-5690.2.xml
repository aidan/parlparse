*S2M-5690.2 Shiona Baird: Economy and Small Business—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5690) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from "recognises" to end, and insert "acknowledges the enormous contribution made by small businesses to the Scottish economy; notes that 98% of Scottish businesses employ less than 50 people and that small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) support 41% of business turnover and 52% of all private sector employment; believes that the current system of business rates works against the interests of small businesses and in favour of larger companies and that replacing business rates with a system of land value taxation would help to redress the balance; further notes that the power of supermarkets needs to be reigned in through an independent food supply chain regulator and that local business would benefit greatly from proposed green legislation that would make green public procurement mandatory rather than optional, and recognises the increasingly important role that small businesses will play in the localised, low carbon economy of Scotland’s future."
