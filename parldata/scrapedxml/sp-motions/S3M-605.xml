 *S3M-605 Karen Whitefield: South Nimmo GP Practice - Airdrie—That the Parliament recognises the strength of feeling among patients of the South Nimmo GP practice in Airdrie who feel that they have not been properly involved in the process of finding a new GP manager for the practice; expresses concern about the ability of any practice based within the Airdrie Health Centre, which is already badly overcrowded, to take an additional 1,800 patients, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to instruct NHS Lanarkshire to rerun the process of selecting a GP manager.
