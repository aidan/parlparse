*S1M-3426# Dr Sylvia Jackson: Scottish Road Maintenance Survey-That the Parliament notes the Scottish Road Maintenance Condition Survey by the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) which will evaluate the non-trunk road network across Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Executive's involvement in and support for this project, along with the funding that it has already provided to local authorities in order to help tackle problems in respect of such roads; recognises that for a number of decades the non-trunk roads network has suffered from under-investment, while the number of vehicles using such roads has dramatically increased, and considers that, following its publication, the Scottish Executive should use the SCOTS report as a basis for allocating resources according to the needs identified, providing a long-term funding programme for the non-trunk road network in Scotland.
