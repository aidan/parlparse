*S1M-3212 Trish Godman: European Commission Initiatives on the By-catching of Dolphins, Porpoises and Pilot Whales in Fishing Gearâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the initiatives finally being taken by the European Commission and other interested parties to reduce and perhaps one day eliminate the inadvertent slaughter of dolphins, porpoises and pilot whales trapped in the nets of trawlers operating in waters close to Scotland's coastline and elsewhere; is convinced that Scottish fishermen will readily engage with scientists and others in an effort to reduce dramatically this needless slaughter, and believes that it has an important role to play in the implementation of rules and regulations governing the use of whatever means are needed to protect such important marine species.
