*S3M-946 Linda Fabiani: St Andrew’s Day—That the Parliament believes in the importance of celebrating Scotland’s national day; recognises the opportunity that it offers to both celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the 21st century and to promote a fair and inclusive society; notes the Scottish Government’s proactive support of a programme of events throughout the country and all of Scotland’s six cities; commends the work of schools and community groups across Scotland in teaching our young people about St Andrew’s Day and promoting diversity through their celebrations, and furthermore thanks the St Andrew’s societies, Caledonian societies, Scottish Development International, Globalscots, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and all the other overseas organisations who have planned over 100 wide-ranging celebrations in countries around the world.
