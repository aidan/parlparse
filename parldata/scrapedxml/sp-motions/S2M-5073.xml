*S2M-5073 Donald Gorrie: WHSmith—That the Parliament notes the evidence that WHSmith’s highly centralised buying system has, in recent years, produced a clear and unequivocal bias against Scottish interest material, which is very damaging to Scottish publishers and writers; calls on WHSmith and other national and major book retailers to sign up to a code of conduct on Scottish cultural material, and invites the Scottish Executive to become partners with the Parliament in promoting and monitoring such a code.
