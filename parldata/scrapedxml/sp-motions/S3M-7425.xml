*S3M-7425 John Wilson: Reported Incidents of Domestic Abuse against Men on the Increase—That the Parliament acknowledges the release of official statistics detailing incidents of domestic abuse recorded by the police for 2009-10; notes with concern that the number of reported incidents of male victim/female perpetrator domestic abuse has more than doubled since 2000-01 from 2,696 to 7,938; recognises that this now brings the total number of reported cases of male victims of female abusers up to 15% of all reported cases; considers that these statistics show a significant increase in reported incidents of male victim/male perpetrator domestic abuse from 173 in 2000-01 to 666 in 2009-2010, and considers that these figures demonstrate that a concerted effort is needed to bring to an end all instances of domestic violence irrespective of gender.
