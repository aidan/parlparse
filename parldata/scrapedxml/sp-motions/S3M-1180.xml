*S3M-1180 Robert Brown: Abuse of Parliamentary Procedure by the Scottish Government—That the Parliament deplores the action of the Scottish Government in withdrawing, without consultation with Business Managers and at 15 minutes’ notice, Legislative Consent Motion S3M-1087 on the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill – UK Legislation set for debate on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the Parliamentary Bureau at the request of the Scottish Government; deplores this abuse of parliamentary procedure by the Scottish Government which prevented debate by the Parliament on the issue of enhanced support for youth services and facilities in Scotland, and notes with regret that the present Scottish Government, by its actions, has demonstrated that it values Scotland’s young people less than young people in England are valued under the same Bill.
