*S3M-307 Nicol Stephen: Home Loss Payments—That the Parliament notes that the current Home Loss Payment made to those displaced from their homes by compulsory purchase has remained at a maximum of £15,000 since 1991; notes that the equivalent maximum in England and Wales has recently been changed to £44,000, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring the Scottish payment into line with that in the rest of the United Kingdom and keep it under regular review.
