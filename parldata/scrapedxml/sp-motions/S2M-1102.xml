*S2M-1102# Johann Lamont: Health Inequalities in Scotland-That the Parliament welcomes the information provided in Health and Well-being Profiles for each Scottish Parliamentary Constituency, 2004; acknowledges the serious and significant health inequalities within Scotland that these reports highlight; recognises the clear correlation between poverty, deprivation and ill-health; believes that the Scottish Executive, in its review of the Arbuthnott formula for health spending, should ensure that health spending more closely matches Scottish deprivation indicators and health need, and further believes that the proposed independent review of local government finance should examine the benefits of an Arbuthnott-like review of the distribution of funding to local authorities to ensure that such funding takes proper account of deprivation.
