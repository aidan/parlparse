*S3M-1812.2 Stewart Maxwell: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1812) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "regrets" to end and insert "respects the democratic right of tenants to determine the ownership of their homes; regrets that HM Treasury will only write off local authority housing debt where local authority housing stock is transferred; believes that housing associations and other not-for-profit, co-operative bodies continue to have the lead role in providing new social housing but welcomes the Scottish Government’s encouragement of local authorities to augment the supply of new social housing as part of their role as landlords, and endorses the Scottish Government’s plans to end the right to buy on new social housing and to review how right to buy applies to the existing stock of social housing." Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon*
