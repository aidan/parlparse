*S2M-1161 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Suffragette Pardon-That the Parliament notes the 90th anniversary of the end of the militant campaign of the suffragette movement in Scotland; recognises that the sentences handed down to suffragette prisoners and the treatment of those prisoners when convicted were politically motivated and bore no relation to the acts committed, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on Her Majesty's Government for a posthumous pardon for the Scottish suffragette women who were convicted during this important period in women's history.
