*S2M-3318 Bruce Crawford: Deprivation in Scottish Coalfield Communities—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings contained within the Coalfields Communities Campaign’s report, Deprivation in Scottish Coalfield Communities, which highlights that two-thirds of former mining communities have levels of deprivation above the Scottish average and that deprivation affects communities whose combined population is 600,000; calls on the Scottish Executive to make Her Majesty’s Government, and in particular the Chancellor of the Exchequer, aware of the report, and further calls on the Executive and Her Majesty’s Government to outline their action plan for former coalfield communities to ensure that such levels of deprivation and poverty are eradicated from communities in energy-rich Scotland.
