*S3M-2526♦ Aileen Campbell: Royal Society of Edinburgh’s Inquiry into the Future of Scotland’s Hills and Islands—That the Parliament notes the findings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh’s Committee of Inquiry into the Future of Scotland’s Hills and Islands, published on 8 September 2008; expresses its concern at the report’s findings that Scotland receives an "inadequate" share of European funding under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which has the potential to cause a serious crisis in rural agriculture, including in rural areas of the south of Scotland; supports the report’s recommendation that the UK Government should urgently review its plans to end direct support to Scotland’s farmers when the CAP is reviewed in 2013, and applauds the Scottish Government’s constructive approach to EU funding and CAP reform discussions underway in Brussels, which deserves more support than those policies of the UK Government.
