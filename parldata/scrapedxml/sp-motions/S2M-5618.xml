*S2M-5618 Helen Eadie: Bus Connectivity in Scotland and the Competition Commission—That the Parliament congratulates all those organisations and individuals across Scotland involved in the efforts to ensure that the bus services grow into a co-ordinated, responsive service meeting the demands of an integrated public transport service; expresses profound concern that the Competition Commission has made a determination requiring divestment of the Megabus or Stagecoach services currently operated as a joint venture, created on 12 September 2005, to operate the Scottish services of Stagecoach’s megabus.com and Motorvator and Braddell plc’s Scottish Citylink; observes that Stagecoach acquired 35% of the share capital of Scottish Citylink Limited in return for transferring certain rights to the Motorvator and megabus.com operations in Scotland; notes that Braddell plc owns the remaining 65% of Citylink’s share capital with the joint venture operating services under the megabus.com and Scottish Citylink brands, and is the leading provider of express coach services in Scotland; welcomes the fact that passenger numbers have risen year on year by 41% and notes that, after stripping out the impact of the concession scheme, growth is in the region of 25%; is disturbed that the commission’s plans may dismantle a high-quality, value-for-money and integrated network and replace it with a disintegrated collection of routes to the detriment of customers who rely on lifeline inter-city coach services; is concerned at the cost to the taxpayer of further inquiry and regrets that the issue is now presenting serious conflict in Scottish Executive transport policy; hopes that the Executive will make representations to the Competition Commission to seek a reversal of its decision that will seriously impact on the major efforts that are being made by relevant people and organisations in Scotland to produce bus services fit for the 21st century, and finally hopes that for all sectors where monopoly power is subject of Competition Commission rulings there will be equitable and fair treatment across all sectors.
