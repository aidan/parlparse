*S3M-6475 Bob Doris: Remembering Robert Anderson—That the Parliament commemorates the generations of activists who have contributed so much to the political life of the nation; mourns the passing of Mr Robert Anderson on Saturday 30 May 2010, aged 100; celebrates his eventful life and notes that he was one of the Scots who took Rudolf Hess into custody at Eaglesham following his mysterious and ill-fated flight in 1941; notes that both Robert Anderson and his wife Helen, who died in 2006, joined the Scottish National Party as founder members in 1934 and both campaigned for Scottish independence throughout their entire adult lives, and considers that such remarkable people from the various political parties have contributed enormously to Scotland’s national life and should be remembered for their service not just to party but to country. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Aileen Campbell*, Bill Kidd*, Kenneth Gibson*, Alasdair Allan*, Anne McLaughlin*, Willie Coffey*, Brian Adam*, Gil Paterson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Sandra White*
