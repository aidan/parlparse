 *S3M-358 Alasdair Allan: Scots Language Database—That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the Scottish Corpus of Texts and Speech website (www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk) by researchers at the University of Glasgow; notes that this website has more than four million words in Scots and Scottish English, includes texts from 1945 up to the present day and, as well as describing meaning and usage, the project also has audio links which allow people to hear the words being spoken, and recognises that this could be a vital resource for those interested in the Scots language the world over and that the Scots language is a source of interest across the world as one aspect of Scotland’s long and thriving cultural heritage. 	The member has provided the following Scots translation: At the Pairliament walcomes the makin o the Scottish Corpus of Texts and Speech wabsteid (www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk), bi researchers at Glesca Universitie; taks tent at this wabsteid haes mair nor fower meilion wurds i Scots an Scottish Inglish, amang them screids fae 1945 forrit, an at, forby descreivin meanins an uisses, the projeck haes audio links an aw, at lats fowk hear the wurds bein spoken; taks tent at this cuid be a uissfu resource for thaim’s interestit i the Scots leid the warld ower; an at the Scots leid is a source o interest ower aw the warld as ae bit o Scotland’s lang cultural heriutage at’s tae the fore yet.
