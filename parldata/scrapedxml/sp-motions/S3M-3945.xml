*S3M-3945 Ian McKee: EU Structural Funds—That the Parliament welcomes the £95 million in European Structural Funds that will be injected into the Scottish economy, financing a total of 129 projects across many areas of the country; notes that the £70.2 million allocated from the European Regional Development Fund will focus on urban regeneration, business growth and rural development, creating almost 8,000 jobs, and that the £24.7 million allocated from the European Social Fund will target unemployment by supporting around 75,000 people through training and skills development; further notes that this cash will provide a fundamental boost to some of Scotland’s most deprived areas, creating opportunities for people and businesses; stresses the benefits and importance of European Structural Funds to Scotland particularly during the current economic recession, and recognises that these funds constitute one of many advantages of EU membership.
