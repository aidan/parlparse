*S1M-4016.1 Ms Sandra White: Announcement of Glasgow Airport Rail Link Project—As an amendment to motion (S1M-4016) in the name of Bill Butler, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert ", whilst welcoming at long last a commitment to building the long-awaited Glasgow Airport direct rail link announced by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning on 12 March 2003, regrets that the minister has chosen the cheapest option for the rail link and that there is no commitment to the Glasgow CrossRail scheme, which would connect Glasgow Airport to the entire country and has long been identified as a key component to the success of the Glasgow Airport rail link and crucial to the transport infrastructure, economic development and regeneration of Glasgow and the west of Scotland; notes that travellers from the north and east heading to Glasgow Airport will still have to make their way from Glasgow Queen Street to Glasgow Central Station to connect; believes that the lack of commitment to CrossRail demonstrates a lack of understanding of the needs of passengers, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should make, at the earliest possible time, a commitment to the development of the Glasgow CrossRail scheme."
