 *S3M-851 George Foulkes: Lothian Buses are the Best—That the Parliament congratulates Lothian Buses, Edinburgh and the Lothians’ wholly publicly owned bus operator, for being awarded the accolade of UK bus operator of the year; recognises that this most prestigious award is closely fought for by all bus companies around the United Kingdom; is delighted that our capital city’s publicly owned and operated Lothian Buses managed to beat off stiff privately owned and operated competition from London, Liverpool and Cambridge to be the outright winner; commends the ordinary bus users in Edinburgh and the Lothians who judged the competition for recognising the excellent job that Lothian Buses staff do and the high-quality service that they provide; welcomes the investment over the past few years on new buses; recognises the essential role that bus travel plays for people across the region, and encourages other bus operators throughout Scotland to strive to reach Lothian Buses’ high standards.
