*S3M-3414 Elaine Murray: Review of Legal Aid—That the Parliament is concerned that offenders convicted of serious crimes are able to receive significant sums in legal aid to undertake vexatious appeals against sentence and against the consequences of their crimes, for example in terms of lost pension entitlements; considers that the criteria for eligibility of legal aid should be reviewed to prevent the use of public funds for gratuitous serial appeals by persons convicted of serious crimes such as rape, and further considers that such actions compound the injury and distress cause to victims of these crimes and may deter rape victims from reporting offences.
