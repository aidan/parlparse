*S1M-3279 Ben Wallace: Sovereignty of Gibraltar-That the Parliament condemns the agreement reached by Her Majesty's Government with the Spanish Government on the future of Gibraltar; notes that, throughout talks leading to the agreement, Gibraltar and her people were denied a separate representative role; urges Spain to lift all current obstacles on the people of Gibraltar that restrict their enjoyment of free and full rights in accordance with membership of the European Union; endorses the position of the vast majority of Gibraltarians that their vote in any referendum should be the last word, and further notes the dire consequences to the strategic value of the United Kingdom of any move towards shared sovereignty.
