*S1M-2331# Alex Fergusson: Scottish Agricultural College, Auchincruive -That the Parliament recognises the important contribution made by the Scottish Agricultural College's Auchincruive Campus to food, land and environmental studies in Scotland; notes that the campus is Scotland's largest agricultural educational facility; further recognises the valuable contribution made to the Ayrshire economy by the campus, particularly its vital role at the heart of the bio-science industry in the west of Scotland, and express its hope that this contribution will be fully acknowledged during the forthcoming review of the Scottish Agricultural College's operations.
