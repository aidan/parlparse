*S2M-4304 Michael Matheson: Scotland’s Support for the Paralympic Movement—That the Parliament recognises the growing development of the paralympic movement; believes that promoting and hosting international disability sporting events and paralympic training camps in Scotland in the run-up to the 2012 London Paralympics can help this development, will encourage more disabled people in Scotland to participate in sport and will provide excellent opportunities for Scotland’s elite disabled sportspeople to compete in their home country; recognises that participation in sport produces physical, psychological, and social benefits; believes that promoting disability sport may help change attitudes and foster a more inclusive society; notes also the potential economic benefits for local communities from hosting major disability sporting events and training camps; recognises that Scotland already has facilities which would provide ideal locations for such events and camps, and calls on the Scottish Executive to explore how Scotland can be promoted as a suitable venue for hosting international disability sporting events and to begin discussions with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) on Scotland providing paralympic training camps before London 2012.
