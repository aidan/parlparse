S2M-5536 Bruce Crawford: Impact of Pfizer’s Change of Wholesale Practice on Scottish Pharmacies—That the Parliament expresses concern at Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals’ (PGP) proposal to distribute its medicines through a single distribution channel in the United Kingdom; believes that this will damage the pharmaceutical wholesale network in Scotland and will have cost implications for the NHS in Scotland; further believes that this will reduce service levels and be detrimental to patient care in Scotland; is concerned that, if other pharmaceutical manufacturers follow suit, this will further compound the problem by reducing service levels and increasing administrative burdens which will adversely affect the ability of community pharmacists to deliver pharmaceutical care to the people of Scotland, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should seek to persuade PGP to review its decision.
