 * S2M-3015.1 Mr Ted Brocklebank:Financial Management 2004-5, including Provisional Outturn Figures—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3015) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out from “improved” to end and insert “latest provisional outturn figures; encourages the Scottish Executive to continue its constructive dialogue with the Finance Committee to improve understanding, transparency and scrutiny; further notes the importance of this process to the efficient delivery of commitments outlined in A Partnership for a Better Scotland, and is disappointed, however, that, despite earlier assurances by the Executive, its efficiency drive falls substantially short of the Gershon savings instigated in Whitehall.”
