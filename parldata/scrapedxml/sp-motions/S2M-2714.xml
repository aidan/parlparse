*S2M-2714 Frances Curran: World Lupus Day 2005—That the Parliament notes that World Lupus Day will take place on 10 May 2005; recognises that over five million people worldwide, of whom around 90% are female, have Lupus and that it is therefore likely that every MSP has spoken to someone with Lupus in the last month; further recognises that Lupus may be mild, but can be disabling and sometimes fatal, causing many different symptoms including joint and muscle pain, fatigue, depression and kidney, heart, lung and brain involvement as well as miscarriages; acknowledges that there is an urgent need to increase awareness worldwide of the debilitating impact of Lupus; supports Lupus organisations around the globe in calling for increases in funding for medical research on Lupus, targeted education programmes for health professionals and the public and worldwide recognition of lupus as a significant health issue, and welcomes the setting up of a Cross Party Group on Lupus in the Scottish Parliament.
