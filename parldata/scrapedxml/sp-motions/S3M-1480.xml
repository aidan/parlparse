*S3M-1480 Duncan McNeil: Damian’s Law—That the Parliament is appalled that innocent individuals continue to be murdered in random unprovoked knife attacks in Scotland; shares the anger of the communities of Greenock and elsewhere that a number of these offences are committed by offenders with previous convictions for knife crime; regrets that, despite law reform and concerted efforts by the Scottish Executive, police and others, too many individuals still carry a weapon as a matter of course; agrees that knife-carriers need to be taught that their actions have consequences before they rob someone of their life, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to examine the imposition of mandatory custodial sentences for unlawful possession of knives and other bladed weapons as a matter of urgency.
