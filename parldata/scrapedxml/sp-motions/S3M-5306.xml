*S3M-5306 Johann Lamont: Support the Cross Out Child Poverty in Scotland Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes the Cross Out Child Poverty in Scotland campaign organised by Glasgow the Caring City; notes the campaign event at Cathcart Conversations on 29 November 2009, which secured support across parties, across faiths and from across Glasgow’s communities; welcomes the Cathcart Statement on Child Poverty, which reads "We, the undersigned believe that Scotland’s children deserve better. We believe that no society can be truly at ease with itself while significant numbers of children live in poverty. We believe that the elimination of child poverty must be a priority for us all - for politicians, community leaders and every member of society. We believe that poverty should be defined more widely than lack of money, that it encompasses a lack of education, of health, of welfare, of self-esteem and of love. We believe that poverty corrodes children’s health, their happiness, their safety and their aspirations. We recognise that children whose lives are blighted by poverty are at higher risk of educational failure. We recognise that a life lived in poverty can lead to a life of drug abuse and exploitation. We believe that only through the elimination of child poverty can we expect the children of Scotland to live their lives to the full, and to be able to enjoy the opportunities that the rest of society take for granted. We, the undersigned, believe the time for change is here."; supports the aim of the campaign, to end child poverty; believes that this campaign highlights the critical importance at all levels of government of tackling child poverty, which denies too many children the right to a safe and happy childhood and the opportunity to achieve their potential; recognises that a key strength of this campaign is its understanding of the need to reach out beyond government to individuals and families and communities; believes that such unity of purpose can challenge poverty, and believes that signing this statement will show a commitment to the future of all Scotland’s children and a determination to act on their behalf.
