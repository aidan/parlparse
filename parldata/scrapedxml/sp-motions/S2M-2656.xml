 * S2M-2656 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Shewalton Landfill—That the Parliament condemns the lack of transparency by North Ayrshire Council in its dealings over the new Shewalton landfill site development; further condemns the council’s lack of commitment and investment in alternative methods of waste disposal, and calls on the council to introduce an alternative waste disposal method as a matter of urgency and for an overhaul of its methods of releasing information to members of the community.
