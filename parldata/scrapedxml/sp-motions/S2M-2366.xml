*S2M-2366# Mark Ballard: Norwegian Smoking Ban Not Bad for Business—That the Parliament notes the forecast in Norway of an increase in the number of pub, bar and restaurant businesses that would face bankruptcies due to the introduction of a smoking ban in public places; notes that these fears have proved to be unfounded; notes that the number of pub, bar and restaurant businesses facing bankruptcy declined during the first seven months of the ban; believes that the introduction of a smoking ban in Scotland would not necessarily lead to increased bankruptcies in the bar, pub, hotel and restaurant industries, and congratulates Norway for achieving a reduction in adult smoking in every year since 1998.
