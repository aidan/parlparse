 *S3M-3274 Bill Wilson: Labour Party’s Attitude Towards Inquiry into Iraq—That the Parliament endorses the need for an inquiry into the serious allegations that Lord Bingham brought up, in his British Institute of International and Comparative Law lecture on 18 November 2008, concerning the legitimacy of the invasion of Iraq; notes that the need for an inquiry is supported by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives at Westminster; acknowledges that the alleged improprieties that led to the invasion of Iraq may have resulted in, according to a survey released in September 2007 by British polling organisation Opinion Research Business, a post-invasion excess mortality of over one million, and notes with incredulity the Labour Party’s enthusiasm for inquiries in the Scottish Parliament in light of its obstructionist attitude to an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Iraq war.
