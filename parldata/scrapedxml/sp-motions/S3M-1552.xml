 *S3M-1552 Bill Kidd: Anti-Semitic Blogging in National Newspapers—That the Parliament abhors the publication in both The Scotsman and The Herald newspapers’ online blogs of blatantly anti-Semitic rhetoric by individuals who hide their identities behind screen names; believes that any such racist statements have no place in national newspapers, in print or online, and calls on the editors of these two major newspapers to ensure that such foul-mouthed attacks on any section of society are removed from their blogs before publication.
