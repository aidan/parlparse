*S2M-3204# Murdo Fraser: Planning Applications for Wind Power Developmentsâ€”That the Parliament notes that 17 planning applications for onshore wind power developments have been referred to ministers on appeal after being refused by local authorities since 1999; is concerned at the high number of applications that are referred to ministers after they are democratically rejected at local level; believes that, when a rejected application is referred to ministers on appeal, the Scottish Executive should ensure that a public inquiry is held in order to have all issues considered and aired in public; further believes that all groups involved with wind farm applications, which include local authorities, community councillors, anti and pro-wind farm action groups, wind farm developers and the general public, agree that the current planning strategy and guidelines are inadequate, and considers that Scotland needs a national renewable energy strategy with up-to-date national guidelines for the siting of onshore wind farms.Supported by: Alex Johnstone*, Phil Gallie*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Derek Brownlee*
