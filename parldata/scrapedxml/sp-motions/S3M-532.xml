*S3M-532 Kenneth Gibson: 3TFM—That the Parliament congratulates the volunteers and board of directors, chaired by Louis Ferguson, of 3TFM on securing a community radio licence for the next five years, enabling it to broadcast to the three towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; notes that 3TFM is one of only four radio stations in the United Kingdom to have been awarded such a licence by Ofcom and the only one in Scotland; recognises that 3TFM will focus on improving the health and wellbeing of the communities it serves; is aware that 3TFM began in 2004 when determined volunteers with no previous broadcasting experience created a professional, well-run radio station sending out entertaining programmes with a health message, providing 672 hours of music over 28 days and training 150 volunteers, 30 live presenters and studio crew; notes that it will be live on the air from 17 November 2007 for 28 days in preparation for the new licence, and believes that the commitment, energy and enthusiasm of everyone at 3TFM will take the new station from strength to strength.
