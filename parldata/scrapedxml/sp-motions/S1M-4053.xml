*S1M-4053 Tommy Sheridan: Closure of Rankin Maternity Unit at Inverclyde Royal Hospital—That the Parliament notes the comments of Inverclyde GP Dr Mustafa Kapasi in the Big Issues in Scotland for 13 to 19 March 2003, in relation to the threatened closure of the 29-bed Rankin Maternity Unit at Greenock's Inverclyde Royal Hospital, that the closure plan was a "farce" and that "the maternity unit should remain in Inverclyde  It has the best safety record in Scotland. Paisley is a run-down hospital and for patients to be travelling 20-40 miles to reach it is a disaster"; further notes that GPs from both Inverclyde and Paisley unanimously voted in favour of the unit remaining in Greenock, and therefore resolves to support the local community and medical campaign to save the Rankin Maternity Unit from closure.
