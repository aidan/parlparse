 *S2M-1574# Ms Sandra White: Congratulations to Camcorder Guerillas-That the Parliament congratulates Camcorder Guerillas for the production of "Welcome", a film depicting the plight of asylum seekers in Glasgow who due to government policy are made homeless; notes that Glasgow City Council, whilst evicting asylum seekers from their homes, currently receives funding from the Home Office for houses earmarked for asylum seekers which in many cases are lying empty, and believes that, on humanitarian grounds, the Scottish Executive should enter into talks with the Home Office and Glasgow City Council to put an end to the practice of making asylum seekers homeless and take full responsibility for asylum seekers who are on Scottish soil.
