 *S3M-79# Sandra White: Read All About It—That the Parliament welcomes the recent launch of Local News for Westenders, which complements Local News for Southsiders, one of Glasgow’s most widely distributed free titles; congratulates Local News for Southsiders on its 10th birthday as a totally independent community newspaper, which is distributed at more than 300 busy public spots, from the Gorbals to Govan and from Pollok to Castlemilk; salutes the paper’s ethos of highlighting the positive things happening in the Southside and the successes of local people and businesses but without steering clear of controversy, and wishes it and the new arrival all the success in the future in providing an invaluable public service for communities.
