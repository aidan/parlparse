 *S3M-2011♦ Iain Smith: Enforcement of Planning Legislation—That the Parliament notes with concern the difficulties faced by planning authorities, such as Fife Council, in attempting to deal with breaches of planning legislation through enforcement and stop notices; considers that development without the appropriate planning approval undermines the rule of law and the planning process and that the present planning legislation does not provide a sufficient safeguard against unlawful development; believes that appeals against enforcement or stop notices should not be permitted on the grounds that planning permission for the development would have been granted or that a planning application for the development has been submitted; further believes that there should be a presumption against approval for any development that has been carried out without the appropriate planning approvals, and desires further debate on these proposals. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Mike Pringle*, Jim Tolson*, Robert Brown*, Alison McInnes*
