*S3M-2580 Bob Doris: Congratulations to Macom Technologies—That the Parliament welcomes the fact that Glasgow-based Scottish company Macom has entered into an agreement to provide hundreds of hi-tech components for wind turbines in the United States of America; acknowledges that Macom will supply TechAlert 10 sensors to Clipper Windpower, a fast-growing wind turbine manufacturer; understands that the TechAlert 10 sensors will monitor performance of wind turbines that will be deployed in the USA over the coming two years; views this as a demonstration of confidence in a Scottish company at the cutting edge of developing technology to tackle climate change; congratulates all involved in the development of this technology, which originated from the University of Edinburgh and shows that Scotland not only has vast amounts of renewable energy potential but also the expertise to tap into such renewable energy potential, and agrees with Jim Dehlsen of Clipper Windpower who said that "Scotland’s leadership in driving forward technologies in support of wind energy’s global expansion offers the potential of increased Scottish economic development, including new supply opportunities and associated jobs".
