*S3M-1260.2 Margaret Curran: Poverty—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1260) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "that tackling these challenges" to end and insert "; regrets that the SNP’s approach fails to respond to the needs of the poorest households in Scotland and fails to engage those groups experienced in tackling poverty in finding solutions, and believes that social justice is a priority for the Scottish people and should remain a central policy commitment of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament."
