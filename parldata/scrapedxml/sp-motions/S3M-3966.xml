 *S3M-3966 Alasdair Allan: St Kilda—That the Parliament notes plans to examine the feasibility of a new St Kilda visitor centre by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar; recognises the social and cultural significance of the United Kingdom’s only dual UNESCO world heritage site, which was permanently evacuated in August 1930, for future generations; further recognises that this comes following the inspiration of St Kilda – A European Opera, which was performed in 2007 simultaneously in the Western Isles, France, Belgium, Germany and Austria and which celebrated the history of the island and the hardship faced by the community; also notes moves to include St Kilda in the proposed Harris National Park due to the shared history of the people of St Kilda and Harris, and believes that St Kilda has a large part to play in the future economic wellbeing of the Western Isles.
