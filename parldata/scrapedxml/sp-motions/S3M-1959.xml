 *S3M-1959 Patrick Harvie: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill—That the Parliament notes the series of amendments to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill which sought to reduce the time limit for abortion and were considered by the House of Commons on 20 May 2008; recognises that, while legislation in this area is currently reserved to Westminster, the delivery of clinical services, health promotion and sex education are all devolved responsibilities; further notes that the outcome of the Commons votes makes it likely that the time limit for abortion will remain unchanged; understands the strength of feeling on both sides of the debate but believes that both supporters and critics of abortion are concerned to reduce the number of unnecessary abortions; recognises the clear evidence base from Europe and around the world showing that good quality sex education and the free availability of contraception and sexual health services are key factors in achieving reduced abortion rates as well as other improvements in sexual and reproductive health and rights, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring renewed focus to its work on sexual and reproductive health, including a greater emphasis on comprehensive sex education for all, and a continued commitment to individual empowerment and women’s reproductive rights. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Jamie Hepburn*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Robin Harper*, Bill Wilson*, Bill Kidd*
