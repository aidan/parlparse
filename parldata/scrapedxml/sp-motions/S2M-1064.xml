 *S2M-1064 Mrs Nanette Milne: Blood Donations in the Parliament-That the Parliament encourages the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to make facilities available to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) to hold regular donor sessions for, specifically, MSPs and parliamentary staff; notes that the new policy of not accepting blood from donors who have received a blood transfusion since 1 January 1980 is likely to result in a loss of around four per cent of current donations; is concerned that, with secondary effects, this figure could increase to 10 per cent; welcomes the new initiative by SNBTS to recruit new donors and launch a new high profile media campaign later this year, and believes that the Parliament is in a unique position to be able to take the lead on the issue at a crucial time for securing national blood supplies.
