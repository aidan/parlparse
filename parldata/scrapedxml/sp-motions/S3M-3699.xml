 *S3M-3699♦ Nigel Don: Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive—That the Parliament believes that retained firefighters provide an invaluable service to communities across Scotland, particularly those in remote and rural areas, such as the north east and Highlands and Islands; believes that setting a 48-hour maximum to the working week as currently proposed in relation to retained firefighters could greatly reduce the hours for which they would be available for duty, to the detriment of fire services in many remote and rural communities; recognises the concerns raised by the Retained Firefighters Union in relation to the recent European Parliament vote to end the UK opt-out to the EU working time directive; agrees with the STUC and Fire Brigades Union that, as the issue is now subject to negotiations at European level, there is no immediate threat to fire provision, and hopes that the mature and responsible joint efforts by the Scottish and UK governments will ensure that any future changes to the EU working time directive ensure the flexibility required to allow the continuation of retained firefighters and the protection of workers’ rights.
