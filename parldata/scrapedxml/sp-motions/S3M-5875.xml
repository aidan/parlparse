*S3M-5875 Jackie Baillie: Keep the Early Intervention and Network Support Teams in West Dunbartonshire—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council to disband the acclaimed early intervention and network support teams; acknowledges that the early intervention team has played a lead role in tackling illiteracy in West Dunbartonshire and has received national and international praise for the results that it has achieved; further acknowledges the work of the network support team in assisting children with special needs to access the curriculum; understands that West Dunbartonshire Council plan to carry out this budget cut without any further consultation or discussion; believes that cutting the early intervention and network support teams would have a negative impact and could jeopardise the future of young children in West Dunbartonshire, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to intervene to encourage West Dunbartonshire Council to drop the proposal to disband the early intervention and network support teams immediately.
