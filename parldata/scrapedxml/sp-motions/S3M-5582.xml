 *S3M-5582 Cathy Jamieson: Queen Margaret Academy, Ayr, and Scotwest Credit Unionâ€”That the Parliament commends pupils and staff at Queen Margaret Academy in Ayr who have worked with Scotwest Credit Union to set up a credit union branch in the school; notes that this branch is open to all 600 pupils in the school, that it is operated by pupils on a voluntary basis, allowing them to gain experience of financial services and work towards recognised qualifications, and that it also offers an option for pupils to save for a school trip to Holland next June, and calls on the Scottish Government to encourage and support similar initiatives in other schools.
