 *S1M-1656.1 Mr Jack McConnell: Future of Scottish Education—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1656) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "which could result in" to end and insert "; believes that world class education is essential to give every child the best possible start in life and is critical to the future prosperity of Scotland; welcomes the clear vision that puts the interests of the child at the centre of the improvement of Scottish education embodied in the Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. Act 2000; and recognises the clear priority which the Executive has given to raising standards and promoting ambition for all."
