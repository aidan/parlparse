*S2M-3371 Bill Butler: The Deportation of Drumchapel High School Pupils—That the Parliament expresses its deep regret at the deportation of Drumchapel High School pupils, Nimet and Saida Vucaj, on Thursday 29 September 2005 to Kosovo from London Stansted Airport following the rejection of their family’s asylum application; deprecates the insensitive manner in which immigration officials apparently handled this part of the process; expresses its sympathy for the pupils and staff of Drumchapel High School whose feelings of anger and dismay at this appalling news regarding what has happened to their friends and fellow pupils can scarcely be imagined; acknowledges the First Minister’s commitment, expressed in the Parliament on 22 September 2005, to initiate discussions with the Home Office to agree a protocol which will cover all removals of children and young people in Scotland, and exhorts the Scottish Executive as a matter of urgency, given this recent distressing case, to expedite the formulation of such a protocol with Westminster and negotiate a moratorium on any further such dawn raids until such a protocol has been agreed.
