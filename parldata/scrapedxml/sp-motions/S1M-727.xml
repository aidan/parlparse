*S1M-727 Mr Adam Ingram: Opencast Mining and Public Safety—That the Parliament notes with alarm an incident, over 25–26 March, in which a massive landslide at an opencast mining site in New Cumnock moved more than half a mile after the collapse of an earth-mound; further notes that in the opinion of the mining company responsible, such landslips "happen day and daily because of wet weather"; believes that the current national planning policy guidelines which stipulate a minimum distance of 500 metres between opencast workings and housing settlements is completely unsatisfactory and does not protect the safety of the public, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to review this guideline immediately and undertake an assessment of all other opencast mineworkings to determine if houses or settlements could be in danger from potential landslips. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Mr Gil Paterson*, Alex Neil*, Christine Grahame*, Michael Matheson*, Linda Fabiani*, Irene McGugan*, Mr Lloyd Quinan*, Fiona Hyslop*
