*S3M-6950 Rob Gibson: Celebrate Blas Festival 2010—That the Parliament congratulates the Blas Festival 2010 for celebrating Scotland’s Gaelic-based musical heritage in more than 30 venues from Caithness to Lochaber and Skye to Strathspey; notes the essential engagement of the local community organisers in collaborating to deliver the Highland-wide programme; celebrates the quality of homegrown, traditional musicians of all ages who deliver such a varied programme and welcomes the inclusion of Irish and Cape Breton musicians in the mix; encourages the Blas Festival to build on the multiple-venue model and on the enthusiasm of musicians and audiences, and calls on non-governmental sponsors who value Scotland’s lively traditional culture to help ensure the life of the Blas Festival in future years, which are likely to see major cuts in central and local government funding.
