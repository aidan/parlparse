*S3M-2299 Dr Richard Simpson: Funding for Data Sharing Partnerships—That the Parliament notes the cut by two-thirds in Scottish Government funding via the Transformational Technologies Division (TTD) to the 14 Data Sharing Partnerships (DSP) and the proposed ending of all TTD funding for 2009-10; believes that the delivery of data sharing is central to delivery of the Parliament’s and Scottish Government’s priorities in support of vulnerable adults and children facing difficulties in families with drug, alcohol, mental health or other problems; further notes that the DSPs will now have to apply to 32 local authorities and 14 NHS boards, including submitting separate draft plans and programmes for each authority, and all for only £150,000 each; condemns this as a massive loss of efficiency, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that these programmes are not disrupted by ensuring that they are part of every local authority single outcome agreement and NHS board accountability review.
