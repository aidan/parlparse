*S2M-5691 Fergus Ewing: Rural Postcodes—That the Parliament notes that Parcelforce imposes a separate regime of charges for the Highlands and Islands which it classifies as Zone 2, while England, Wales and other parts of Scotland are in Zone 1; further notes that these charges are considerably higher in Zone 2 than in Zone 1; notes with concern that, in response to Aviemore and Vicinity Community Council pursuing this issue, Jim Fitzpatrick MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment Relations and Postal Services at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has indicated that he approves of these extra charges; considers that the UK Government therefore acquiesces in the higher charges imposed for one area of the United Kingdom, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Parcelforce and to the DTI to end this discriminatory treatment.
