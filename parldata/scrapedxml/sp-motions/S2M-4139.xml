*S2M-4139 Shiona Baird: Scottish Marine Energy Industry on the ROCs?—That the Parliament notes with concern the warning from the fledgling Scottish marine renewables industry that the Renewables Obligation Scotland, the market mechanism that could drive the expansion of the marine renewable energy industry, must be urgently amended if Scotland is to maintain its leading position in this field;  congratulates Ocean Power Delivery (OPD) on the export of its Pelamis wave power device to Portugal in a deal worth £50 million, but shares OPD’s regret that its first commercial contract to generate electricity was not in Scotland; acknowledges the World Energy Council’s estimate that the global wave energy market is worth £500 billion and therefore finds it difficult to reconcile the Scottish Executive’s failure to support adequately the marine renewables industry with the Executive’s claim that its top priority is growing the Scottish economy, and calls on the Executive to recognise the dangers faced by the Scottish marine renewables industry and to take immediate steps to ensure that this golden opportunity is not lost to Scotland.
