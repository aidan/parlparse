*S1M-437.2 Roseanna Cunningham: Tackling Drug Misuse in Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S1M-437) in the name of Angus MacKay, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "recognises that there is neither a single drug problem nor a single solution; is concerned that at present there are insufficient resources available to those who desire to address the problems of addiction; welcomes the contribution which can be made to the debate by reference to international experience and, accepting that a cross-cutting approach is required to deal with the challenge posed to society by substance abuse, agrees to reflect that in the Parliament itself by the establishment of a Substance Misuse Strategy Committee which would facilitate the multi-agency debate required."
