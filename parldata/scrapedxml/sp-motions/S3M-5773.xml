 * S3M-5773 Jackie Baillie: Fyneview Respite House—That the Parliament is concerned by Argyll and Bute Council’s proposal to close Fyneview Respite House in Lochgilphead; understands that Fyneview Respite House is one of the very few respite options available to carers in Argyll and Bute; further understands that the carers strategy was underpinned by a funding package to achieve appropriate local provision for respite to support carers in their role and believes that it would be wrong to allow this money to be swallowed up into savings, and therefore calls on Argyll and Bute Council to continue supporting Fyneview Respite House.
