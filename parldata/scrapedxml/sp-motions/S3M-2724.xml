*S3M-2724 Ken Macintosh: Support the Lessons from Auschwitz Project—That the Parliament notes that 16 October 2008 marks the last visit to Auschwitz organised and subsidised by the Holocaust Educational Trust and supporting school pupils to fly directly from Scotland; recognises the importance of successive generations learning about one of the most horrific crimes in human history; appreciates the impact that such trips have had on young people across Scotland, including those from Fife who organised the Anne Frank and You festival in Kirkcaldy marking Holocaust Memorial Day 2007; notes the renewed funding granted by UK ministers to allow two pupils from every school in England and Wales to continue to benefit from this moving and memorable experience, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its approach to Holocaust education and to match the UK Government’s funding in this devolved area of responsibility so that Scottish pupils can also continue to learn the "Lessons from Auschwitz".
