*S2M-2614 Christine Grahame: People’s Victory for Borders Rail—That the Parliament notes the recent funding announcement by the Scottish Executive following a petition signed by thousands in support of the Waverley Line and unanimous support from the Scottish Parliament in June 2000 for full reinstatement of the line from Edinburgh to Carlisle; recognises that this latest announcement represents a people’s victory for everyone from Campaign for Borders Rail to individuals such as Madge Elliot from Hawick, and calls on the Executive to ensure that the track for the railway is laid from the Borders towards Edinburgh in recognition of the sustained efforts of Borderers to right this historic wrong.
