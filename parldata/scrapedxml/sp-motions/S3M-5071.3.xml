*S3M-5071.3 Andy Kerr: The Scottish Economy—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5071) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "notes the concern of Scotland’s business organisations that the Scottish Government’s budget fails to prioritise sustainable economic growth, as the Scottish Government has made substantial cuts to the enterprise, tourism, regeneration and housing budgets and has decided to cancel the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, a decision that was taken without prior consultation, despite the fact that it is an infrastructure project of national importance; believes that all of these decisions compound the failure of the Scottish Futures Trust to deliver capital investment, to the detriment of jobs and infrastructure, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward new proposals to create jobs, increase infrastructure investment and grow the Scottish economy."
