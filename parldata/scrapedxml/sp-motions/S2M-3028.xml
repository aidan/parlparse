 * S2M-3028 Richard Baker: Met Office, Aberdeen—That the Parliament notes with concern the Met Office’s proposals to close its Aberdeen Office and centralise forecasting services in Exeter; notes the vital contribution that the Aberdeen Office and its 37 staff make to the fishing, oil and gas industries in the north east; notes the concerns expressed by trade unions, the UK Offshore Operators Association and the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation over the proposals; believes that the local knowledge and expertise that the Aberdeen Met Office staff have is invaluable; calls on the Met Office to use the consultation period to reconsider the proposal, and believes that all interested parties should work together to ensure that there is no reduction in the quality of localised weather forecasting in Scotland.
