*S1M-3871# Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow City Council Against Pre-Emptive Attack on Iraq-That the Parliament applauds the anti-war initiative of Glasgow City Council in launching a petition opposed to war with Iraq; recognises the unanimous support of all five political parties represented on the council for this petition and the resolution passed by the council on 30 January 2003 which reads "The Council considers that a pre-emptive attack on Iraq is neither necessary nor justified and that it would produce incalculable risks to international peace and stability. The Council further considers that British participation in such an attack would be likely to have seriously damaging effects on Glasgow's social and economic welfare and to endanger the safety of its citizens. The Council accordingly calls upon Her Majesty's Government not to commit British Forces to a pre-emptive attack on Iraq."; notes that the petition allows the citizens of Glasgow to register their support or opposition to a war led by President Bush and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and supports the council's resolution and opposes a pre-emptive attack on Iraq.
