 * S2M-2921 Mike Rumbles: UK Government Smoking U-Turnâ€”That the Parliament notes reports that the UK Government is considering a U-turn on its refusal to ban smoking in all enclosed public places; notes that Scotland is putting health promotion at the top of the agenda with a total ban on smoking in enclosed public places being introduced in 10 months, compared to the current unworkable compromise which will be introduced in three years in England, and calls on the UK Government to follow the lead that Scotland, as well as many other countries throughout the world, is setting on banning smoking in public places.
