*S1M-408.2 Fiona Hyslop: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S1M-408) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the Executive’s proposals to achieve this through a range of measures, including the introduction of a single social tenancy, the development of a single regulatory framework for social housing, the promotion of a stronger strategic role in housing for local authorities, and a new role and status for Scottish Homes, but believes that these measures alone will not improve the position of Scotland’s 80000 homeless people and that the Executive must give greater priority to dealing with chronic under investment in Scotland’s public and voluntary housing including the reversal of their policy of wholesale stock transfer."
