*S2M-4434# Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Fife’s Coastline—That the Parliament recognises that Fife has some of the most beautiful coastline in Scotland; further recognises that the Scottish Executive has made efforts to clean up our coasts and seas, particularly through the Scottish Coastal Forum; recognises that the local tourism industry depends on Fife having clean beaches and seas; understands that there is much work still to be done and that some of our coastline is still littered with rubbish and other pollution, and considers that the Executive and other relevant public agencies should redouble their efforts in cleaning up the coastline and seas for our own quality of life, for tourism, for wildlife and for future generations.
