 *S3M-4626 Richard Baker: Granite City Graduates Come Out on Top—That the Parliament welcomes the recently published findings of the Higher Education Statistics Agency detailing graduate employment rates that show that job prospects for granite city graduates are among the best in the United Kingdom; notes that graduates’ job prospects differ from university to university; agrees that Aberdeen’s two universities are among Britain’s best and are in Scotland’s top three universities for progression into further study and employment, with 98% of Robert Gordon University graduates and 96.7% of University of Aberdeen graduates in employment or further study within six months of graduating in 2007-08; notes that these figures are higher than those of Oxford, Cambridge and the majority of Scottish institutions, and congratulates Aberdeen’s two universities for delivering a world-class student experience and excellent learning environment for students, helping them to develop crucial skills that make them more employable and able to compete in an increasingly competitive job market.
