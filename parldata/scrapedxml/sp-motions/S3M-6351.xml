*S3M-6351 Pauline McNeill: Concern over Proposed Cuts at the University of Glasgow’s Faculty of Biomedical Sciences—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal to cut 18 posts out of a total of 60 at the University of Glasgow’s Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, which it considers will result in major gaps in the structure of courses and reduce the availability of specialist teaching; acknowledges the importance of teaching that the faculty undertakes for the medical school and other key departments within the university; believes that this action by the university is unjustified in relation to its overall budget; is further concerned about the overall impact of the job losses on the long-term future of the faculty; commends the staff and students who are campaigning against this plan, and calls on the University of Glasgow to reconsider this plan.
