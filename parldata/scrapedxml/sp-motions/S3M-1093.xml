*S3M-1093 Sandra White: Energy Sector Social Tariffs—That the Parliament expresses concern that the rise in cost of wholesale supplies to the energy market will result in large increases in domestic prices, which will place an unacceptable burden on the poorest and most vulnerable members of society, and believes that the forthcoming UK Energy Bill should include provision to commit energy companies to introducing social tariffs to protect people who are concerned that they will be unable to heat their homes.
