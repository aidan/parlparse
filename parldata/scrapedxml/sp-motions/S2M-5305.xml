 *S2M-5305 Tricia Marwick: Tysabri for People with MS—That the Parliament deplores the decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium not to recommend that Tysabri be prescribed to people with multiple sclerosis (MS); notes that, for a small number of those with the most aggressive from of relapsing-remitting MS for whom existing treatments do not work, Tysabri represents the only treatment available; notes that Tysabri is prescribed in Germany, Ireland and the United States of America but not in Scotland, which has the highest rate of MS in the world, and urges NHS boards in Scotland to allow the prescribing of Tysabri which had been described by Dr Gavin Giovannoni, of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, as the most significant advance in MS treatment for nearly a decade.
