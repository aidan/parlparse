*S2M-1336 Carolyn Leckie: Eurovision Song Contest-That the Parliament is concerned to note the successive failures of the British Eurovision song contest entry in recent years; believes that voting across Europe is related to the views of European people on Her Majesty's Government's role in the war on Iraq and on other issues, and further believes that a UK entry is unlikely to succeed as long as Her Majesty's Government continues with current foreign policy, that a Scottish entry is less likely to be tainted and that Scotland should be entitled to a separate Eurovision song contest entry.
