*S1M-2476 Mr Gil Paterson: White Ribbon Day - 25 November 2001—That the Parliament notes White Ribbon Day on 25 November 2001 and supports the Blow the Whistle on Violence Against Women event on that day; further notes that the White Ribbon is the international symbol of hope for a world where women and girls can live free from the fear of violence; recognises the difficulty Womankind Worldwide has had in finding a Scottish distributor for white ribbons this year, and hopes that this problem will be rectified in time for next year’s White Ribbon Day to help highlight the problem of violence against women and the cost of this to society.
