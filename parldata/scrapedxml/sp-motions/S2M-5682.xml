*S2M-5682u John Scott: Ending of Exemptions for Water and Sewerage Charges for Smaller Voluntary Organisations—That the Parliament notes the position of the Scottish Executive, as detailed in its Consultation Analysis of the Non-Household Water Charges - Changes to The Current Charging Arrangement, that it has no plans to extend beyond 2010 the exemption from water and sewerage charges granted to smaller voluntary organisations, or to establish a replacement for it when it expires; further believes that the ending of the exemption will place very considerable financial pressure on smaller voluntary organisations and churches in Ayrshire and across Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should extend the present exemption arrangements beyond 2010.
