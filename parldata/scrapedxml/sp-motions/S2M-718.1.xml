*S2M-718.1 Shona Robison: Reform of Public Services-As an amendment to motion (S2M-718) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "rejects the proposals by the Conservative Party to privatise our public services and deplores the continued use of PPP/PFI to fund our public services by the current Labour/Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive; believes that the developing crisis in the NHS will only be addressed by increasing the capacity of the NHS to treat more patients and reduce waiting times through effective policies to recruit and retain staff within the NHS in Scotland, and calls for a national debate on the way forward for the health service in Scotland."
