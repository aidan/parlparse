*S1M-683# Fergus Ewing: Edinburgh Marathon—That the Parliament believes that the 1999 Puma Edinburgh Marathon was a success generating over £600,000 in economic benefit for Fife and Edinburgh, regrets that Fife Council has, because of budget constraints, decided that it is unable to commit £100,000 towards the cost of running the event this year; believes that it is vital that the Edinburgh Marathon should continue as an international event and as such has a massive growth potential which would, with proper niche marketing, benefit the tourist economy to the tune of over £3 million pounds by the year 2002; invites the Scottish Executive to take urgent steps with a view to seeking to reverse the cancellation of the 2000 Puma Edinburgh Marathon and to provide this event with a secure future to benefit Scottish athletes including disabled athletes and also to benefit the tourist industry.
