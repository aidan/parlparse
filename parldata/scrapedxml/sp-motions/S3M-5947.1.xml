*S3M-5947.1 Dave Thompson: Housing Budget Cuts—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5947) in the name of Jamie Stone, leave out from "of the shortage" to end and insert "that the £120 million accelerated capital funding from the Scottish Government’s 2010 -11 budget into the 2008-09 and 2009 -10 budgets is now due to be paid back; regrets that the UK Government’s refusal to accelerate further spending into 2010 -11, while the Scottish economy is still recovering from an extreme economic downturn, will further constrain the Scottish Government’s ability to protect the Scottish economy from further damage due to the recession, and finally calls on the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who did not back the Scottish Government’s call for accelerated capital spending for the 2010 -11 financial year, to now join the Scottish Government in demanding no more cuts to the Scottish budget in any emergency budget following the UK general election."
