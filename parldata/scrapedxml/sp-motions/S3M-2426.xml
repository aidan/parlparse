 *S3M-2426 John Park: Impact of the Thatcher Government’s Economic Policies on Scotland—That the Parliament notes the comments by the First Minister suggesting that Scotland "didn’t mind" the Thatcher Conservative government’s economic policies; remembers with concern the misery experienced by the three million unemployed in the 1980s when the economic consequences of Thatcherism reached their nadir; understands the devastating impact that the Thatcher government’s policies had on mining, the steel industry, dockyards and communities across Scotland; further notes that the First Minister has also expressed support for Reaganomics; worries that supply-side economics, a largely discredited economic theory, could become a model for the Scottish economy, and hopes that the Scottish Government will not pursue a right-wing economic agenda at the expense of Scotland’s working people and their families.
