 *S2M-2001 Marlyn Glen: University of Dundee’s Prestigious Science Award—That the Parliament congratulates the University of Dundee on being recognised as the best science institution in Europe to conduct scientific research, according to a survey of scientists in The Scientist magazine; notes that this results from the university’s high-quality research facilities, the well-founded co-operation across scientific disciplines and the reputation for creativity; notes that this latest award builds upon its recognition as the "most quoted university in Europe" by the Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia’s research survey earlier this year, and further notes the University of Dundee’s valuable role as a worthy ambassador for the city of Dundee with its prolific production of scientific excellence.
