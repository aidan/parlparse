*S1M-3563 Irene McGugan: Mouth Cancer Awareness Week-That the Parliament recognises that the second Mouth Cancer Awareness Week runs from 10-16 November 2002; congratulates the Tayside Community Dental Service and other agencies throughout Scotland for their efforts to inform the public about this disease; notes with concern that in Scotland there are approximately 500 new cases of oral cancer and 250 deaths per year, that less than 50% of cases will survive five years and that the incidence of oral cancer is on the increase in younger people, and encourages the Scottish Executive to assist in raising public awareness of preventative measures such as giving up smoking, reducing alcohol consumption and, most importantly, visiting a dentist at least once a year.
