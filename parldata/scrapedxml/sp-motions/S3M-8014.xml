*S3M-8014 Dave Thompson: The People’s Bible—That the Parliament welcomes the initiative of the Scottish Bible Society to produce a People’s Bible as part of the 400th anniversary of the Bible commissioned by a Scottish king; welcomes the opportunity provided by the travelling road show in Scotland, England and Wales, to bring people together from diverse sections of our society as they transcribe verses from the Bible in their own handwriting; acknowledges that these handwritten passages will be reproduced online resulting in the entire Bible being available as a product of the people of today; hopes that this initiative may be a catalyst for a renewed interest in reading the scriptures for the participants, and encourages the spirit of religious tolerance throughout Scotland and indeed the United Kingdom as a whole.
