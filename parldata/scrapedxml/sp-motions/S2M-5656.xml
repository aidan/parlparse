*S2M-5656 Elaine Smith: Hilton Group Discrimination Against Cuba—That the Parliament regrets the decision of the Hilton hotel group to ban Cuban delegations from its global chain; expresses concern about remarks from a UK spokesperson for the Hilton group that Cubans may be banned from its London hotels; recognises that any such developments would violate domestic UK anti-discrimination laws and EU safeguards against the use of extra-territorial legislation and would be tantamount to a breach of UK sovereignty and an act of racial discrimination; believes that the Scottish Executive should liaise with the UK Government to request that it issues a public statement of opposition to any attempts by the Hilton group or any other US-owned multinational companies to enforce elements of the illegal US embargo of Cuba in the territory of the United Kingdom, and further expects that in the meantime the Executive and its agencies will not use any premises owned and operated by the Hilton group in Scotland for conferences, meetings and other such official functions until it is clarified that the group will not racially discriminate against Cuban nationals.
