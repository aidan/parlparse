*S3M-4216 Helen Eadie: Value of Public Spacesâ€”That the Parliament recognises the value of public spaces in encouraging a healthy keep-fit nation; supports people from across Scotland who are concerned at facing the potential loss of playing fields, including junior football parks such as that used by Lochgelly Albert, and hopes that the Scottish Government will issue guidance advising against further loss of public spaces as local plans are developed across Scotland.
