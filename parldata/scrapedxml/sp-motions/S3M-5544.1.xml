 *S3M-5544.1 Willie Coffey: Recognition of Council Workers’ Efforts during the Big Freeze—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5544) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from first "South Ayrshire" to end and insert "other local authority areas who made tremendous efforts to keep services going and respond to the public during the recent severe weather; considers that efforts to cope with the severe weather were hampered by the decision of the previous Labour/Liberal Democrat executive to privatise the maintenance of Scotland’s trunk roads, a decision condemned by the chairman of the Scottish Police Federation as having led to a reduced standard of winter maintenance; recalls that one of the few inputs by the Labour Party to the budget process for 2009-10 was a proposal to take £10 million out of the roads maintenance budget to fund air travel and that this was rightly rejected by every other party in the Parliament, and condemns the actions of members who supported these policies and have criticised the efforts of local councils during one of the most severe weather events of recent years."
