*S3M-7626 Karen Whitefield: Congratulations to Airdrie Academyâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Airdrie Academy on the annual school league tables recording what it considers to be an excellent performance by it over the past year; notes that the percentage of pupils awarded five or more Highers at grades A to C has doubled in the past year from 5 to 10%; further notes that almost a quarter of the relevant pupils achieved three or more Highers and that 40% gained at least one; considers that this constitutes an outstanding level of improvement and stands testament to the diligence and commitment of staff and pupils alike; fully expects that Airdrie Academy will continue to flourish over the coming year, and wishes everyone at the school every success in the future.
