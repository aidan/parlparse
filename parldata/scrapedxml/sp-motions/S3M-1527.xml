*S3M-1527 Stuart McMillan: FIFA President’s Olympic Football Team Comments—That the Parliament acknowledges FIFA President Sepp Blatter’s comments in the Sunday Herald on 9 March 2008 where he stated "When it comes to the Olympics there should be one team from one of the countries playing, and not a combination from all four" and that the inclusion of a UK football team in the 2012 Olympics would harm the four British football associations; believes that such a team would threaten the status of Scotland as an independent football nation; recognises the respective supporters’ associations and federations of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England are opposed to a UK team, and calls on the British Olympic Association to abandon its campaign to force the four UK football associations to amalgamate for the 2012 Olympics.
