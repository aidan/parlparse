*S2M-4679 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Travel Costs for Cancer Sufferers—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent Macmillan Cancer Support report which reveals that the most widespread cost facing cancer patients is the cost of travelling to and parking at hospital, that on average patients who incur these costs make 53 trips to hospital during the course of their treatment, spending approximately £325, and that far too many cancer patients are not made aware of the help that may be available to them, such as through the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme or the NHS Low Income Scheme; recognises that these extra costs come at a time when cancer patients and their families are already dealing with the strain of a cancer diagnosis and the debilitating effects of treatment; notes that 91% of cancer patients’ households suffer loss of income and/or increased costs as a direct result of cancer; acknowledges that there is an urgent need for a review of the financial assistance available for patients travelling for treatment, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to exempt cancer patients from hospital parking charges and to give cancer patients help with their travel costs.
