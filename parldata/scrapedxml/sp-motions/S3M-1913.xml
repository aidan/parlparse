*S3M-1913 Jamie Hepburn: Sistema Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the creation of Sistema Scotland, a charitable organisation that will work with young people in the Raploch area of Stirling, providing them with practical opportunities that they might not otherwise have had to learn how to play musical instruments; further welcomes that the children will all be provided with breakfast at Sistema Scotland’s first summer school; notes that the inspiration for the organisation comes from El Sistema in Venezuela, which has great experience in providing similar opportunities to some of that country’s poorest children; wishes the six professional musicians who will help run the programme in Raploch well as they learn more about how the sister programme has worked in Venezuela, and hopes that similar projects will be initiated across Scotland. Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham*, Aileen Campbell*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Alasdair Allan*, Sandra White*, Mike Pringle*, Alex Neil*, Bob Doris*, Patrick Harvie*, Kenneth Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Kidd*, Keith Brown*, Robin Harper*
