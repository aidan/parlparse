*S2M-4703 Elaine Smith: Positive Engagement towards Cuba—That the Parliament extends its regards to Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Republic of Cuba, on the occasion of his 80th birthday on 13 August 2006; notes his current ill-health and wishes him a speedy recovery; is concerned by reports which show that UK exports to Cuba have decreased by 48% since 2000 whilst trade has been increasing between Cuba and other EU countries during this period; deplores the illegal US blockade of Cuba, including the recent tightening of extra-territorial elements which directly affect relations between the European Union and Cuba; calls on the Scottish Executive to explore options for strengthening relations between Scotland and Cuba through cultural, scientific, sporting and trade links, and considers that the Executive should urge Her Majesty’s Government to maintain and develop its independent approach of positive engagement towards Cuba.
