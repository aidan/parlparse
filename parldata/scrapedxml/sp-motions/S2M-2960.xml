 * S2M-2960 Chris Ballance: Commemoration of Spanish Civil War Veteran, George Dickie—That the Parliament supports the calls of Whithorn and District Business Association to commemorate the Spanish Civil War veteran, George Dickie; applauds the bravery and commitment of all those volunteers who fought to halt the rise of fascism in Spain, and believes that, but for the crippling injuries he sustained fighting Franco’s forces, George Dickie would have shown the same bravery and commitment in resisting Hitler’s attempt to subjugate Europe in 1939 and that he is worthy of being commemorated.
