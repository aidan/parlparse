 *S3M-4429 Kenneth Gibson: Sizewell Nuclear Leak—That the Parliament expresses its grave concern at the long-overdue disclosure of unauthorized radioactive release from Sizewell nuclear power station, exposing the site’s culture of non-compliance and absolute negligence; is appalled that such a sensitive facility would operate in a seemingly non-existent control environment where proper training and nuclear site licence conditions have been set aside; is aware that leaking radioactive material was detected only when a contractor went to wash laundry and that this chance discovery led to the prevention of the irradiated fuel becoming uncovered and a potential airborne off-site release; finds it beyond belief that a nuclear disaster was averted only by pure luck and that public safety should be dependent on fortuitous events; considers that the power plant’s pond system pipe work was mistakenly constructed with simple PVC pipe and wonders why this serious anomaly was not discovered at any time during the 40-year life of the plant or during the safety reviews after two similar accidents; considers that this highlights a disturbingly endless trend of alarm failure and ignorance at Sizewell; acknowledges that the central processing unit (CPU) controlling the alarm system had failed, resulting in a standing alarm, which sounded for two days without anybody recording it in a log or investigating; believes that the relay-based alarm system was poorly installed and never actually operational, the pond level alarm was incorrectly modified and would not have worked if pond level detectors had tried to initiate it and that a fluid detection system should have sounded an alarm from the pipe’s discharge but at the time the system was not fully installed; regrets that all these alarms were of little consequence because the alarm’s computer software was also found to be malfunctioning and that, even if the software and alarms had operated properly, they would have been masked by the CPU’s standing alarm, which was being ignored in the master control room; further regrets that a nuclear power station, built with substantial public investment and potentially representing a significant health risk, would be operated with ignorance of standing alarms, failure of inspection and oversight and shrouded in secrecy; considers that UK ministers would prefer to ignore freedom of information requests while spending their time promoting a generation of new reactors; insists that the UK Government allay suspicion of similarly undisclosed accidents by ending this ongoing lack of disclosure, and hopes that UK ministers will recognise the wisdom, foresight and public benefit of clean, green energy sources, which seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, have been ignored.
