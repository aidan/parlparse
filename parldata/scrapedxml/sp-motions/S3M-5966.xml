S3M-5966 George Foulkes: Credit Union to Branch out across the Lothiansâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the news that Craigmillar Credit Union is extending its low-cost loans and savings scheme to almost 50,000 people by including the Duddingston, Portobello, Craigentinny, Willowbrae and Restalrig areas; supports the volunteers who run the credit union in their objective to double its membership over the next three years; wishes the two-month trial of a new collection point in Portobello every success, and continues to offer support to what it sees as an ethical alternative to mainstream banking that more and more people are choosing to invest in. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson, Bill Butler, Jackie Baillie, Bill Kidd, Trish Godman, Mary Mulligan, James Kelly, Mr Frank McAveety, Robin Harper, Shirley-Anne Somerville, Jamie Hepburn, Dr Richard Simpson, Ian McKee, Karen Whitefield, Sarah Boyack, Ken Macintosh, Elaine Smith, Cathy Peattie*
