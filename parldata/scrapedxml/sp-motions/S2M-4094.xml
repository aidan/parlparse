*S2M-4094 Jackie Baillie: Scottish Paramedic Relief Squad—That the Parliament welcomes the proposal to establish a Scottish paramedic relief squad, able to be deployed as a rapid response team at home or abroad in response to emergencies from communities and countries facing the immediate aftermath of disaster or tragedy; acknowledges that this will fill the void for on-the-scene medical care and transfer, complementing the work of international medical aid agencies; congratulates Jimmy McGrath, Gordon McNeil and Garry Fraser, who are paramedics, for developing this proposal; firmly believes that the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Scottish Executive should support the establishment of a Scottish paramedic relief squad as an additional valuable contribution to our international aid efforts, and, in particular, strongly encourages the Executive to consider providing assistance with equipment, training and start-up costs.
