 *S2M-2081 Mr Brian Monteith: Gritting on Stirling’s Roads—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive’s decision not to allow the additional capital funding for safety-related school transport projects announced by the Minister for Transport on 4 November 2004 to be used on precautionary winter gritting of school bus routes; believes that the lack of any precautionary gritting on school bus routes is an issue of concern for several communities in the Stirling area, not least because of incidents that occurred last winter at Fintry and the Carron Valley where school transport was disrupted by treacherous road conditions; acknowledges that 300 people in Fintry alone signed a petition on this very issue earlier this year; believes that gritting school bus routes is about providing pupils with safer routes to school, and calls on the Executive to allow local authorities the flexibility to determine how best to spend additional roads funding to reflect local circumstances, such as severe road conditions.
