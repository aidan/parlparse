*S3M-2951 Aileen Campbell: UK Fails in Duties Under the Ottawa Convention—That the Parliament notes the publication of the Landmine Monitor 2008 by the Nobel Peace Prize winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which confirms that the UK Government has failed in its duty, under the Ottawa Convention on landmines, to clear the Falkland Islands of such munitions; further notes that the UK Government has already applied for an additional 10 years in which to complete this process; shares the ICBL’s belief that this lack of progress is disappointing, and calls on the UK Government to set a firm deadline for clearing the Falkland Islands of landmines.
