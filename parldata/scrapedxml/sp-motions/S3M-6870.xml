*S3M-6870 Hugh O’Donnell: International Day of the Disappeared, 30 August 2010—That the Parliament commends the work of the British Red Cross and the other organisations involved in tracing those people who are missing and in trying to restore family links across the world; recognises that every year people go missing as a result of conflicts and natural disasters and sombrely notes how enforced disappearances can arise through abduction or imprisonment; remembers those who are missing and the family and friends trying to trace their loved ones, and believes that on 30 August 2010, the International Day of the Disappeared, we should remember those who are missing and support the work in tracing them in any we can.
