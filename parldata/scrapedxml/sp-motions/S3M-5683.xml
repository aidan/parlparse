*S3M-5683 Dave Thompson: Gaelic Promotion, Not Proscription—That the Parliament deplores the statements made by Highland Labour Councillor Deirdre Mackay that condemned Highland Council’s efforts to provide accommodation and teaching for pupils in Gaelic-medium schools and considers them ill-informed; distances itself from her criticisms of efforts to support one of Scotland’s native tongues, which many view as having suffered discrimination for centuries; condemns her negative comments toward Gaelic plans introduced by the previous Labour/Liberal Democrat-led Scottish Executive; calls on Labour MSPs to disassociate themselves from what could be viewed as thinly disguised racism; supports promotion of Gaelic, not proscription, and congratulates Highland Council for working to increase provision of Gaelic-medium education at schools across the Highlands.
