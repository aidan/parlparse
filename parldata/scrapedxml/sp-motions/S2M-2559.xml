 * S2M-2559 Rob Gibson:Clearances Denial—That the Parliament notes with astonishment recent claims by “historian” Michael Fry, previewing his forthcoming book, that the Highland clearances were a myth; questions the author’s selective use of source material; deplores his assertion that the Sutherland clearances were an early example of deliberate displacement of people similar to the housing policies of the post-World War Two Labour government, and recognises that throughout the Highlands and Islands many thousands of people were forcibly evicted from their ancestral lands and that depopulated glens, straths and islands remain a testament to those clearances to this day.
