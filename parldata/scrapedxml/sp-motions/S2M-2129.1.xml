 *S2M-2129.1 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Fisheriesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2129) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "an outcome" to end and insert "urges the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to secure higher quotas and more days at sea to secure a future for our fishermen and their coastal communities, accompanied by an end to the discredited haddock permit scheme with no new restrictions for the nephrops sector, and calls on the Executive to support the view of the vast majority of Scottish fishermen that it is time to end the discredited Common Fisheries Policy and to regain national control of UK waters".
