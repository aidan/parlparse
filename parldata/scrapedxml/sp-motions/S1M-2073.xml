*S1M-2073# Dennis Canavan: Scottish Transport Group Pension Funds Surplus—That the Parliament notes the recent revelation by the Scottish Executive that the total gross surplus in the Scottish Transport Group Pension Funds is likely to be of the order of £250 million, of which about £150 million may be claimed by the UK Exchequer; recalls that last year about 100 members of the Scottish Parliament signed Dennis Canavan’s motion S1M-1096, calling for urgent action to be taken in order to secure the maximum possible benefit for the pensioners from the Pension Funds surplus, and therefore calls for the entire surplus to be paid to the pensioners as soon as possible.
