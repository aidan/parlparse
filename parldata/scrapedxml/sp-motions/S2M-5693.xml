*S2M-5693 Donald Gorrie: Disability Payments by Glasgow City Council—That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of Glasgow City Council to withdraw the £4.00 per month payments to adults with learning disabilities who attend the council’s day centres; believes that this small payment represented a wage and added much-needed self-esteem to some of the most disadvantaged people in our society and was a means of providing a small degree of independence for users of the service; calls on the council to reconsider its decision, and notes that the financial savings of approximately £42,000 to the council will not even cover the cost of the retirement party which the city is hosting for its departing councillors.
