*S2M-4018 Richard Lochhead: Labour Party’s New Policy on Nuclear Power—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision taken by the Labour Party in Scotland at its Aviemore conference to support the building of new nuclear power stations in Scotland; further notes that this decision was taken in the run-up to the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster; believes the decision was taken as a result of pressure from UK Ministers in London to support nuclear power; further believes that, rather than opt for new nuclear power stations and a dangerous, dirty and expensive technology, Scotland should instead be doing everything possible to promote our nation as a centre of excellence for genuinely clean and safe energy technologies, and further believes that Labour’s support for nuclear can only undermine efforts to turn Scotland into a renewables powerhouse.
