*S2M-4781 Frances Curran: Scotland’s 10-Year Health Failure—That the Parliament notes the review of the Scottish Diet Action Plan which has found that, despite numerous high-profile and costly information and advertising campaigns, the Scottish diet is today just as bad as it was 10 years ago; further notes that the bright spot on the horizon is the suggestion that healthier school meals and the introduction of free fruit in schools is beginning to alter children’s eating habits but it is not enough as less than half our children take school meals; believes that the introduction of free healthy schools meals for all pupils 10 years ago would have had a big impact on the eating habits of a new generation; considers that the evidence is there internationally that Scotland needs less talk and more action; further considers that the introduction of free healthy school meals for all children would be a first important step to improving the health of our children and the next generation of adults, and believes that MSPs need to support this initiative now as we are running out of time.
