*S3M-5682 Robert Brown: United Kingdom Supreme Courtâ€”That the Parliament notes that the United Kingdom Supreme Court, established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, commenced its duties on 1 October 2009, and took over the previous jurisdiction of the (a) House of Lords as a court of final appeal in Scottish civil cases and (b) Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for devolution issues; welcomes the publication of the report, Final Appellate Jurisdiction in the Scottish Legal System, by Professor Neil Walker, which followed a request by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to examine the issue; considers that the issue of final appellate jurisdiction must be considered in the context of the broader constitutional settlement across the various parts of the UK; recognises that the UK Supreme Court now has a significant constitutional law function; welcomes in particular the option for restructuring the UK Supreme Court as a final appeal court along quasi-federal lines, which is described by Professor Walker as "the most acute in its diagnosis and most sensitive to the relevant values at stake"; notes that the report recommends this option as being the most attractive reform option under the present constitutional settlement, and urges the UK and Scottish governments to take forward the development of the UK Supreme Court in this fashion as best matching the needs of the Scottish legal system and the citizens whom it serves.
