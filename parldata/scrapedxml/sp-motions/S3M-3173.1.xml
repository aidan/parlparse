*S3M-3173.1 John Park: Homecoming and its Potential to Support Sustainable Economic Growth—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3173) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from first "recognises" to end and insert "welcomes and supports the calendar of events and activities taking place this year from the weekend around Burns Night to St Andrew’s Day; recognises that this will make for a unique year for all those joining the celebrations, including the people living in Scotland, the diaspora Scots and those with an affinity for Scotland who visit in 2009, and calls on Scottish ministers to maximise the potential for Homecoming Scotland 2009 to boost international and domestic tourism in support of the Scottish economy by restoring full access to apprenticeships in the tourism and hospitality industries, bringing an end to uncertainty around future funding of Scots language and arts organisations and detailing how they will measure the contribution of Homecoming Scotland 2009 to supporting sustainable economic growth in the course of this year and beyond."
