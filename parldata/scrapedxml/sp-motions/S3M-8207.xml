*S3M-8207 Elaine Smith: Community Youth Rugby—That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) on the work that it does in promoting rugby in communities; recognises the importance of sport in promoting active and healthy lifestyles in young people; considers that it is crucial that any investment in rugby via the CashBack for Communities initiative is spent fairly in all areas throughout Scotland where youth rugby is being nurtured; welcomes the SRU primary after-school club for all pupils in Coatbridge, which can be a helpful stepping stone between school and club rugby; considers that Charles Fawcett of the Healthy Lifestyle Project in Coatbridge is undertaking excellent work in promoting community rugby and commends him for it; congratulates the community youth rugby S3/4 team on its achievements to date, and wishes it every success in the future.
