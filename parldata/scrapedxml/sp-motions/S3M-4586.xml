 *S3M-4586 Malcolm Chisholm: School Closures in North Edinburgh and Leithâ€”That the Parliament is concerned by the proposal to close Royston Primary School and Fort Primary School in the Edinburgh North and Leith constituency; notes that the average number of pupils per primary school in Edinburgh is already the second highest in Scotland; is dismayed that almost two thirds of the proposed revenue savings from primary school closures in Edinburgh are stated by the council to arise from reducing staff costs; believes that closures will therefore increase class sizes and pupil teacher ratios, and calls on the council to concentrate instead on reversing the decline in teacher numbers in Edinburgh and recognising the important and successful role that Royston and Fort primaries play in their respective communities.
