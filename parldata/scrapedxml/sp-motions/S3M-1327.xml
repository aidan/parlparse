 *S3M-1327 Ian McKee: Scottish Science Funding Crisis—That the Parliament notes with concern the funding crisis at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), the effects of which, as well as reductions in new physics grants for Scotland’s universities, will see reductions in funding for the United Kingdom Astronomy Technology Centre (UKATC) by 50% over the next three years; recognises that this funding has been vital to the continued existence of these organisations which have been responsible for many world-leading instruments for the world’s astronomers, have pioneered the successful Dark Sky Scotland scheme and have provided support to hundreds of science teachers to encourage young people in Scotland into science; deplores the actions of the STFC in disproportionately reducing the funding in Scotland, and calls on MPs at Westminster to reassess the funding for science in Scotland.
