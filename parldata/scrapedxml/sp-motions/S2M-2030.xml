*S2M-2030 Carolyn Leckie: Appointment of Condoleezza Rice as US Secretary of State—That the Parliament expresses its ever-increasing concern at US foreign policy and the danger that it poses to the world; believes that the resignation of Colin Powell and the appointment of Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State signals a ratcheting-up of aggressive imperialist intention and action on the part of the United States of America; believes that millions of people across the world are now in greater danger than they were before the wars on Afghanistan and Iraq; condemns the slaughter of Fallujah; recognises that bombs and blood increase terrorism and that the foreign occupation of Iraq has inevitably led to citizens taking up arms and the further waste of life of women, men and children in Iraq and of members of the armed forces; therefore condemns all acts of barbarism and brutality associated with the occupation; notes documentary evidence of US troops committing war crimes, including the execution of wounded prisoners, and believes that the only hope for a peaceful solution in Iraq is the withdrawal of all foreign occupying forces and that British forces should be brought home immediately, thus avoiding any further casualties.
