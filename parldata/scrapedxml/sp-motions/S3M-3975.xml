 *S3M-3975 Gavin Brown: Project Stedfast—That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in Project Stedfast and praises the role played by the group in raising approximately £100,000 to build a school in Kenya; notes that four boys’ brigades from the Lothians, the 51st Bonnyrigg, 1st Loanhead, 5th Livingston and 56th Edinburgh, were involved in the project; further notes that, due to the sterling efforts of all those involved in the project, youngsters in Kenya now have a new primary school with facilities for disabled people, where they can start their education and the local community has access to all the facilities at evenings and weekends, and believes that all those involved in Project Stedfast are a credit to Scotland.
