*S3M-2583 Alison McInnes: Aberdeenshire - Best Large Council to Work For—That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeenshire Council on being named Best Large Council to Work For in the United Kingdom; notes that it was the only Scottish local authority to finish in the top 25 overall; believes that this recognition is in large part due to the local authority’s commitment to decentralisation and staff empowerment, and urges more local authorities to follow Aberdeenshire’s example that employee job satisfaction helps contribute to good service delivery.
