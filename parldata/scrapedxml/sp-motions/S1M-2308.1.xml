 *S1M-2308.1 Bruce Crawford: New Reactor at Chapelcross Nuclear Power Plant—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2308) in the name of John Scott, leave out from "British" to end and insert "the output of Chapelcross Nuclear Power station is insignificant with regard to energy production in Scotland, being 196MW of power which is only 2% of Scotland’s normal capacity of 9654MW and consequently, believes there is no business case for substantial investment in the station in order to support it beyond its current expected lifespan, and further notes with concern that nuclear electricity production at Chapelcross is a mere by-product of the process of the station’s primary role in the production of weapons-grade tritium to support the Trident weapons system, a system of mass destruction which has no place in a civilised nation. Supported by: Fiona McLeod*, Andrew Wilson*, Mr Lloyd Quinan*, Mr Gil Paterson*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Robin Harper*
