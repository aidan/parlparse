*S3M-455 Claire Baker: Advice Week—That the Parliament notes that Advice Week runs from 10 to 16 September 2007; recognises the tremendous impact that citizens advice bureaux (CABx) and other advice agencies have across Scotland; notes the particular efforts of Citizens Advice and Rights Fife in its offices in Cowdenbeath, Cupar, Dunfermline, Glenrothes, Kirkcaldy and Methil and across Fife; fully supports the free, confidential, impartial and independent service that bureaux provide to those who are often the most vulnerable people in society; notes that in the last year alone CABx in Scotland dealt with over £211 million of debt, and calls on government and all relevant organisations, whether public, private or voluntary sector, to work together to urgently reduce levels of unmanageable debt across all parts of Scotland.
