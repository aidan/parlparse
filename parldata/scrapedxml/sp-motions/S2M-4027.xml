*S2M-4027 Des McNulty: Cut the Strings—That the Parliament supports Jubilee Scotland’s Cut the Strings campaign and its call for an end to attaching harmful economic policy conditions to debt relief; notes that, despite it now being UK policy not to attach harmful conditions, such as privatisation, trade liberalisation and cuts in social spending to aid, debt relief is still made subject to World Bank or IMF conditions that undermine democracy and delay delivering resources needed to alleviate poverty, and believes that the United Kingdom should take a lead by delivering debt relief without harmful conditions.
