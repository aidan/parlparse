*S1M-3736 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow City Centre Policing-That the Parliament notes the extraordinary level of activity in Glasgow City Centre day and night and the intensive policing required of the ever-increasing night economy, particularly of young people attracted to the under-18s clubs; notes that there are approximately 36,000 people in Glasgow city centre four nights each week; notes that Glasgow has the highest level of shoppers in Scotland, being second only to London for UK shopping; notes the increasing occurrence of retail crime and public order disputes in Glasgow; notes that Glasgow has the highest proportion of licensed pubs and clubs outside London; notes the disproportionate responsibility on the city centre police force for maintaining public order in Glasgow city centre which is not recognised as unique in relation to resources allocated through the police funding formula, and considers that there is a case for revisiting the funding formula to provide greater resources for Strathclyde Police Division A.
