 *S2M-4697 Mr Jim Wallace: Energy Saving Trust - Revocation of VAT Rebate—That the Parliament notes the recent decision by HM Revenue and Customs to revoke retrospectively the VAT rebate which has historically been enjoyed by the Energy Saving Trust, a government-funded non-profit organisation which promotes energy efficiency and carbon saving, with the effect that the trust must now repay approximately £5 million or around 65% of its annual budget; further notes that this decision will lead to the cancellation of energy saving programmes and the loss of jobs at the trust throughout the United Kingdom as well as in Scotland; believes that this deeply regrettable decision will undermine the excellent work undertaken by the Scottish Executive to promote energy saving and energy efficiency, and urges the Executive to give careful consideration to increasing its grant to the Energy Saving Trust to make up some or all of the shortfall for the current year.
