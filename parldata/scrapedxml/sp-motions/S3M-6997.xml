 *S3M-6997 Ian McKee: Roma Rights and Free Movement of People—That the Parliament notes a recent European Parliament resolution on the French Government’s policy of deporting Roma families and demolishing their encampments, passed by 337 votes to 245; further notes the European directive on free movement of persons allowing all citizens of the European Union to freely reside in any member state; recalls the European Commission’s function as guardian of treaties with a duty to question and intervene when community law may be breached; further recalls the legal right and principle of European citizenship; welcomes Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding’s recent statement that the case may be put to the European Court of Justice; firmly believes that under no circumstances should any ethnic group be stigmatised or deported purely on grounds of ethnicity, and calls on the European Commission to introduce tougher community legislation on the protection of Roma communities and their integration in society.
