 *S3M-3540♦ Ted Brocklebank: The Future of Scottish Newspapers—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent announcement by Trinity Mirror that a quarter of journalists at the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail will lose their jobs due to the newspapers merging; further notes that this follows on from proposed cutbacks in editorial staff at the Herald and Times Group and concerns about the future of other Scottish daily and weekly newspapers including Johnston Press, which owns the Fife Free Press Group; recognises that, while the crisis in the Scottish print media mirrors the situation worldwide with the economic downturn dramatically affecting circulation and advertising, the Scottish press faces particular difficulties including the loss of government advertising to the internet, and believes that the democratic process requires a vibrant Scottish newspaper sector with all sides working to minimise job losses and find long-term solutions.
