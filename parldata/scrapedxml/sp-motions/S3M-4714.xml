 *S3M-4714 Christine Grahame: Lockerbie, In the Name of Justiceâ€”That the Parliament considers that, with (a) so many unanswered questions relating to the prosecution and conviction of Abdelbaset al Megrahi, (b) the abandonment of his appeal with the evidence upon which the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission concluded that there may have been a miscarriage of justice on the basis of unheard evidence, (c) inter alia new evidence indicating that Mr Megrahi was not in Malta when a crucial purchase of items linking him directly to the explosion took place, (d) information that four days before he was picked out at an identity parade by Tony Gauci, the shop keeper who is said to have sold those items, the same Gauci had seen a photograph of Mr Megrahi in an article linking him to the bombing, (e) evidence not made available to the defence and (f) further new evidence, in the name of justice for the victims, their relatives and Mr Megrahi, a public inquiry with the full participation of United Kingdom and United States authorities is essential.
