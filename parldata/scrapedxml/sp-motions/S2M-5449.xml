 *S2M-5449 Dr Jean Turner: Baldernock Community Council Takes Climate Change Seriously—That the Parliament commends the work done by Al Gore’s lecture tour and his film "An Inconvenient Truth", which can now be seen on DVD and should be viewed by as many people as possible to bring home the horror of the consequences to communities if they ignore the message of the urgency to halt climate change; praises the Baldernock Community Council for its serious approach to this subject by engaging with a post-graduate student of Salford University who has volunteered his services to analyse the situation within the Baldernock Community Council area over an eight-month period, with a team of local helpers, to find out what energy is used and then to find a way forward to reduce carbon emissions to their lowest; acknowledges that Baldernock is lucky to have the free services of this post-graduate student, and urges the Scottish Executive to encourage all communities to participate in similar exercises, and in so doing join with communities such as Aston Hayes in Cheshire, with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs support, and Riverside in Stirling, by giving some financial support to all community councils for this purpose.
