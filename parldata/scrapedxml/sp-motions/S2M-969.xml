 *S2M-969# Michael McMahon: Recognising the Contribution of Scottish Lithuanians-That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Lithuanian Cultural and Recreational Social Club in Mossend, Lanarkshire, on the occasion of its 25th anniversary; notes the positive contribution that Lithuanian immigrants have made to Scotland's economy, local communities and special causes; applauds the commitment of members of the club to maintaining a sense of their history; recognises that now, with fifth and sixth generations, the Lithuanian community has integrated successfully but is at risk of losing its cultural identity and language; calls, therefore, for a recognition that, with the accession of Lithuania to the EU, the time is right to welcome further immigrants with much needed skills to Scotland from Lithuania and build on the links already important to, and embedded in, Lanarkshire's culture and history, and hopes that any new immigrants are treated with respect and given a warm welcome in recognition that different communities can and do integrate successfully in Scotland.
