*S1M-346# Helen Eadie: Fife Rail Service—That the Parliament deplores the appalling level of service rail passengers in Fife have endured over several years and expresses grave concern at the extreme deterioration over recent months; notes with concern the overcrowding on these trains and the health and safety issues this presents; calls upon ScotRail to announce and implement an immediate action plan to improve punctuality, reduce train cancellations and increase the number of carriages on peak-time trains, with such an action plan to have been successfully implemented within six months, and further calls for an explanation why the new rolling stock which was ordered from the train manufacturing companies by ScotRail for use on this line has still not been delivered more than four years later.
