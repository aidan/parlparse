*S3M-2555 Mike Pringle: Clarification of Acceptability of Scottish Qualifications for UK Citizenship Applications—That the Parliament is concerned that the UK Government Immigration and Nationality Directorate’s unfamiliarity with the relevant Scottish qualifications in the form of SQA certificates that meet the application requirements for UK citizenship, as laid down by the Home Secretary, may have resulted in the rejection of Scotland-based applications for citizenship, and calls on the Scottish Government to clarify the acceptability of these Scottish qualifications with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.
