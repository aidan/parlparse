*S3M-596 Angela Constance: Concessionary Travel—That the Parliament notes with concern that disabled people in receipt of the low rate mobility component of disability living allowance (DLA) are not eligible for concessionary travel; is deeply alarmed about the detrimental impact on disabled people who this year have had to re-apply for concessionary travel and who have subsequently lost eligibility; recognises that the National Concessionary Travel Scheme replaced local schemes such as those operated in West Lothian and the Strathclyde area that included those in receipt of DLA low rate mobility component; acknowledges that DLA low rate mobility component is a benefit for people who, due to the nature of their disability, require support or supervision to travel; notes that many people with mental health problems or learning disabilities will not qualify for concessionary travel under the mental health legislation due to high thresholds and bureaucracy and, furthermore, that this exclusion contravenes recommendations and the spirit of the Same as You guidance, and therefore calls for a review of the National Concessionary Travel Scheme and supports Capability Scotland and Enable Scotland in their campaign to extend eligibility for concessionary travel to those in receipt of DLA low rate mobility component and free travel for their companions, and to make it easier for disabled people to qualify where they are not in receipt of DLA or eligible under mental health legislation.
