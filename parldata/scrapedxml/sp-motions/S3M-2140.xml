 *S3M-2140 Peter Peacock: Ullapool Primary School—That the Parliament notes the concerns being expressed by the Ullapool Primary School Parents Council over the adverse effects which the ongoing budget cuts being made by the Highland Council are having upon the educational quality at Ullapool Primary School; notes that due to lack of finances the school has no library service and, because of the budget cuts this year, no swimming classes and no specialist teachers for music or higher education, and therefore calls on the council to make the necessary resources available to ensure that children attending Ullapool Primary School receive the resources needed to provide for their education.
