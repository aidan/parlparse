 *S3M-945 Jim Mather: Tourism—That the Parliament recognises the vital role that tourism has in increasing sustainable economic growth in line with the Scottish Government’s Economic Strategy; reiterates its support for the ambitions set out in the Tourism Framework for Change that tourism revenue should increase by 50% in real terms in the decade to 2015 and that Scotland should be one of Europe’s most sustainable tourism destinations; recognises the appetite in the industry to improve and exceed visitor expectation, and welcomes the fact that these ambitions are shared between the public, private and third sectors.
