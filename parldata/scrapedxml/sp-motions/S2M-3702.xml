*S2M-3702 Tommy Sheridan: Eviction of Storrier Family—That the Parliament notes the eviction of the Storrier family and, in particular, Gladys Storrier, aged 71, from a ground floor council home to a third-storey home two closes from the ground floor home; believes that it is unacceptable to refuse in such a harsh fashion to accommodate a pensioner with known illnesses; believes that the Storrier family should be housed in a suitable ground floor home and that the shortage of such good quality council homes across Dundee is indicative of a Scottish-wide problem whereby the demand for good quality council and socially rented homes far outstrips the supply, and therefore demands a massive council housing building programme with no right-to-buy policy.
