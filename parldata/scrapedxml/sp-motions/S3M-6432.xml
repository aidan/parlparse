 *S3M-6432 Bill Kidd: European Parliament-paid Traineeships for People with Disabilities—That the Parliament congratulates the European Parliament on the continuing success of its paid scheme for disabled people, which was launched in 2006 as a positive-action measure for facilitating the integration of disabled people in the workplace; notes that the programme is designed to encourage applications from men and women with disabilities and allows successful candidates to familiarise themselves with the activities of the European Parliament; further notes the importance of promoting equal opportunities in the workplace, and wishes further success for the scheme in continuing to remove barriers for disabled people to future employment.
