*S3M-3290 Cathy Jamieson: Supporting the Gaiety Theatre—That the Parliament congratulates the Gaiety Theatre for its incredible contribution to Scottish theatre throughout its 106-year history; recognises the significant contribution it would make in 2009 as the culture and heritage of Scotland is celebrated on the world stage in the Year of Homecoming; expresses its dismay at the proposal by South Ayrshire Council to close the venue, a decision that would spell the end of one of Scotland’s cultural treasures, and calls on South Ayrshire Council to withdraw this proposal, explore all available options to secure its future and to renew its commitment to continue to support the Gaiety Theatre as it showcases the best in performing arts. Supported by: Elaine Murray*, Patricia Ferguson*, David Stewart*, Cathy Peattie*, John Park*, Robin Harper*
