*S1M-3481# Bill Butler: Timetable for the Glasgow Airport Rail Link—That the Parliament welcomes the response made by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning in the debate on the future of air transport in Scotland to a question regarding the much-needed Glasgow Airport rail link; recognises that his reply, which talked of being able to come forward with "the preferred optionin the next few weeks" and a "starting date for design and construction" of "2005" [Official Report c 14500], marks real progress on this matter; notes that the Minister’s statement relates directly to an earlier members’ motion, S1M-3412, which urged the Minister to come forward "as a matter of urgency" with his "favoured option for this development and a clear timetable for its speedy implementation", and stresses the absolute support of Glasgow’s MSPs, Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Passenger Transport and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce for the successful implementation of the "ambitious timetable" [Official Report c 14500] announced on 9 October 2002 by the minister.
