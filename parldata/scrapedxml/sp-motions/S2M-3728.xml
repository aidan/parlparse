 *S2M-3728# Ms Sandra White: Loss of Teaching Posts in Glasgow Nursery Schools—That the Parliament condemns proposals from Glasgow City Council to transfer qualified nursery teachers out of nursery school education and into mainstream primary education, thereby leaving the city’s pre-five education in the hands of less qualified staff, as part of the savings options for Glasgow Education Services’ budget proposals; recognises the high level of commitment displayed whereby a nursery teacher must first attain a full teaching qualification followed by a further specialist qualification; recognises also that with the experience gained a nursery teacher will identify educational and behavioural difficulties which can be corrected at an early stage thereby benefiting the child and society as a whole, and believes that a duty of care is owed to at least maintain present levels of provision of nursery teachers as the bedrock for all levels of educational services.
