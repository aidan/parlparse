*S2M-1664# Dr Sylvia Jackson: Beslan Tragedy—That the Parliament offers its deepest sympathy to the people of Beslan following the terrorist outrage which ended in the death of over three hundred people, many of whom were children; notes that, with experience of the Dunblane Primary School tragedy, the people of Scotland will be sharing the anguish felt across the world at this terrible act of terrorism against young children, carers and teaching staff in what was considered to be a safe and secure learning environment, and supports the thousands of Russian people in their grief who have taken to the streets to look for answers to this tragedy.
