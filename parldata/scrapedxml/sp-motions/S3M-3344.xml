 *S3M-3344 Cathy Peattie: Map of Gaps—That the Parliament welcomes the Map of Gaps 2 report and website www.mapofgaps.org from the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the End Violence Against Women coalition; notes with alarm that three million women across the United Kingdom experience violence each year; further notes that over a quarter of local authority areas across Britain have no specialised violence against women support services, such as rape crisis centres, refuges, domestic violence outreach projects and services for black and minority ethnic women; recognises the need for local authorities and other public bodies to undertake needs assessments under their gender equality schemes and to ensure both sufficiency and diversity of provision; welcomes that, as with the previous report from December 2007, Scotland leads the way in provision and that this, in part, is due to Scotland being the only part of the UK to take an explicitly gendered policy approach to violence against women; is concerned however that the removal of ring-fenced funding for local services may be leading to a dilution of focus and support, and calls on the Scottish Government and local authorities to ensure that rigorous needs analysis and equality impact assessment, as required by the Gender Equality Duty (GED), are central to future single outcome agreements.
