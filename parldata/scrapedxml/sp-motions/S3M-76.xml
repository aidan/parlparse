 *S3M-76 Stuart McMillan: Tourism in Inverclydeâ€”That the Parliament notes the publication of the new edition of the Lonely Planet Great Britain guide and is concerned that Inverclyde has been omitted from this edition; notes that tourism is a vital Scottish industry and that it should play a pivotal role in the future success of Inverclyde; further notes that Inverclyde has a proud maritime history and is currently an embarkation, disembarkation and visitation port for luxury cruise liners bringing thousands of visitors each year, thus continuing our maritime tradition; also notes the attractions that Inverclyde has to offer, including the McLean Museum, the outdoor swimming pool and Newark Castle, and urges the Lonely Plant publishers to ensure that Inverclyde is not omitted when the next guide is published.
