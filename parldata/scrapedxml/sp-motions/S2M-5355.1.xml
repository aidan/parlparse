*S2M-5355.1 Colin Fox: Trident—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5355) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "believes Trident nuclear weapons to be both illegal under international law, as they cannot distinguish between enemy combatants on the one hand and innocent civilians on the other, and immoral; calls on the Westminster Parliament to oppose the White Paper on the replacement of the Trident nuclear weapons system and to recognise Britain’s obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaties; believes that the £25 billion needed to replace Trident would be better spent on health, education and social services, and calls on all parliamentarians to support the Faslane 365 day of protest on 8 January 2007 for MSPs, MPs and MEPs outside the naval base on the Clyde".
