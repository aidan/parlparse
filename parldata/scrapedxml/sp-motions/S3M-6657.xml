*S3M-6657 Anne McLaughlin: Preventing Domestic Abuse in Scotland’s Muslim Communities—That the Parliament welcomes the news that Islamic scholar Shayk Amer Jamil is to launch a nationwide campaign targeting domestic abuse in the Muslim community; recognises the importance of tackling domestic abuse in every community in Scotland; welcomes the role that Scotland’s imams can play in reducing domestic abuse by highlighting their faith’s stance against such abuse; hopes that the campaign improves reporting rates of domestic abuse; recognises that domestic abuse unfortunately blights all of Scotland’s communities, and congratulates Shayk Amer Jamil on the leadership that he is showing in his community on this issue.
