*S3M-399 Pauline McNeill: Getting the Balance Right in Glasgow’s West End—That the Parliament notes the vibrancy and diversity of Glasgow’s West End as one of Scotland’s most important cultural and conservation districts and the opportunity it presents to showcase the best of Glasgow’s regeneration as a successful world city, but expresses concern at the proliferation of late licences in the area that are already affecting quality of life for residents; notes with concern the latest proposal from G1 Group for a night club as part of a development at Glasgow’s Botanic Gardens which has attracted widescale opposition from local communities and which, if granted, would have a serious impact on local people, threatening the sustainability of the West End as a place to live, increasing noise and public disorder and putting further pressure on inadequate transport facilities, and calls on Glasgow City Council to review its licensing policy in relation to Glasgow’s West End and reject any application for a late licence or night club at the Botanic Gardens.
