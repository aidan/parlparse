*S2M-65 Frances Curran: Reduction in Services at Vale of Leven Hospitalâ€”That the Parliament notes the reduction in elderly care and mental health services at the Vale of Leven Hospital; further notes the downgrading of the accident and emergency services and the transfer of the maternity unit to Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital; is aware that Vale of Leven Hospital provides healthcare to a large and varied patient area, from Dumbarton to Oban, covering large rural and urban areas and that this reduction in services is of huge concern to people living in the area, and believes that there should be a halt to any further reduction or transfer of services and a re-instatement of those services already affected.
