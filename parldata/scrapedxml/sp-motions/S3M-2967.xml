*S3M-2967 Patrick Harvie: International Students and ID Cards—That the Parliament notes that all non-EU nationals renewing their visas after this week will be required by the UK Government to buy an ID card and that this particularly affects international students studying in Scotland; shares the previous Scottish Executive’s view, supported by the Parliament in 2005, that ID cards must not be required for the use of devolved services; notes that, while immigration is currently reserved, universities and education are devolved services; believes that international students contribute substantially to Scottish society and the Scottish economy, and urges the Scottish Government to provide whatever advice and support it can for such students studying in Scottish universities and colleges if they refuse to comply with the ID card scheme.
