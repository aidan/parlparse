 *S1M-3078.2 Mary Scanlon: Action to Recruit, Retain and Value Nurses-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3078) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "and supports" to end and insert "notes with concern, however, the recent decrease in nurse numbers; acknowledges that better staffing levels and conditions will lead to better morale and therefore higher levels of nurse retention, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to promote a more flexible system that would recruit and retain appropriate numbers of nurses and midwives to serve Scotland's needs."
