 *S1M-3942 Brian Adam: Chewing Gum Disposal—That the Parliament applauds Councillor Kevin Stewart and Aberdeen City Council in their endeavours to try and get the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s agreement to introduce a levy on chewing gum manufacturers, the proceeds of which would be allocated to local authorities to clean up the mess created by those who discard their gum on our streets and pavements; notes that other local authorities are backing Councillor Stewart's original motion because cleaning up chewing gum costs millions of pounds each year, and furthermore believes that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should introduce this sensible proposal in his forthcoming budget.
