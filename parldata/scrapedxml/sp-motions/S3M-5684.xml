*S3M-5684 Christina McKelvie: Alleged Discrimination Against Asylum Seekers at UKBA—That the Parliament expresses deep concern at allegations by whistleblower Louise Perrott of a culture at the UK Border Agency (UKBA) of hostility and discrimination towards asylum seekers, openly expressed anti-immigration and anti-asylum seeker views and disbelief and humiliation of asylum applicants; is further concerned that Ms Perrott was able to make legally binding decisions on the granting and refusal of asylum and on detention of individuals and families after only five weeks’ training, and endorses the call of Keith Vaz MP, chair of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, for an immediate and full investigation into the practices and cultures of management and staff at the UKBA.
