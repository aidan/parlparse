*S2M-4430 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Academic Pay Dispute—That the Parliament recognises the important contribution of Scotland’s universities to the nation’s economy and well-being; deplores the unnecessary delays caused by the university principals’ and vice-chancellors’ prolonged refusal to negotiate in respect of academic pay; reminds them that the recent increase of funding was partly granted in expectation that they were about to restore some of the lost value of academic pay, and urges them to seek a just settlement with great urgency in order to prevent further damage to students about to graduate and to ensure the future quality of teaching and research. Supported by: Campbell Martin*
