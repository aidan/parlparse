 *S3M-7209 Christina McKelvie: UK Anti-Slavery Day and European Anti-Trafficking Dayâ€”That the Parliament marks the first UK Anti-Slavery Day, which coincides with European Anti-Trafficking Day on 18 October 2010; understands that an estimated 12.3 million people across the world are in slavery today, forced to work for little or no pay and denied basic human rights and freedoms; further considers that many enslaved people have also been victims of human trafficking across international borders, including into the United Kingdom; further recognises that, between 1 April 2009 and 31 August 2010, 74 people in Scotland were identified as suspected victims of human trafficking; pledges its support for the Anti-Slavery International and Stop the Traffik campaigns to bring a global end to slavery and human trafficking; calls on the UK Government to reconsider what it considers its regrettable decision to decline to opt in to the new European Union anti-trafficking directive, and asks the Scottish Government to continue its existing work to prevent women, children and men being trafficked into Scotland and to provide services and support for victims of trafficking and slavery.
