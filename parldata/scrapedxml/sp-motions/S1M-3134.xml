*S1M-3134 Andrew Wilson: Transfers Under PFI/PPP - Protection of Staff Rights and Conditions-That the Parliament recognises concerns expressed by many employees, trade union members, commentators and concerned citizens about the operation of PFI/PPP contracts initiated by the public sector in Scotland; acknowledges that these concerns are based on a number of factors, including the excessive cost of capital provided, the quality of public service provided and the rights and conditions of staff employed under PFI/PPP contracts; further recognises that many of the alleged efficiency gains in PFI/PPP contracts in comparison to the public sector are made at the expense of staff rights and conditions, which, in turn, can have a significant negative impact on the quality of ongoing service; further recognises that there is growing concern that the rights and conditions of employees transferred out of the public sector in Scotland through PFI/PPP deals are less favourably protected than elsewhere in the UK; resolves that any future PFI/PPP contracts should make the detail of alleged efficiency savings publicly available and specify the impact that such savings have on staff rights and conditions so that public bodies entering into such agreements are fully accountable to the people that they serve, and further resolves that, in respect of employee transfers under the TUPE regulations from public bodies for which the Scottish Executive has any responsibility, transfer practice should adhere to the Cabinet Office Statement of Practice as a minimum standard.
