*S3M-1068 George Foulkes: Bank Machine Accessibilityâ€”That the Parliament recognises how difficult it is for people with visual impairments to use bank automated telling machines; notes that there is not a standard design for ATMs which results in people having to familiarise themselves with the layout each time they go to a new one; further notes that sometimes people with visual impairments have to ask strangers to help them to take their own money out, leaving them feeling very vulnerable; believes that everyone should be able to access their own money without fear, and urges the Scottish Executive to discuss the issue with all Scottish banks to agree a standard design which can be more easily accessed by those with visual impairments.
