*S1M-399 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Dyslexia—That the Parliament recognises that 10% of the population suffer from some degree of dyslexia and that 3% require intensive, special tuition at primary school age to acquire even basic skills in reading, writing and numeracy; notes with concern that half the prison population is dyslexic and the evidence this displays of our historic neglect of remedial education; calls upon the Scottish Executive to recognise dyslexia as a disability and ensure that all local authorities do so too, and urges the Scottish Executive to make additional resources available to local authorities to enable them to undertake early assessments for dyslexia and provide additional educational support for dyslexic children.
