*S2M-4236 Christine May: Congratulations to Glenwood High School—That the Parliament applauds the achievement of the pupils of Glenwood High School in Glenrothes who, together with their teacher Alastair Wood, partners Ardmel Group Limited and Fife Council and with the support of other local businesses, raised £80,000 to provide a new junior school at Weligama in Sri Lanka to replace one destroyed in the tsunami; acknowledges the very high level of commitment, concern for others and selflessness shown by these and many other young people involved in similar work in Glenrothes and across Scotland; supports the Scottish Executive in its efforts to provide a framework for supporting young people’s voluntary activities through Project Scotland; recognises the very high degree of social awareness shown by the majority of young people demonstrated by this and many other similar projects, and wishes Glenwood High School’s Charity Group and other such groups in schools across Scotland continued success.
