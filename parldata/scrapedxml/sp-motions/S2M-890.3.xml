*S2M-890.3 Allan Wilson: Nuclear Waste-As an amendment to motion (S2M-890) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from "is concerned" to end and insert "agrees that the review of options for the long-term management of radioactive waste, currently being undertaken by the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, is the correct means of engaging Scotland in the debate to find a long-term publicly acceptable solution to the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste and that the Scottish Executive should continue to input into UK, European and international radioactive waste issues and require the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to implement policy such as the UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001-2020."
