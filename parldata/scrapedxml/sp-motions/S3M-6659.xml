*S3M-6659 Anne McLaughlin: Bigotry still Blighting Scottish Society—That the Parliament condemns the sectarian vandalism suffered by the Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Bridgeton in Glasgow; considers that such incidents are still an all too frequent occurrence in 21st century Scotland; notes that this incident occurred just shortly after the church hosted a mass to celebrate its centenary, having opened on the Feast of the Sacred Heart in 1910; recognises the contribution that Scotland’s Catholic community makes to Scottish society and regrets any sectarian abuse that it suffers; notes the large amount of effort that the parishioners and the parish priest put into redecorating the church in time for the centenary celebrations; regrets that the vandalism has now tarnished this impressive community effort; hopes that the perpetrators are identified in the near future, and wishes the church well with the rest of its centenary year.
