*S3M-2378 Malcolm Chisholm: Anniversary of the "8888" Pro-Democracy Demonstration—That the Parliament recognises the twentieth anniversary of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Burma that began on 8 August 1988 and during which an estimated 3,000 people were brutally slaughtered by the ruling military junta; expresses its deep concern about reports that over 2,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated in that country where they face systematic abuse and are denied proper medical care in contravention of their basic human rights; notes that an estimated 900 people have been imprisoned in the past 10 months, including many involved in the September 2007 "Saffron Revolution", and commends and supports the work of organisations across the United Kingdom, including the Amnesty International Edinburgh St Mark’s Group, in highlighting the plight of these prisoners of conscience and calling for their immediate and unconditional release.
