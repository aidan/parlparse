*S3M-7863 Bill Kidd: Whiteinch Wonder—That the Parliament congratulates the Whiteinch Centre on being shortlisted for the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum’s 2010 awards; believes that the centre gives a tremendous service to the Glasgow community in providing classes, addiction support, stress management services and money advice, alongside the healthy eating café, under-5s’ crèche and social care support and that this illustrates the huge benefits of community empowerment; notes that the Whiteinch Community Association raised £1.2 million to build and manage the community facility, is now generating 50% of its own income and will produce a report regarding the added value that the centre creates for the local community; believes that the future of community empowerment lies in the understanding and replication of such initiatives, and wishes the Whiteinch Centre continuing success in the future.
