*S3M-6534 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Funding Cuts by Department for International Development—That the Parliament expresses grave concern at the decision by the Department for International Development to withdraw funding from a number of awareness-raising projects, including Scotdec’s First Steps to Lasting Change project; notes that the decision to withdraw Scotdec’s funding was taken just two days after the new Secretary of State for International Development was appointed and just one year into a three-year project; condemns the making of important funding decisions without an evaluation of affected projects and in such a short time frame, and calls on the Secretary of State to reconsider his decision.
