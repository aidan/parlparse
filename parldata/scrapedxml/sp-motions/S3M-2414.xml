 *S3M-2414John Park:Migrant Workers In Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern recent newspaper reports highlighting the plight of many migrant workers involved in Scotland’s soft fruit industry; further notes a report by Amnesty International suggesting evidence of human trafficking into Scotland for domestic and agricultural labour; understands that many farmers in the fruit and vegetable sectors are reliant on migrant labour but expresses concern that many migrant workers have to endure squalid living and working conditions; recognises that Scottish produce can be among the best in the world but worries that this reputation for excellence could be tainted by the exploitative practices of a minority of employers; welcomes investigations by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and other bodies into rogue employers; believes that there should be greater public emphasis placed by representative bodies on the high employment standards the majority of fruit and vegetable producers adhere to and hopes that this will restore public confidence in the industry; applauds the work undertaken by trade unions to promote migrant workers’ rights, and hopes that the industry, supermarkets and others involved in the sector will work more closely with trade unions to protect vulnerable workers.
