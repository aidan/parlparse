 *S3M-3291 Iain Smith: Anstruther Fish Bar, UK Fish and Chip Shop of 2008—That the Parliament congratulates the Anstruther Fish Bar for being named UK Fish and Chip Shop of the Year and for also winning the title for the contribution to the local community; recognises that its success is down to the consistent high quality of the fish and chips as well as using ethically sourced North Sea haddock, local Pittenweem prawns and Shetland organic cod from the world’s first sustainable solution to wild-cod fisheries; further recognises the contribution that the Anstruther Fish Bar makes to local tourism, and wishes owners Robert and Alison Smith continued success.
