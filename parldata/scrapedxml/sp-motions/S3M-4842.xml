 *S3M-4842 Alasdair Allan: Hebrides Range Advert that Gives the Game Away—That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to make clear whether it was aware of the advertisement recently placed online by its defence contractor, QinetiQ, for a "Deputy Project Manager, integrated air ranges operations" for "a very large Air Range Transformation project (£40M+) that will undertake Range modernisation, integration of Command and Control functions for the Aberporth and Hebrides Ranges, and implement remote control and monitoring of much of the Hebrides Range T&amp;E equipment", and further asks the UK Government to explain whether it feels that this advertisement is consistent with its claim that no decision has yet been made on the future of the Hebrides Range and that UK ministers are listening to the representations being made by a fragile island community that would suffer devastating economic and social consequences were the 125 direct job losses currently being proposed to be carried through.
