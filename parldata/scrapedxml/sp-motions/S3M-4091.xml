 *S3M-4091 Jamie Hepburn: Planned Industrial Action in Grangemouth, Alloa, Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath Royal Mail Delivery Offices—That the Parliament notes the decision by postal workers based in the Grangemouth delivery office in central Scotland, as well as delivery offices in Alloa, Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath, to call for strike action over the weekend of 9 and 10 May 2009; further notes that the decision to strike is in response to the modernisation of delivery and sorting jobs, which the Communication Workers Union feels has been implemented without proper consideration; regrets that the workers feel forced into industrial action, which will affect mail services to businesses and households across the areas served by these offices; notes that the action coincides with protests across Scotland against the UK Government’s plans to part-privatise the Royal Mail, and believes that modernisation of the Royal Mail must take place in the context of continued public ownership, with the priority placed on public service and full consultation of workers as any changes are introduced.
