*S3M-1291 Gil Paterson: You’ve Had Enough of Our Money, Hands Off Our Notes—That the Parliament supports the campaign by the Scottish Daily Express to give Scottish bank notes equality status and notes with concern what is planned by the UK Government which will effectively mean the end of Scottish notes; calls on the UK Government not to abolish the circulation of Scottish notes; highlights the fact that Scottish banks are the among the most stable financial institutions in the world; considers that the UK Government has taken enough of Scotland’s wealth but that its appetite remains unabated, and therefore calls on the UK Government to keep its hands off Scottish notes as London has had enough of our money.
