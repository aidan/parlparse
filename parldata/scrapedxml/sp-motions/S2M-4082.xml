*S2M-4082 Patrick Harvie: The End of Ivor Cutler—That the Parliament celebrates the life of Ivor Cutler, poet, musician and artist, who sadly died this week after entertaining and occasionally perplexing audiences for half a century; hopes that Cutler’s passing will not stop new generations from discovering his work and delighting in it as so many have before, and, now that the coffin is closed, hopes that he enjoys the doughnut. Supported by: Chris Ballance*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Alex Johnstone*, Christine May*, Brian Adam*, Mr Brian Monteith*, Eleanor Scott*, Robin Harper*
