*S1M-2284# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Recognition of Parkinson's Disease—That the Parliament recognises that Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological condition affecting 13,500 people across Scotland and that one in seven people diagnosed will be under the age of 50; notes that every element of normal movement, speech and swallowing is affected by the disease, which often has a devastating impact on both immediate and extended family; believes it is important to establish models of good clinical and social care; further recognises and commends the excellent work being done by the Parkinson’s Disease Society in helping people and their carers with problems arising from the disease, and considers that the Scottish Executive should as a matter of urgency establish a national network of Parkinson’s Disease specialist nurses to provide a national service framework for neurological conditions including Parkinson’s Disease and should eliminate any inequities in health and social care access in areas such as Glasgow, Ayrshire, Lanarkshire and the Highlands and Islands where the shortage of specialist nurses is most acute.
