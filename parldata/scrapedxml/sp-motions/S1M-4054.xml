*S1M-4054 Robin Harper: Attack on Iraq—That the Parliament condemns the decision by Her Majesty’s Government to order Her Majesty’s armed forces to join the United States of America in the use of military force against Iraq; recognises that this military action will result in the deaths and injury of both innocent Iraqi civilians and United Kingdom servicemen and servicewomen; recognises that such military action is contrary to international law and has undermined the authority of the United Nations; believes that such unilateral action is weakening the international coalition against terrorism and will result in increased support for terrorist groups whose intention is to act against civilians in the United Kingdom and in other countries, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to disengage Her Majesty’s forces from hostilities against Iraq, to ensure in the meantime everything is done to minimise the number of civilian casualties resulting from this military action, particularly those caused by the use of cluster bombs, depleted-uranium armaments and landmines and to ensure that humanitarian relief is provided immediately upon the cessation of hostilities.
