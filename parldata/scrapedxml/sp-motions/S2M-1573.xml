*S2M-1573 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Smoking Deaths per Constituency-That the Parliament notes the high mortality rates attributable to smoking in every constituency throughout Scotland; further notes with concern the wide variance between constituencies and, in particular, the effect that smoking has on mortality rates in the west of Scotland and Glasgow, and urges all members, particularly those from the most badly-affected areas, to appreciate the deaths and illness caused by both primary and secondary smoking and to take the first possible opportunity to vote for legislation that will assist in reducing these horrific figures, thereby helping to create a more equal society for all the people of Scotland.
