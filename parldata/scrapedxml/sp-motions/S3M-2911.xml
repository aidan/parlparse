*S3M-2911 Aileen Campbell: UK Immigration Minister’s Comments on Asylum and Immigration—That the Parliament notes with serious concern comments by the UK immigration minister, Phil Woolas MP, that migration lawyers and non-governmental organisations supporting asylum seekers are "playing the system" and give "false hope" to immigrants and asylum seekers in the United Kingdom; believes that Scotland and the United Kingdom have a moral duty to provide asylum for people escaping human rights abuses and a sound case for accepting migrants with a positive contribution to make to our economy; deplores the use of provocative or prejudiced language in any debate about immigration policy, and further believes that if Phil Woolas’s statement is reflective of UK Government policy it serves only to emphasise the need for power over immigration and asylum policy in Scotland to be devolved to the Parliament.
