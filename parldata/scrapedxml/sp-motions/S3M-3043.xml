*S3M-3043 George Foulkes: Ireland Raises VAT—That the Parliament welcomes the UK Labour government’s decision to cut VAT, helping Scottish businesses and Scottish families; acknowledges the cut in VAT from 17.5% to 15% and notes that this contrasts favourably with the Republic of Ireland, which has just raised VAT to 21.5%; notes the comments of Torlach Denihan, Director of Retail Ireland, who said "The increase in VAT makes Ireland less competitive by comparison with our nearest neighbour, Britain", and believes that this is another blow to the much-cited "arc of prosperity". Supported by: David Stewart*, Michael McMahon*, Jackie Baillie*, Andy Kerr*, Elaine Murray*
