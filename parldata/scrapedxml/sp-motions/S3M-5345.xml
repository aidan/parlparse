*S3M-5345 Cathy Peattie: Carers Rights Day—That the Parliament notes and welcomes Carers Rights Day, which falls on Friday 4 December, and acknowledges and values the substantial contribution made by over 600,000 unpaid carers and young carers across Scotland; welcomes the practical and emotional support provided by the Falkirk Carers Centre and the network of Princess Royal Trust for Carers Centres across Scotland that have worked with over 50,000 carers in 2008-09; notes that the Carers Centres are critical to the implementation of the Scottish Government’s carers strategy, but are facing significant funding challenges; is concerned that there is no commitment to additional resources to support the implementation of the new carers strategy; believes that the work being done to develop the new strategy should take forward the action highlighted in the Care 21 report relating to respite and short breaks, training for carers, access to information for carers and the specific needs of young carers, and believes that the strategy should lead to real action that benefits Scotland’s unpaid carers, ensuring clear accountability for service delivery and improvements that enable carers to continue caring with confidence and to have a quality life outside of that caring role.
