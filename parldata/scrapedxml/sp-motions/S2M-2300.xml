 * S2M-2300 Dr Jean Turner:Ambulatory Care and Diagnostic Unit (ACAD) Safe Working—That the Parliament acknowledges that the safety of patients and staff within the NHS is paramount, especially when operative procedures are performed; realises that, even within the best circumstances, sometimes unexpected side-effects or emergency situations can, and occasionally do, arise out of very straightforward procedures, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to only consider establishing Ambulatory Care and Diagnostic Units (ACADs) with day-surgery theatres provided that they are attached to a district general hospital with in-patient beds providing medical, surgical, coronary care, intensive care/high-dependency and casualty services, thus ensuring safer working conditions as well as adding capacity within the general hospital to enable elective work to be carried out on patients not fit to be treated as day cases.
