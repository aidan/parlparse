*S3M-7623 Christine Grahame: Halt the Attack on WikiLeaks—That the Parliament condemns what it considers the assault on free speech by the US Government and other nation states in undermining the international new media website, WikiLeaks; understands that recent additional disclosures provide evidence that the US Government planned in February 2008 to "damage and destroy" WikiLeaks; deplores what it considers to be the overtly politically motivated efforts of the US and other governments in undermining WikiLeaks; believes that among the disclosures made by this groundbreaking website is evidence of war crimes and human rights abuses by the US and other governments, and urges all countries to resist any threats or diplomatic intimidation by the US and recognise that WikiLeaks has an important role in ensuring genuinely open, transparent and accountable government.
