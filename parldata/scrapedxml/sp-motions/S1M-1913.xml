*S1M-1913# Christine Grahame: ME and the Benefits System—That the Parliament notes that, while the Department of Health and Social Security has made it clear that people with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) are entitled to state benefits, the format of questions on the claim forms and the nature of the tests for disability are not appropriate to the symptoms and consequences of this disease; further notes that many of those with ME have difficulty in obtaining benefits to which they are entitled, and believes that the Scottish Executive, through its representatives on the UK Working Group on ME established in 1999, should emphasise these difficulties in order that no-one who is disabled through ME is excluded from accessing appropriate benefits.
