 *S3M-4017♦ Jim Tolson: Settlement for Former Gurkha Soldiers—That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the UK Government’s announcement of new guidelines for the settlement for former Gurkha soldiers, which limits applications for settlement to former soldiers who have served for 20 years or more or who have been awarded the highest military honours; acknowledges the support for the settlement of former Gurkha soldiers by former Gurkha officer, Major Bill MacKay of Dunfermline; further acknowledges over 70 years continuous service given by Sergeant Sunar Gurung, who served with Major Bill MacKay, and his six sons who all served with the Gurkha regiment, and believes that the UK Government’s decision fails to recognise the long history of dedicated service to this country by Gurkha soldiers.
