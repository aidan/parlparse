 S3M-3716 Liam McArthur: 40th Anniversary of the Loss of the Longhope Lifeboat—That the Parliament notes that 17 March 2009 marks the 40th anniversary of the capsizing of the Longhope lifeboat, the TGB, in the Pentland Firth with the loss of its crew of eight who together left behind seven widows and 10 fatherless children; further notes that, despite this incredible blow to the small community at Longhope, the lifeboat station remains active to this day with the crew of the current Tamar class lifeboat, the Helen Comrie, continuing the long tradition of seamanship and bravery displayed since the station was first established in 1874; believes that, as one of the smallest communities to support and crew a lifeboat, the Longhope community reflects the highest traditions and values of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and recognises that, thanks to the service of the crews of the Longhope lifeboats for well over a century, including that of the crew tragically lost in 1969, mariners passing through the Pentland Firth can do so in the confidence that the Longhope lifeboat remains on station ready to come to their aid when required.
