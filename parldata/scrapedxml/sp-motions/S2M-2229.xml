*S2M-2229 Christine Grahame: Care and Repair—That the Parliament marks its concern at the withdrawal by Scottish Borders Council of the handyman service for tenants in the socially-rented sector from the end of 2004, a free service which was much-needed and used by elderly and disabled people in Galashiels and surrounding areas and in particular by those in sheltered and retirement accommodation and which provided much-needed help with tasks such as changing curtains, moving furniture and changing light bulbs; notes that this free service, which must have prevented accident and injury, ended with the launch of the Scottish Executive’s Care and Repair Scheme in the Borders, a service which also provides, inter alia, a handyman service, but only to those in privately-rented accommodation or owner-occupiers, and therefore urges the Executive to make enquiries as to whether the withdrawal of the handyman service to those in socially-rented accommodation has happened elsewhere in Scotland.
