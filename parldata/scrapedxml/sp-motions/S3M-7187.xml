*S3M-7187 Patrick Harvie: Fossil Fuel—That the Parliament shares the ambition of the current administration that Scotland should meet 100% of its electricity demand from renewables by 2025 and considers this an achievable goal; deeply regrets, however, that the Scottish Government’s wider energy policy appears to contradict this objective; is concerned at the support that has been given for what it considers a dramatic expansion of open-cast coal extraction and the current support being expressed for exploratory deep-water oil drilling at the Lagavulin prospect; expresses dismay that MEPs voted against a moratorium on exploratory drilling on 6 October 2010; considers that carbon emissions will not be reduced simply by renewable electricity generation but by the reduction and ultimate elimination of the burning of fossil fuels; understands that the world already has sufficient fossil fuel reserves to make the generally agreed goal of limiting climate change to two degrees impossible to achieve; therefore considers that there is no justification for further exploration in search of new reserves, and calls on the Scottish Government to oppose the continued hunt for new fossil fuels by every means at its disposal.
