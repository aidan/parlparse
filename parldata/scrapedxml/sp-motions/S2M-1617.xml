*S2M-1617 Murdo Fraser: IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Swiss-based IMD International of the IMD – World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004, which includes Scotland as one of its regional cases for the first time; notes that the study ranks Scotland as the 36th most competitive economy out of a total of 60 cases and also places Scotland in 38th place out of 60, nine places behind the United Kingdom as a whole, for the category measuring macro-economic domestic economy; notes that the study concludes that the extent to which government policies are conducive to the competitiveness of the economy places Scotland 39th in the study, Scotland’s lowest placing in the league tables behind countries such as Columbia, India, the Slovak Republic and communist China and underlining the damage that the Scottish Executive’s policies are doing to Scotland’s competitive position, and believes that, if this Executive is serious about growing the economy as the top priority, then it must take heed of this apolitical third-party report and change its policies to create conditions where business can flourish, which should include lowering business rates, reducing bureaucracy, privatising Scottish Water and investing in a transport infrastructure that can get Scottish goods to market.
