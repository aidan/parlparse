*S3M-7737 Robin Harper: Opportunities for Young People—That the Parliament commends the work of Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus in founding, in 1976, the Grameen Bank, which provides microfinance for people living in poverty in Bangladesh; recognises that, since its beginnings in Bangladesh, there arenow Grameen-type programmes tackling poverty across 38 countries around the world and that Grameen America is now branchingout to many new locations in New York, Nebraska, Washington DC and California; believes that there is an opportunity to tackle the growingproblem of unemployment among 16 to 19-year-olds with the establishment of a microcredit scheme for young people in Scotland;notes that this scheme could offer loans for small business ventures to young people who are not in education, employment ortraining and be supported by an entrepreneurial mentoring scheme; further believes that such a scheme would build on thecontribution made by Scotland’s social enterprise sector and draw on Scotland’s long history of entrepreneurial achievement, and calls on the Scottish Government to explore ways to establish a Scottish youth microcredit scheme.
