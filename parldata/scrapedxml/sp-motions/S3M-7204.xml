 *S3M-7204 Jim Hume: East Lothian Community Achievements—That the Parliament congratulates the communities of North Berwick and East Linton on their recent success at the 2010 Britain in Bloom and Beautiful Scotland awards respectively; notes that North Berwick won in the category for coastal towns with a population of less than 12,000 people and secured more than 90% of the available points; considers that East Linton’s silver gilt certificate was recognition of the local community’s hard work to transform the area; further notes that North Berwick has twice won the best overall town category in the Beautiful Scotland contest, the most recent being in 2009, and extends special praise to the North Berwick in Bloom and East Linton in Bloom groups for their commitment, hard work and pride in their communities.
