*S2M-660.2 Nicola Sturgeon: Violence Against Women-As an amendment to motion (S2M-660) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "approves" to end and insert "deplores the fact that while over 36,000 women reported a domestic abuse incident to the police in the last 12 months, over half of the incidents did not lead to the recording of a crime or offence and only 66% of those recorded were referred to the procurator fiscal; is appalled at recent research which shows that Scotland has a prosecution rate of 10% and a conviction rate of 6% following rape allegations, the second poorest conviction rate in Europe; welcomes the "prevention, protection, provision" theme of the National Strategy to Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland and work done to date, but believes that the Scottish Executive must consider what action could reasonably be taken to improve dramatically prosecution and conviction rates for rape and other cases of violence against women."
