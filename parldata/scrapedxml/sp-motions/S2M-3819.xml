*S2M-3819 Richard Baker: Beating Bowel Cancer - 7th Loud Tie Campaign—That the Parliament notes that, despite increased efforts to raise awareness of bowel cancer, 3400 new cases are diagnosed every year in Scotland; believes that, because of the importance of comprehensive screening and early diagnosis, progress made though the new national screening programme will be crucial in reducing the number of deaths from bowel cancer; recognises that the screening programme, already piloted in Grampian, Tayside and Fife, will see over 650,000 potentially vulnerable people screened from 2009; supports further improvements in bowel cancer services, building on the increased patient involvement and public awareness being delivered though managed clinical networks; believes that more needs to be done to raise awareness of bowel cancer; welcomes and supports Beating Bowel Cancer’s seventh “Loud Tie Campaign”, and urges MSPs to wear a loud tie or scarf between 30 January and 5 February 2006 and help beat bowel cancer.
