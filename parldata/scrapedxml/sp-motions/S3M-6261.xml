*S3M-6261 Liam McArthur: NFU Scotland Calls for Land Eligibility Penalty Amnesty—That the Parliament notes that the tightening of the land eligibility rules governing claims for Single Farm Payment (SFP) or Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) has resulted in farmers and crofters suffering retrospective penalties on their 2009 SFP claims when land previously used to claim support payments is deemed ineligible under the new interpretation of the rules; considers that many farmers and crofters have been left uncertain of how to properly fill out their 2010 application forms for SFP and LFASS in time for the 17 May 2010 deadline because of a lack of clarity in the interpretation of the rules; believes that there is a manifest injustice when anyone is penalised where the rules have, in effect, been changed without proper notice and explanation; also believes that it is very unsatisfactory for farmers and crofters to be left without clarification on how the rules are now being applied with the application deadline fast approaching, and urges the Scottish Government to issue without delay clear guidance on the new interpretation of the rules and to respond positively to the call from NFU Scotland for the introduction of an immediate amnesty on penalties associated with eligibility of land for support scheme purposes and for moves to reduce the impact on farmers and crofters of the tighter interpretation of the rules. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
