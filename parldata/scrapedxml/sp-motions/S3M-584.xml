*S3M-584 Joe FitzPatrick: David Cairns’ Comments on New Nuclear Power Stations—That the Parliament notes with concern the comments made by David Cairns MP, Minister of State at the Scotland Office, in support of new nuclear power stations in Scotland; believes that, rather than opting for new nuclear power stations and a dangerous, dirty and expensive technology, Scotland should instead be doing everything possible to promote our nation as a centre of excellence for genuinely clean and safe energy technologies, and further believes that support for nuclear power can only undermine efforts by the Scottish Government to make Scotland nuclear-free and a global leader in clean renewable energy.
