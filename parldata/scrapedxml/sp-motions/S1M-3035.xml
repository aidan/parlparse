*S1M-3035 Alasdair Morgan: PGCE Secondary Courses in Geography, Drama, Biology and Chemistry at Jordanhill Campus-That the Parliament deplores the decision of the Scottish Executive to direct the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to limit the recruitment of students at Jordanhill Campus of the University of Strathclyde in the areas of geography, drama, biology and chemistry to not more than 85, having the month before indicated to the University that they should expect to recruit some 175 such students, a decision which has resulted in the University issuing 136 legally binding offers for such courses for which they will now receive funding for only 85; notes that the Principal of the University of Strathclyde has described the Executive's decision as "capricious and ill-considered", and calls upon the Executive to review its decision.
