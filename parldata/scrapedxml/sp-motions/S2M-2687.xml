 S2M-2687 # Cathy Peattie: Race Equality Dutyâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the initial progress that key public authorities in Scotland have made to address their statutory duty to promote race equality under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000; recognises the supportive and enforcement measures that the Commission for Racial Equality Scotland has taken to assist them in getting to this stage; notes that authorities are required to review their arrangements for complying with the duty over the next three years by November 2005, and considers that all authorities should fully implement their existing arrangements and refresh their arrangements by November in order to ensure that they reflect best practice and make continued advancement towards eliminating the considerable racial inequalities which continue to exist in the provision of services.
