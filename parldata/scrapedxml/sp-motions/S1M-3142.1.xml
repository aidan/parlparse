 *S1M-3142.1 Murdo Fraser: Conservative Support for Creationist Schools-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3142) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "astonishment" to end and insert "disappointment the hypocrisy of the Scottish National Party, which one week proclaimed itself the champion of choice and diversity in education and the next condemns any educators with whom they disagree; derides Michael Russell's assumption that creationist views have nothing to do with the great religious faiths in Scotland and the wider world when there are different views among Christians in many mainstream denominations on the question of creation and evolution; notes that, under Conservative proposals, any state-funded school in Scotland would be required to teach the curriculum and be subject to inspections by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education; warmly welcomes the findings of the poll commissioned by the Catholic Church in Scotland which showed that the majority of Scots support the right of Catholic parents to send their children to Catholic schools and that the overwhelming majority of Scots believe that moral values should be taught in schools; recognises the importance of diversity in Scottish education, and believes that the best way to deliver this is through greater parental choice."
