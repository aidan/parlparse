*S3M-3867 Pauline McNeill: The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement from the Scottish Funding Council that drama courses at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama will be funded at conservatoire level; believes that pitching the funding at an appropriate level ensures that the academy’s funding is in line with institutions such as the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama; considers that this announcement confirms that the academy is at the forefront of drama education internationally, demonstrated by its recent Research Assessment Exercise result; notes that this decision follows a concerted campaign by members of opposition parties calling on the Scottish Government to ensure that drama courses are funded at the appropriate level, and congratulates the academy on its continued status as Scotland’s internationally renowned conservatoire of music and drama. Supported by: Karen Gillon*, Mary Mulligan*, Des McNulty*, Claire Baker*, Robin Harper*, Elaine Smith*, Iain Smith*
