*S2M-423# Linda Fabiani: Civilian Peace Service—That the Parliament recognises that 5 November is a powerful reminder that religious and other divisions can escalate destructively into conflict; welcomes the initiative of churches, faith groups, non-government organisations, the Scottish Centre for Nonviolence, the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly, the United Nations Association and others to promote in Scotland the concept of a civilian peace service, and endorses the need for a standing, trained service with a key role in conflict resolution and post-conflict peace-building.
