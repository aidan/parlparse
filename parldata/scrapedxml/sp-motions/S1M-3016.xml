*S1M-3016 Trish Godman: The 150th Anniversary of The Lifeboat Magazine-That the Parliament warmly commends the editor and staff of The Lifeboat, the magazine of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), on its 150th anniversary; believes that The Lifeboat plays an important role in informing its many readers of all elements of the lifeboat service, including detailed accounts of the numerous rescues carried out by the gallant lifeboat crews, fleet renewals, the fundraising activities of dedicated RNLI supporters and much more; remembers, too, the efforts of previous editors and staff of the magazine who ensured its survival during difficult years, including the two world wars, and, in particular, offers sincere thanks to the crews of the lifeboats whose bravery is so readily acknowledged in the pages of The Lifeboat and by those who live in our maritime communities.
