*S2M-2719# Tommy Sheridan: Smugness of English Commentators and Failure of English Football Managers—That the Parliament congratulates the two English Premiership football teams who have reached the semi-final stage of the European Champions League but regrets the continued smugness and arrogance displayed by various English football commentators in relation to this achievement; notes the failure of English-born football managers to secure success in the English FA Cup, the English Premiership, the European Champions League or indeed for the English international team, and hopes that in future years an English team managed by an English manager may reach the latter stages of domestic and European competitions and may even one day win the English Premiership.
