 *S2M-79# Pauline McNeill: Local Bus Routes —That the Parliament expresses concerns over powers of deregulated bus operators to alter local bus routes without prior consultation and notice to local communities; believes that it is not acceptable that profitability is put before access in such cases; is particularly concerned about the adverse effect of such changes on older people, those with disabilities and parents with young children, restricting their access to vital services and facilities; notes that the negative experience of such changes in communities such as Bromhill, Anderson and Townhead in Glasgow has resulted in community campaigns to reinstate bus services; further notes that there is currently no legal requirement for bus operators to consult members of the public on the variation of bus routes and that bus operators are reluctant to provide advance warning of changes owing to commercial sensitivities; notes that there is no statutory duty for a strategic authority to assess gaps created in bus services, and believes that measures should be considered by the Parliament to create statutory duties on bus operators to consult communities on proposed changes to local bus routes and to ensure that bus operators serve hospitals and key services, regardless of profitability.
