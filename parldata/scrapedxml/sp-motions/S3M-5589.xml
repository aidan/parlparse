*S3M-5589 Robin Harper: Bee Research, Monoculture and Allotments—That the Parliament notes the publication of research by the French National Institute for Agronomic Research, based in Avignon, proving for the first time that a more diverse diet of different kinds of pollen can boost bee immunity; considers that this suggests that modern intensive monoculture farming is one of at least three major factors contributing to the alarming rates of decline in bee numbers across Europe, amounting in the United Kingdom to a 20% loss in the 2008-09 winter period, and calls on the Scottish Government to work, in this, the international year of biodiversity, to see what improvements in biodiversity can be made through assistance to large-scale farming and extra assistance to small-scale and organic farming and, in particular, encouragement to local authorities to persuade them to open up land for allotment development in order to address this serious problem and halt the decline in honey and bumblebees that afflicts the countryside at present.
