 *S3M-7961 Sandra White: University Cuts Don’t Add Up—That the Parliament condemns cost-cutting proposals by management at the University of Glasgow, which will reportedly see the university’s nursing courses and what is considered its highly valued modern languages department decimated alongside adult learning courses, which, it believes, have brought immeasurable benefit to many adult learners; understands that, contrary to the view being put forward by the university’s principal, Anton Muscatelli, the University of Glasgow received an increase in public funding this year; further considers that claims that the institution could run out of money by 2013 are severely undermined by the fact that the £3 million savings proposed by these cuts represent less than 1% of the university’s income; believes that Glasgow’s world-renowned reputation for academic excellence will be threatened by these proposals, and hopes that the university’s principal and management will, in the face of such widespread opposition, abandon what it considers these ill-thought-out and discredited proposals.
