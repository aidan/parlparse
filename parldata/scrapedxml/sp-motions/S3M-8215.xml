 *S3M-8215 Anne McLaughlin: Victory for Haitian Women—That the Parliament welcomes the return of the democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and his wife and colleague, Mildred Trouillot, to Haiti on 18 March 2011; recognises that Haitian women spearheaded the seven-year struggle for Aristide’s return; backs the International Women’s Day call by Oganizasyon Fanm Vanyan (Brave Women’s Organisation), a group of women in tent cities and sweatshops and market vendors, demanding the right to welcome home their chosen leader; condemns what it considers the undemocratic and fraudulent exclusion of Lavalas, Aristide’s political party, from the election, and further condemns any additional outside interference with the sovereign rights of the Haitian people.
