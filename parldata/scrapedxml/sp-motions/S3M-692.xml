 *S3M-692 Elaine Smith: Human Papilloma Virus—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government’s commitment to introduce a vaccination programme against the most dangerous strains of human papilloma virus (HPV); understands that sexually transmitted HPV is extremely common among men and women in the United Kingdom and has been found to cause 75% of cervical cancers and 90% of the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection in clinics in Scotland, genital warts; supports the assurances given on the future vaccination of girls aged between 12 and 13 years and recognises that there are discussions surrounding a catch-up programme for young women up to the age of 16; further recognises that trials are ongoing on the vaccine’s efficacy in protecting men from a range of cancers; acknowledges the potential benefits which the vaccination of young men could bring in terms of both improving men’s health in Scotland and of cost savings for the NHS in genito-urinary medicine and cancer treatment, and urges ministers to consider fully these factors when determining the shape of Scotland’s vaccination programme.
