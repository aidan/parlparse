 * S2M-3292 Alex Johnstone:Lumphanan’s Macbeth Day—That the Parliament congratulates the community of Lumphanan for holding a Macbeth Day on 17 September 2005 to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of the birth of Macbeth, King of Scots from 1040 to 1057; appreciates that well-organised entertaining and educational events such as this will demonstrate to Scots the truth about Macbeth’s reign and help dispel the unfortunate myths surrounding the king generated mainly by Shakespeare’s “Scottish Play”, and calls for more work to be done to highlight Macbeth’s place in a successful and forward-looking 11th century Scotland.
