 *S3M-5105 Bob Doris: Glasgow Caledonian University Leading the Way on Widening Access to Higher Education—That the Parliament believes that access to a university education should be widened to ensure that people from all communities, including those from the most deprived backgrounds, can benefit and should be based on talent and ability and not on social background or ability to pay; notes that this is particularly important in Glasgow, given the recent University and College Union report that placed three Glasgow constituencies, Glasgow north east, south west and east in the poorest performing 7% of constituencies in the United Kingdom, based on adults having a university degree; notes that the matter is compounded by the lack of any qualifications at all by many adults in these areas, most notably in Glasgow east, which ranks 623 out of 629 in terms of qualifications; in this context congratulates Glasgow Caledonian University on being the only Scottish university to receive both the UK Award for Lifelong Learning and the award for Widening Participation Initiative of the Year; acknowledges that this is the second year that Glasgow Caledonian University has been recognised for its excellence in education after receiving the 2008 Award for Outstanding Support for Overseas Students; recognises the great contribution to Glasgow’s communities that the university and its Caledonian Club have made, and highlights the students’ and faculty’s continued effort to promote lifelong learning and higher education.
