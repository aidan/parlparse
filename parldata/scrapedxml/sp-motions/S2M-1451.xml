*S2M-1451 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Heart Week 5 to 13 June 2004-That the Parliament congratulates the British Heart Foundation on its Heart Week campaign, the Big Red Fightback, from 5 to 13 June 2004, against coronary heart disease (CHD); notes that, while heart disease rates in Scotland are falling, more people than ever before are living with the disease; further notes that lack of physical activity is one of the key causes of CHD, yet only around one in three men and one in four women achieves the recommended 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week, and therefore believes that the Heart Week campaign's focus on encouraging people to increase their level of physical exercise will be an important contribution to fighting the causes of heart disease in Scotland.
