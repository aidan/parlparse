 * S2M-2866.1 Murdo Fraser: Student and Graduate Debt—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2866) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from “further” to end and insert “calls on the Scottish Executive to end the graduate endowment which places an increased debt burden on students; recommends that the student loan repayment threshold be raised to £20,000 and that the loan value be increased to £5,000 per annum at a low, but commercial, rate of interest, which will remove the necessity for students to resort to expensive overdraft and credit card borrowing, and calls on the Executive to transfer all or part of the loan book to independent providers so that higher education can expand without extra and undue burden being placed on the taxpayer.”
