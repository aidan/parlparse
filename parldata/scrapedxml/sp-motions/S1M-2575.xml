S1M-2575# Irene McGugan: Recruitment and Retention Crisis in Social Work-That the Parliament notes with concern that the crisis of recruitment and retention in the social work profession is now acute, as evidenced by the fact that 78% of local authorities who responded to a recent SNP survey highlighted this as a serious concern; further notes that there has been an increase in referrals and statutory obligations to childcare social work without resources to meet the needs and that, where child poverty and deprivation is highest, the crisis worsens, with some areas recently recording a vacancy rate of 24% with 29% of cases unallocated; is concerned that there has been a steady fall in applications to social work departments over the last five years and that in consequence Scotland's most vulnerable children and young people are being failed at a time when they are most in need of support, and considers that the Executive should take action to ensure that the role of childcare social workers is valued and should as a matter of urgency make a commitment to a comprehensive review of the terms and conditions of social workers which will address the particular circumstances of the profession and improve the current poor public image of social work for the benefit of all children in need.
