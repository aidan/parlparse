*S3M-400 Murdo Fraser: Scottish Monument for Great War Soldiers in Flanders—That the Parliament expresses its gratitude to the people of Flanders for erecting a Celtic cross to commemorate Scotland’s fallen soldiers of the Great War; notes that the unveiling of the monument took place on 25 August 2007 on the Frezenberg Ridge in Zonnebeke which is where Scottish soldiers fought during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917; thanks everyone who contributed towards the memorial and the commemorations, in particular Burgomaster Dirk Cardoen, First Alderman Franky Bryon and the Town Council of the municipality of Zonnebeke, and Erwin Ureel and all the staff of the Passchendale Memorial Museum 1917, and hopes that Scots will continue to remember yesterday’s fallen and that many will journey to Flanders to the Scottish monument to learn about, and reflect on, the sacrifice that was made by our Scottish soldiers.
