*S2M-2041 Robin Harper: Colombian Green Presidential Candidate, Ingrid Betancourt—That the Parliament notes with great concern that Ingrid Betancourt, Presidential candidate and Leader of the Colombian Green Party (Partido Verde Oxigeno) has now been held for 1,000 days by FARC (The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) having been abducted on 23 February 2002; recognises that before her abduction, and despite threats to her life, Ingrid Betancourt was a brave champion of peace and democracy in her troubled country, and requests that Her Majesty’s Government redouble its representations to the Colombian Government to do everything in its power to secure the safe release of Ingrid and her campaign manager Clara Rojas.
