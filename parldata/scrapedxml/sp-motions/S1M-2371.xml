*S1M-2371 Shona Robison: Licensing of the Sale of Fireworks-That the Parliament notes with concern the public safety issues surrounding the irresponsible use of fireworks; recognises that this is in part due to fireworks being sold illegally to or for those under 18 years old; believes that only those considered to be "fit and proper persons" should be able to sell fireworks and urges the Scottish Executive to consider extending the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 to require such persons to be licensed in order to sell fireworks.
