*S2M-1112 Tommy Sheridan: Scotland-wide Referenda-That the Parliament believes that the provision of nutritional, healthy, free school meals for all children, the replacement of the council tax with an income-based alternative and returning rail and bus services to public ownership along with the gas and electricity industries are extremely popular across Scotland and that each of these vital issues should be subject to an individual Scotland-wide referendum as soon as practically possible.
