*S3M-2171 Kenneth Gibson: Age of Alcohol Purchase—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the 2006 Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey that 84% of 15-year-olds reported ever having drunk alcohol, while 36% had had a drink in the previous week, that in 2006-07 there were 41,651 discharges from general hospitals with an alcohol-related diagnosis, or 762 per 100,000 population, an increase of 7% from 710 per 100,000 population in 2002-03, that the number of alcohol-related deaths went from less than one-in-100 in 1980 to one-in-30 in 2005, including contributing to one-in-three adult pedestrian fatalities and 50% of deaths caused by fire; notes that, in the Scottish Health Survey 2003, 27% of Scottish men and approximately 13% of Scottish women reported usual alcohol consumption in excess of the recommended weekly limit; notes that alcohol misuse costs Scottish society at least £1,071 million per year; commends the Scottish Government’s Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems and its recognition of the fact that "in Scotland we face a substantial challenge in readjusting our attitudes and behaviours in relation to alcohol, and in particular, educating our young people to adopt a sensible approach to alcohol consumption"; notes that many studies show that in the United States of America raising the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) from 18 to 21 years showed significant decreases in traffic crashes and traffic fatalities as well as a decrease in the proportion of 17 to 18-year-old students reported drinking in the last month from 72% in 1980 to 51% in 1999, the period immediately following widespread adoption of the rise in MLDA; recognises the dangers of alcohol misuse by those of all age groups and the pressing need to create a culture of responsible, rather than binge, drinking, and believes that the Scottish Government should limit the sale of alcohol in off-sales and supermarkets to people aged 21 and over, not only to help reduce accidents and encourage a more sensible approach to drinking but also to reduce the incidence of alcohol-fuelled youth disorder.
