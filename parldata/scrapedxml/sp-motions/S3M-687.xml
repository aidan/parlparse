 *S3M-687 Elaine Smith: Not for Sale—That the Parliament notes the conference entitled Challenging Demand, organised by the Women’s Support Project, that explores the issue of commercial sexual exploitation; welcomes to Scotland Professor Gail Dines and Dr Rebecca Whisnant, two visiting American academics, who are addressing the conference; believes that prostitution and pornography are part of the continuum of violence against women and are predicated on gender inequality and a perception of women’s subordination; further believes that the Parliament should take whatever action is necessary to challenge the demand for women’s bodies to be traded for men’s sexual gratification; urges the Scottish Government to provide better funding to allow exploited women to have their voices heard, and sends out a clear message that women in Scotland are "Not for Sale."
