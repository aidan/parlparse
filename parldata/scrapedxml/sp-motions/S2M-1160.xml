 *S2M-1160 David Mundell: BBC Scotland Local TV News Bulletins-That the Parliament notes that a recent BBC review of news programming confirmed that audiences wanted more local broadcasting; welcomes the comments of BBC Scotland Controller, Ken MacQuarrie, indicating that the BBC in Scotland is now considering providing local TV news bulletins to run alongside its existing output, and looks forward to the pilot scheme which, Mr MacQuarrie stated, would probably take place in the south west of Scotland.
