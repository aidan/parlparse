*S3M-6015♦ Helen Eadie: Royal National Lifeboat Institution—That the Parliament recalls that the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was first founded in 1824, leading 30 years later to the formation of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and has been responsible for the saving of over 200,000 lives; remembers that the service is dependent on the volunteers who both support and run the service, ensuring that the financial resources are there, with little or no cost to the public purse, to maintain the boats and equipment needed when disasters strike on the coast; believes that the RNLI provides the country with a first-class emergency service that is the envy of the world; wishes all supporters and volunteers of the RNLI every success, and commends and highlights the support given by Dalgety Bay Sailing Club and, in particular, the late Alastair Burnside who, with his wife, made a very special contribution locally to the work of the RNLI.
