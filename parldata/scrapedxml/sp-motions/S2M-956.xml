*S2M-956# Carolyn Leckie: Conflicts of Interest and Vaccination Policy-That the Parliament notes the lecture given by Member of Congress, Representative Dave Weldon, M.D. to the Institute of Medicine in the United States of America, on 9 February 2004 in which he cites the in-built conflict of interest of the Center for Disease Control, which "is tasked with promoting vaccination, ensuring high vaccination rates and monitoring the safety of vaccines", which means that "they serve as their own watchdog - neither common nor desirable when seeking unbiased research"; recognises that this same conflict is replicated in the United Kingdom by our system and believes that such a conflict fatally undermines confidence in vaccination policy and is untenable; notes the interests, including direct financial interests in pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines, of members of bodies such as the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Medicines Control Agency; notes that Dr Andrew Wakefield has issued a full statement robustly defending the allegations against him and welcoming any investigation into his research; recognises that his findings have been replicated by, for example, Dr Arthur Krigsman, consultant paediatric gastro-enterologist at Harvard University and Kawashima, Takayuki et al, in "Detection and Sequencing of Measles Virus from Peripheral Mononuclear Cells from Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Autism", Digestive Diseases and Sciences vol. 45, No. 4, April 2000, pages 723-729; is concerned to note the lack of government-funded medical research and examination of autistic children; notes with concern the physical findings of persistent measles virus in the guts and cerebro-spinal fluid of autistic children with bowel problems who have been examined, and believes that the Scottish Executive and the Chief Scientist Office should proactively seek to fund and enable replicative clinical research to identify the cause, or causes, of autism, with particular reference to gastrointestinal dysfunction identified by parents, Dr Wakefield and others.
