*S2M-3697 Chris Ballance: Peace Workers in Iraq—That the Parliament notes the plight of the four hostages in Iraq, who were working for Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT), including US Green Party member and Quaker, Tom Fox; notes that the four CPT members were travelling unarmed and without bodyguards, which is inconsistent with the accusation that they are spies or acting in any capacity with the US Government or armed forces; applauds the brave work of all those who are committed to front-line peacekeeping around the world, and joins with the over 20,000 people, including Tariq Ali, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Ralph Nader, who have signed a petition calling for the immediate release of these hostages so that they can continue their essential work as witnesses and peacemakers in Iraq. Supported by: Donald Gorrie*
