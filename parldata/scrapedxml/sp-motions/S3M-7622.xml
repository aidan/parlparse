*S3M-7622 Christine Grahame: Remove the BBC Weather Tilt—That the Parliament renews calls on the BBC to remove the distorted tilt to the BBC television weather map; believes that this results in poorer detail for viewers in Scotland and gives a warped visual representation that implies that England is geographically bigger than it actually is; considers that, in the current adverse weather, it is vital for viewers in Scotland in particular to secure accurate and detailed weather forecast information and that the current tilt is reducing the amount of information that viewers in Scotland are getting, and therefore calls on the BBC to reinstate the vertical aerial map of the UK.
