*S2M-4740 Jim Mather: Concessionary Tickets and Tariff Charges by Caledonian MacBrayne—That the Parliament expresses concern that Caledonian MacBrayne’s recent decision to rigorously apply the current tariff system removing concessionary tickets for commercial vehicles of 5 metres or less in length is now dramatically increasing transport costs for business people and other island residents when, for more than 20 years, Caledonian MacBrayne has recognised that there should be rebates via access to concessionary tickets for such vehicles because of the difficulty of determining on any specific occasion whether or not any such vehicle was carrying goods for hire or reward and, as a result of this practice, Caledonian MacBrayne has over those 20 years effectively encouraged local business people to purchase such vehicles and develop business models that depend on this reasonable pro-enterprise approach and calls on Caledonian MacBrayne to reinstate its former policy to ensure the viability of local businesses and the affordability of goods and services to and from the islands.
