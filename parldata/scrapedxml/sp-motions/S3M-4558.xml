 S3M-4558 Margaret Mitchell: Tribute to Scotland’s Justices of the Peace—That the Parliament recognises that justices of the peace have served Scotland for over 400 years; notes that the role has changed considerably in recent years with reforms to the lay justice system; pays tribute to the many men and women who have taken up this important role in Scotland; recognises the valuable contribution that they have made to Scotland’s criminal justice system, and hopes that this will continue to be supported and upheld in years to come.
