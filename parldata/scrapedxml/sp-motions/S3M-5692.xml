*S3M-5692 Ian McKee: LGBT Centre Addressing Health Inequalities—That the Parliament congratulates the Edinburgh-based LGBT Centre for Health and Wellbeing for the valuable and essential services that it provides to promote the mental health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Scotland; understands that, while there have been significant positive changes in legislation over the past decade, the everyday experience of LGBT people is that discrimination, prejudice and hate crime continue, which can have a devastating effect on self-esteem and lead to poor mental and physical health; supports the charity’s vital work to address social isolation, poor mental health and health inequalities among one of Scotland’s most invisible minorities, and wishes the charity every success in its vision of a Scotland where sexual orientation and gender identity do not act as barriers to accessing services or are indicators of poor health outcomes.
