 *S3M-1026# Rhona Brankin: Lady Victoria Colliery - Our Most Treasured Place—That the Parliament notes the public poll organised by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland to find Scotland’s most treasured place from its archive of images as a prelude to its centenary celebrations in 2008; welcomes the funding support for the initiative from the Heritage Lottery Fund; commends the engagement with the public which this competition represents; congratulates the former Lady Victoria Colliery in Newtongrange, now the home of the Scottish Mining Museum, on coming first in the public vote; notes that the colliery is Europe’s best preserved 19th century pit complex, has been awarded VisitScotland’s Five Star Excellence Award for four consecutive years and is denoted as being of national or international significance by Historic Scotland; considers the colliery to be a hugely important part of Scotland’s industrial heritage; notes that a report from a structural engineer has identified that the buildings are increasingly fragile and require £2.5 million to preserve them, and believes that the necessary steps should be taken to ensure that the fabric of the colliery buildings is secured for the enjoyment and education of future generations.
