*S1M-2815 Ms Sandra White: Glasgow University Student Accomodation Sell Off-That the Parliament notes with concern the plans of the University of Glasgow to sell off over half of its student accommodation to a private housing association; further notes the concerns of students with regard to resulting rent increases, the lack of consultation with student bodies on campus and their exclusion from key talks on the issue; believes that this can only result in increased hardship for students already burdened with debt from loans and tuition fees, and therefore calls on the University of Glasgow to reconsider the decision to sell off its student accommodation.
