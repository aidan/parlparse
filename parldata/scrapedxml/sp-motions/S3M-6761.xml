 *S3M-6761 Shirley-Anne Somerville: More Tourists for Edinburgh—That the Parliament welcomes the Office of National Statistics estimate that an extra 133,000 overseas visitors were attracted to Edinburgh last year; recognises that Edinburgh is the United Kingdom’s most popular tourist destination after London; considers that this is excellent news for the local economy, which has benefited from a 28.6% rise in tourist spending in the last year, and believes that, with its amazing history, culture and iconic views, Edinburgh is a must-see destination for international tourists.
