*S3M-561.1 Claire Baker: Alcohol and Pregnancy: A Dangerous Cocktail—As an amendment to motion (S3M-561) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from first "pregnancy" to end and insert "some pregnancies, with miscarriage, stillbirth and pre-term delivery among many possible effects; welcomes the recent publication of the British Medical Association (BMA) report, Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, A Guide for Healthcare Professionals; notes that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a severe condition that permanently impairs brain and nervous system functions and can lead to physical abnormalities among children; supports BMA recommendations for further research into FASD; believes that the Scottish Government should consider the implementation of guidance and further training of healthcare professionals on the prevention, diagnosis and management of FASD at the earliest practical opportunity; is aware that six out of 10 mothers drink alcohol while pregnant, many of whom are unaware of the danger to their unborn child; asks the Scottish Government to raise public awareness of this issue and to promote the Chief Medical Officer’s health advice that alcohol should not be consumed during pregnancy, while ensuring that any revision of guidance on alcohol consumption should contain specific advice on the risk of FASD and other side effects during pregnancy, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with Scottish-based alcohol producers to encourage them to provide information to consumers about the associated risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy following the example set by alcohol producers in both France and America."
