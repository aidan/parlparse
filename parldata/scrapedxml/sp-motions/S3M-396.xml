*S3M-396 Bill Wilson: Playwrights’ Studio and Scottish Theatre—That the Parliament congratulates Playwrights’ Studio, Scotland on the exemplary work that it has done in developing and promoting Scottish playwrights and theatre at every level; also congratulates Scottish playwrights on the breadth and quality of their work; notes that these achievements are evident in the approximately 550 works by contemporary Scottish playwrights in the bookshop of Playwrights’ Studio, Scotland; notes the importance of theatre in encouraging healthy discourse in an era when mainstream media often fail to provide an adequate forum for debating serious issues; notes the international impact of recent Scottish theatre and the significant return on investment that it has yielded, both with respect to Scotland’s international reputation and to direct benefits to the people of Scotland; notes that there is every indication that the secure long-term funding of Playwrights’ Studio, Scotland would have further considerable benefits for the nation, and trusts that these facts will be noted by the Scottish Arts Council/Creative Scotland when it comes to making funding decisions.
