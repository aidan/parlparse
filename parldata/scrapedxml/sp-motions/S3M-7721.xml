*S3M-7721 Des McNulty: Bus Service Withdrawals Affecting Duntocher, Hardgate, Faifley, Bearsden and Milngavie—That the Parliament is concerned at the decision by First Bus to withdraw services on the 118 route between Duntocher and Glasgow except during morning and evening peak times from Mondays to Fridays; notes that services from Glasgow will terminate at Baljaffray shops at all other times; is further concerned at the withdrawal of all services from Monday to Saturday after 7pm and all Sunday services on the route and the introduction of an hourly instead of half-hourly service on the 119 route; believes that insufficient consideration has been given to the people who will be adversely affected by the changes; is of the view that working people, schoolchildren and pensioners in the Duntocher, Hardgate, Faifley, Bearsden and Milngavie areas will be greatly inconvenienced by these changes by First Bus; believes that vital routes must be protected, and supports the reregulation of bus routes in Scotland as an urgent priority.
