 * S2M-2575 Christine Grahame:Sodexho School Meals and Lifestyle Survey 2005—That the Parliament notes that, according to the Sodexho School Meals and Lifestyle Survey 2005 which questioned not only children but parents and teachers, on average Scottish schoolchildren spend a total of £1.75 on the way to and from school on confectionery, crisps, chocolate and canned drinks in addition to money spent on lunch and that, 24% of Scottish schoolchildren help themselves to food from the fridge for their evening meal compared to 12% for the United Kingdom (UK) as a whole, 59% said that their school had a vending machine compared to 41% in the UK as a whole, 77% said that they were allowed to leave the school premises at lunchtime, again the highest total in the UK; further notes that 44% said they were too lazy to exercise compared to 30% UK-wide; expresses its concern at the thrust of these findings, and urges the Scottish Executive to undertake a survey among Scotland’s pupils, both primary and secondary, along the lines of the Jamie Oliver “Grub Log” to determine how accurate or otherwise these findings are.
