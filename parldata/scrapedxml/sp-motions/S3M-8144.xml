*S3M-8144 Irene Oldfather: Condemning the Promotion of Smoking During Paris Fashion Weekâ€”That the Parliament was disappointed to see national newspapers use images of Kate Moss smoking a cigarette while modelling for Louis Vuitton at Paris Fashion Week; condemns the use of cigarettes and smoking as a method of highlighting fashion and gaining publicity; considers that images of models smoking can be very attractive to young people, who might aspire to be like such icons, and that such high-profile images detract from the work carried out to prevent young people from smoking and in educating them on the harm that it causes; notes that it is estimated that 15,000 young people take up smoking in Scotland every year and that it causes one quarter of all adult deaths, and further considers tobacco to be highly addictive and that its easy availability and visibility can lead to young people becoming hooked, which is damaging to their health and the health of those around them.
