 *S3M-4653 Brian Adam: BBC Trust Support for Scottish Football on Terrestrial TV—That the Parliament welcomes the decision from the BBC Trust in its submission to the UK Government’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport to seek the protection of Scottish international football matches by adding live home and away qualifiers to the A-list, giving them the same level of protection as the Scottish Cup, and believes that this is a significant step forward in the campaign to return live Scottish football to terrestrial television where it is available to the widest possible audience.
