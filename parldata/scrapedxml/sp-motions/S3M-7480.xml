*S3M-7480 Patricia Ferguson: European Award for Maryhill Burgh Halls—That the Parliament notes that what is considered Maryhill’s historic Burgh Halls has won the award for Best Contribution to Urban Regeneration in Scotland through the use of European Structural Funds in the 2007 to 2013 programme; notes that this award recognises the Maryhill Burgh Halls Trust’s work in involving the community throughout the project and undertaking significant ongoing outreach work with local organisations and the best practice for bringing together sensitive historic building restoration with dynamic contemporary design and new outdoor spaces; believes that the refurbishment of the halls, which is scheduled for completion in the summer of 2011, will play a significant role in the ongoing regeneration of the communities of Maryhill, and congratulates all those who have played a part in bringing what it considers this important building back to life.
