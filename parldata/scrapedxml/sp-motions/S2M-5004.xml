*S2M-5004 Irene Oldfather: Alzheimer’s Drug Treatments—That the Parliament regrets the recent announcement by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) that it has rejected all appeals and that drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease will in future only be available on the NHS to people with moderate Alzheimer’s disease; recognises that this means that people with mild Alzheimer’s disease will no longer be eligible for treatment; notes that the current cost of the treatments is less than 0.3% of the total NHS Scotland drugs budget; is aware, however, that these treatments have been assessed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network as clinically effective at all stages of Alzheimer’s disease; notes that memantine, currently widely prescribed across Europe and the United States of America for the treatment of severe Alzheimer’s disease, is also not being recommended for use; acknowledges that the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of General Practitioners also believe that these drugs are effective treatments in improving quality of life for people with Alzheimer’s disease; is concerned that NICE’s appraisal focused solely on statistical, clinical and cost-effectiveness information and did not take into account the wider positive impact that these drugs can have on the lives of people with Alzheimer’s disease and their families, including maintaining independence for longer and alleviating the impact of the disease on carers’ own health and quality of life; notes that NICE’s decision applies in England and Wales and takes effect on 22 November 2006; is aware that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) will publish its comment on the guidance on that date, which will then set the rules for NHS boards in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to listen to the views of patients, carers and clinicians alike, as well as any guidance from NHS QIS, and consider adopting a different position in Scotland to allow people at all stages of Alzheimer’s disease to continue receiving the medication that their GP or consultant recommends.
