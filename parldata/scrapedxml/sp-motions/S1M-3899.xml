 *S1M-3899 Tommy Sheridan: Closure of Glasgow City Social Security Office—That the Parliament recognises that those who rely on social security benefits are the most vulnerable in society and include elderly, disabled and infirm people and that these sections of the community often have difficulties with mobility and access to modern communications such as telephones and the internet; believes that social security is best delivered in properly staffed, local offices that are accessible to the community; is therefore dismayed at the plans of the Department for Work and Pensions for social security provision in Scotland including the closure of the Glasgow city office in 2003, which will mean a reduction in service and increased travel for the people in areas such as Glasgow city centre, Townhead, Possilpark, Hamiltonhill and Charing Cross who are seeking social security benefits advice and services, and the replacement of local overpayments sections with debt centres; is concerned at the absence of proper public debate and consultation on the closure of the Glasgow city office, and calls on the Department for Work and Pensions to keep the office open in its current form as a local social security office.
