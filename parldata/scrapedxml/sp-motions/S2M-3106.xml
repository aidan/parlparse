 *S2M-3106 Christine Grahame: Flawed Draft Hepatitis C Planâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the comments of Dr Nicola Rowan, Director of the Mainliners UK Hepatitis C Resource Centre in Scotland, that the draft hepatitis C action plan for Scotland neglects vital areas of care for people living with the virus and that there was "very little detail" about treatment and support for those already infected and seemed to be "little will to adequately address the fact" that the majority remain undiagnosed; further notes with alarm that, of the 50,000 individuals estimated to be infected with Hepatitis C in Scotland, at least 60% remain undetected and yet the plan proposes "low key" awareness raising for the public; considers that of particular concern is the lack of funding to make the proposals workable according to Dr Rowan, a comment supported by David Liddell, Director of the Scottish Drugs Forum, and in all the circumstances calls on the Scottish Executive to respond to these concerns with immediacy.
