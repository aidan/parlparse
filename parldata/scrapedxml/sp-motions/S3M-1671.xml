*S3M-1671 Hugh O’Donnell: Council for Scottish Archaeology Changes its Name—That the Parliament welcomes the new name and re-branding of the Council for Scottish Archaeology (CSA) to Archaeology Scotland (AS), from 1 April 2008; agrees with the CSA Board that the new name and the changes associated with it will give a new impetus to the protection and promotion of Scotland’s rich archaeological heritage, and welcomes the fact that CSA/AS have been assured that protection of all archaeological and historical sites is now a condition of grant for all recipients of agri-environment grants under Tier 2 - Land Management Options and Tier 3 - Rural Priorities.
