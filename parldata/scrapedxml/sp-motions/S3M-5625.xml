*S3M-5625 Robin Harper: Reductions in Teacher Training Staff—That the Parliament notes that so few recently qualified teachers are gaining employment after their induction year that Scotland now faces a proposed cut in admissions to teacher training of over 1,000 students and could be facing a cut in the teacher education budget of £8 million, raising fears of large-scale redundancies among teacher educators, and calls on the Scottish Government and the educational establishment to do all that they can to retain teacher educators in post in order to ensure sustainable regrowth in the teacher training sector in the future and to employ the present workforce with funding from the schools development budget to take forward the Curriculum for Excellence development that is so urgently required and, by further work with local authorities, to do everything possible to retain recently qualified teachers in schools.
