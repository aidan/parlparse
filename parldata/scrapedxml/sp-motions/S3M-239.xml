*S3M-239 Jim Tolson: End Fuel Poverty by 2016—That the Parliament acknowledges that all types of household are susceptible to fuel poverty, but particularly pensioner and lone-parent households; notes Scottish Executive figures published earlier this year showing that 419,000 Scottish households are in fuel poverty; recognises the crucial role that the central heating and Warm Deal programmes have played in delivering thousands of vulnerable individuals out of fuel poverty in the last eight years; however recognises the concern of key stakeholders that more needs to be done to tackle fuel poverty, and calls for urgent action to meet the 2016 target to abolish fuel poverty in Scotland.
