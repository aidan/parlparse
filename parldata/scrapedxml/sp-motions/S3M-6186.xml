 * S3M-6186 Karen Gillon: UNISON’s Green Workplace Project Wins Climate Challenge Funding—That the Parliament congratulates members of the South Lanarkshire branch of UNISON on being awarded £60,728 from the Climate Challenge Fund for their Green Workers project; notes that the project will work with UNISON members across a variety of South Lanarkshire-based organisations with the aim to raise awareness of the carbon footprints of members, give advice on how to reduce emissions and empower members to raise ideas on how to make a difference not only at home but in their workplace; further notes that the project will specifically encourage reduced emissions through energy efficiency and greener travel options and that members will have the opportunity to borrow energy monitors to check their energy use at home, and believes that the project demonstrates the contribution that trade unions can make to tackling climate change in the workplace and that similar projects will have an important role to play to help Scotland meet its climate change targets.
