 *S2M-4464.1 Fiona Hyslop: Educationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4464) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "supports greater choice within schools, rather than between schools, in order that pupils can benefit from breadth in the curriculum and believes that the agenda for education in Scotland should be focussed on raising the levels of achievement for all and should include a review of the deployment of education resources at school level against the national resources provided, an analysis of over-assessment in schools and policies to drive forward the pursuit of excellence."
