*S1M-2157 Mr John Farquhar Munro: Sodexho and Asylum Seekers-That the Parliament notes the contents of the article published in The Observer on 2 September 2001 and the allegations therein relating to Sodexho and its subsidiary companies; further notes that the allegations relate to the exploitation of asylum seekers, one of the most vulnerable groups in the UK, and suggest that a subsidiary of Sodexho is guilty of paying asylum seekers the equivalent of 34p an hour for their work; abhors any attempts made by any company in the UK to avoid paying the minimum wage to any employee, whether they be citizens of the UK or not; is concerned that Sodexho is responsible for providing catering services to the Parliament and that the Parliament should be setting a good example to the rest of the nation in terms of ethical employment practices, and therefore urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (a) to enter into urgent negotiations with Sodexho to ensure that, if these allegations are found to be true, any unfair or unethical working practices used by the company or any of its subsidiaries cease immediately, particularly where they relate to the employment of vulnerable groups and (b), if Sodexho refuse to met these demands, to immediately revoke its contract for the provision of catering services to the Scottish Parliament.
