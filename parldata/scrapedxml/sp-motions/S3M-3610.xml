 *S3M-3610 Robin Harper: Shelter’s Edinburgh Families Project—That the Parliament expresses both concern and regret over the closure of the highly successful Edinburgh Families Project, which was set up and run by the charity, Shelter, from 1998; notes that this project was the first of its kind in Scotland that delivered intensive support specifically to meet the needs of families struggling to leave behind a history of homelessness or families at risk of homelessness; further notes that a unique aspect of the project was its separate support and advocacy for children and young people through working with child-support workers qualified in drama, art or play therapy; recognises that this project transformed the lives of 415 families, directly helping around 800 children, during its 10-year history; wishes the staff from the project well in finding alternative employment, and believes that the Scottish Government must consider the impact of losing such a valuable homelessness prevention project at the time when the target of ending homelessness by 2012 looms large and must also ensure that housing and homelessness services, support and provision are properly resourced and delivered throughout Scotland as a matter of urgency.
