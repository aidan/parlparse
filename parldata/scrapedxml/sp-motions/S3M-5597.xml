*S3M-5597 Patricia Ferguson: RSAMD’s New Dance School at Spiers Lock, Glasgow—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama will open a new dance school in the Spiers Lock area of Glasgow later this year; notes that the development of this new £6.3 million campus will be the first part of a three-stage process to expand the academy’s facilities taking it a step closer to its aim of becoming the United Kingdom’s finest conservatoire; further notes that the new dance school will sit in close proximity to the Scottish Opera facilities and National Theatre of Scotland offices at Spiers Lock, and welcomes this important addition to Spiers Lock as a cultural quarter in Glasgow.
