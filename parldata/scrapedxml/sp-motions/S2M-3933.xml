 *S2M-3933# Alasdair Morgan: Wanlockhead Museum Trust and Museum of Lead Mining—That the Parliament notes that 2006 is the 250th anniversary of the founding of Wanlockhead Miners’ Library, established by the lead miners as part of their educational and cultural activity and now under the care of the Wanlockhead Museum Trust; recognises that the award-winning museum itself is a unique monument to industrial workers in the Lowther Hills, as well as being a valuable economic asset to today’s economy, and believes that the Scottish Executive should act to ensure that arrangements are in place so that the museum’s trustees can plan for the future with some degree of certainty instead of encountering the intermittent financial uncertainty which, on occasion, threatens the very existence of the museum.
