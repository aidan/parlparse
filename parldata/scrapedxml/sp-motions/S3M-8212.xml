 *S3M-8212 Jamie Hepburn: Scottish Government Delivers for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the many investments and achievements of the SNP administration in the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area over the past four years; notes that these include funding through the Town Centre Regeneration Fund for improvements to Kilsyth High Street and Conservation Area, funding for Kilsyth and Cumbernauld Village, new housing built in Kildrum, Cumbernauld Village and Carbrain, with more planned for Westfield, Carbrain and Kildrum, and CashBack for Communities funding for a range of projects, including £400,000 for the Cumbernauld Colts Football Club; also believes that people across the area have benefitted from the council tax freeze, the decision to save the accident and emergency unit at Monklands Hospital, and that the streets are safer thanks to investment in 588 additional police officers across the Strathclyde area, and believes that these achievements can best be protected and enhanced by the re-election of the current Scottish administration.
