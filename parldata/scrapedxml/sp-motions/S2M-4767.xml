 *S2M-4767 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: What People Think of Scotland’s CAB Service—That the Parliament notes the results of the recent Ipsos MORI survey on public perceptions of Scotland’s Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) service, which found that 98% of clients trust the confidential service, 97% appreciate the professionalism, competency and efficiency of staff and 96% believe that the CAB helps people get fair treatment; further notes that among the general public 86% believe that the CAB provides advice, assistance and support across a range of issues, 84% feel it helps people to get fair treatment and 84% believe that the CAB can be trusted; congratulates the staff and thousands of volunteers in Scotland’s 76 citizens advice bureaux on the highly positive findings; believes that the high level of trust which the people of Scotland have in the CAB service is a precious commodity that deserves greater recognition both locally and nationally; further notes that 11 to 17 September 2006 is Advice Week, and encourages MSPs of all parties to sign the congratulations cards to their local bureaux, available at the CAB stand in the Parliament’s garden lobby on 13 September.
