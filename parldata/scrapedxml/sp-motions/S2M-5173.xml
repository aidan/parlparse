*S2M-5173 Brian Adam: Aberdeen Social Work Funding Crisis—That the Parliament notes with concern Aberdeen’s social work funding crisis and is appalled that very significant service reductions of £14 million are required for 2007-08 and beyond across all social work service provision in the city; further notes that this diminution of service will have a major impact on the lives of Aberdeen’s most vulnerable citizens, and calls on the Scottish Executive to accept Aberdeen City Council’s offer of talks and to take steps to close the gap between grant aided expenditure and the actual cost of providing children and young peoples’ services in Aberdeen which, according to a report prepared for Aberdeen City Council by Professor Arthur Midwinter, now stands at around £10 million.
