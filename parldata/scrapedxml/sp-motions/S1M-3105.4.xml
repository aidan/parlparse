*S1M-3105.4 Robin Harper: National Waste Strategy-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3105) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "notes that conservation of natural resources, reduction of pollution and creation of employment could be achieved through a National Waste Plan based on minimisation, reuse and recycling of commercial and household waste, that the generation of waste in Scotland is increasing, that most of the waste generated in Scotland arises from commercial and industrial sources, and notes with concern that Scotland currently recycles only about 6% of its household waste; welcomes the publication by local authorities of Area Waste Plans which demonstrate the economic and environmental benefit of minimisation and recycling of waste as an alternative to incineration and landfill dumping; is concerned that there has been insufficient guidance from the Executive for both local authorities and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to implement Area Waste Plans that are based on waste minimisation and recycling and therefore that the Executive's current approach will result in increasing waste generation, the building of several new waste incinerators and continued low levels of waste recycling; is further concerned that community recycling stakeholders are not funded nor sufficiently consulted on the National Waste Plan, and therefore calls on the Executive to adopt a strategy of Zero Waste within the National Waste Plan, based on waste minimisation and recycling, to include mandatory consultation with community-based recyclers, and towards this strategy in the short term (a) to fund investment in kerbside collections from every home, as well as increased recycling at Civic Amenity Sites and an expansion of the existing network of recycling collection sites, (b) to oppose plans for new waste incinerators in Aberdeen and the Highlands; (c) to increase the Strategic Waste Fund to at least Â£150 million and allow community-based recyclers access to this fund, (d) to stop importation of waste into Scotland from other countries and (e) to set a mandatory target for local authorities for at least 35% recycling of household waste by 2010."
