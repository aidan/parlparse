*S1M-2319# Rhoda Grant: Future of Highland Air Services—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive’s support for a public service obligation on the Inverness to Gatwick air route; recognises the importance of this route for many businesses and communities in the Highlands, and believes that the Scottish Executive should continue to pursue this issue at both UK and European levels to ensure that a direct link between the Highlands and London is maintained.
