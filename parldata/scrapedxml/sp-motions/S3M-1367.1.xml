*S3M-1367.1 Rhona Brankin: Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1367) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, insert at end "and, in so doing, notes that the Scottish Government is no longer pledged to abolish graduate loan debt and acknowledges also the inadequate increase in the Young Students’ Bursary and, as the Scottish Government has a responsibility to develop a system of student funding to provide sufficient financial support to students while they study, believes that an independent commission should be established on further and higher education in Scotland whose remit shall include consideration of structures and future funding of the sector and student support."
