*S2M-712# Robert Brown: Domestic Wind Turbines-That the Parliament welcomes the development by the Glasgow company Windsave of the world's first domestic wind turbine; notes that the turbine simply plugs into the mains and can reduce average electricity domestic bills by 15%; welcomes the fact that Scotland continues to be in the vanguard of developing renewable energy technology including the world's first commercial wave power station and marine energy testing centre, and believes that the Scottish Executive should promote this and other small-scale renewable energy devices for public buildings, households and private companies to deliver the commitment in A Partnership for a Better Scotland to ensure that new homes and public buildings increasingly incorporate solar power or other renewable energy sources.
