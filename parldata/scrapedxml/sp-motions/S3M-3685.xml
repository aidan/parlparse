*S3M-3685 Jamie Hepburn: Norway’s £10 Billion Investment to Combat the Credit Crunch—That the Parliament notes proposals from the Government of Norway to establish two new funds with a total capital of NOK100 billion (approximately £10 billion), designed to improve access to loans for companies and households and to help stabilise the financial market; further notes the range of measures that the Government of Norway, which is an independent country with a population comparable to that of Scotland, has taken to insulate the country’s economy against the global economic downturn; considers that there is no evidence whatsoever that Norway is, or is about to become, insolvent, and therefore believes that the actions of the Government of Norway are an example of why independence for Scotland is even more necessary in the face of global recession.
