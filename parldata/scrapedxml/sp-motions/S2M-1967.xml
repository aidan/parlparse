*S2M-1967 Chris Ballance: Shifting Expenditure from Military Spending to Working for Peace—That the Parliament notes that "it is highly likely that the armed forces will, in future, be more frequently employed on peace support and counter-terrorist operations where the focus will be on conflict prevention and stabilisation, rather than the defeat of opposing forces" (Delivering Security in a Changing World - Defence White Paper - December 2003) and that "No conventional military threats to the UK are likely to emerge over the period to 2030" (The Future Strategic Context for Defence, Ministry of Defence Paper); believes that, to help create peace, Scotland must invest in, and prepare for, peace by shifting economic and human resources away from investment and preparation for war and towards preparation for peace; supports and commends work on projects such as that by the Scottish Centre for Nonviolence to develop a pool of well-trained civilian peacemakers who would have the requisite skills and training to serve in conflict areas, and urges significantly-increased spending of taxpayers’ money on conflict prevention, including retraining military personnel, from 2.3% of the Ministry of Defence’s budget in order to achieve the joint Ministry of Defence, Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office Public Service Agreement goal of "improved effectiveness of the UK contribution to conflict prevention".
