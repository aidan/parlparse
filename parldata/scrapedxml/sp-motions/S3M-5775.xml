 * S3M-5775 Marilyn Livingstone: Kirkcaldy Street Pastorsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the introduction to Kirkcaldy of Street Pastors, an initiative in which church leaders, ministers and members with a concern for society, in particular for young people who feel themselves to be excluded and marginalised , voluntarily patrol the streets from early evening until late, providing practical help to young people making their way home from a night out; commends the project for offering blankets, comfortable shoes, water, basic first aid and company for vulnerable people while they wait for transport or find friends; understands that the Street Pastors will build up relationships with local licensees and nightclub staff and work with support from and in cooperation with local police and Fife Council to look at collaborative ways of working on issues affecting young people; further understands that there are now 100 Street Pastor teams around the United Kingdom and that the project has seen some excellent results, including a drop in crime in the areas where the teams have been working, and commends the fact that their aim is simply to care, listen and help.
