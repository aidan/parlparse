*S3M-4878 Cathie Craigie: Pilot of a National Emergency SMS Text Service—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of a pilot of a UK-wide emergency SMS text service; further welcomes the work of the UK Government, telecommunications companies and RNID in developing this system, which will allow the 758,000 people who are deaf or hard of hearing in Scotland to send an SMS text message to the emergency services from a mobile phone; considers that this development represents a milestone in the safety, care and protection of people who are deaf or hard of hearing who find it difficult or are unable to use the 999 telephone service to call for help; believes that this new development will help save more lives, and, following the pilot, looks forward to a full service being rolled out in 2010.
