*S2M-981 Fiona Hyslop: Support for Nursery Nurses-That the Parliament appreciates the excellent pre-school education and care that nursery nurses deliver to Scotland's children; notes that their pay has not been reviewed for a considerable length of time and that the current pay negotiations have been ongoing for more than three years; regrets that nursery nurses have felt obliged to take industrial action in support of their pay claim; notes that the situation is no closer to being resolved; calls on UNISON and COSLA to redouble their efforts to find a solution and end the dispute, and further calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene to ensure that a national agreement is forthcoming, taking into account the new roles and responsibilities of nursery nurses in delivering national policies for the pre-5 curriculum, early education intervention measures, early identification of children with special support needs and vital support to deliver mainstreaming in education as established under the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act 2000.
