 *S3M-4029 Bill Wilson: The Gurkhas, Prepared to Die for the UK but not Fit to Live Here?—That the Parliament agrees with the sentiments expressed in the Westminster Early Day Motion, EDM 1362, that states that new Home Office guidelines relating to the settlement of former Gurkha soldiers in the country for which they served is unnecessarily restrictive, morally wrong and offensive; notes that approximately 1,500 Gurkhas, including Falklands veterans, currently awaiting the outcome of their appeals would face deportation under the new guidelines; accordingly welcomes the UK Government’s defeat in the House of Commons on this issue, and calls on the UK Government to take note of the majority opinion of MPs that it believes reflects the opinion of UK citizens and therefore to welcome those who are considered good enough to die for the United Kingdom as also fit to live here.
