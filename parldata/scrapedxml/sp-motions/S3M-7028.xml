*S3M-7028 Robin Harper: BlindCraft Closure—That the Parliament deplores the decision by the administration of City of Edinburgh Council to start a period of 90 days’ statutory consultation with staff of BlindCraft about closure of the business; considers that BlindCraft is a valuable and reputable company, established in 1793, which makes quality beds and provides employment opportunities particularly for those who are disabled or have a visual impairment; believes that closure will have a severe impact on its 70 workers, particularly the two-thirds who have a visual impairment, and on the public purse, to support redundant workers; notes that in 2008 the company won a contract with John Lewis to the tune of £2 million and understands that its projected sales for 2010-11 were £1.58 million; welcomes the campaign and petition by workers and supporters to save BlindCraft, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene to prevent the closure.
