*S1M-2392 Elaine Thomson: Enough is Enough-That the Parliament congratulates the Enough is Enough group from Mastrick in Aberdeen, who were recently awarded the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize for raising awareness of the fight for the protection of women and children from domestic abuse, and notes and applauds the extremely hard work which the group has put in over many years in campaigning to change the law in order to further protect women and children suffering from abuse which culminated in the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Bill.
