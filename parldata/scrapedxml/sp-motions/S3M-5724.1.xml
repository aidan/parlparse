 * S3M-5724.1 Robert Brown: UK Parties Support Referenda on Constitutional Change—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5724) in the name of Aileen Campbell, leave out from "this represents" to end and insert "referenda can be an appropriate method of determining major constitutional changes in the United Kingdom where there appears to be a broad consensus across civic and political society; notes that there is only modest minority support for the SNP’s proposal to withdraw Scotland from the United Kingdom; notes further that the experience of the SNP in government appears to have diminished this support further; is aware that the SNP government has repeatedly delayed in bringing forward its long-promised Referendum Bill to the Parliament; looks forward to the strengthening of the powers of the Scottish Parliament along the lines proposed by the Steel Commission and the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution, and believes that the banking crisis demonstrated conclusively that Scotland and the other nations of the United Kingdom are stronger together within a modern and pluralist United Kingdom." Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety*, Liam McArthur*
