*S2M-1596 Pauline McNeill: Restoration of Scottish Screen Archive—That the Parliament welcomes the £696,000 Heritage Lottery Fund award to Scottish Screen to restore around 400 hours of fragile film at risk of disintegration; notes that film to be restored includes 1896 footage of Queen Victoria at Balmoral, thought to be the first film ever shot in Scotland, and footage of life in St Kilda before evacuation, Clydebank shipping and the 1960 European Cup Final at Hampden Park; believes that historical film held in the Scottish Screen Archive is of enormous importance to the people of Scotland in documenting the social, cultural and industrial history of Scotland in the 20th century, and further welcomes plans to increase access to historic film footage to the public through the on-line catalogue and local libraries.
