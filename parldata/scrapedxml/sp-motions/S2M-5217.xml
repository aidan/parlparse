*S2M-5217 Tommy Sheridan: Stop the Sell-Off, Start Investing in Council Housing—That the Parliament notes the latest comprehensive rejection of the Scottish Executive’s anti-council housing, stock transfer policy by council tenants in the Highlands, as expressed by their 60% vote against transfer on a 60% turnout of tenants; demands a radical u-turn in Executive housing policy to provide the required resources to allow local authorities to invest in upgrading, repairing and rebuilding their council house stock; notes the Highlands Housing Association’s attack on Solidarity during the campaign and believes that such attacks are unhelpful and misguided, and demands real investment in council houses and an end to the damaging right-to-buy policy and its replacement with a right-to-rent discount to reward and promote the council house rented sector.
