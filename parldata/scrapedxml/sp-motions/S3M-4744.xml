*S3M-4744 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Launch of Preventing Violence Against Women Website—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of a new tool for campaigners working to prevent violence against women and children in Scotland, a new website found at www.vawpreventionscotland.org.uk; notes that this was developed by the pioneering Edinburgh charity, Zero Tolerance; commends the new website and network for providing a place for individuals and organisations to share expertise, information and good practice on preventing violence, abuse and exploitation of women and children and thus avoid unnecessary duplication and missed opportunities for collaboration; welcomes the funding from the Scottish Government, and acknowledges the need for continued resourcing and support for preventative initiatives such as this, as recognised in the Scottish Government’s shared approach document, Safer Lives: Changed Lives, which notes that "developing an effective approach to prevention and reducing violence against women" is a key issue of concern that needs to be addressed. Supported by: Aileen Campbell*, Stewart Maxwell*, Nigel Don*, Stuart McMillan*, Kenneth Gibson*, Robin Harper*, Sandra White*, Alasdair Allan*, Ian McKee*, Elaine Smith*, Bill Kidd*, Jackie Baillie*, Anne McLaughlin*
