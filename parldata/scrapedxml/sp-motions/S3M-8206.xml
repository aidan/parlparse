*S3M-8206 Anne McLaughlin: The Cruel Practice of Indefinite Detention—That the Parliament condemns what it considers the UK Government’s shocking practice of indefinitely detaining asylum seekers; considers this practice to be shameful; understands that most of the people in indefinite detention cannot be returned to their country of origin for a variety of reasons including the danger in the country of origin; further understands that one such individual was detained for eight years; believes that seeking asylum is no crime and that asylum seekers should therefore not be treated as criminals, and calls on the UK Government to end immediately what it sees as this abhorrent practice.
