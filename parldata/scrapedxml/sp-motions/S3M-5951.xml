 *S3M-5951 Linda Fabiani: State of the Union—That the Parliament notes the calls in Westminster for MPs to have an annual Scotland Day debate and considers that there should be a reciprocal arrangement whereby MSPs debate the state of the Union every year, noting that, if such a debate were held now, the Parliament would be debating the deployment of Scottish forces in theatres of war overseas without the full range of proper equipment, the collapse of the UK economy and lack of fiscal stimulus, the potential downgrading of the UK’s debt rating and the scandal of MPs being prosecuted for misuse of their allowances.
