*S3M-1408 Rob Gibson: Welcome to Highland Wood Pellet Plant—That the Parliament notes the imminent commencement of work on the £25 million Balcas wood processing plant in Invergordon; welcomes the estimated 38 full-time jobs it will bring to the Easter Ross area, the extra 207 it will generate in the Highland area and the 307 in Scotland; notes that on completion it will be the largest biomass renewable energy project in the United Kingdom, producing 8 megawatts of power, over half of which will be fed into the national grid, thus displacing 170,000 tonnes of carbon per year as well as creating 100,000 wood pellets per year for renewable heat fuel, and contends that this green enterprise which uses local sustainable resources is a model for the future of sustainable businesses in Scotland.
