*S3M-6627 Joe FitzPatrick: Computer Games Tax Relief—That the Parliament condemns the decision by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne MP, to abandon plans for tax relief for the computer games industry; considers that this decision will affect Scotland disproportionately as Dundee alone accounts for 10% of the total UK computer games industry; considers tax relief necessary to enable the industry to be on a level playing field with competitors, such as France, Canada, Japan and South Korea, already offering tax relief; further notes that a recent report from games industry body TIGA showed that, over five years, the tax breaks would cost an estimated £192 million but would deliver £415 million in tax receipts, and calls for this important industry to be give the support that it needs to ensure its continued success.
