*S3M-4739 Brian Adam: Scotland against Continual Fuel Duty Hikes—That the Parliament notes with great concern the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s plans to increase fuel tax by two pence per litre; also notes that this is far from the first hike in fuel duty under the current administration; is concerned that these increases are causing growing inflation on the price of groceries and other goods due to high shipping costs, and calls on the Chancellor to take measures on behalf of the haulage industry, Scottish business and the Scottish people, to forego the tax increase and to bring forward measures to create more stability in the Scottish financial sector.
