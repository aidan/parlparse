*S3M-4944 Michael Matheson: Stop the Park Gallery Closing—That the Parliament notes the decision by the Labour, Conservative and Independent-led administration of Falkirk Council to close the Park Gallery in Falkirk; believes that Falkirk Council’s decision to close the Park Gallery is lamentable, given that it is one of only two outlets for contemporary art in the Forth Valley area; notes the lack of public consultation by Falkirk Council prior to taking this decision, and therefore calls on Falkirk Council to recognise the widespread opposition within the community to this plan and that a full public consultation exercise should be undertaken to ensure that the views of the local community are taken into account on the future of this important community asset.
