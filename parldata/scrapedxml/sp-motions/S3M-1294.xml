 *S3M-1294 Aileen Campbell: Insolvency Rates in Scotland—That the Parliament notes figures released by the Insolvency Service, which show that the number of personal bankruptcies in Scotland in 2007 was 14.5% higher than in 2006; expresses concern that increasing numbers of people in Scotland are facing unmanageable debts; believes that, while bankruptcy can be a necessary last resort in some cases, more action must be taken to stop people ending up in financial difficulty in the first place, and further believes that people in Scotland would benefit from the Scottish Parliament having more power over the regulation of credit and financial services and the ability to act against irresponsible lending practices.
