 *S2M-1357 Michael McMahon: Scottish Premier League Deal with Setanta-That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by the Scottish Premier League to agree an exclusive four-year deal with pay-per-view company, Setanta; believes that this will restrict the ability of ordinary football fans to watch Scotland's most popular spectator sport; considers this to be yet another short-sighted decision by those who run Scottish football, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government so that the necessary steps are taken to ensure that there will be live football available on terrestrial television in Scotland once this restrictive deal ends.
