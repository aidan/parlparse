*S3M-2772 John Scott: Adoption of A70 as a Trunk Road—That the Parliament believes that there is a need for major investment in Ayrshire’s strategic road network; welcomes the completed improvement works to the A77 over recent years and planned improvement works to this route still to be undertaken; further believes that if the economy of Ayrshire is to prosper then the A70, which links southern Ayrshire to the M74, must be upgraded, and calls on the Scottish Government to recognise the significance of this route to the economic development of Ayrshire by adopting the A70 as a trunk road.
