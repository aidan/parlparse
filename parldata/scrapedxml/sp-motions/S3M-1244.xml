 *S3M-1244 Rob Gibson: Civil and Political Unrest in Kenya—That the Parliament joins others in calling for an end to the savage civil and political unrest that has plagued Kenya since the controversial elections on 27 December 2007; encourages all parties in Kenya to engage in constructive diplomacy with a view to building consensus and a peaceful resolution to the violence; urges both President Mwai Kibaki and the opposition leader, Raila Odinga, to call a ceasefire in a bid to curtail the spiralling death toll which has cost the lives of around 800 Kenyans; commends the excellent work of UNICEF in providing temporary shelter and basic supplies for over 250,000 displaced Kenyans; calls for a new set of elections to be held that will be independently monitored by an international impartial body, such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and implores both the European Union and United Nations to exert every influence at their disposal to ensure a peaceful outcome.
