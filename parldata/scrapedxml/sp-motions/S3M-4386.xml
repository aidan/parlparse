 *S3M-4386♦ Bob Doris: Supporting Scotland’s Third Sector—That the Parliament congratulates the 12 organisations that were successful in their applications for funding distributed from the new Scottish Government Third Sector Enterprise Fund; notes that the awards to Possil and Milton Forum on Disability and Rosemount Lifelong Learning will make a significant contribution to the activities of these north Glasgow organisations; welcomes the commitment demonstrated by the Scottish Government towards the sector with the provision of £12 million, of which £250,000 is ring-fenced for credit union applications, and believes that the third sector in partnership with the Scottish Government will continue to improve on the delivery of vital services to the nation as well as providing jobs at the time that they are most needed.
