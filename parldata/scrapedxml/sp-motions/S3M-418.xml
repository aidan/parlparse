 *S3M-418 Margo MacDonald: Mordechai Vanunu—That the Parliament notes that Mordechai Vanunu completed 18 years in prison in Israel in 2004 following his revelations about Israel’s nuclear weapons programme; further notes that since 2004 he has been subject to severe restrictions, including a ban on overseas travel; is astonished that he has been sentenced to a new term of six months in prison for speaking to foreign nationals, and calls on the government to ask the Israeli Government to lift all restrictions on Mordechai Vanunu and allow him the freedom to travel.
