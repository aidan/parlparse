 *S3M-5038 Bill Wilson: RNID Report, Who Benefits?—That the Parliament is concerned by the findings in the report by RNID, Who Benefits?, which show that people who are deaf are missing out on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance because their benefits claims are being rejected unfairly; notes that, while previous research conducted by RNID in 2001 showed that many deaf people were not claiming DLA because they had had their claims turned down, this situation has not improved in the last seven years and, in certain cases, it has worsened; further notes that over half of those questioned who successfully claimed DLA had had a claim turned down previously, yet 91% of appeals by British Sign Language (BSL) users are successful; is dismayed that 74% of respondents said that they found the 54-page DLA form difficult to complete, with 56% of BSL users saying that they could not understand some of the questions and 66% reporting that most of the questions on the form were not relevant to deafness, and that, when examinations were conducted in the claimant’s home by a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) health professional, 28% said that they had difficulty communicating with the doctor; believes that more work needs to be done to ensure that the 758,000 people in Scotland who are deaf or hard of hearing are no longer denied access to benefit entitlements, and calls for the guidance used by DWP decision-makers regarding the specific needs of deaf people to be strengthened and met.
