*S3M-450 Liam McArthur: Sitting of Scottish Youth Parliament in Orkney—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Youth Parliament on its successful sitting, held in Orkney on 8 and 9 September; welcomes the decision of Members of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYPs) to hold their latest plenary session in Orkney as a further demonstration of the relevance of the Scottish Youth Parliament’s work to all of Scotland; acknowledges the efforts of Orkney Islands Council staff and Orkney’s MSYPs, Jenny Drever and Jethro Crocker, in making the sitting such a success; believes that the theme of the sitting, Sustainable Futures, was particularly appropriate given Orkney’s growing reputation as a world centre of excellence for marine renewables development, and encourages MSPs to explore ways in which they can work ever more closely with John Loughton, the new Chair of the Scottish Youth Parliament, and with other MSYPs.
