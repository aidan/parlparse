*S1M-3700.2 Richard Lochhead: Fisheries 2003—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3700) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "urges the Scottish Executive to officially lead the UK delegation at next week’s Fisheries Council with a view to opposing vigorously any draconian cuts in fishing opportunities; calls on the Executive to propose that viable quotas be set that will allow the fleet to return to sea in the new year, providing the opportunity for states with a direct interest in the North Sea and the Irish Sea to bring forward management plans later in 2003 that promote fisheries conservation and secure a future for our fisheries communities, and further calls on the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to engage directly with other EU states and Norway to achieve this objective."
