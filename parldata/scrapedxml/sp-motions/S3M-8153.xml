 *S3M-8153 Ian McKee: North Sighthill Regeneration—That the Parliament welcomes the regeneration project for North Sighthill, part of City of Edinburgh Council’s £150 million 21st Century Homes programme that will see the last of Sighthill’s tower blocks demolished by the summer of 2011; considers that the demolition at North Sighthill will end an era of deprived housing, antisocial behaviour and crime and give way to a modern and vibrant community with a mixture of 320 council and private sector flats and houses; notes that the Scottish Government and City of Edinburgh Council’s investment in new homes will allow the first council houses to be built in Edinburgh after what it considers to be generations of neglect, and looks forward to the Sighthill building work, which is scheduled to commence in the second half of 2012. Supported by: Gil Paterson*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*
