 *S3M-127.1 Robin Harper: Sustainable Public Transport Systems—As an amendment to motion (S3M-127) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from "Scottish Executive ministers" to end and insert "sustainable public transport systems which meet the needs of communities and businesses are essential for Scotland’s economic development; recognises that the case for the Edinburgh Tram scheme is supported by Scotland’s business, environmental and sustainable transport organisations, as well as a majority of the Parliament; notes that the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link has been heavily criticised by environment and sustainable transport organisations and that the report by consultants Arup indicated that it posed a threat to the business case for the trams; recognises that there are significant environmental, technical and financial problems with other transport infrastructure projects in Scotland, such as the M74 Northern Extension and the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route; considers that a short review process would be acceptable to assess these issues, and calls on the Scottish Executive to report on the result of such a review before the summer recess."
