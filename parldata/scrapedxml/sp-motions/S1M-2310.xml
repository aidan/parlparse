 *S1M-2310 John Farquhar Munro: Concessionary Tolls on the Skye Bridgeâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the proposed introduction of concessionary bus fares for pensioners across Scotland; recognises that the high cost of crossing the Skye Bridge places a heavy burden on pensioners living on limited incomes, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to investigate the introduction of concessionary tolls on the Skye Bridge to run until the tolls are scrapped altogether.
