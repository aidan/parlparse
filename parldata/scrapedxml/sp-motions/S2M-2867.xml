 * S2M-2867 Mark Ballard:Brazilian Government—That the Parliament notes that, after 28 months collaborating with the government, the Brazilian Green Party has decided to abandon its support for President Lula and that the Brazilian Green Party Culture Minister, world-famous singer Gilberto Gil, has resigned his seat in government because of “a clear retreat in Brazilian environmental policies”; supports the Brazilian Green Party in its concern at the death of 38 undernourished children belonging to the Guarani tribe in one of the country’s Indian reservations and at new record figures on Amazon rainforest destruction; notes that the Brazilian environment ministry has said that 26,000 square kilometres of forest were chopped down in the 12 months prior to August 2004; further notes that this figure is the second highest on record, 6% higher than the previous 12 months; congratulates the Brazilian Green Party on its strong stance; recognises how Green parties from across the world work together on such important issues, and welcomes the fact that the Brazilian Green Party is willing to stand up for the rights of indigenous people and for the Amazon rainforest, even if this means sacrificing a seat in government.
