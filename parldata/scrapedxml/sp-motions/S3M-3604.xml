*S3M-3604 Michael Matheson: Time to Abandon GB Football Team—That the Parliament notes the comments of FIFA President Sepp Blatter that the independence of separate Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and English football teams will be jeopardised if the UK Government persists with a Great Britain football team for the 2012 London Olympics; further notes that the 1908 London Olympics provide a precedent for all four home nations to be allowed to participate in their own right; considers that it is time to stop any pretence that a GB team will not have an effect on the status of the four associations and to take heed of the comments of the President of FIFA, who stated on 9 March 2008, "if you start to put together a combined team for the Olympic Games, the question will automatically come up that there are four different associations so how can they play in one team", and calls for the UK Government to start listening to the Scottish Football Association, FIFA and the Tartan Army on this matter.
