*S3M-540 Elaine Smith: Coatbridge Citizens Advice Bureau—That the Parliament commends the work of citizens advice bureaux throughout Scotland; congratulates Coatbridge and Clydesdale citizens advice bureaux for successfully piloting a new facility to tackle health service complaints which is now being rolled out across the country; applauds their staff and volunteers for their commitment to working with NHS boards to guide people with complaints about the NHS; expresses concern that loss of funding from the Big Lottery Fund means that Coatbridge Citizens Advice Bureau cannot keep apace with rising demands on the service; urges the Scottish Government to examine ways and means of assisting with lack of funding, and believes that extra funding and support should be made available as a priority to citizens advice bureaux throughout Scotland to allow them to cope with the extra demands being placed on the service.
