*S1M-3039 Richard Lochhead: Taxation on Oil and Gas Profits-That the Parliament notes the decision by Her Majesty's Government to increase tax on North Sea oil and gas profits by 10% but believes that any provision to this effect should not be introduced until a full economic assessment has been conducted of the impact of any changes on current and future employment and exploration related to North Sea activities.
