 *S3M-5669 Anne McLaughlin: Disasters Emergency Committee—That the Parliament commends the work of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) in providing humanitarian aid to the victims of the Haitian earthquake; acknowledges that the DEC, an umbrella organisation for humanitarian aid agencies in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom, consists of Action Aid, the British Red Cross, CAFOD, CARE International UK, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Help the Aged, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision; considers that, at times of overseas emergency, the DEC brings together a unique alliance of aid, corporate, public and broadcasting sectors to rally the public’s compassion and ensure that funds raised go to DEC agencies that are well placed to deliver effective and timely relief to people most in need; believes that the DEC in Scotland could not provide vital aid to those in need without the remarkable generosity shown by the Scottish people in their response to this and many other disasters, and hopes that the public and civic society will continue to give whatever they can afford to the DEC Haiti Earthquake Appeal to fund the essential aid required to meet both immediate need and to help rebuild people’s lives and livelihoods in Haiti in the longer term.
