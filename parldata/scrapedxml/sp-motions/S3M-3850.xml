 *S3M-3850 Robin Harper: Impact of Disclosure Policy on Services for Vulnerable People—That the Parliament notes recent changes to Disclosure Scotland’s interpretation of the regulations that limit access to enhanced disclosure checks for charity and voluntary organisation staff and volunteers working with vulnerable groups; notes that a number of different charities, including MND Scotland, Befriending Network Scotland and Clydesdale Befriending Group, have raised concerns that their ability to provide services to vulnerable groups may be affected as a result of these changes; calls on Disclosure Scotland to clarify the reasons for the change and to assess the practical impact on the ability of charities and voluntary organisations to deliver services; welcomes the work being done by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) to resolve this situation, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with SCVO and other relevant voluntary sector organisations to reduce the risk that any services and support for vulnerable people in Scotland might be lost. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*
