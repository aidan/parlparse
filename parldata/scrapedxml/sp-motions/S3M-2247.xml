*S3M-2247 Cathie Craigie: We’ve Got Big Plans for Deaf Children and Young People in Scotland—That the Parliament commends all deaf young people in Scotland who got involved in the National Deaf Children’s Society’s (NDCS) largest ever consultation with deaf children in the UK, Change Your World; acknowledges that the results of this national conversation present a unique insight into the opinions of young deaf people on issues that affect them; supports the NDCS as it develops its Big Plans for Scotland’s deaf children and young people as a result of the Change Your World consultation; congratulates all those who attended the NDCS event in the Parliament on Wednesday 18 June 2008 to launch the results of the consultation, particularly the pupils from Dingwall Academy and Dalziel High School who led the event with such confidence and maturity and told us how they wanted the world to change, and commits to listening to what these results tell us about being a deaf young person in Scotland today.
