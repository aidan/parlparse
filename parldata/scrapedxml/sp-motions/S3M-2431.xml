*S3M-2431 Jackie Baillie: Clostridium Difficile Public Inquiryâ€”That the Parliament believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing should instruct a public inquiry into the deaths from Clostridium difficile at the Vale of Leven Hospital and at other hospitals in Scotland; notes that such an inquiry can be instructed by Scottish Ministers under the Inquiries Act 2005, where it appears that particular events have caused, or are capable of causing, public concern, or there is public concern that particular events may have occurred; further notes that the matter is not reserved within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998; recognises that there are wider lessons to be learned for all of the NHS in Scotland in preventing and tackling Clostridium difficile, the incidence of which is increasing; acknowledges and supports the families of those affected by Clostridium difficile at the Vale of Leven Hospital in their continuing call for a public inquiry, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, in the interests of openness and transparency, to instigate such an inquiry without further delay.
