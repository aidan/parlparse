*S2M-3681 Ms Sandra White: Lack of Scrutiny of Scottish Ministers—That the Parliament notes the continuing poor quality of ministerial answers to parliamentary questions; notes that the regular inability of ministers to provide adequate answers to questions by MSPs is detrimental to democratic accountability and scrutiny and is undermining the parliamentary process, and calls on the Scottish Executive to embrace democracy fully in order to become truly accountable, transparent and open in the range of areas for which it has direct responsibility by establishing a central statistical department which can collate and ultimately monitor the performance of Scottish ministers.
