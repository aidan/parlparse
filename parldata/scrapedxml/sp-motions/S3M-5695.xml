*S3M-5695 Patrick Harvie: WWF’s Earth Hour 2010—That the Parliament supports WWF’s Earth Hour 2010, in which, at 8.30pm on Saturday 27 March, thousands of people all over Scotland will join hundreds of millions across the globe in switching off their lights for 60 minutes in a demonstration of support for people and wildlife threatened by climate change; urges all local authorities and other public bodies to sign up to Earth Hour; considers that the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen failed to establish a sufficiently ambitious or binding framework capable of tackling the threat of climate change; considers that Scotland has shown leadership by setting the world’s strongest statutory greenhouse gas targets, and calls on all nations to agree a legally binding global deal this year that sets stringent carbon emissions reduction targets at global and national levels. Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Elaine Smith*
