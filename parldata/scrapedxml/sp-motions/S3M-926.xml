*S3M-926 Cathy Jamieson: Police Pay—That the Parliament notes the dedication, courage and professionalism of police officers throughout Scotland in tackling crime and protecting the public; believes that they should be justly rewarded for the job that they do on behalf of us all; recalls that in July 2007 the official side and the staff side of the UK Police Negotiating Board (PNB) failed to agree the annual pay rise for police officers for the second year running; notes that on 2 November the issue was passed to the independent Police Arbitration Tribunal for resolution; recognises that both sides of the PNB are bound by the decision of the tribunal, and calls on Scottish ministers to be equally bound to implement any agreement reached.
