*S3M-3946 Ian McKee: Roslin Institute Scientific Research—That the Parliament congratulates the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute for its role in scientific research into gene interaction, providing a crucial resource for the study of immunity and disease and a better understanding of why different people can develop a disease in different ways; considers that the research could lead to treatments for diseases such as cancer, arthritis and MS by identifying the weak spots in the gene network and provide clues on how to stop the growth of tumours or enable the growth of healthy cells, and notes that the project, led by Professor David Hume, Director of the Roslin Institute, is an international study involving scientists from the Roslin Institute and a number of other research centres and universities worldwide and is yet another scientific achievement of which Scotland is proud to be part.
