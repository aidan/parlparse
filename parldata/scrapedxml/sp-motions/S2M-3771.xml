*S2M-3771 Ms Sandra White: Justice for Local Government Pension Scheme Members—That the Parliament notes with concern proposals that the Scottish Public Pensions Agency should follow the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) negotiations which are taking place in England and Wales; further notes that this would result in the removal of the 85 Rule from 1 April 2006 and would end protection for existing scheme members, as well as resulting in a 1% increase in employee contributions and an increase in the age at which benefits can be taken from 50 to 55, and urges the Minister for Finance and Public Service Reform to state unequivocally that Scottish LGPS members will be treated in the same way as other public sector workers.
