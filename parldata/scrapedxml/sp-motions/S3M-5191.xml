*S3M-5191 David Stewart: World Diabetes Day—That the Parliament acknowledges that 14 November 2009 is World Diabetes Day, an official United Nations Day, which marks the birthday of Frederick Banting who, along with Charles Best, first conceived the idea that led to the discovery of insulin in 1922; notes that the campaign for 2009 is Understand Diabetes and Take Control, which aims to raise awareness of the disease and the lifelong demands imposed on the 285 million people living with diabetes; further notes with concern that the International Diabetes Federation estimates that over 344 million people worldwide are at risk of type 2 diabetes and believes that this can be easily prevented in many cases by helping and encouraging those at risk to maintain a healthy body weight and take moderate physical activity; further notes that the most recent Scottish Diabetes Survey shows that there were 219,963 people with a diagnosis in Scotland at the end of 2008 and believes that many cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed; urges the Scottish Executive to raise awareness of the symptoms of diabetes to ensure early diagnosis and treatment, and looks forward to the publication of the updated Diabetes Action Plan, which will provide strategic priorities for diabetic services in 2010 and beyond.
