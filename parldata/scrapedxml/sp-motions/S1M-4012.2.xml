 *S1M-4012.2 Dennis Canavan: The Current International Situationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-4012) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from first "believes" to end and insert "considers that, on existing evidence, there is no political or moral justification for military action against Iraq and believes that, if such action were taken without the explicit approval of the United Nations, it would be contrary to international law and therefore urges Her Majesty's Government to use its diplomatic influence to work for peace rather than war."
