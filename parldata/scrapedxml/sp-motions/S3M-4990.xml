*S3M-4990 Helen Eadie: Gordon Brown Is Congratulated by Bono in New York—That the Parliament is immensely proud of and congratulates Gordon Brown for the honour that he was awarded in the United States last week when he was in New York for the UN General Assembly and was hailed as a hero for stabilising the world economy and showing compassionate leadership; notes that he was named World Statesman of the Year at a VIP-packed gala dinner and that the award was presented on behalf of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an interfaith organisation that campaigns for religious freedom and human rights, by the veteran former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who praised Gordon Brown for his vision and dedication in handling the world economic crisis and said, "his leadership has been essential to our ability to overcome the moment of danger"; notes the praise that he received from the foundation, which stated that the award was for his "compassionate leadership in dealing with the challenging issues facing humanity, his commitment to freedom, human dignity and the environment, and for the major role he has played in helping to stabilise the world’s financial system", and finally notes Barak Obama’s praise for Gordon’s integrity as the two men vowed to work together to tackle the unprecedented global recession.
