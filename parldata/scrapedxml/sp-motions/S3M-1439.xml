 *S3M-1439 Mary Mulligan: Handle With Care—That the Parliament welcomes Handle With Care: A report on the moving and handling of children and young people with disabilities, laid before the Parliament by Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People; recognises that moving and handling issues can cause significant disruption to the lives of children and young people and their families; notes that poor practice may result in breaches of children’s rights, be detrimental to their welfare and limit their enjoyment of life, while good practice contributes to children’s physical and emotional welfare, helping to maximise their mobility and independence; congratulates the young people who worked with the commissioner on the report for their courage in helping to bring this important issue to the attention of the Parliament, and urges central and local government and all service providers to note the findings of the report and explore how they can contribute to the wellbeing of children and young people with disabilities by considering how they can take forward the recommendations set out in the report.
