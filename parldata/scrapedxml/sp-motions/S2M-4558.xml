 *S2M-4558 Alex Neil: Tickets for the 2012 London Olympics—That the Parliament notes the call of Derek Wyatt MP, chair of the Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Olympic and Paralympic Group, that Londoners should be given the first chance to buy tickets for the London Olympic Games in 2012; believes that this is contrary to the international nature of these events; disputes the notion that Londoners deserve the first chance to buy tickets because of a levy on their council tax to help fund these games; notes that Scotland stands to lose out on lottery revenues due to the 2012 Olympic Games being held in London, but that there is no suggestion that Scots should be given an early chance to buy tickets before general public sale despite this loss of resources to Scotland, and believes that no specific area of the United Kingdom should be given the first chance to buy tickets for the London Olympics in 2012 before any other area. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Ms Rosemary Byrne* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
