 *S3M-6329 Bob Doris: Redundancy Avoidance at University of Glasgow Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences—That the Parliament expresses concern at the University of Glasgow’s proposals to restructure the Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences with the loss of around 18 staff posts through redundancy; notes that the exact detail of these cuts will not be known until the end of July 2010, which is causing anxiety for staff and students, and that the effect on course offerings for academic year 2010-11 is yet unknown; recognises the constructive efforts of faculty staff to assist in financial savings that have already reached £1 million, including accepting the possibility of a 5% wage cut and reduced hours of work; is concerned that the university’s management of both student admissions and financial targets for universal teaching cost reductions have further impacted on the faculty’s situation; notes that new criteria prevent struggling faculties from being supported by more profitable faculties, and calls on University of Glasgow Principal and Vice-Chancellor Professor Anton Muscatelli to meet with staff representatives once more to explore alternatives to redundancy within the faculty and to reassure both staff and students about the university’s commitment to the faculty for the coming academic year.
