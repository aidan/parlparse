 *S2M-1103 Donald Gorrie: Midnight Football Programme-That the Parliament commends the Midnight Football programme, funded by the Bank of Scotland and provided by the Scottish Football Association and local police, whereby for two hours on Friday evenings young people in 14 towns in Scotland play football at appropriate centres in organised tournaments with qualified coaches and transport provided, as an alternative to wandering the streets, and suggests that the Scottish Executive should work with the existing partners to ensure that these successful projects are carried on beyond their existing nine weeks and that similar projects are started in other areas as one part of the Executive's measures to provide young people with constructive alternatives to antisocial behaviour.
