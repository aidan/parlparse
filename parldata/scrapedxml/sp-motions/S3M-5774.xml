 * S3M-5774 Gil Paterson: Local Amenities, a Fight against Obesity—That the Parliament is aware of the need to tackle obesity in society, particularly among children of all ages; recognises the need for facilities to be in place to allow sport and recreation in local communities; questions the action of the ruling Labour/Conservative administration of East Dunbartonshire Council for pushing through a proposal that will see the closure of the Allander Sports Centre in Milngavie, which is used to almost full capacity during opening hours; further questions its acceptance of a planning gain of £10 million for the renewal of a new sports centre that is estimated to cost between £16 and £20 million, and asks Labour politicians at every level to consider, given the recession, where East Dunbartonshire Council is expected to find the money to rebuild the Allander Sports Centre.
