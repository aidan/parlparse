 * S2M-2836 Shiona Baird: Wind Power in the UK—That the Parliament congratulates the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), the UK Government’s advisory body, on the publication of Wind Power in the UK, a report on the issues surrounding onshore wind power development; agrees with the SDC that wind power and other renewables are needed to secure a truly sustainable future for Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom; welcomes the findings of the SDC that wind power is both cost-effective and predictable enough to take the place of coal and gas-fired power stations in the medium term and that it is unlikely to need dedicated back-up; considers that a broad range of onshore and offshore renewable technologies, including wind, solar, biomass, wave and tidal wave, have the capacity and predictability to replace both conventional and nuclear power stations; further agrees that an expansion of renewables and improved energy efficiency have far greater capacity to tackle climate change than the inherently unsustainable nuclear industry; fully supports calls for communities to be involved in meaningful public consultation from an early stage in the development process and for them to share in the commercial benefits of wind power, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take a lead in pushing forward the expansion and development of all sustainable renewable technologies to fulfil Scotland’s potential as a world leader in sustainable energy supply.
