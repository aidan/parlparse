 *S3M-7235♦ Willie Coffey: Addressing Young Offenders’ Communication Support Needs—That the Parliament acknowledges the evidence presented by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and supported by the Prison Reform Trust in respect of the high levels of communication support needs (CSN) among young offenders; recognises the impact of CSN on levels of offending behaviour and recidivism among young people and considers that unaddressed CSN create barriers to crime diversion and prevention initiatives, education, employment and rehabilitation; further recognises the impact effective communication support services, including speech and language therapy (SLT), can have on helping prevent young people from getting involved in offending behaviour and in managing and supporting their rehabilitation; is concerned that there is not a comprehensive communication support service throughout the Scottish justice system, with SLT consistently available only at Polmont Young Offenders Institute and Cornton Vale while offenders in other establishments receive SLT only by local arrangement despite evidence, for example, that at least 66% of young offenders have significant CSN, and believes that there is a strong case for a pilot CSN service for criminal justice services in a defined area of Scotland, such as the South West Scotland Criminal Justice Authority area, which covers the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency, given that young offenders from Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway form the second largest geographical group in Polmont Young Offenders Institute, in order to determine the most effective and economic communication support service model for Scotland’s justice system, including an evaluation of the impact of the pilot on crime diversion and prevention, passage through the courts, engagement in rehabilitation and outcomes in terms of recidivism.
