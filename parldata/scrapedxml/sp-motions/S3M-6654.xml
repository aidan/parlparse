 *S3M-6654 Nanette Milne: Increasing Access to Self-monitoring and Self-management of Anticoagulation Therapy—That the Parliament notes that the levels of self-monitoring and self-management in Scotland for anticoagulation therapy are considerably lower than in England and the rest of western Europe; notes that the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (Yorkhill) in Glasgow, which looks after all young people on anticoagulation therapy, has achieved considerable success with the training of young people to self-monitor and self-manage their anticoagulation therapy but that there is no support for them when they move to adult clinics; notes that authoritative studies confirm the cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring and self-management; further notes the Cochrane Review meta-analysis confirming the clinical benefits and outcomes of self-monitoring and self-management; challenges the view of some NHS boards and clinicians that anticoagulation monitoring and management require to be undertaken in secondary care; points to what it considers to be the costly and time-consuming practice of bringing patients from outlying areas to hospitals rather than manage them in primary care; reminds the Scottish Government that its policy document, Better Health, Better Care, states that "patients living with long-term medical conditions and their carers should have the information and support that they need to manage their condition on a day-to-day basis, in the knowledge that the NHS is there for them when they need it", and would welcome encouragement being given to NHS boards to increase access to self-monitoring and self-management of anticoagulation therapy for those patients in north east Scotland and the rest of the country who, with the endorsement of their clinicians, wish to do so.
