*S3M-1449 Kenneth Gibson: Removal of Wardens from Sheltered Housing Complexes—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision by North Ayrshire’s Labour, Liberal Democrat and two Independent councillors to axe all of the wardens in its local authority sheltered housing complexes; is alarmed by the total lack of consultation with those reliant on the service and the wider public prior to this move; is aware that plans to remove the service are causing deep distress and anxiety to those vulnerable people who rely on this valuable resource such as elderly, blind and disabled people to make a saving of only £285,000 despite the fact that it has millions of pounds in reserve and received an above inflation settlement for 2008 to 2011 inclusive; regrets that some of those councillors who took this decision, notably the Liberal Democrats, have attempted to evade responsibility for their actions by blaming the council tax freeze, and calls on North Ayrshire Council to suspend this decision until proper consultation can take place following on from which a further vote on this issue should be taken by the council as soon as possible. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Gil Paterson*, Bob Doris*, Stuart McMillan*, Alasdair Allan*, Bill Kidd*
