*S3M-5076 Helen Eadie: Interfaith Organisation, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, Presents World Statesman Award to Gordon Brown—That the Parliament considers that there are times in any government’s term of office when elected members of the party of government would do well to engage in a period of self-denying ordinance; further considers that the current Scottish administration might consider urging its backbenchers to refrain from engaging in the expression of what could be construed as anti-American sentiment so soon after the offence caused to both American and Scottish people by the release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi; notes that the organisation on whose behalf Henry Kissinger presented the World Statesman of the Year Award to Gordon Brown, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, is an interfaith organisation that campaigns for religious freedom and human rights, and does not consider that the criticism of Henry Kissinger expressed by Jamie Hepburn MSP in his amendment, S3M-4990.1, reflects in any way on the foundation and its work.
