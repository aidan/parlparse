 *S1M-1807.2 Phil Gallie: Justiceâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1807) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "the record" to end and insert "that the Executive has presided over a period of police under-manning, a loss of morale within the prison service, chaos in our courts, a rise in crime, particularly in crimes of violence, and the recycling of criminals through prisoner early release."
