*S3M-2303 Robert Brown: Glasgow Science Centre Job Losses—That the Parliament is appalled at the announcement by Glasgow Science Centre that it is being required to shed one-fifth of its workforce as a "direct consequence" of funding cuts of 40% over the period to 2010 imposed by the SNP government; is concerned at the complacency of SNP ministers in the face of this threat to Scotland’s only internationally-ranked science centre and to support for science and science education in Scotland; notes that the Scottish Government has been compelled to make available a further £250,000 of funding but is concerned that this appears to be a one-year concession only, that it is unclear how or to whom it is to be distributed and that it does not appear to resolve the major cuts in core funding made by the SNP government, and urges the Scottish Government to take immediate action to rescind its damaging funding cuts and enable Glasgow Science Centre to continue and build on its good work.
