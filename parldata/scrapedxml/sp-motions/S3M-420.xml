*S3M-420♦ Cathie Craigie: Muscular Dystrophy—That the Parliament notes that there are 3,000 people living in Scotland with inherited neuromuscular disorders and muscular dystrophy; is concerned that families in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and across Scotland still experience lengthy waits for powered wheelchairs and home adaptations a year after the My Life campaign; recognises that means-testing for adaptations for disabled children has been abolished in England and Wales but not in Scotland; notes that England and Wales has a dedicated fund, the Disabled Facilities Grant, that can award up to £25,000 for adaptations; further notes that the equivalent fund in Scotland, the Housing Adaptation Grant, serves other non-disability related adaptations, is not a ring-fenced fund and is capped at £20,000, and considers it imperative that these organisational and financial failures in providing necessary support to enable people to live independently are addressed as a matter of urgency.
