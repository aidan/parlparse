 * S2M-2918 Mike Pringle: Introduction of Scottish Bravery Awardâ€”That the Parliament recommends the introduction of a specific Scottish award for bravery which would recognise acts of extreme courageousness and altruism such as the one carried out by Edinburgh South constituent, Dougal Smart, who died in November 2003 while trying to save the life of a tourist in Southern Australia and whose untimely death, although honoured by the Australian government, has not yet been publicly recognised in the UK.
