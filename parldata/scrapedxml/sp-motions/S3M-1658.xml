*S3M-1658 Lewis Macdonald: Forensic Science Laboratory in Aberdeen—That the Parliament notes with concern that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice is currently considering plans to close the forensic science laboratory in Aberdeen; recognises the vital role that forensic scientists and fingerprint staff play in working with police officers in Grampian in tackling crime; notes in particular that forensic scientists working exclusively on volume crime in partnership with officers in Grampian are increasing detection rates on offences such as housebreaking, car crime and vandalism; believes that such progress would be jeopardised by the proposed closure of the Aberdeen forensic science laboratory, and calls on Scottish Ministers to consult the public in Grampian and the Highlands and Islands on the future of the service before reaching any decision to close the Aberdeen forensic science laboratory.
