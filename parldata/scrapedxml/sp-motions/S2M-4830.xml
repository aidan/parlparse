*S2M-4830 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Privatisation of Dental Treatment—That the Parliament notes with concern the creeping privatisation of dental services in the south of Scotland and elsewhere; notes that some dentists are being advised to encourage NHS patients to undertake unnecessary cosmetic dental treatment and that this advice is coming from private companies such as Integrated Dental Holdings, and calls on the Scottish Executive to condemn such practices and to put pressure on local NHS boards to ensure that all dentists are offered fair employment contracts based on their ability to practise and not on their capacity to foist unnecessary private treatment onto patients for the sake of profits.
