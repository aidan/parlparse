 *S1M-1912.2 Ben Wallace: Impact of the European Union on Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1912) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "whilst welcoming this enlargement, opposes a single currency, which will undermine our national sovereignty and lead us closer to a federal integrated Europe, and calls on the Scottish Executive to urge Her Majesty’s Government to support the development of an enlarged European Union which is based on flexibility, fairness and understanding of a member state’s right to determine its own direction on social, economic and foreign policy."
