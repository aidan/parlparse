*S3M-1146 Helen Eadie: Fife Council Places Elderly People in Danger—That the Parliament notes that NHS Fife achieved its target in April 2007 of less than 20 delayed discharges over six weeks and no patients in a short stay bed, immediately prior to the change in control from a Labour-controlled Fife Council to an SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled council but notes that, since the change of political administration, Fife has seen an upward trend in the number of delayed discharges to 164 on 15 September 2007; further notes that, according to a report from NHS Fife, the three main emerging reasons for delays in securing community care arrangements as at the September 2007 census were: non-availability of council funding for care home places, awaiting residential home places and awaiting social support to live at home; further notes that according to a survey of Fife care homes carried out in the last week, some owners of such homes report vacancies being available; recognises that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing advised that £3.5 million would be made available by NHS Fife to Fife Council on a one-off basis to help with the situation but expresses grave concern that patients with urgent cases of dementia and at serious risk are being denied places in specialist homes as a consequence of SNP/Liberal Democrat Fife Council’s decision to cut social work funding and limit finance available and considers that, as a consequence, Fife Council is failing to protect the frailest and most vulnerable people in Fife, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to act as a matter of urgency to ensure that serious danger to our elderly people in Fife is avoided.
