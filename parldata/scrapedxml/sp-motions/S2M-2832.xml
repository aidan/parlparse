 * S2M-2832# Linda Fabiani: Welfare and Education at Dungavel—That the Parliament regrets the fact that asylum seeker families with children are detained; notes, however, the inspection report on Dungavel House immigration removal centre by the Chief Inspector of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons for England and Wales; notes the Chief Inspector’s extreme concern about children at the centre and her disappointment that “no progress had been made in relation to independent assessment of the welfare and developmental needs of the children who were held in Dungavel at the time of this re-inspection”, and considers that the Scottish Executive should enter into discussions with the Home Office’s Immigration and Nationality Department to “ensure that there are independent assessments and reviews of the welfare and educational needs of detained children, and to take note of their findings”, as recommended by the Chief Inspector, and to ensure that South Lanarkshire Council is enabled to meet its obligations under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.
