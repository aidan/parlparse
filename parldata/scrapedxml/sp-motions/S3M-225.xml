*S3M-225 Sandra White: Glasgow Sleepout—That the Parliament extends its full support to the sleepout on 21 June 2007 in George Square, Glasgow, and other sleepouts throughout the rest of the United Kingdom during the summer as part of the Still Human Still Here campaign which aims to highlight the destitution that many asylum seekers find themselves in as a result of policies designed to force them out of the country; agrees with the recommendations of the campaign which call on the UK Government to end the threat and use of destitution as a tool of government policy against refused asylum seekers, to continue financial support and accommodation to refused asylum seekers as provided during the asylum process, to grant permission to work until such time as they have left the UK or been granted leave to remain and to continue to provide full access to health care and education throughout the same period, and believes that these sleepout events are invaluable in highlighting the terrible plight that many asylum seekers find themselves in and maintaining the necessary pressure required to force a much-needed review of overall asylum policy. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick*, Bob Doris*, Christina McKelvie*, Brian Adam*, Elaine Smith*, Christine Grahame*, Bill Kidd*, Ian McKee*, Bill Wilson*, Gil Paterson*, Rob Gibson*, Aileen Campbell*
