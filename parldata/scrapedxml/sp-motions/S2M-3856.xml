*S2M-3856 Mark Ballard: Trident Nuclear Weapons—That the Parliament believes that there should be the fullest possible public debate on any decision to replace the Trident nuclear weapons system; notes that a successor to Trident could cost as much as £25 billion, therefore significantly affecting other public spending options; calls on the Scottish Executive to urge the UK Government to produce a Green Paper on Trident replacement that considers all possible options, including non-replacement, and further calls on the Executive to urge the UK Government not to conclude any agreements, or to engage in preparations to build a new generation of nuclear weapons, until after this debate.
