*S3M-1349# Patricia Ferguson: Evening Times Campaign - Fighting for a Fairer Deal from Property Managers—That the Parliament notes the problems faced by many home owners living in factored properties; considers that there is a clear requirement for legislation which will ensure that all property managers are registered and that access is available to a recognised form of mediation, and congratulates Glasgow’s Evening Times newspaper on its initiative in highlighting the issue and in pressing for reform of the system.
