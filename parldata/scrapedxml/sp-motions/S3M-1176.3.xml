*S3M-1176.3 Tavish Scott: Budget (Scotland) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1176) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end "but, in so doing, believes that this is a budget of SNP broken promises; believes that the budget document is the most opaque seen since devolution; regrets the failure of the SNP government to provide adequate information on its detailed spending proposals, efficiency savings programme and alternatives to PPP; is further concerned that the budget choices made by the SNP government will lead to cuts in vital public services across Scotland, and therefore calls on the SNP government to address these issues as a matter of urgency."
