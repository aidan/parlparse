*S3M-405 John Park: Support for a Multi-Modal Forth Crossing—That the Parliament notes the publication of options for the Forth replacement crossing; believes that multi-modal transport options across the Forth should feature more prominently in the publication; expresses concern that a road-only crossing would be short-sighted and would not adequately address issues of growing traffic congestion; notes the possibility of "peak oil" being reached in the next 10 years; calls for a rail option to be included in the final proposal for a new crossing, and considers that the project for a new Forth crossing should be commenced without delay. Supported by: David Whitton*, Claire Baker*
