*S3M-4624 Patrick Harvie: Accounting Regulations for Scottish Charities—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government’s recent consultation, Charities And Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005: Proposals for Minor Amendments to the Act and to the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006: Consultation Paper; considers that at present Scottish charities with an annual turnover of more than £100,000 are required to prepare accrual accounts at significant expense, which has a negative impact on their ability to carry out their core activities; recognises that the law in England and Wales was recently changed so that only charities with a turnover of more than £250,000 per annum are required to prepare accrual accounts, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the Scottish requirements do not impose an unreasonable burden on small charities.
