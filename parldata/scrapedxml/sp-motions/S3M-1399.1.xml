*S3M-1399.1 George Foulkes: Congratulations to City of Edinburgh Council on an Excellent Budget—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1399) in the name of Mike Pringle, leave out from "congratulates" to end and insert "notes with grave concern the recent budget of the SNP/Liberal Democrat City of Edinburgh Council which will have a negative impact on services for children and young people across the city; particularly deplores the 1.5% cut from devolved schools’ budgets resulting in at least a £10,000 reduction per average primary school, £10,000 reduction per average special school and £50,000 reduction per average secondary school; further deplores the council’s award-winning youth services being reduced by £357,000, Community Learning and Development being cut by the full-year equivalent of £850,000, and all school meals being increased by an inflation-busting 10p, and believes that the SNP/Liberal Democrat council budget will thus result in the loss of much-needed local services for young people in both schools and the wider community throughout Edinburgh."
