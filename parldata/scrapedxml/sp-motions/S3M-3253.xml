*S3M-3253 Margaret Mitchell: Operation Fleet—That the Parliament notes the success of Operation Fleet, which was targeted at tackling and reducing levels of violence, drugs, disorder and antisocial behaviour through high-profile policing and enforcement in South Lanarkshire; acknowledges that the operation resulted in 62 people being charged with a variety of offences; recognises that this success was achieved through the coordination of over 340 officers and high-visibility policing, which the Scottish Conservatives have consistently advocated, and welcomes the emphasis on public safety as one of the main objectives of the initiative.
