*S3M-1931 Keith Brown: Re-linking Pensions to Average Earnings—That the Parliament supports the campaign by the Scottish Pensioners’ Forum on behalf of Scotland’s pensioners for a decent basic state pension; notes that 2008 is the 100th anniversary of the introduction of pensions in the United Kingdom; further notes that in the 2005 Westminster election, the manifestos of most parties called for the reintroduction of the link between annual increases in the basic state pension and annual increases in national average earnings; recognises that as of November 2006 this has also been the aim of the Labour government at Westminster; also recognises that decisions on matters relating to pensions are matters within the responsibility of the UK Government and Parliament, and therefore calls on the UK Government to effect the restoration of the link as soon as possible and substantially before 2012.
