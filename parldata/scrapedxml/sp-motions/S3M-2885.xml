*S3M-2885 George Foulkes: UK Government’s Welcome Decision on Post Office Cards—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the UK Labour government to keep the Post Office card account with the post office until at least 2015; believes that comments by the SNP candidate in the Glenrothes by-election and the Deputy First Minister, both of whom suggested that the Labour government was set to strip this vital service from post offices, were misleading and deeply irresponsible, causing fear and alarm to the many pensioners across Scotland who use and value the Post Office account service, and further believes motion S3M-2876 by Aileen Campbell to be hollow and politically motivated.
