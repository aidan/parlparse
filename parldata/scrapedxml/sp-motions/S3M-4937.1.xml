 *S3M-4937.1 Liam McArthur: The Power of Scotland Renewed Report Publication—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4937) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from "calls on" to end and insert "notes that the UK Government’s Department of Energy and Climate Change’s consultation paper, issued on 17 June 2009, would require a new coal-fired power station only to demonstrate at the outset a carbon capture and storage (CCS) capacity of 400MW gross; recognises that, if this were applied to the proposed 1,600MW coal-fired power station at Hunterston, 75% of the CO2 emissions would continue unabated until the technology is proven, which could take at least 15 or 20 years; regrets that Scottish ministers have confirmed their intention to align the Scottish position with that of the United Kingdom, irrespective of the implications for the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009; believes that CCS technology would best be developed on existing coal-fired and gas-fired stations, such as Longannet; believes that the Scottish Government must differentiate between existing coal-fired and gas-fired stations and new coal-fired and gas-fired stations, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce policy for consenting to new thermal power plants under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, which supersedes the National Planning Framework, to prevent any new coal power stations from being granted planning consent unless they make full use of CCS technology from the outset." Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
