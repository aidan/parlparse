*S2M-5546 Tommy Sheridan: Justice for the Shrewsbury 24—That the Parliament notes the recent launch of a campaign to secure justice for the 24 construction workers charged with conspiracy during the 1972 building workers’ strike who many believe were viciously victimised; further notes that the Shrewsbury 24, as they become known, were taking part in a legal and legitimate official strike when they were arrested and charged, with six men receiving harsh gaol sentences and the 18 others being branded criminals for life and receiving two year suspended sentences; condemns the brutal treatment meted out by the establishment against these workers whose only "crime" was to oppose the exploitative use of "cash-in-hand" employment and the lack of health and safety practices afforded to workers in the construction industry; salutes the courage of the Shrewsbury 24 for standing up for workers’ rights despite the intimidation of the employers and the state and demands that the conviction of these men be immediately quashed and a terrible wrong be addressed 34 years after the convictions which relied upon an 1875 law on unlawful assembly; notes with concern the recent comments of Terry Renshaw, one of the Shrewsbury 24, when he said "despite our fight for proper protection for workers, which cost us so highly, the death rate on construction sites, the highest in any industry, remains the same today as it was 34 years ago"; supports the Justice for the Shrewsbury 24 Campaign, and demands greater safety conditions for all construction workers.
