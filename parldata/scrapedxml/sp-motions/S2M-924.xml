*S2M-924 Frances Curran: Hull City Council-That the Parliament applauds the decision of Hull's Labour controlled city council to introduce free healthy school meals, breakfasts and tea-time snacks for 22,300 primary schoolchildren in Hull in a move intended to improve child health and poverty; notes that council leader Councillor Colin Inglis declared that "we hope to set the pace for the whole country"; agrees wholeheartedly with this move, and calls on the Scottish Parliament to follow suit and introduce free school meals throughout Scotland.
