*S2M-1902# Helen Eadie: Commonwealth of Learning Award for Open University Access Programme—That the Parliament notes that the Open University’s (OU) short course programme "Openings" consists of short flexible courses designed to give students, particularly from under-represented groups, an experience of OU study, the intention of which is to bridge the divide between further and higher education and to give students clear pathways for their future development; congratulates the OU for winning the prestigious Commonwealth of Learning Award for excellence in distance education materials at the recent pan-commonwealth conference in New Zealand for its "Understanding Children" course, part of the Openings programme, which has received international recognition for giving over 36,000 people a stepping stone into higher education; notes that the course was praised for its "innovative approach to designing, developing and implementing an access course"; notes that the quality of the multi-media course materials and the level of support provided to students were also given special mention; commemorates the 100th anniversary on 3 November 2004 of the birth of Jenny Lee, formerly Labour MP and Baroness Lee of Asheridge, the founder of the Open University and celebrates the fact that Jenny Lee, wife of Aneurin Bevan, was born and lived her early life in Cowdenbeath, in the Dunfermline East constituency, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider a service of commemoration not only to celebrate Jenny Lee’s life but also to mark the amazing achievements and contribution which the Open University continues to make to our world.
