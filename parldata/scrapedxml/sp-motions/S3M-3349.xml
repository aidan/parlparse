S3M-3349# Shirley-Anne Somerville: Earth Hour 2009—That the Parliament supports WWF’s Earth Hour 2009, which aims to encourage millions of people worldwide and across Scotland to switch off their lights for an hour at 8.30 pm on Saturday 28 March 2009, to send a powerful global message that we care enough about climate change to take action and demonstrate widespread public support for an equitable, binding and scientifically credible global deal on climate change and, in Scotland, strong Scottish climate change legislation; considers that 2009 is a critical year for action on climate change with a new global deal to be agreed in Copenhagen in December; acknowledges the opportunity for Scotland to take a global lead with the most progressive legislation in the world through a strong Climate Change (Scotland) Bill; recognises that the global deal must address the historical responsibility of the United Kingdom and other developed countries as major contributors to climate change; commends local government in Edinburgh alongside the many individuals who are early signatories to support WWF’s Earth Hour in Scotland, and further considers that the Scottish and UK governments are in an ideal position to take a proactive, progressive and leading role throughout the 2009 negotiations. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick, Alasdair Allan, Bill Kidd, Christina McKelvie, Alex Neil, Angela Constance, Robin Harper, Mike Pringle, Stuart McMillan, Aileen Campbell, Christine Grahame, Michael Matheson, Jamie Hepburn, Gil Paterson, Jim Hume, Dave Thompson, Malcolm Chisholm, David Stewart, Rob Gibson, Liam McArthur, John Park, Ken Macintosh, Ms Wendy Alexander, Jamie McGrigor, Cathy Peattie, Alison McInnes Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
