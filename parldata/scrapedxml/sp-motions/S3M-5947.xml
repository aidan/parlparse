*S3M-5947 Jamie Stone: Housing Budget Cuts—That the Parliament is aware of the shortage of affordable housing across Scotland and particularly in the Highlands and Islands where the problem can be described as acute; is therefore very concerned by the Scottish Government’s move to cut spending on affordable housing in 2011-12 by 45%, which will mean a reduction in spending from £32 million to £17.5 million; believes that this will be very damaging to affordable housing programmes and make a real impact on families trying to find a place to live, and, therefore, as a matter of urgency, calls on the Scottish Government to revisit its decision.
