 *S1M-2328 Tommy Sheridan: Railways-That the Parliament believes that the railways belong to the people of Britain and that no compensation should therefore be paid to private shareholders of Railtrack; further believes that the operating company should also be taken back into public ownership, and considers that a new democratic structure involving workers and users of the industry should be established to ensure real democratic control of our railways north and south of the border.
