*S2M-1326.1 Eleanor Scott: Health Issues-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "the current" to end and insert "demand for healthcare can never be fully met; recognises that prevention of illness and promotion of good health is crucial, and that this cannot be delivered by the NHS, but requires action by all those public bodies whose decisions shape our lifestyle, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all public bodies have a health-promoting agenda, so that the people of Scotland can live healthy lives in a healthy environment."
