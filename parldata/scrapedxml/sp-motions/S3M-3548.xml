*S3M-3548♦ Des McNulty: Community Service Volunteers—That the Parliament commends Community Service Volunteers (CSV) for its strong track record in supporting retired people to engage with their local communities as volunteers; congratulates the CSV-RSVP (Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme) voluntary drivers project in West Dunbartonshire, which organises the pick-up and return to their homes of elderly people and other patients who would otherwise be unable to attend local health clinics and hospitals; notes that direct government funding for this and other similar volunteering schemes ends in March 2009; expresses grave concern that local authorities across Scotland are not making financial provision for these services to continue despite Scottish ministers advising projects to seek funding through community planning partnerships, and would welcome the provision of suitable financial support to ensure that the work of well-used and successful projects, including CSV-RSVP in West Dunbartonshire, can continue.
