 *S2M-5416 David McLetchie: 300th Anniversary of the Act of Union—That the Parliament notes that 16 January 2007 is the 300th anniversary of the passing of the Act of Union by the Scottish Parliament; believes that the union has been one of the greatest political success stories of modern European history; recognises that the union continues to contribute massively to our culture, strength, stability and prosperity while enabling each of the constituent parts to retain its proud sense of national and local identity; is convinced that all four countries that make up the United Kingdom benefit from the union and that we continue to achieve much more together than we would as separate nations, and invites all supporters of the union of all political persuasions and of none to use the 300th anniversary to reiterate the case for, and continued relevance of, the union for this century and beyond.
