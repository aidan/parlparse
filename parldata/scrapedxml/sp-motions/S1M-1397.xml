 *S1M-1397# Nick Johnston: Pornography in W H Smith Stores-That the Parliament notes with disapproval the decision of W H Smith to reintroduce pornography to its stores; urges the company to reconsider its decision to sell material which is not only offensive to many people but which reinforces practices of exploitation and discrimination; further asserts that such material does nothing to enhance society, has a corrosive effect on the morality of Scotland and debases not just those who are inadvertently forced into contact with it and are by the nature of their employment compelled to offer it for sale, and also asserts that such material demeans Scotland as a nation and that the Parliament would welcome any action which would encourage the removal of such filth from public display and sale.
