*S3M-7345 Malcolm Chisholm: Leith Biomass Plantâ€”That the Parliament is concerned about the proposal from Forth Energy to build a large electricity-from-biomass plant at Leith docks; understands that it will involve the transportation of large quantities of wood from many thousands of miles away and the release of massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere; is also concerned about the consequences to the local environment, including a 120-metre-high chimney in a residential area and the release of dioxins from it; supports environmentally friendly renewable energy developments, including small-scale combined heat and power biomass, and calls for a moratorium on the development of large-scale electricity-from-biomass plants. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
