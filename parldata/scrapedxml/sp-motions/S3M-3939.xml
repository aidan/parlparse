*S3M-3939 John Park: Miners’ Knee—That the Parliament notes that thousands of miners suffer from a form of osteoarthritis of the knee, also known as miners’ knee; further notes the recommendation of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council that coal miners with the condition who have worked underground for 10 years or more should be able to claim Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit; welcomes the recent announcement by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions that miners’ knee will now be added to the list of prescribed diseases, ensuring that former miners will now be able to apply for state compensation through Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit; believes that this is a fitting announcement in the 25th anniversary year of the miners’ strike; recognises the work that has been carried out over the years by the National Union of Mineworkers to improve the rights and welfare of miners and former miners, and hopes that members of the Scottish Parliament will work with the National Union of Mineworkers in Scotland for the benefit of all miners, former miners, mining families and mining communities across Scotland.
