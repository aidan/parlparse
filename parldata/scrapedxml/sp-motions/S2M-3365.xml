*S2M-3365 Dr Jean Turner: Provision of Papers in Alternative Formats to Print—That the Parliament wishes to recognise the work being done by the Scottish Executive in including blind and partially-sighted people in its consultation processes by transcribing print to both Braille and audio formats and commends the role of Cue and Review Recording Services in this process; acknowledges the important role that Executive funding has played in developing Cue and Review’s website which includes an automated quote tool; recognises, however, that provision of material in audio, Braille and large print formats is insufficient unless it publicises that this information is available in these formats, and calls on the Executive to ensure that all future publicity carries this information to encourage blind and partially-sighted people to ask for consultation papers in their preferred format.
