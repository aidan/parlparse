*S1M-2313 Michael Matheson: Falkirk 2008 European Football Championship Bid—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to exclude from its consideration the joint application submitted by Falkirk Football Club and Falkirk Council for the SFA’s bid for the European Football Championship in 2008; congratulates both the club and the council for their vision in pursuing this application; further notes their continued determination to provide a community football stadium within Falkirk, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to support the club and the council in securing the necessary funding for a community football stadium. Supported by: Andrew Wilson*, Mr Gil Paterson*, Alex Neil*, Linda Fabiani*
