 *S2M-2471 Murdo Fraser: Debt Reliefâ€”That the Parliament notes that this is the 60th anniversary year of the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank; recognises that the IMF and the World Bank have voiced a commitment to ensuring that individual countries determine their own economic path; acknowledges that aid and debt relief on their own will never solve the problem of global poverty but that good governance, free enterprise, free markets and fairer trade are required; believes that trade protection for developed countries at the expense of the developing world is both immoral and hypocritical, and believes that faster and deeper debt relief alongside the promotion of free enterprise and encouraging freer, fairer trade will help lift millions of people out of poverty.
