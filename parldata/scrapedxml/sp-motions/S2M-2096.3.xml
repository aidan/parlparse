*S2M-2096.3 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Towards a Sustainable Aquaculture Industryâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2096) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end "but questions the timetable and scope of the proposed Aquaculture bill; further notes that the Executive has still failed to meet 14 targets it set out in the Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture, and laments that it has taken it six years to set up a review into the current regulatory framework with a view to lightening the burden of regulation that threatens to choke the industry."
