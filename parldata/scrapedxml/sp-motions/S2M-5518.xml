*S2M-5518 Christine Grahame: National Status for Scots Charities—That the Parliament notes the anomaly of registered UK charities, based and operating solely in England, that are given "national" status which enables them to raise funds in Scotland but with no requirement to provide support or benefit to nations outside England; notes that this places Scottish-registered charities at a disadvantage through not being able to raise funds in England, and urges ministers to enter into negotiations with their English counterparts to resolve this unequal situation and allow registered Scottish charities to raise funds on an even playing field with those based and operating solely in England.
