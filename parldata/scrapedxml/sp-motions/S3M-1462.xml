*S3M-1462 Michael Matheson: Scotland’s Support for Nuclear Security Project—That the Parliament recognises the efforts of the Nuclear Security Project in bringing together international security leaders and nuclear experts from 29 countries in Oslo, Norway, this week in order to advance the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons; welcomes such a project, which has won the wholehearted backing of former US officials with extensive experience as secretaries of state and defence and national security advisors; acknowledges the inherent value of reducing nuclear dangers with the ultimate aim of universal nuclear disarmament; believes that Scotland should find its own voice in seeking to forestall the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the spread of nuclear enrichment and reprocessing, and notes the potential for Scotland to assume a leading role in the international effort to promote a world free of nuclear weapons.
