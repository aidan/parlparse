S3M-4596 John Wilson: Children’s Asthma Practice Support (CAPS)—That the Parliament welcomes the NHS Lanarkshire project, Children’s Asthma Practice Support (CAPS), currently being piloted throughout Motherwell and Wishaw and which aims to provide improved asthma services in local communities; notes that 22 nurses have completed specialist training to ensure that every health centre in Motherwell and Wishaw has a practice trained nurse who is up-to-date with the most recent asthma management model; recognises the work of nurses, doctors and local parents who have worked with the paediatric respiratory services team to design this new model of asthma care for children, and understands that treating stable asthma in children within the local area will increase confidence in managing children’s asthma and allow hospital-based clinicians to allocate more time to those with more severe cases of the illness.
