 *S3M-8077 Willie Coffey: National Science and Engineering Week and Scotland’s Research Base—That the Parliament notes National Science and Engineering Week, coordinated by the British Science Association, which is scheduled to run from 11 to 20 March 2011; notes that this will include a science fair on Grange Campus, Kilmarnock, involving 200 primary school pupils; further notes the findings of the 2010 report carried out by Evidence, International Comparative Performance of Scotland’s Research Base, that, relative to gross domestic product, more researchers cite innovative work carried out in Scotland than in any other country; notes that, although Scotland has less than 0.1% of the world’s population, the report found that, in 2008, 1.8% of the global citations in new research referred to previous research in Scotland; notes that the report also stated that Scotland had particular strengths in biological science, environmental research and health and medical research, with 2.4%, 2.2% and 1.8% of global citations respectively; endorses the views of Professor Anne Glover, Chief Scientific Adviser to the Scottish Government, that "Scotland is one of the best countries in the world to do science", and invites the media to mark National Science and Engineering Week by communicating strongly to Scotland’s young people that strength in scientific research offers the potential for a rewarding and worthwhile career.
