 *S2M-1065# Rob Gibson: Strategic Assessment of Far North Railway-That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's claim to record investment in public transport; notes its backing for reopening rail routes such as Stirling, Alloa to Kincardine and part of the Waverley line; further notes the recent Highlands and Islands Enterprise report showing that demand for the rail network in the Highlands is growing and that demand could be increased further by more investment in infrastructure and timetables, and considers that the Executive should initiate a strategic assessment of the rail service between Inverness, Thurso and Wick with particular attention to the feasibility of a Dornoch Firth rail crossing to shorten significantly the rail journey times on the route, taking into account specific provision for the Lairg loop stations. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Tommy Sheridan*, Jim Mather*, Stewart Stevenson*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Richard Lochhead*, Eleanor Scott*
