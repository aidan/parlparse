*S3M-7554 Jackie Baillie: Postman Pat On The Back—That the Parliament commends what it considers to be the hard work and commitment of Scotland’s postmen and women during the recent severe weather conditions; considers that the Royal Mail has kept the country’s mail flowing across Scotland despite what it sees as the chaos caused by sub-zero temperatures; understands that the festive season is the busiest time of year for the Royal Mail and that it depends on the dedication of its staff to cope with the increased volume of letters, parcels and Christmas cards, and praises the postmen and women of Helensburgh and Lomond, Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven for their efforts this season and all year round.
