*S3M-3841 Pauline McNeill: Daily Record and Sunday Mail Pension Scheme—That the Parliament expresses its concern at developments at the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, where staff have voted overwhelming for strike action; is concerned that Trinity Mirror, following its decision to merge the two editorial desks, at the likely cost of 70 jobs, has decided not to use its discretion to enhance the pensions of those employees with over 25 years’ service, thereby making compulsory redundancies more likely; calls on management to reinstate this discretionary element in order to ensure that as many of the redundancies as possible are made on a voluntary basis, and further calls on management within the media and newspaper industry to consider the impact of job losses on the quality of journalistic output.
