*S2M-3508 Colin Fox: Scotsman Journalists Sacked—That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scotsman newspaper group to sack seven of its journalists on its daily and Sunday titles; notes with concern that the decision comes on the back of recent assurances to the National Union of Journalists that there would be no compulsory redundancies during this phase of cutbacks, and believes that falling sales at The Scotsman are the consequences of decisions taken by the editor and management and that it is therefore they who should shoulder the full responsibility.
