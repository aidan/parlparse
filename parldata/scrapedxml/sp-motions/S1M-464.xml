*S1M-464 David Mundell: Necessity of Cross Border Study—That the Parliament recognises the geographic reality that some students in the South of Scotland have no option but to study in the North of England through either the practicality of transport links or a social need to stay at home and attend the university course available at the place most conveniently near to their home; recognises that the choice of the place of study for these students is not simply an academic choice but is one of practicality and necessity, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to produce proposals which ensure that those students in the South of Scotland who require to study in the North of England out of geographic or social necessity rather than academic choice can do so on the same financial basis as students resident in Scotland studying in Scotland.
