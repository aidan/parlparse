*S3M-1739 Tavish Scott: Shetland Museum Leads for Scotland in Art Fund Prize 2008—That the Parliament congratulates the Shetland Museum and Archives for winning through to the final shortlist of four museums competing for the Art Fund Prize 2008; notes that this is the result of the hard work of the staff involved in running the museum; further notes that this news will not surprise the many visitors who have visited the exciting new museum and archives since it was opened last year and who have enjoyed its well-presented displays set in the impressive complex of new and restored buildings at Hays Dock in Lerwick, and calls on all Scots to get behind the Shetland Museum and Archives as it competes against three museums in the south of England before the winner of the Art Fund Prize 2008 is announced on 22 May.
