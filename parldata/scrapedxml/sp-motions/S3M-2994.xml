*S3M-2994 Robin Harper: Recovery Zones for Bee Populations—That the Parliament welcomes the European Parliament’s overwhelming vote in favour of providing recovery zones for bee populations; notes how reliant Scottish agriculture is on bees for pollination and food security; expresses its concern over the recent sharp decline in bee numbers, and calls on the Scottish Government to follow the European Parliament’s lead by identifying areas of pollen and nectar-rich land in Scotland that can subsequently attract subsidy or other supports to provide conditions that will allow our vital bee populations to begin to recover.
