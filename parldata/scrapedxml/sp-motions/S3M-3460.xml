*S3M-3460 Bill Kidd: Collision of HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphantâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern reports that trident missile-armed HMS Vanguard collided with its French equivalent, Le Triomphant, in the Atlantic on 3 or 4 February 2009, resulting in damage to both nuclear-armed vessels; believes that it is the duty of the Ministry of Defence to release full details of the collision to the public; agrees with the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (SCND) that this collision highlights the danger of keeping nuclear submarines at sea when there is no threat to Britain, and recognises the urgent need to scrap Trident in the face of such potential catastrophe.
