*S2M-3845 Carolyn Leckie: The Local Government Pension Scheme and Abolition of Rule of 85—That the Parliament is concerned to learn of the contents of the Scottish Executive’s answer to question S2W-21675 by Mr Tom McCabe on 17 January 2006 with reference to changes to the Scottish Local Government Pension Scheme; regrets the Executive’s manner of announcing its support for the abolition of Rule of 85, which would cause detriment to 200,000 local government workers; believes that this demonstrates a lack of respect for local government workers, their representatives, employers and COSLA; believes that it is a misjudgement on the part of the Executive to disregard the views and legal opinions presented by COSLA and UNISON; further believes that the Executive should take urgent action to redress the harm caused by the content of the answer and manner of the announcement; is concerned about other measures to erode local government pensions; supports local government workers in their efforts to protect their pensions and rights, and considers that the Executive should initiate urgent discussions with COSLA and the trade unions to achieve a solution agreeable to all. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Rosie Kane*
