*S3M-7168 Tom McCabe: Scrapping of Universal Child Benefit—That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government to abandon the principle of universal child benefit by what it considers to be crudely removing the eligibility of households with a higher rate taxpayer to receive that allowance; is concerned at this as it believes that it is an unfair decision that punishes families with one income just beyond the eligibility threshold while continuing with what it considers to be the unjust targeting of children following the removal of the child trust fund; believes that this undermines the principle that every child is entitled to child benefit and the protection that children are entitled to from the government of the day, and calls on Liberal Democrats in Scotland to distance themselves from what it believes is this unfair measure. Supported by: Gil Paterson*, Cathy Jamieson*, Patrick Harvie*, Kenneth Gibson*, Patricia Ferguson*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Jackie Baillie*, Mary Mulligan*, Brian Adam*
