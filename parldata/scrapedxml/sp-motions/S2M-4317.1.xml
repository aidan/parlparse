*S2M-4317.1 Mr David Davidson on behalf of the Justice 2 Committee: Police and Justice Bill - UK Legislationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4317) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end "but, in doing so, expresses serious concerns over the ambiguity of the status of an extradition request in respect of a person domiciled in Scotland against whom the Lord Advocate has decided not to proceed; notes that the United States of America has not, over a period of some three years, ratified the bilateral extradition treaty with the United Kingdom, and accordingly, in the interest of equality between nations and recognising the distinctive nature of the Scottish legal system and the need to protect the civil liberties and human rights of those living in Scotland, urges the Minister for Justice to make representations to the UK Government based upon these concerns."
