*S3M-7757 Brian Adam: Listen to Supporters’ Views on the Future of the SPL—That the Parliament notes the ongoing discussions in the Scottish Premier League (SPL) regarding the future structure of the league; regrets the apparent rush toward a decision before supporters have had the chance to look at and scrutinise the proposals; notes the Supporters Direct survey in which nearly nine out of 10 supporters opposed a 10-team league; believes that, as the paying customers of the SPL, supporters’ views should be taken onboard, and calls on the SPL and individual clubs to consult fans before a final decision is made.
