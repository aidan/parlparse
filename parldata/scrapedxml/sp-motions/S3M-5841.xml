*S3M-5841 Rob Gibson: Divert RBS Investment from Tar Sands Oil Extraction—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, Cashing in on Tar Sands - RBS, UK Banks and Canada’s Blood Oil, by Friends of the Earth, Platform and other green groups, which deplores the exploitation of tar sands in north-west Canada by international oil companies such as Shell and BP; raises concerns about the effects on climate change of the greenhouse gases released in processing this low-grade oil source; welcomes the Co-operative and the Fair Pensions lobby group release of a special briefing paper to alert shareholders in the companies involved; particularly points to the alleged £4.9 billion in loans made to these oil extraction operators in the last three years by Royal Bank of Scotland, and urges UK Financial Investments Limited to order a change of direction in energy investment toward Scottish wind, wave and tidal power as a sustainable means for RBS, which is over 80% owned by the UK taxpayer, to restore its balance sheet in the long term.
