*S3M-3824 Bill Kidd: Life Expectancy Gap Grows Under Labour—That the Parliament expresses its concern at new figures released by the General Register Office for Scotland showing that the life expectancy gap between rich and poor people in Scotland has grown vastly since Labour came to office in 1997, with the difference for women having increased from 5.8 years between 1996 and 1998 to 6.3 years between 2007 and 2009 and the difference for men having increased from 8.6 years to 8.7 years; believes that the policies of the UK Labour Party have driven a wedge between Scotland’s richest and poorest people, while the Scottish Government has aimed to bridge this gap with policies that make a real difference, such as freezing council tax and slashing prescription charges, and further believes that these recent figures call into question the credibility of the Labour Party’s renewed commitment to fairness and equality.
