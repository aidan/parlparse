*S3M-2671.3 Pauline McNeill: Scottish Broadcasting Commissionâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-2671) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end "; agrees with the commission that Scotland should not lose out on the obvious advantages of being part of the UK broadcasting framework, particularly in research and development of digital media platforms, and believes that the Calman Commission should consider the role of the Parliament in playing an active role in scrutinising and promoting the broadcasting industry as it relates to Scotland."
