*S2M-1533 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Stop the Unfair Taxing of Our Troops-That the Parliament deplores the fact that Scottish troops are still required to pay council tax whilst serving abroad in places such as Iraq; considers it unfair that persons in prison, diplomats and members of visiting defence organisations, among others, are exempt from paying council tax within Scotland but members of our own armed forces when serving abroad are not, and further considers that members should support immediate legislation to ensure that our troops are no longer forced to pay this tax while not even domiciled within Scotland.
