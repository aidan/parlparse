 *S3M-7231♦ Sandra White: Scrapping of the Security Industry Authority—That the Parliament commends the excellent progress made by the Security Industry Authority (SIA) in tackling serious and organised crime in the security industry and notes the strong support for its continuation among senior law enforcement officers; further notes the comments of Scotland’s most senior police officer, Strathclyde Chief Constable Steve House, that "Scotland needs an SIA or equivalent body", and hopes that the SIA or an equivalent Scottish body can be retained in Scotland.
