*S1M-3518# Brian Fitzpatrick: End Debt on our Doorstep—That the Parliament applauds the work of the individuals and organisations supporting the Debt on our Doorstep campaign in speaking out against poverty, the effects of debt and extortionate lending and for fair and affordable finance in Scotland and across the whole of the United Kingdom; acknowledges the progress made since Church Action on Poverty's Pilgrimage against Poverty in 1999 and the commitments made by Her Majesty's Government and the devolved administrations to tackling poverty and social injustice but recognises that still too many people in this country continue to struggle with the burdens of poverty and debt and are systematically excluded from affordable credit and forced into the arms of extortionate lenders; affirms the need for greater awareness and support for credit unions and other community finance and development initiatives and for high street lenders to more fully honour their social responsibility obligations; considers that the Scottish Executive should, working together with the other devolved administrations and Her Majesty’s Government, make progress on securing tighter regulation of extortionate lending and establishing accessible and fair Social Fund arrangements so as to alleviate the burdens of debt on poor people and their families, and congratulates the organisers of the End Debt on Our Doorstep Lobby and Action Day taking place in Edinburgh and London on 3 December 2002 for stimulating public debate and creating fora where the voices and needs of folk with direct experience of poverty and debt can be heard.
