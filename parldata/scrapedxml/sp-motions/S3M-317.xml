 *S3M-317 Margo MacDonald: Referendum on EU Treatyâ€”That the Parliament believes that there should be a referendum on the proposed EU treaty currently awaiting signature by the member countries of the European Union; notes that the leaders of many of these countries have made statements which accord closely with the findings of Open Europe that the overwhelming majority of the 250 proposals in the European constitution, rejected by Dutch and French voters in referenda, remain unchanged in the revised treaty, and therefore considers that there is an unassailable case for the referendum that was promised in the event of major changes in EU sovereignty.
