 *S3M-3840 Ian McKee: Prescription Charges—That the Parliament welcomes the reduction in prescription charges from 1 April 2009 to £4 and to £38 for a 12-month prescription pre-payment certificate, which will help all those who are struggling to pay for medicines through the current recession; notes that the abolition of prescription charges reflects the principles of our national health service, free at the point of use; considers that evidence shows that it is those with long-term conditions who have benefited the most from last year’s prescription cuts, and finds it totally unacceptable that in the 21st century Scottish citizens should be taxed on ill health through prescription charges.
