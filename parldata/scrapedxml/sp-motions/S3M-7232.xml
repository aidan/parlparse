*S3M-7232 Bill Butler: Show Racism the Red Card Fortnight of Action 2010—That the Parliament notes that 15 until 31 October 2010 marks Show Racism the Red Card’s 7th annual Fortnight of Action, which will feature 30 anti-racist community events across Scotland and includes Islamophobia workshops at Knightswood Secondary School in Glasgow; welcomes the support of Scotland’s football clubs for the campaign with activity at Scottish Football League, Scottish Women’s Premier League, Scottish Women’s Football League and Scottish Cup second round matches on 23 and 24 October and at Scottish Premier League matches on the weekend of 30 and 31 October; believes that Scottish football, both at club and international level, has benefited hugely from the participation of players born outside of Scotland; abhors the treatment of players who have been racially abused at grounds across Scotland, and unequivocally affirms that racism has no place in Scottish society.
