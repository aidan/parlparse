*S3M-4501 Cathy Jamieson: Congratulations to the STUC Youth Conference—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) Youth Conference, which will be held in Dundee on 27 and 28 June 2009, and its theme, Unions Work for Young People’s Wellbeing; recognises that young people are at greater risk of being injured and made ill by their work and are far more likely to suffer mental health illness when either or both parents have a history of long-term unemployment, and believes that the STUC Youth Committee should be congratulated for highlighting the role that improved health and wellbeing in young workers can have in pulling the economy out of recession and for its efforts in engaging with organisations such as the Samaritans, Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health, see me, respectme and Working Health Service Lothian to promote the need for improved health and wellbeing in Scottish workplaces.
