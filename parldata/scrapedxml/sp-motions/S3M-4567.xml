*S3M-4567 Bob Doris: Summer Sport—That the Parliament recognises the efforts of sporting groups working with children across Scotland as we enter the summer school holidays; notes that the North Glasgow Football Development Group is hosting a four week summer football camp at the north Kelvinside pitches in Maryhill where SFA-qualified coaches will teach valuable skills to youngsters and will hold weekly mini tournaments to encourage their football talents; believes that the summer break is a perfect opportunity for youngsters to enjoy outdoor activities, and expresses the gratitude for the time and commitment so selflessly devoted by the organisers of this programme and also to those contributing to sporting activities for children across the nation, from which the benefit cannot be underestimated.
