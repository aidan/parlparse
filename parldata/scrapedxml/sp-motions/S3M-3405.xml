*S3M-3405 Bob Doris: Welcoming OFT Steps in Sale and Rent Back—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has written to a number of sale and rent back companies asking them to substantiate their advertising claims; believes that the OFT is acting correctly to protect the rights of the most vulnerable homeowners from some unscrupulous companies who buy properties from people struggling to make mortgage repayments, often at well below the market value, and rent back, often at well above the market value and contrary to the original agreements; calls on the UK Government to implement the OFT’s recommendations on sale and rent back schemes, in particular the recommendation that such companies should be regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and welcomes all measures by both the Scottish and UK governments to support homeowners experiencing hardship during this recession.
