*S3M-5693 Ross Finnie: Health Secretary Must End St Margaret’s Fiasco—That the Parliament notes the comments made by John Bannon, a non-executive board member of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, who is reported to have stated that board members have not been made aware of key aspects of the decisions made concerning the development of Blawarthill Hospital, which could lead to the proposed closure of beds at St Margaret of Scotland Hospice; further notes an article in Scottish Review by Kenneth Roy that raises serious questions about the Blawarthill proposal, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate the serious issues raised by Messers Bannon and Roy with a view to resolving the future of St Margaret of Scotland Hospice.
