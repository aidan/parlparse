*S2M-4966 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Clean Coal Technology—That the Parliament notes the announcement by British Energy of the imminent shut down of the nuclear power station at Hunterston in Ayrshire; welcomes such a move and hopes that this will be followed by an announcement of the closure of all nuclear facilities in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that British Energy undertakes a full site-decontamination process, and further calls on the Executive to take this opportunity to initiate a programme of power production from clean coal technology as part of an energy mix that creates and maintains jobs in both the opencast and farming sectors while meeting Scotland’s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol.
