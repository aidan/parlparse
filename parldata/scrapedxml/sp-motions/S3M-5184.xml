*S3M-5184 Marilyn Livingstone: Scottish Coastal Rowing Project—That the Parliament welcomes the initiative of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Project, launched on 31 October 2009; notes that the aim of the project is to restart local regattas in Fife and throughout Scotland and to promote friendly intercommunal competition through racing; recognises that the project connects with the histories of coastal communities such as Dysart and East Wemyss and provides an opportunity to encourage craft skills by using a team of apprentices from Adam Smith College; commends the guiding principle that boats should be available at a low cost, consistent with safety, for use by community groups, including youth groups, as a means of constructive competition, and acknowledges the benefits that this project will bring to Fife and Scotland as a place to live and an important tourist destination.
