 *S3M-7228 Elaine Smith: Fighting All the Way for Equal Pay—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of How fair is Britain? Equality, Human Rights and Good Relations in 2010, The First Triennial Review by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC); notes the report finds that, 40 years after the passing of the Equal Pay Act 1970, women in the UK still earn significantly less than men; is concerned by the report’s conclusion that progress in closing the gender pay gap in the UK has ground to a halt; welcomes the EHRC’s goal of closing the gender pay gap faster and further, and commends Close the Gap, in conjunction with the STUC, for supporting what it considers to be the Mikron theatre company’s excellent production, Striking The Balance…fighting all the way for equal pay, which was performed recently in Glasgow and Edinburgh to celebrate 40 years of the Equal Pay Act and which chronicles the continuing struggle to close the gap since the act was passed.
