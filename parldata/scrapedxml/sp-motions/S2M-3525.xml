*S2M-3525 Carolyn Leckie: Amnesty for the Women of Cornton Vale—That the Parliament notes with concern the latest statistics from the Scottish Executive, which show that the vast majority of women in HM Prison Cornton Vale are there for non-violent crime and that they are essentially victims of society, imprisoned for minor offences that are rooted in poverty, exclusion, drug and alcohol dependency and abuse and violence against them as women; acknowledges that the criminal justice system is widely believed to be failing these women and wider society, and calls on the Executive to make immediate plans for the amnesty and release of all women imprisoned in Scotland for non-violent crime, review the cases of all women in jail and put the appropriate resources and supports in their communities to help them achieve fulfilling lives outside prison. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Rosie Kane*, Tommy Sheridan*
