*S3M-2071 Helen Eadie: Good News for Ankylosing Spondylitis Sufferers—That the Parliament welcomes the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland’s endorsement of the multiple technology appraisal by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to approve anti-TNF treatments for patients with severe active ankylosing spondylitis (AS); believes that such treatments add to the quality of life of people affected by AS and will allow many people to take control of their treatment at home; commends the Scottish Medicines Consortium for its approval of anti-TNF for AS in October 2006, and calls on NHS Scotland to ensure people who are eligible have access to treatment as soon as possible to improve their welfare and quality of life.
