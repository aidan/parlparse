*S1M-1853 Christine Grahame: Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week 2001—That the Parliament notes with concern that, while Scotland is the multiple sclerosis (MS) capital of the world with 10,400 people with MS, only 2.4% of these people have access to beta interferon compared with equivalent percentages of 15% in Finland and 13% in Italy; notes that the cost of providing beta interferon to those in Scotland who might benefit would be some £7 million, representing a minute fraction of the NHS budget; queries the cost of beta interferon in Scotland as compared to elsewhere; notes the inadequate provision of physiotherapy for those affected by MS; further notes the lack of provision of specialist MS nurses; affirms that MS nurses should be fully funded by the NHS; notes that there is an urgent need for suitable respite facilities; recommends that it be standard practice on a diagnosis of MS that the appropriate consultant meet the patient’s GP to inform them and discuss the case, as many GPs may only occasionally see a case of MS and may therefore be uninformed about the disease and treatments; considers that money expended on the above will not only benefit the 10,400 people with MS and their carers but would also lead to a net saving to the public purse, and commends all those with MS, their carers and the MS Society for their continuing campaign for justice in health care provision.
