*S1M-2646# Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Secondary Schools Staffing Levels-That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of Glasgow City Council to introduce a new method of calculating staffing levels at secondary schools in Glasgow involving staffing schools on an average pupil roll across the year whereby, for example, if there are 800 pupils in August and a projected 750 in January following the departure of January school leavers the school will be staffed for 775 pupils from August; notes that no other local authority uses this practice; further notes that potentially 38 secondary teaching posts could be lost as a result, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should make urgent representations to Glasgow City Council against introducing this method of calculating staffing levels.
