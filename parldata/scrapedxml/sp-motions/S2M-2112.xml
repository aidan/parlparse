 *S2M-2112 Donald Gorrie: Erskine—That the Parliament recognises the contribution made to Scottish life by the Erskine organisation through its care for ex-servicemen and women throughout Scotland since its foundation in 1916 as Erskine Hospital for men who had lost a limb in the First World War; recognises its continuation as an independent Scottish charity supported by voluntary contributions, providing physical and emotional care to ex-service people harmed in the Second World War and the many wars since; further recognises its employment of people with disabilities in its commercial gardening, furniture and print outlets, and wishes it well in its continuing development of its services at Erskine and in Edinburgh. Supported by: Trish Godman*
