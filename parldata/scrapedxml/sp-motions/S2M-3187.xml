*S2M-3187 Tommy Sheridan: Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance—That the Parliament accepts that various travel and accommodation allowances are designed to ensure that elected MSPs are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenditure whilst endeavouring to represent their constituents; rejects, however, the use of the Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance (EAA) by certain MSPs to purchase properties at public expense which they then privately profit from when they decide to sell on; regrets that, to date, several MSPs have personally pocketed large sums of money through use of the EAA and that this practice brings the whole Parliament into disrepute; believes that no MSP should personally profit from an allowance scheme introduced to meet away-from-home living costs and that the current EAA should be radically altered to ensure that any surplus accrued to properties purchased under the scheme is returned to the Parliament; believes that the 90-minute rule for qualification for the EAA should be re-examined and applied to each MSP’s actual home address and not their constituency; recognises that MSPs are paid a very large wage which places them in the top 4% of income earners in Scotland; believes that the use of public money for travel and allowance schemes must be above reproach but considers that the current EAA fails that test as it allows MSPs to pocket thousands of pounds personally at public expense, and therefore agrees that the current second-homes scandal must be stopped.
