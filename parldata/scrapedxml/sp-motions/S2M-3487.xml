*S2M-3487 Murdo Fraser: Autism-Specific Medical Treatment Centre—That the Parliament congratulates the charity, Action Against Autism, for bringing to Scotland, at the Royal College of Physicians, six of the world’s leading medical doctors practising in the field of autism, who articulated to delegates from over 10 countries that autism can be treated by the introduction of safe and proven interventions for the often painful and distressing underlying medical conditions which courageous children with autism are experiencing, and believes that the Scottish Executive should give consideration to the establishment of an Autism-Specific Medical Treatment Centre in Scotland to address the needs of the 3,400 primary school children and others who have been identified as suffering from this devastating condition.
