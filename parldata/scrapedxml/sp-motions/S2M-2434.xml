 *S2M-2434 Christine Grahame: Family Mediation Bordersâ€”That the Parliament notes the concerns of Family Mediation Borders regarding the proposed funding arrangements underpinning the Family Law (Scotland) Bill which the service considers will cause it serious financial difficulties resulting in, at least, the cutting back of its core service provision and, at worst, closure; notes that Family Mediation Borders assisted 550 parents and children in the last year; further notes that, apart from the human benefit of mediated settlement with regard to contact and residency for children, there must inevitably be savings to the public purse in legal aid and other costs, such as shrieval time, because of successful mediated settlement; notes also the provision by Family Mediation Borders of contact facilities, particularly important in a sprawling rural area with poor public transport links, and urges the Scottish Executive to retain the current funding arrangements and expand such local family mediation services which will be even more invaluable with the proposed changes in family law.
