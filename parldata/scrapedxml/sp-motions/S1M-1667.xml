 *S1M-1667 Mr Adam Ingram: Funding Cuts at the Scottish Agricultural College—That the Parliament notes with concern that the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) will suffer absolute cuts in funding from the Scottish Executive of some £1.5 million over the next three years; notes that these cuts will fall on the education and research functions of the college, taking out productive capacity and therefore limiting the SAC’s ability to replace core funding cuts by income generation; recognises that SAC has a key role to play in rural development particularly at a time when the agriculture and fishing industries are in crisis, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to review its perverse decision on SAC funding which will hinder both rural development and lifelong learning objectives in rural Scotland. Supported by: Mr Gil Paterson*, Michael Matheson*, Alex Neil*, Ms Margo MacDonald*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Mr Lloyd Quinan*
