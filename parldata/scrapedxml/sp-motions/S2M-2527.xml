*S2M-2527 Mr Brian Monteith: Criminals Should Not Be Rewarded For Crime—That the Parliament condemns the actions of the BBC in paying convicted burglar, Brendan Fearon, £4,000 to appear in a BBC documentary while the victim of the burglary received no fee; believes that this is a wholly inappropriate use of the TV licence fee and that the BBC’s actions will disgust the majority of TV licence fee payers who have no control over how the licence fee money is spent, and calls for legislation to ensure that convicted criminals cannot make money from their crimes.
