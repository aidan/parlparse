*S2M-2145# Elaine Smith: Oxfam Asylum Positive Images Project—That the Parliament congratulates Oxfam on its Asylum Positive Images Project; welcomes the project’s aims of promoting accurate, fair and well-informed media coverage of asylum issues; recognises the findings of a recent Mori Poll commissioned by Oxfam which found that more than 83% of people surveyed agreed that individuals seeking asylum in Scotland should be given the opportunity to work; notes that 64% of people maintained that Scotland should be a safe haven for those fleeing persecution and that a further 60% believed that children should not be held in detention centres; acknowledges that these findings illustrate the goodwill that exists towards refugees and asylum seekers in Scotland; considers that the Scottish Executive has a responsibility to recognise, promote and encourage such attitudes as part of the drive towards a more inclusive and tolerant Scotland, and suggests that the continued operation of Dungavel House immigration removal centre undermines this objective.
