 *S3M-3635 Stuart McMillan: Home Reports Boost Buyers’ Interest—That the Parliament welcomes the results of a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland showing that more people are thinking about buying a home as a result of new seller reports; notes that eight out of the 10 largest chartered surveyor firms said that the introduction of home reports had boosted interest in the housing market, and acknowledges that the implementation of home reports by the Scottish Government has helped house buyers to save money and obtain greater peace of mind about the properties that they may wish to purchase.
