 *S3M-1618 Alasdair Allan: Nuclear Non-Proliferationâ€”That the Parliament notes the statement on a National Security Strategy by the Prime Minister to the House of Commons on 19 March 2008 in which he stated his desire to achieve "after 2010 a more robust implementation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with the aim of accelerating disarmament among possessor states, preventing proliferation and ultimately freeing the world from nuclear weapons"; condemns the contradictory nature of this statement while the UK Government is continuing to press ahead with its plans to replace the trident nuclear missile system, and calls on the UK Government to send a major signal to the review talks of 2010 by abandoning this plan as an encouragement to all nuclear states to disarm.
