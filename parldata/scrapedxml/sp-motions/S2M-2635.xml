 * S2M-2635 Christine Grahame: Council Tax Poverty—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of a Help the Aged survey regarding the plight of many of Scotland’s pensioners which disclosed that some 70% of those responding were in council tax poverty, that the average pensioner paid 11% of net income on council tax and water rates, that accordingly the majority of pensioner households are forced to make budget cuts every year following increases in council tax and water rates and that these cuts are often made in heating, leisure, clothing and travel; notes that some 22% of those surveyed did not know that they were entitled to council tax benefit and that 40% of those entitled to claim benefit did not do so; further notes that it may be that the poorest pensioners are the very people who do not claim; notes the one-off payment of £200 towards council tax and considers this to be little more than a pre-election bribe and further that it is not payable to those female pensioners under the age of 65 who are often the poorest; notes that the Scottish National Party is committed to a non-means-tested citizens’ pension to be increased in line with earnings and to a local income tax, both of which would give dignity and independence to Scotland’s pensioners, one in five of whom live in poverty, and calls on the Scottish Executive, at the very least, to introduce a local income tax as soon as practicable and to end the abhorrent means-testing of our pensioners which is not only undignified but is failing.
