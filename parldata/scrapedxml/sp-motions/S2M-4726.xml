*S2M-4726 Donald Gorrie: Burns Monument, Kay Park, Kilmarnock—That the Parliament urges East Ayrshire Council to restore the world-famous Burns Monument in Kay Park, Kilmarnock, which is currently suffering from vandalism and decay, so that it can play its part in the celebrations and tourism related to the memory of Burns, especially in view of the desire of the Scottish Executive and many organisations and individuals in Scotland and throughout the world to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Robert Burns’ birth in 2009.
