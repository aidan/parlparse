*S2M-296# Christine Grahame: Funding of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs—That the Parliament notes the terms of the Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. Act 2000 and, in particular, section 15; welcomes the presumption of mainstreaming of children and young people with special needs; is concerned, however, that local authorities may find, due to circumstances outwith their control, that they lack sufficient funding to comply with these requirements and that children and young people with special needs will therefore be disadvantaged, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider rucksack funding, that is the supplementary funding of such children and young people centrally where the funding package for all aspects of their care is above a statutory figure, and further consider putting systems in place for payment of, and application for, central funding and for such applications to be considered by the relevant local authority, the Executive and representatives of the child or young person.
