*S2M-3133 Rosie Kane: Concern About Racist Headlines Following on from London Bombingsâ€”That the Parliament views the Daily Express headline from 27 July 2005, "Bombers are all spongeing asylum seekers", with deep concern; believes that, as well as being factually incorrect, the headline is an incitement to racial hatred as defined in Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 and could result in attacks on both individuals and minority communities; notes that, according to the Muslim Safety Forum which works closely with the police, the number of faith-related attacks in London has increased by 500% compared with the same period last year; believes that everything possible should be done to rebuild good community relations and prevent a further escalation in race hatred, and, therefore, calls for a halt to such irresponsible journalism and for action to be taken against the editors and journalists concerned.
