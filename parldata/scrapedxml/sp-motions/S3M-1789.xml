*S3M-1789 Andy Kerr: Closure of JVC Facility in East Kilbrideâ€”That the Parliament condemns the decision by JVC to close its East Kilbride electronics plant with the loss of 300 local jobs and an additional 60 agency jobs as production will shift to eastern Europe; is alarmed at the lack of transparency, accountability and consultation afforded to the workforce by the company, as news of the closure was given at a canteen meeting called by management; notes that the closure of the plant was preceded by the loss of 99 jobs in September 2007; calls on the Scottish Government to act immediately to support manufacturing in Scotland and ensure that redundant workers are re-employed at the earliest opportunity, and supports the efforts of Unite the Union to secure the best possible benefits for the workforce.
