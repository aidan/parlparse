 S2M-2683 # Mark Ballard: Trade Justice Week—That the Parliament commends groups like Oxfam, the World Development Movement and Friends of the Earth for campaigning during Trade Justice Week for new trade rules that rebalance global trade in favour of local communities and their environment; believes that governments should have the right to decide their own trade policies to protect people and the environment from destruction and abuse; acknowledges the conflict between the current free trade agenda and the world’s environmental limits and accepts that the emphasis on growth, regardless of environmental costs, puts pressure on natural resources, often contributing to climate change, and concurs with Friends of the Earth Scotland’s Chief Executive, Duncan McLaren, that “Current trade under the World Trade Organisation is widening gaps between rich and poor, stripping rights from local communities and plundering the Earth’s natural resources. Rich countries and big business are forcing their agenda of free trade and open markets upon the world but this model is failing with devastating results. Trade Justice Week is about sending a clear message to politicians that the world needs trade justice, not free trade.” R Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Cathy Peattie, Fiona Hyslop
