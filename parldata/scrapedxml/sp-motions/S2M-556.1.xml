 *S2M-556.1 Roseanna Cunningham: Common Agricultural Policy Reform-As an amendment to motion (S2M-556) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the CAP Reform Agreement of June 2003; recognises that it has the potential to deliver a better deal for Scottish agriculture and for rural Scotland as a whole than the current arrangements; believes that the range of agri-environmental measures should be expanded to promote a sustainable rural economy that will be of benefit to all those involved in Scottish agriculture as well as all those who live and work in rural Scotland, but urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that decisions about the various flexibilities are made in Scotland, on the basis of what is best for Scotland, and are not subject to external pressures dictating UK-wide uniformity."
