*S1M-3304 Tommy Sheridan: UK Position on Iraq—That the Parliament notes the continued threats by George W Bush and the USA to affect a "regime change" in Iraq by any means necessary; condemns the USA’s bully-boy tactics and its international sabre-rattling, which does nothing to build greater unity, peace and harmony throughout our diverse world; believes that the USA is increasingly isolated in its war-mongering intentions to invade Iraq despite opposition from across Europe and even from within the United Nations; calls on Her Majesty’s Government to issue a clear statement of opposition to involvement in any attack on Iraq in the interests of promoting greater world peace and harmony, and further believes that, should Her Majesty’s Government commit any support, physically or financially, to an American-led attack on Iraq, a special debate should be arranged immediately in the Parliament.
