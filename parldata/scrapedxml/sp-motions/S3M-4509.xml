*S3M-4509 Christopher Harvie: Job Losses at MGt, Kirkcaldy—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by MGt, based in Kirkcaldy, the billing and software provider to the sports broadcaster Setanta, that it will lay off 10% of its workforce, resulting in the loss of 100 jobs, in order to cut costs in the wake of Setanta going into administration in the United Kingdom; deplores the fact that the economic recession is putting outsourced support and software centre employees in a highly vulnerable position; calls on the management of MGt to give full consideration, during the 30-day consultation period, to other means of cutting costs, such as management salaries, to reduce the planned number of redundancies; asks MGt to work with the Scottish Government and other public bodies to ensure that every assistance is offered to the workers and families affected, and also calls for management and workers’ representatives to consider an appeal to top-class premier league players, who might be well disposed and well placed to offer support to fans and workers, on the bottom rung of their industry, threatened with redundancy.
