*S1M-2420 Trish Godman: Disabled Drivers and Supermarkets-That the Parliament commends the campaign by the Baywatch Campaign, British Polio Fellowship, the Disabled Drivers' Association, the Disabled Drivers' Motor Club and Disability Now to give more protection to disabled parking bays in supermarket car parks; deplores the selfishness of other drivers who occupy such spaces with their own cars, and welcomes the initiatives taken by Asda, Safeway, Sainsbury's and Tesco to tackle this problem in a much more effective way than has been the case in the past.
