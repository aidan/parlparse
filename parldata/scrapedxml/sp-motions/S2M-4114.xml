 *S2M-4114 Mr Mark Ruskell: Global CO2 Concentrations—That the Parliament notes that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has now reached 381 parts per million, the highest level for at least one million years; further notes that concentrations have risen by 2.6 parts per million over the past year, one of the largest annual increases on record; believes that urgent action is vital if we have any chance to stabilise atmospheric carbon levels; notes the confirmed closure of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology unit at Banchory which will weaken Scottish-based research into climate change and its effects, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider legislative moves similar to those in Westminster where Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative politicians have joined forces to propose legislation on micro-renewable power and the setting of annual reduction targets for CO2 emissions.
