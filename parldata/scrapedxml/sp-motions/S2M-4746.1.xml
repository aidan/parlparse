 *S2M-4746.1 Miss Annabel Goldie: Future of Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4746) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from "welcomes" to "four years" and insert "notes that since devolution the gap between the poor and the rich has widened, waiting lists and times are going up, crime is getting worse, council tax has increased by 60% and economic growth is lagging behind England; recognises that these problems are not the fault of devolution, but are the fault of the Labour and Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive; believes that, to make devolution work, more power and responsibility need to be returned to people and local communities, real public sector reform needs to be instigated and better value for money needs to be provided;"
