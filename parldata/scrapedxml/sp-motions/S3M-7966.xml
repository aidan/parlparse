*S3M-7966 Lewis Macdonald: Concerns Regarding Scottish Tourism Revenues—That the Parliament notes the concerns raised by tourism and transport operators about the impact of recent and planned rises in air passenger duty (APD); notes the recent report commissioned by Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, which suggests that the increase in APD in November 2010 could cost Scotland’s airports more than one million passengers over the next three years and cost the wider Scottish economy up to £77 million in spending by tourists; regrets the decision by the current Scottish administration to discontinue and not replace what was considered the highly successful air route development fund, and believes that the time has come to boost international trade and tourist visits by a new initiative to support the development of new, direct air services to Scotland.
