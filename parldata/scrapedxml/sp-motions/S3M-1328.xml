*S3M-1328 Christine Grahame: Bring Berwick Back—That the Parliament notes the referendum campaign in Berwick-upon-Tweed, 990 years after the town was ceded to Scotland following the Battle of Carham, to gauge support for the town being returned to the fold of Scottish nationhood; notes that Berwickers are once again considering the benefits of being part of Scotland; recognises the strong levels of support in the town for such a move, which sees the benefits that Scotland has derived from slowly removing the barriers to progress and prosperity by becoming increasingly independent of London control; agrees that we would warmly welcome Berwick-upon-Tweed back into the nation of Scotland as we move to regaining our full independence, and urges Scottish ministers to begin negotiations with HM Government to secure Berwick-upon-Tweed’s restoration as part of the nation of Scotland.
