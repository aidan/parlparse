 *S3M-6962 George Foulkes: Edinburgh Forensics Laboratory—That the Parliament notes that the official consultation process regarding the Scottish Police Services Authority’s (SPSA) Forensic Services Modernisation Options Paper has closed; further notes that it includes an option that proposes the withdrawal of what are considered key services at the Edinburgh forensic services laboratory; considers that the Edinburgh forensic services laboratory is essential to solving both low and high-level crime; acknowledges the concerns of the forensic staff, who, it considers, provide an excellent service; is concerned that the proposed cutbacks would result in a hugely reduced service for Lothians and Borders Police; believes that this would significantly hinder its ability to fight crime; further believes that the SPSA seems to be more interested in saving money and maximising the use of Gartcosh than protecting forensic services, and is of the view that, when a decision is reached, it should be presented to the Parliament for thorough scrutiny.
