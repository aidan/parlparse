*S2M-4223 Chris Ballance: Takeover of Ottakar’s by Waterstone’s—That the Parliament believes that the provisional decision by the Competition Commission to allow the takeover of Ottakar’s by Waterstone’s is misguided, ignores the distinctive nature of the Scottish book market and disregards the evidence given to the commission by the Cross Party Group on Scottish Writing and Publishing, which made clear its belief that a merger would both limit consumer choice and diminish opportunities for Scottish writers to become established, and urges the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport to lobby the Competition Commission to seek to have this decision reversed before it is made final. Supported by: Shiona Baird*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Mike Pringle*
