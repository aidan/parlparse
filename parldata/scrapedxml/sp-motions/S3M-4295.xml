*S3M-4295 Jamie Hepburn: Low Bids Undermine Royal Mail Privatisation Plan—That the Parliament notes that only two companies have made offers for a 30% stake in the Royal Mail under the UK Government’s plans to part-privatise the service and that what is understood to be the higher of these bids is of just under £2 billion, far less than the UK Government had hoped to raise; believes that this lack of interest shows that the proposals are unworkable and fatally undermines the UK Government’s plans, and calls for the abandonment of these proposals and for the Royal Mail to remain wholly within the public sector as the Labour Party stated as its ambition in its 2005 manifesto. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Kidd*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Aileen Campbell*, Stuart McMillan*, Bill Wilson*
