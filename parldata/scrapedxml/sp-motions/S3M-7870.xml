 *S3M-7870 Bill Kidd: Support for the Egyptian People—That the Parliament wishes to express its full support for the demonstrations by the Egyptian people by stating its unequivocal belief that all peoples have the right to live in a free and democratic society unshackled by dictatorial oppression and the fear of arrest, detention and torture by a private army disguised as a police force, as it considers is the case of the 30-year rule of Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, and calls on President Mubarak to halt what it sees as the thuggish behaviour of his supporters and to step aside now, rather than holding off until September, in order to avert further bloodshed of innocent Egyptians and allow a peaceful transition to democracy. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Sandra White*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Gil Paterson*, Stuart McMillan*, Linda Fabiani*, Kenneth Gibson*, Rob Gibson*, Christine Grahame*, Patrick Harvie*, Bob Doris*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Wilson*
