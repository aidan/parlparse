*S2M-4976 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Aberfan Anniversaryâ€”That the Parliament notes the 40th anniversary of the disaster in Aberfan on 21 October 1966 when 144 people were killed, 116 of them children; further notes that the tragedy happened at 9.15 am as the children of Pantglas Junior School were about to start their lessons when a coal slag heap started to shift and engulfed some terraced cottages, a farm and the school; recognises that a generation of children was wiped out, and expresses its sympathy to the people of Aberfan who have borne this loss. Supported by: Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Murray Tosh*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Campbell Martin*, Tommy Sheridan*, John Swinburne*, Phil Gallie*
