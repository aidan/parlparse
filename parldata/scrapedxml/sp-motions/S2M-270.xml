 *S2M-270# Mike Pringle: Single Transferable Vote and Electoral Reform Society Report—That the Parliament welcomes the Electoral Reform Society’s report, Room for Improvement?, on the 2003 Scottish Parliament elections and, in particular, notes some of the problems it identified with the additional member system of voting; notes the report’s conclusion that the single transferable vote (STV) would overcome many of these problems and overcome the conflict that can arise from having both constituency and list MSPs; agrees that the STV system should be used for the Parliament’s elections, which will enable communities to be better represented; believes that it should have the power to legislate for its own electoral system, and calls on the UK Parliament to transfer that power to this Parliament. Supported by: Mrs Margaret Smith*, Jeremy Purvis*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*
