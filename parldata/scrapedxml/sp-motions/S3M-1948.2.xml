*S3M-1948.2 Alison McInnes: First Glasgow Fare Increases—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1948) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from "fare cap has been lifted" to end and insert "Competition Commission has blamed the removal of its fare cap on the SNP government’s decision not to increase the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) to compensate for rises in fuel duty; regrets the Scottish Government’s refusal to pass on to Scottish bus operators the fuel duty rebate which the UK Government has provided for bus operators in England, thereby putting bus operators north of the border at a competitive disadvantage; further regrets that the Scottish Government’s budget indicates that no further fuel duty will be rebated in the next three years; recognises that the SNP government’s lack of support will have serious implications for bus services in Scotland, particularly for rural service operators that are already at full stretch financially; deplores the fact that bus passengers across Scotland will have to pay for the SNP Government’s poor judgment, and calls on the Scottish government to give a detailed explanation as to why it will not increase the BSOG to compensate for rising fuel duty and what Scottish Ministers intend to do to minimise the impact on bus passengers in Scotland.
