*S3M-1690 Michael Matheson: Spiralling Costs of London Olympics—That the Parliament expresses concern at the comments of Jack Lemley, former Chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority, that the true cost of the London Olympics has been suppressed and that the total bill could top £20 billion; notes that good causes in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have already had their lottery funding slashed to meet the increasing cost of the London games, and calls on the UK Government to ensure that lottery funds are not further raided to meet the cost of the London games.
