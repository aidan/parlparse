 *S1M-1502.1 Fergus Ewing: Salmon Conservation (Scotland) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1502) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "and notes that the measures for the conservation of salmon which the Bill will allow are limited in nature; urges the Scottish Executive to bring forward an action plan designed to conserve salmon in all phases of their life cycle, and recommends that, as the existing corpus of statute law relating to salmon fishing and conservation is both complex and fragmented, a Consolidation Bill be brought forward as soon as practicable."
