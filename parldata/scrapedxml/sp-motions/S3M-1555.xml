*S3M-1555 George Foulkes: Save the Royal Commonwealth Pool—That the Parliament rejects any attempts to remove listed building status from the Royal Commonwealth Pool; believes that it should remain an accessible and affordable pool of high quality to be enjoyed by all the people of Edinburgh; considers that planning to close the pool without a thought for how to replace it defies page 41 of the SNP’s 2007 manifesto, to "expand measures to increase physical activity among children and in the general population", and further believes that the pool is a building for Edinburgh and Scotland to be proud of.
