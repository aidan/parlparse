 *S1M-2205 Bill Aitken: Juvenile Justice—That the Parliament recognises that the Children’s Hearings system as at present constituted is manifestly failing to deal with criminal and offending behaviour and calls upon the Executive to carry out a full review of Scotland’s system of juvenile justice, such a review to include consideration of giving Children’s Hearings an increased range of disposals.
