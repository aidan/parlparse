 * S2M-2807 John Swinburne:Buy Your Own White Stick!—That the Parliament notes with concern the report by the Royal National Institute for the Blind, Buy Your Own White Stick!, published in March 2005, which reveals that many of the 38,000 people in Scotland registered with social work services as blind or partially-blind are being denied basic equipment and essential aids to enable independent and safe living in and out of the home; further notes that such provision is inconsistent across Scotland and is rationed, poorly co-ordinated and subsidised by the voluntary sector, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to support the report’s recommendations to ensure the free supply of basic equipment which will reduce the risk of injury and enhance independent living for blind and partially-sighted people wherever they live in Scotland.
