*S2M-369 Mr Bruce McFee: Labour Party Misuse of NHS Argyll and Clyde's Time—That the Parliament commends NHS Argyll and Clyde for initiating regular briefings between itself and MSPs to improve communication links; notes that West of Scotland Labour MSPs have, for the second time, demanded that they have a separate meeting with NHS officials, including the Chief Executive, thereby incurring additional costs; further notes the financial situation of NHS Argyll and Clyde which recently announced £13.2 million of cuts and also recommended the reduction of maternity services within its locality, and calls upon West of Scotland Labour MSPs to end their system of separate briefings regarding NHS Argyll and Clyde, refrain from such demands in the future and allow the board to operate one single briefing, which will allocate them more time to focus upon the important issues of health care in Argyll and Clyde.
