 *S2M-2756 Ms Sandra White: Life Expectancy Gap for Glasgow Remains the Same After 100 Years of Labour Rule—That the Parliament notes the report published in the British Medical Journal in April 2005, "Health Inequalities and New Labour: how the promises compare with real progress", which highlighted that the life-expectancy gap remains the same as it was 100 years ago, that Glasgow still has the poorest life expectancy in the United Kingdom, with the average length of time you can expect to live in some parts of the city being just 63 years and that the city continues to have among the worst levels of heart disease, stroke and cancer rates in Europe; notes the report’s conclusion that New Labour "have yet to effectively tackle the wider issue of inequality"; notes that almost 100 years of Labour domination in Glasgow have not improved the lives of the city’s poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants, and calls on the Labour-led Scottish Executive to apply a higher dosage of redistributive policies to end poverty and its associated social problems in Scotland once and for all.
