 *S1M-3226 Christine Grahame: Legal Aid in Peeblesshire-That the Parliament notes with concern that there is no local access to legal aid in Tweeddale, the last legal aid practitioner having recently left practice in Peebles; is concerned that this, combined with the current closure of Peebles Sheriff Court and uncertainty over its future, must prejudice access to justice by the people of Peeblesshire, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to address these deficiencies as a matter of urgency.
