*S3M-5332♦ Johann Lamont: Big Lottery Fund, Tackling Need in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the announcement by the Big Lottery Fund that it will spend £400 million in Scotland in the next five years; welcomes the fact that the Big Lottery Fund will now have £50 million more to commit to projects next year than expected; recognises that this increased resource, directed to tackle need and disadvantage in the Glasgow Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland, represents a great opportunity to challenge inequality, and would welcome a clear link between spending decisions on this lottery windfall and the commitment given by Scottish Ministers in Scottish Policy Directions for 2009-2015 to the Big Lottery Fund "to address the priorities of tackling disadvantage, the advancement of well-being and addressing inequalities".
