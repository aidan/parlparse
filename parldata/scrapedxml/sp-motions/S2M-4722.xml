*S2M-4722 Ms Sandra White: End the Genocide Now—That the Parliament extends its greatest sympathies to the people of Darfur in Sudan, where over 400,000 people have died and another three and a half million face starvation due to the ongoing conflict in the region and strongly criticises the international community for not taking any real action whilst the misery continues, despite some of its members calling the situation in Darfur genocide and accusing the Sudanese government of using famine and mass rape as weapons of war; considers that the international community is once again driven by economic concerns, namely in the form of the vast oil reserves in the region, rather than humanitarian ones, and believes that, if we are to end this cycle of global imperialism which continues unabated in Iraq and Afghanistan and has the effect of making large sections of the Muslim population feel alienated and highly suspicious of the motives behind international intervention, be it through "peacekeeping", "humanitarian intervention", "nation building" or "regime change", we must unite in our condemnation of these atrocities and the motives behind the international community’s shameful response.
