S2M-1865 Mark Ballard: White Poppies for Peace—That the Parliament notes that the first white poppies for peace were conceived of by the Women’s Co-operative Guild, many of whom were mothers, sisters, and widows of men killed in the First World War who feared that an even worse war was imminent, that white poppies first appeared on Armistice Day 1933 and that the Peace Pledge Union has subsequently undertaken their distribution; also notes that there have been 300 wars and 200 million war deaths since 1933; believes that the wearing of white poppies is a symbol of grief for everyone who has been harmed by war as well as a commitment to peace with justice, and therefore resolves to support the wearing of white poppies alongside red poppies during the period of remembrance.
