*S3M-6687 Robert Brown: Glasgow Women’s Library—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow Women’s Library on its promotion to full status as an Accredited Museum by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA); notes that the MLA’s Museum Accreditation Scheme sets nationally agreed standards for all museums in the United Kingdom and that this award testifies not only to the importance and value of the Glasgow Women’s Library but also to the hard work and dedication of its staff and members; further notes that the library is undergoing a new phase in its development as it plans to move to its new premises at the Mitchell Library in summer 2010; recognises the efforts of staff to raise the necessary £1.5 million for this move; congratulates them on their results to date, having accumulated nearly £500,000; urges Glasgow City Council to help support the project through its capital contributions and commends the Robertson Trust, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Scottish Arts Council, the Third Sector Enterprise Fund and the Women on the Shelf Scheme on their support of the project to date; wishes the library all the best in its future endeavours to achieve further accreditation as the national women’s library, and urges the Scottish Government to work to support such valuable facilities in the third sector that contribute substantially to the cultural and social fabric of Scottish life.
