*S3M-39# Elaine Murray: Expanding Higher Education Provision at the Crichton Campus in Dumfries—That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the University of the West of Scotland, through the merger of the University of Paisley and Bell College, and its commitment to its four sites, including the Crichton Campus in Dumfries; believes that this should result in increased opportunities for higher education in Dumfries and Galloway but recognises that this will not substitute for the undergraduate courses offered at the Crichton by the University of Glasgow; is therefore very concerned that Glasgow University does not intend to recruit any first-year undergraduate students this year, and believes that the Scottish Executive should continue to work with the Scottish Funding Council and the University of Glasgow to find a solution that will reverse this position and will guarantee that Glasgow University will continue to offer undergraduate degree courses to students at the Crichton.
