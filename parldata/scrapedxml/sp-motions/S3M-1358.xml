*S3M-1358 Jamie Hepburn: Illiterate Woman Sentenced to Death in Saudi Arabia—That the Parliament notes with considerable concern the decision of a court in Saudi Arabia to condemn to death an illiterate woman, Fawza Falih, convicted of witchcraft; supports the calls of Human Rights Watch to King Abdullah to halt the execution and its belief that the conviction of Fawza Falih for witchcraft is a travesty of justice and reveals severe shortcomings in Saudi Arabia’s justice system, and continues to call on government at all levels in the United Kingdom to use its diplomatic influence to promote equal rights and democracy in Saudi Arabia.
