*S3M-967 Tavish Scott: Scots Trad Music Awards 2007—That the Parliament notes the importance to Scotland’s cultural and economic life of its rich variety of traditional music; welcomes the recognition that this is given by the annual Scots Trad Music Awards which highlight the depth of talent available from across Scotland; welcomes the news that the Cullivoe Dance Band from Yell is this year’s winner of the Scottish Dance Band of the Year award, recognising the contribution that they have made to Shetland and Scottish music over many years; further welcomes the individual award of Instrumentalist of the Year to Catriona McKay, whose contribution to Scottish music includes her membership of Shetland’s Fiddlers’ Bid, and believes that these awards show the particular strength of Shetland’s musical heritage which, thanks to the musical tuition available in Shetland’s schools, is being passed on to the young Shetlanders of today, many of whom will be leading competitors for future Scots Trad Music Awards.
