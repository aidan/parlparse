*S1M-2711 Des McNulty: UN 0.7% GNP Target for Development Assistance-That the Parliament notes that the economic consequences of the tragic events of 11 September 2001 will have severe and adverse impacts on developing countries, particularly sub-Sahara Africa; recognises the commitment by international institutions and Her Majesty's Government to the goal of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015; shares the concerns raised by the World Bank and others that without significantly increased development assistance many countries will fail to reach this goal; praises the actions by the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Denmark for consistently achieving the UN 0.7% GNP target for development assistance over many years, and congratulates Luxembourg for achieving the target in 2000 and Portugal and Ireland for setting dates to achieve the target, in 2006 and 2007 respectively; recognises the principle that successful poverty reduction is an essential foundation of stability in an increasingly globalised world; believes that the adoption of an intermediate target of 0.4% for overseas development assistance by 2006 with the goal of achieving the UN 0.7% GNP target by 2012 would strengthen the United Kingdom's advocacy role; welcomes the leadership shown by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, and the Secretary of State for International Development, Claire Short, in establishing a Commonwealth Education Fund to support disadvantaged children in Commonwealth countries, and commends the work of those charities and agencies in Scotland who not only take forward development work in many of the poorer countries but also play a vital role in informing the Scottish people about the importance of development assistance.
