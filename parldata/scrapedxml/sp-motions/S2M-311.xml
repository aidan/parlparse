*S2M-311 Mark Ballard: Network Rail Closure of Level Crossings-That the Parliament condemns the attitude of Network Rail in seeking to close level crossings in Scotland without consultation; notes that this is contrary to the aspirations of the Parliament to support public enjoyment of the countryside, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ask the Secretary of State for Scotland to ensure that in future there is full consultation with local authorities, emergency services and outdoor recreation organisations and that, in taking their views into account, a proper balance is struck between safety and public access in deciding whether or not to close a crossing.
