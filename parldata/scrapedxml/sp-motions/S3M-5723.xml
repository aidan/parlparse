 *S3M-5723 Rob Gibson: Indian BT Brinjal Moratorium Welcomed in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the robust action by the Government of India in deferring the commercial cultivation of what would have been its first genetically modified vegetable crop; considers there to have been widespread public outcry over the plans to grow Bt Brinjal, the variety of genetically modified aubergine targeted at India, and welcomes the indefinite moratorium on growing Bt Brinjal there until sufficient tests are carried out to independently establish the long-term impact of this GM crop on human health and the environment to the satisfaction of both the public and scientific community, and calls on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Food Standards Agency to take a transparent and precautionary stance as exemplified by the Scottish Government regarding proposed GM crops that are being aimed at Scottish growing conditions.
