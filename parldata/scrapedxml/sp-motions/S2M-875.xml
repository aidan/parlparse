*S2M-875# Michael McMahon: Palliative Care in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the initiative of overnight palliative care nurses in Lanarkshire that enables patients with end-stage cancer to be cared for and die at home if that is their wish; recognises the value this work brings to the lives of vulnerable people and their families and the efforts made to take a multi-disciplinary approach; believes that this will encourage a culture of cooperation rather than competition; recognises the need for similar schemes to be rolled out across Scotland while having regard to the different needs in different parts of Scotland, and notes the gaps in the system which need to be addressed such as care for adolescents who do not fall under the care of either adult or paediatric specialists.
