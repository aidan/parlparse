 *S2M-4053 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Save Borderline Theatre Company!—That the Parliament recognises the excellent work of Borderline Theatre Company over the last 32 years; acknowledges the quality and professionalism of the company and its roots in Ayrshire; further recognises that it has entertained almost a million people across Scotland; expresses its disappointment in the Scottish Arts Council’s (SAC) decision to cease its revenue funding which will also mean the loss of Borderline’s extensive Lifelong Learning Programme which last year delivered over 1,100 workshops with 18,168 people taking part; condemns the SAC decision, and invites the Scottish Executive to review urgently the current funding situation for Borderline. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Brian Adam*, Phil Gallie*, Carolyn Leckie*, Chris Ballance*, Robin Harper*
