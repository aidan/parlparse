*S3M-7018 Malcolm Chisholm: Homelessness 2012—That the Parliament reaffirms its commitment to the internationally acclaimed homelessness objective that by 2012 anyone unintentionally homeless should be offered permanent accommodation; believes that this requires continuing investment in the building of new socially rented homes to deal with supply shortages; agrees that preventing homelessness where possible, in line with the principles of early intervention, is also a key priority in achieving this objective, and applauds the work of organisations such as Move On, which has put those principles into practice in a range of successful projects and whose Edinburgh headquarters are based in the Edinburgh North and Leith constituency.
