*S1M-3157 Mr Brian Monteith: Central Scotland Police Headquarters-That the Parliament notes with dismay that the SNP members of Central Scotland Police joint board have instigated a report which will examine the feasibility of relocating the force's headquarters from Randolphfield, Stirling, to a new site in Falkirk; believes that this proposal is being put forward for partisan and parochial reasons and without regard to the impact on either headquarters staff or police finances, and further believes that the proposal is an unnecessary distraction from the greater priorities that the police have to deal with, particularly the growth in crime which, according to the Scottish Executive's own statistics, has risen by 25% in Clackmannanshire, 9% in Stirling, and 3% in Falkirk since 1997. Supported by: Mr Keith Harding*
