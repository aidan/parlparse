 *S3M-4569 Patricia Ferguson: Diageo - No to Job Losses—That the Parliament notes with great concern the announcement by Diageo that it intends to cut up to 900 jobs across Scotland, with 140 of those at Port Dundas in Glasgow; also notes that staff have cooperated fully with the company by allowing agreements on pay and conditions to be suspended; believes that the profitability of the company is due in no small part to the skill, commitment and hard work of their employees; hopes that the proposals may be reconsidered during the consultation period and that all avenues are explored, and believes that the workforce deserve a positive outcome and an end to the uncertainty surrounding their future.
