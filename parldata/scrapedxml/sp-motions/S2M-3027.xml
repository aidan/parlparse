 * S2M-3027 Robin Harper: Fuel Poverty Schemes in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive on the achievements of the Warm Deal and central heating programmes; acknowledges that 87.2% of households receiving measures from the central heating programme have been taken out of fuel poverty, the cost of achieving the satisfactory heating regime was reduced by 49.4% and the mean National Home Energy Rating (NHER) score increased from 3.31 to 6.87; considers that the Executive should continue both schemes but with a single point of access, increased funding, more measures and wider eligibility, particularly for disabled people, families with children under 16 with disabilities and people over 60, and believes that the Executive should consult Energy Action Scotland on the large number of other improvements that they recommend and should come to a decision as a matter of urgency, given that the schemes have only another nine months to run in their present form.
