*S2M-1154 Pauline McNeill: Kenny Richey, a Scot on Death Row-That the Parliament notes that Kenny Richey, a British citizen who grew up in Edinburgh, has spent 16 years on death row in the State of Ohio, despite being described by Amnesty International as a "compelling case of apparent innocence"; notes that following the case having been heard at the sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on 7 May 2003 a final decision is expected imminently on whether he should face execution; notes that important forensic and eye witness evidence has come to light since the original verdict was reached which casts serious doubt on its safety; notes, however, that this new evidence has not been heard by a court of law, and considers that the First Minister should urge the UK Government to make direct and robust representations to the state authorities in Ohio on behalf of Kenny Richey.
