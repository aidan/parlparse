*S3M-6117 Robert Brown: Cambuslang and Rutherglen Alcohol Initiativeâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Cambuslang and Rutherglen Community Health Initiative on its successful Alcohol Prevention and Education Programme (APEP); notes the vital services that it provides to local communities by way of information distribution, presentations, workshops, training and other resource projects; considers that the APEP has made great inroads in addressing alcohol dependency by raising awareness and engaging with schools, community groups and other agencies; notes with concern its findings, particularly that 36% of residents believe that licensed premises in the community do not act responsibly in terms of the selling of alcohol, that 79% believe that underage drinking is not under control in their community, that 77% believe that drunken anti-social behaviour and/or damage are common in their community and that 47% are not aware of local community projects that tackle the issue of alcohol, and urges all public agencies and the alcohol industry to work together to tackle these concerns, to encourage responsible drinking and to minimise the adverse impact of alcohol on local communities.
