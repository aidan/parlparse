*S2M-833# Mr Brian Monteith: Tax Stamps on Scotch Whisky Products-That the Parliament notes with concern that Her Majesty's Government is once again considering the introduction of tax stamps on spirits, but not on wine or beer; recognises that any such tax stamp would impact particularly on the Scotch whisky industry; believes that the case for a tax stamp system is not proven and that it would be an ineffective means of combating fraud and illicit trade while imposing substantial costs and practical problems on the industry, particularly in relation to labelling and storage; notes the Scottish Executive's Scotch whisky framework which supports a fair taxation regime for Scotch whisky, and therefore believes that the Executive should make representations to Her Majesty's Government against the introduction of tax stamps or any similar burdens on the Scotch whisky industry.
