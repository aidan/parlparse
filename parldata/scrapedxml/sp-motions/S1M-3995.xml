*S1M-3995# Helen Eadie: Lochgelly High School Pipe Bands and Drum Corps - Congratulations—That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement by the Scottish Executive that additional money is to be made available to enable more students to enjoy the opportunity to learn music in schools; congratulates Lochgelly High School’s two pipe bands on their recent achievements and is especially proud that the drum corps, as well as being the world champion, is also British and Cowal champion; further notes that the Novice Juvenile Band is currently Fife, Scottish, Cowal and British champion, winning the coveted Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association’s Champion of Champions title for the season and that the Juvenile Band is currently Fife and British champion; believes that these bands show young people in the very best light, particularly against other bands up to the 19 years age limit but have competed in other Highland Games competitions in Bathgate, Crieff, Thornton, Markinch and Strathmiglo against older, adult bands and, even against such "hairy-kneed" opposition, have won eight firsts, four seconds and one third; supports such splendid achievements, and considers that the First Minister should reward them by inviting them to participate in the USA Tartan Day Celebrations this year.
