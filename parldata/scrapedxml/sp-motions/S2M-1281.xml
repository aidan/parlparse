*S2M-1281# Elaine Smith: Breakthrough Breast Cancer's Decision to Reject Nestlé Deal-That the Parliament congratulates Breakthrough Breast Cancer on the charity's decision to reject a £1 million promotional deal with Nestlé due to ethical concerns surrounding the company's promotion of formula milk in the developing world; recognises that studies indicate that a bottle-fed child living in poverty is up to 14 times more likely to die of diarrhoea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than breastfed infants; notes that companies such as Nestlé make massive profits from artificial milk which they strive to make as like mothers' milk as possible whilst the manufacturers of the real thing, women, remain amongst the world's poorest and most oppressed; believes that breastfeeding is the best way to feed babies; supports the protection and promotion of breastfeeding, and considers that Nestlé should adhere to the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes as adopted by the World Health Organisation in 1981.
