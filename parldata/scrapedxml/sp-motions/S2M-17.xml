 *S2M-17 Maureen Macmillan: Relocation of Scottish Natural Heritage Headquarters to Inverness—That the Parliament endorses the decision of the Scottish Executive to move the headquarters of Scottish Natural Heritage to Inverness; looks forward to the further devolution of government departments and agencies well away from the capital, to the benefit of Scotland as a whole; recognises that the process of devolution away from Edinburgh is very difficult for employees, and calls for all necessary support to be made available to ease moves to other parts of the country, now and in the future.
