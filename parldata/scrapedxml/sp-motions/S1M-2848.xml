*S1M-2848# Cathie Craigie: Deafblind People in Scotland—That the Parliament notes that there are 750 known deafblind people in Scotland, but that Deafblind Scotland and Sense Scotland estimate that the total figure is more likely to be around 2,500; further notes the introduction of guidance under section 7 of the Local Authorities and Social Services Act 1970 on 9 March 2001 in England and Wales, which requires local authorities to be pro-active in their efforts to serve deafblind people and, in particular, to (a) identify and record the number of deafblind people in their area, (b) ensure that an assessment of their needs is carried out, (c) ensure that appropriate services are provided for deafblind people, (d) ensure access to specially trained one-to-one support workers, (e) provide information in formats accessible to deafblind people and (f) ensure that deafblind issues are included as part of one senior manager's responsibilities; recognises that this has represented a major breakthrough for deafblind people in England and Wales, and considers that the Scottish Executive should examine the current provision of services for deafblind people in Scotland and look into ways of introducing similar provision in Scotland
