*S2M-626 Elaine Smith: State Visit to Britain by the President of the United States of America—That the Parliament notes the inappropriate and insensitive timing of the state visit to Britain by the President of the United States of America, George W Bush; believes, however, that this visit can serve as a reminder of the many military and civilian casualties since the commencement of war in Iraq and the many still suffering in the aftermath; expresses solidarity with the United States citizens who opposed the conflict; notes that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have exacerbated instability worldwide, and calls for an end to such pre-emptive attacks on some of the world’s most vulnerable peoples and, instead, encourages engagement with the United Nations to promote peace, equality and an end to world poverty.
