*S3M-3708 Robin Harper: Congratulations to the Young People’s Health Advisory Group—That the Parliament congratulates the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland (SCCYP) and NHS Scotland on their joint event at the Parliament on 12 March 2009, which highlighted and showcased the work of the Young People’s Health Advisory Group (YPHAG); notes that this joint initiative between SCCYP and NHS Education for Scotland on behalf of NHS Scotland enables young people to input to health issues and act as a sounding board on health policy development; was pleased to welcome the YPHAG members, Heather Turnbull, Gary Buchanan, Jenny Hart, Stuart McNally and Jamie Ross, to the Parliament to talk about their work and why they think that it is important to involve young people in the design and delivery of healthcare and health services; acknowledges that listening to young people and taking their opinions into account ultimately leads to better decisions; notes that this pilot is now coming to an end, and hopes that the good work will be built on and taken forward with the establishment of similar groups in each of the NHS boards in Scotland.
