*S2M-3966 Trish Godman: Unfair Fine on St Mirren—That the Parliament believes that the fine of £25,000 imposed on St Mirren FC is both illogical and excessive, given that it was a minor administrative error which led to it failing to name two outfield under-21 players in its squad; believes that such a heavy penalty would cripple many Scottish football clubs; is mindful of the inconsistency in Scottish Football Association (SFA) procedures; recalls that the SFA itself allowed an ineligible player to take part in an under-21 international but chose not to fine or reprimand its members and also opted out of penalising members for the woeful advice given to Dunfermline Athletic FC over the ineligibility of a player selected to play in the League Cup Semi-Final; notes that the SFA fined Livingston FC £10,000 less than St Mirren for the more serious offence of fielding a player wrongly described as an amateur; urges the SFA to review the penalty on St Mirren, and further calls on the members of the SFA to demonstrate a more acceptable degree of consistency and fair-mindedness in their procedures.
