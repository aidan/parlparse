*S3M-1135 Helen Eadie: Wheelchairs - an Essential Aid—That the Parliament notes that the last administration carried out a review of wheelchair services and reported to the Parliament that the service was underfunded by £2.4 million and provided an extra £1 million to help reduce waiting times; further notes that PAMIS (Promoting a More Inclusive Society) and the Scottish Disability Equality Forum state that the funding announcement by the Scottish Government is in fact only £3 million and not the £4 million given in the earlier announcement but, recognising the underfunding identified in the report to the Parliament, the government’s announcement just puts the service where it should have been had NHS boards ensured that the service kept pace with annual uplifts; recognises that the waiting lists for wheelchair users across Scotland pose major problems for all individuals who cannot access wheelchairs particularly those of a specialist nature, and calls on the Scottish Government to monitor carefully and report on an annual basis to the Parliament whether the supply of wheelchairs is matching the needs of all requiring the use of wheelchairs.
