S3M-3687 John Farquhar Munro: Royal Mail’s Threat to Lifeline Postbus Services—That the Parliament recognises the valuable social role that the postbus service plays in remote areas of the west and north Highlands; therefore notes with regret the decision by the Royal Mail to withdraw the three postbus routes in the west Highlands from Diabaig to Achnasheen, Applecross to Torridon and Torridon to Strathcarron and two routes in the far north of Scotland from Thurso to Tongue and Tongue to Bettyhill; considers that the Royal Mail is unwilling to negotiate further with Highland Council over this matter and continues to avoid the issue, and asks the Scottish Government to step in and secure the postbus service, which is vital to many people in these communities.
