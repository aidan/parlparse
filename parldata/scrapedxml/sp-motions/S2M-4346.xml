 *S2M-4346 Fiona Hyslop: Breastfeeding Awareness Week and WHO Survey on Ideal Baby Weights—That the Parliament notes that 14 to 20 May 2006 is Breastfeeding Awareness Week; welcomes the publication of the recent World Health Organisation (WHO) survey of thousands of babies in a number of countries, tracking the baby weights of breastfed babies; notes the implication that, historically, breastfed babies’ weights in Scotland have been charted against bottle-fed babies’ ideal weights, which have been heavier; recognises that this overestimate can lead to unnecessary supplements of formula milk for some breastfed babies, which can lead later to obesity, and might cause some mothers to stop breastfeeding because of mistaken worries about perceived low baby weights, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take measures to prioritise replacing the current charts in baby development books with the more appropriate tracking charts for breastfed babies at the earliest opportunity and to promote breastfeeding.
