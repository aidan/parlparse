*S2M-4724# Dr Elaine Murray: Threat to Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum—That the Parliament commends the efforts of the volunteers who established, maintained and expanded Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum in Heathhall, Dumfries; notes that the museum’s collection includes 21 aircraft, a restored World War II watch tower and a collection of airborne forces’ memorabilia; notes that the museum has achieved a Scottish Tourist Board three-star award and a VisitScotland green tourism silver award; believes that the museum is a valuable asset to the region, providing an educational facility and a tourist attraction; notes that the museum does not receive public subsidy and is therefore extremely concerned that the present owner of the site, Knavesmuir Trust, is proposing to increase the rent by over 600% in this financial year, increasing to over 1,000% in five years’ time; believes that the owner should be encouraged to dispose of the site to Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how it can assist with ensuring the survival of the museum.
