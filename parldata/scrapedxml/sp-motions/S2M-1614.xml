*S2M-1614 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Loss of Scottish Teletext Servicesâ€”That the Parliament strongly disapproves of the actions of Teletext in ceasing the broadcast of a separate Scottish national news service with the incumbent loss of nine of the 14 jobs at present in their Glasgow office; recognises that this means a diminution of quality of service for Scotland, and urges Teletext to reconsider this move and to keep at least one Scottish editor in Glasgow to ensure that the Scottish Teletext service remains monitored and edited within Scotland and not from London, as will be the outcome of this proposal.
