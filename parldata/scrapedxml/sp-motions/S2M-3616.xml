*S2M-3616 Patrick Harvie: Ministerial Commitments on Asylum Protocol—That the Parliament notes the groundswell of opposition to current asylum removal practices being carried out by the Home Office in Scotland; reasserts its view, as expressed in motion S2M-3323 agreed by the Parliament on 22 September 2005, that an agreement is needed between the Home Office and the Scottish Executive which would protect the welfare of children facing removal; notes the commitment made in the Parliament on the same day by the First Minister to seek a “protocol” for this purpose and to report back to the Parliament on progress; notes the First Minister’s statement on 29 September 2005 that the Home Secretary “has agreed that the establishment of such an agreement in Scotland and, perhaps, elsewhere would be advisable”; notes the Deputy First Minister’s assurances to the Parliament on the 27 October 2005 that “the First Minister and the Home Secretary have reached an agreement in principle on the issue” and that the protocol would change removal practices rather than describe existing practice; notes with dismay that the Home Office has this week briefed journalists to the effect that no such protocol will be agreed with the Executive; considers that Scottish ministers have a responsibility to speak honestly in the Parliament and elsewhere, and considers that the contradiction between the ministers’ statements and the Home Office briefing raises the possibility that the First Minister may have misled the Parliament.
