 *S1M-2288 Fergus Ewing: Proposed Liberal Democrat Policy on "Tourism Tax"â€”That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals to be put to a Liberal Democrats conference that a new tax on tourists should be imposed in Scotland; believes that this proposal would cause further damage to an industry which is already facing severe difficulties, and calls upon all who support a vibrant tourist industry to reject this proposed Liberal Democrat policy.
