*S2M-4423# Irene Oldfather: Scottish Maritime Museum—That the Parliament recognises the importance of maintaining and promoting Scotland’s maritime heritage; commends the work of the Scottish Maritime Museum in furthering this aim; notes that the Scottish Maritime Museum has premises in Irvine, Dumbarton and Braehead; recognises that the museum at Irvine Harbourside is currently home to the puffer Spartan, HMS Carrick, and the fishing boat Antares; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to the museum and, in particular, notes that the Executive has provided additional grant funding to allow the Irvine museum to maintain the collection for the last three financial years; notes that the Irvine museum, incorporating the Puffer coffee shop, attracted 25,248 visitors in 2005 and in the same year 701 educational group visits took place; commends the museum for its work in involving the local community of Irvine through organising events for North Ayrshire residents, such as the recent "Show Scotland" event which allowed 807 local people to visit the museum free of charge and the recently launched Fablevision project, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, which brings together disadvantaged young people from Irvine to research and document the history of the puffer Spartan, culminating in the production of a short film; notes that the museum has also been very active in providing opportunities for long-term unemployed people and that the museum currently has six unemployed New Deal placements; regrets that long-term funding for the museum has yet to be secured, thereby preventing the museum from accessing lottery and other funding opportunities; agrees that the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine makes a valuable contribution to Scotland’s cultural heritage and to the North Ayrshire economy, and considers that long-term funding should be offered to secure its future.
