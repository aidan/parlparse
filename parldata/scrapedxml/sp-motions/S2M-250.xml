 *S2M-250 Brian Adam: Scotland's Infantry Regiments-That the Parliament condemns the suggestion that there should be a reduction from six to five in Scotland's infantry regiments by disbandment or amalgamation; notes with pride the histories of the Scottish regiments; recognises the important local loyalties for each of the regiments across Scotland; recalls the magnificent campaign to save the Gordon Highlanders, which unfortunately was ignored by Westminster in 1994, and calls on all Scotland, including the Scottish Executive, to campaign for the retention of all Scotland's infantry regiments.
