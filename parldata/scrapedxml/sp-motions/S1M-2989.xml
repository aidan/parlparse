*S1M-2989 Mr Gil Paterson: Domestic Abuse Courts-That the Parliament welcomes the call by Lord Carloway for the setting up of specialist courts to deal with domestic abuse; notes the effectiveness of this system in dealing with the root causes as well as the symptoms of domestic abuse along with programmes to tackle abusive behaviour as demonstrated in Canada; further notes the cluster courts set up in Leeds which have helped to speed up the court process for cases involving domestic abuse and have made those abused more willing to come forward due to the support they receive and the clear message that is given that abuse is not acceptable, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make the changes necessary to set up these specialist courts in Scotland which will be able to deal with both criminal and civil matters relating to the family. Supported by: Mr Lloyd Quinan*, Mr Adam Ingram*
