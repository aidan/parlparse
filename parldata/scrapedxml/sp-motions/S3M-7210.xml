 *S3M-7210 John Wilson: Welfare Spending Cuts—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent research into welfare undertaken by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the New Policy Institute entitled Working - age ‘ welfare’: who gets it, why, and what it costs; further notes that the study highlights that benefit claimants of working age are disproportionately concentrated in the weakest local economies; considers that a key feature of the research is that the extension of Employment Support Allowanceto existing claimants of incapacity benefit from autumn 2010 onwards risks causing distress while doing little to increase employment, and acknowledges that there are concerns that the health needs of mental health service users are not being taken into account under new eligibility conditions.
