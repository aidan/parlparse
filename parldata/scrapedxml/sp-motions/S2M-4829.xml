*S2M-4829 Donald Gorrie: Football in the Community Programme—That the Parliament commends the joint working of the First Base Agency, an agency working in the sphere of drug and alcohol support and based in Dumfries, and Gretna Football Club’s Football in the Community Programme, using the prestige of the football club to promote positive messages to young people; also recognises similar good work by many other football clubs, using their name to attract young people to take part in constructive educational or recreational activities and anti-drugs and alcohol campaigns, and believes that some of the public money provided for activities of this sort could achieve excellent results and best value by being channelled into schemes which bring together the Scottish Executive, football clubs, local authorities and voluntary organisations to work with young people and attract additional funding from other commercial and charitable sources.
