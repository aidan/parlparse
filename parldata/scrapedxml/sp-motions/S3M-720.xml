*S3M-720 Helen Eadie: First Minister’s Letters to Burman, Iranian and Zimbabwean Leaders—That the Parliament expresses its most profound condemnation of the First Minister, Alex Salmond MSP, who chose to write letters to the governments of some of the most despotic, repressive, undemocratic, villainous regimes in the world: Iran, Burma and Zimbabwe; notes that the First Minister wrote each letter in personal terms, also stating "I would hope we would be able to count on your government’s support...Please do not hesitate to contact me if you or your government wish to discuss these issues further" and signed "Best wishes, Alex"; further censures the First Minister for having written at all to these governments which are the most vilified and dangerous regimes in the world; applauds the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, who has led the calls for there to be a coalition of countries mounting stricter international sanctions with a complete economic boycott against Zimbabwe, highlighting the BBC Newsnight report from Zimbabwe that exposed drastic food shortages with empty food shelves, inflation above 7,500%, infant mortality, average life expectancies in the mid-30s and poor living conditions in townships, lack of power supplies and shocking poverty; congratulates Prime Minister Gordon Brown for saying that he will ensure that he and all of his ministers will boycott the EU International Governmental Conference to be held on 18 December 2007 if President Mugabe is invited to attend, and hopes that folks across Scotland from all walks of life, especially churches, trade unionists and students, will demonstrate solidarity with innocent victims in the regimes of Burma, Iran and Zimbabwe and light a candle on 18 December 2007 for our friends in these countries, especially Father Robert in Zimbabwe who visited and cared for the Parish of Lochgelly in the summer of 2006 for whom we now pray, as we pray for all the innocent victims in these countries.
