 *S3M-7620 Kenneth Gibson: Employment Codes—That the Parliament is opposed to the UK Government’s proposals to scrap the code of practice on workforce matters, which protects workers on outsourced public sector contracts from having different pay and conditions to colleagues working alongside them; believes that the abolition of this code of practice will create a two-tier workforce and will impact heavily on lower-paid workers, particularly in cleaning and catering services; considers that this is a regressive step that will signal to unscrupulous contractors that it is acceptable to pay employees the bare minimum and will, it believes, result in a so-called race to the bottom as some contractors competing for business cut employee wages, and believes that the UK Government should follow the lead of the Scottish Government, which has announced a living wage for employees over which it has responsibility. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Bill Kidd*, Alasdair Allan*, John Wilson*
