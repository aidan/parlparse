 *S1M-1750.1 Roseanna Cunningham: Freedom of Informationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1750) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, insert at end "but nevertheless regrets: (i) the proposed high and potentially prohibitive cost of applications; (ii) the extent and nature of the exemptions, in particular the exemptions afforded to the Crown Office, and (iii) that independent decisions by the Information Commissioner may be vetoed by the First Minister, and further expresses its concern that the passing of a Freedom of Information Bill in the terms proposed by the Executive would make little difference to the culture of secrecy which continues to pervade the governance of Scotland."
