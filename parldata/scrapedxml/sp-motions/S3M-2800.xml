*S3M-2800 Christine Grahame: Fireworks Don’t Work for Animals—That the Parliament notes the concerns of the SSPCA, Scotland’s animal welfare charity, regarding the danger to domestic and wild animals as a result of the widespread use of fireworks well in advance of 5 November and in the days and sometimes weeks after; further notes that while powers in relation to the sale of fireworks remain reserved to Westminster, powers in relation to their use are devolved, and therefore considers that the Scottish Government should embark on a national consultation with a view to bringing forward legislation to regulate further the use and discharge of fireworks, whether for public or personal displays, in order that the welfare of animals is more greatly safeguarded.
