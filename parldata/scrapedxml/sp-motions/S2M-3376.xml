*S2M-3376 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Opposition to Nuclear Power—That the Parliament states its total opposition to nuclear power as a means of energy production; totally opposes any suggestion of building new nuclear power stations in Scotland; acknowledges that recent research, in a UK context, suggests that nuclear power would produce about 50 per cent more global warming emissions than wind power and that nuclear power does not hold any financial benefits compared with the development of renewable energy; accepts that the technology of nuclear power is intimately connected with the technology used to make nuclear weapons and that nuclear facilities are uniquely vulnerable to terrorist attack; recognises that nuclear power produces waste which remains dangerous for tens of thousands of years and that nuclear power leads to radioactive discharges into the seas and atmosphere; notes the recent report from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which estimates that decommissioning costs could be up to £56 billion, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to state categorically that no nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland.
