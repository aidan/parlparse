*S3M-3558 Rhona Brankin: Scrapping of Midlothian Bus Services by First—That the Parliament notes the scrapping, with effect from 20 April 2009, of over 700 bus journeys per week between Edinburgh and Midlothian by First; deplores the fact that this will significantly reduce public transport provision for communities including Gorebridge, Newtongrange, Bonnyrigg, Eskbank, Rosewell and Newton Village; regrets the lack of consultation with the affected communities prior to the announcement; considers that these changes underline the need for communities to have more of a say in the provision of bus services, and believes that there is a strong case for the re-regulation of local bus services if market forces are unable to meet public aspirations for those services.
