*S2M-4067 Stewart Stevenson: No Smoking Day 2006 - "Serious About Stopping?...You Can Do It!"—That the Parliament recognises that 8 March 2006 is No Smoking Day, a campaign which encourages and assists smokers to give up and publicises the many sources of help available to them; further notes that each year more than a million smokers join in the day and an estimated 60,000 actually quit smoking; welcomes the fact that this year’s theme asks: "Serious about stopping?…you can do it!", and hopes that the introduction of the smoking ban will also give people the added impetus to take the opportunity to break their smoking habit which would reduce the tragic statistic that in Scotland over 13,000 people die every year from tobacco use.
