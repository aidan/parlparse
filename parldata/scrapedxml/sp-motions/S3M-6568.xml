*S3M-6568 Mary Mulligan: Raising Awareness in National Epilepsy Week 2010—That the Parliament recognises the collaborative awareness-raising work of Epilepsy Scotland and other Scottish members of the Joint Epilepsy Council of the UK and Ireland; applauds these organisations for highlighting issues for under-25s in National Epilepsy Week, from 13 to 19 June 2010; calls on the Scottish Government and NHS boards to ensure that the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland clinical standards for new patients to be referred to an epilepsy specialist nurse within 30 days are implemented; appreciates the importance of a smooth transition, particularly for young people with difficult-to-control epilepsy, from paediatric to adult health, education and social care services; agrees that investment in transition services and the replication of best practice as highlighted by NHS Highland will bring benefits to many under-25s; welcomes the Cross-Party Group on Epilepsy’s review of new guidelines for children led by Epilepsy Scotland; wishes this national charity’s new ambassador, Rosie Gilmour, every success at her inaugural National Epilepsy Week address, which is scheduled to take place on 16 June 2010 in the Parliament; congratulates the Scottish Government for assisting Epilepsy Scotland in developing new illustrated children’s books for 2 to 7-year-olds and for commissioning its research into Sudden and Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), which can affect the under-25s; acknowledges Epilepsy Scotland’s campaign to make anti-epileptic drugs exempt from proposed generic prescribing regulations; recognises that the Parliament’s best employment practices are informing the charity’s new occupational health guide for employers, and praises partnerships between epilepsy organisations and the Parliament that inform public attitudes, tackle social stigma and create a fair society for the 40,000 people in Scotland with epilepsy.
