*S3M-4884 Aileen Campbell: US Administration Reviews Missile Defence Plansâ€”That the Parliament notes the decision of US President Barack Obama to drop plans for missile defence bases in mainland Europe; believes that this decision will ease tensions with Russia and demonstrates the determination of the US administration to work within existing international structures to maintain global peace and security; notes that the President has also commented on the need for cost considerations in such strategic defence decisions, and calls on the UK Government to review its commitment to the costly and unnecessary renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons programme.
