*S3M-770 Murdo Fraser: Stonewall—That the Parliament deplores the actions of Stonewall in stirring up inter-community tensions by awarding the Bishop of Hereford the "Bigot of the Year" award which is considered to be in extreme bad taste; believes that such activities conflict with assurances given by Stonewall’s Scottish Director to the Equal Opportunities Committee on 23 October 2007 that Stonewall wished to encourage greater work to be done with faith communities; considers that there is an irony in Stonewall campaigning for an amendment to the UK Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill to make incitement to homophobic hatred an offence while simultaneously insulting Christians in what might be regarded as an incitement of religious hatred, and calls on the Scottish Government to review its relationship with Stonewall in light of this behaviour.
