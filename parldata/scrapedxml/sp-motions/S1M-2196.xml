*S1M-2196 Alex Neil: Appointment of Lesley Hynds to Health Education Board for Scotland-That the Parliament expresses its concern at the appointment of Lesley Hynds as Chairman of the Health Education Board for Scotland; questions whether she has the necessary experience and expertise for this job; believes that this is another example of Labour cronyism; calls on the Health and Community Care Committee to hold an inquiry into the appropriateness of this appointment and on the Commissioner for Public Appointments to investigate whether the proper appointment procedures were followed, and believes that this confirms the need for the Parliament to be given the power to vet and, where necessary, veto public appointments, as set out in the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) Bill (Scotland) which has been introduced in the Parliament.
