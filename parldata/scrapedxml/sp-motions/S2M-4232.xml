 *S2M-4232 Shiona Baird: A Globally Responsible Energy Policyâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the publication of an open letter from Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, opposing a new generation of nuclear power stations; agrees with SGR that nuclear power can never be the answer to climate change for reasons of security, economics, health and safety, proliferation and the distraction from more effective energy options; believes that any successful future energy policy must combine efforts to develop genuinely sustainable energy supplies with measures to manage energy demand, and calls on the Scottish Executive to develop a sustainable energy future for Scotland and to do everything in its power to block the construction of any new nuclear power stations.
