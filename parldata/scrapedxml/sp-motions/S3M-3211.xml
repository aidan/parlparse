 S3M-3211 George Foulkes: Academic Freedom Threatened—That the Parliament opposes the SNP government’s proposals to make universities tailor courses more closely to the needs of the economy; notes that this move has provoked an angry backlash from institutions; congratulates the University of Edinburgh for its place as 23rd best university in the world in the Times Higher Education QS World University Rankings; considers that all the staff who have made Edinburgh such a world-class seat of learning and innovation should be left alone to judge what should and should not be taught, and believes that the future of the economy lies in the innovation and skills of the students currently studying and that such talent should be nurtured by professionals in our university sector, not curtailed by the short-term goals of politicians.
