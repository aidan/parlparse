*S1M-1862 Tommy Sheridan: Closure of Motorola Plant, Bathgate—That the Parliament condemns the closure of the Motorola plant at Bathgate and the loss of thousands of jobs; believes that this plant is being closed first because it is easier and cheaper to close a plant here than in the rest of the European Union where workers are protected by the European Directive on the consultation of workers; condemns the UK Labour Government for its failure to sign this directive and calls for it now to reverse this policy, and further believes that the Motorola closure and the many other job losses on the way due to the economic recession can only be dealt with by a socialist economic policy.
