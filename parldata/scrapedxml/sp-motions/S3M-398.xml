 *S3M-398 Robert Brown: Campaign Against Remploy Closures—That the Parliament is concerned at the proposals by Remploy to close or transfer 43 factories out of a total of 83 that it operates; believes that there is a continuing need for sheltered factories to provide skilled and supportive employment as a choice suitable for many disabled people as well as supporting entry for others into mainstream employment; congratulates the workforce and the trade unions on the campaign being run by them against the closures; urges the Scottish Executive to take full advantage of European Union legislation allowing public procurement from organisations like Remploy, and calls on the UK Government to reconsider its support for the Modernising Remploy agenda and to establish an independent inquiry into the future employment needs of disabled people and the management and procurement arrangements at Remploy.
