*S2M-3544 Frances Curran: First Bus Puts Profits Before People—That the Parliament is concerned at First Bus withdrawing bus services in outlying areas of Scotland against the wishes of the local communities; notes that the withdrawal of bus services in the Twechar area, which was not communicated to the local community until the last minute, has left some people with no means to get to their work; is appalled at the arrogant attitude of First Bus management, based in Glasgow, that they do not have to provide a service on any route, that it is well within their rights to cut a service if it is not profitable and that the view of the local community is irrelevant; believes that First Bus’s assertion in its code of business ethics that it will conduct its business “with honesty, integrity and openness” is an empty statement; further believes that, in future, operators’ licences should only be issued when there is a guarantee that certain bus routes within the operating area will be maintained, and notes that we are now seeing the real effect of privatisation of public transport, where bus operators are more concerned with their shareholders’ profits than providing good bus services, can cherry pick the profitable routes and, in this case, force Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) to use public money to pay for an inadequate and reduced service on the routes which First Bus has cancelled which, to add insult to injury, means that SPT is giving the money to First Bus to run these reduced services.
