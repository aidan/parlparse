*S2M-4058# Scott Barrie: Abolition of Tolls on the Forth and Tay Road Bridges—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement to begin planning for the much-needed replacement bridge at Queensferry; further welcomes the fact that the request by the Forth Estuary Transport Authority to increase tolls on the existing bridge has been rejected; believes that it is neither fair, equitable nor consistent to leave Fife as the only area in Scotland to be burdened with tolls; considers that this will have a detrimental effect on social justice and the Fife economy, and supports calls to the Scottish Executive to review its decision to maintain tolling on the Forth and Tay bridges. Supported by: Christine May*, Helen Eadie*, Marilyn Livingstone*
