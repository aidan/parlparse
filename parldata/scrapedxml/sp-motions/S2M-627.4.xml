 *S2M-627.4 Patrick Harvie: Progress in Respect of Fuel Poverty in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-627) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert ", while welcoming improvement in fuel poverty figures in the Scottish House Condition Survey 2002, notes that this derives in part from factors outwith the Scottish Executive's control; considers that addressing home energy efficiency is the most effective way to tackle fuel poverty in addition to helping Scotland meet climate change targets; and calls on the Executive to adopt a single and consistent definition of fuel poverty such as used in the Scottish Fuel Poverty Statement, and further calls on the Executive to commit itself to recognised objective standards for home energy efficiency as used in the Scottish House Condition Survey."
