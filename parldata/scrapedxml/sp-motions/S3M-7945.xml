 *S3M-7945 Alex Neil: Energy Bill - UK Legislationâ€”That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Energy Bill introduced in the House of Lords on 8 December 2010 relating to the creation of powers to develop a new Green Deal for energy efficiency measures, the repeal of the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995, enabling the Coal Authority to charge for services and to implement additional measures to make improvements to regulatory frameworks for the energy markets, so far as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, or alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.
