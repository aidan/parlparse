 *S3M-5029 Jackie Baillie: Bookstartâ€”That the Parliament recognises the importance of the national Bookstart programme; understands that the programme encourages all parents and carers to enjoy books with their children from as early an age as possible; notes that Bookstart aims to give free books to all Scottish children at around eight weeks, 18 months and three years old; further notes that the programme aims to promote reading as a fun activity as well as being educational; congratulates West Dunbartonshire Council on its activities to promote reading from an early age, and welcomes the recent National Bookstart Day on 9 October 2009 as a vital component in combating illiteracy in Scotland.
