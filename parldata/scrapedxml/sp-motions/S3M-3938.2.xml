*S3M-3938.2 Gavin Brown: West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3938) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from "especially" to end and insert "; therefore regrets the previous Labour-led administration’s disappointing record on delivering improvements to key road links connecting the west of Scotland, notably the substantial delays and cost overruns in upgrading the M8 and M74; welcomes the fact that the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link project pioneered by the previous Labour-led administration has been cancelled, thereby freeing up investment for the crucial Edinburgh to Glasgow Rail Improvement Programme, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure the clear prioritisation of transport projects both in the west of Scotland and elsewhere."
