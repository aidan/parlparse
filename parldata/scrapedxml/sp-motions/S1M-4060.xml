*S1M-4060 Christine Grahame: Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Parking Charges-That the Parliament notes with concern that, as from mid-April, staff at the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary will be either paying £250 per annum for a parking permit if they have been successful in their application or paying £10 per day Monday to Friday and £3 per day at weekends; believes that there has been an over-issue of permits; notes that using public transport may be staff's only option and that, for a theatre staff nurse living in Penicuik and working an 11-hour shift from 7.30am to 6.30pm, this will mean leaving home at 6.20am, changing bus with a three-minute transfer time, in order to arrive at work in time to begin the shift, assuming that all buses run to time; refers to the answer to written question S1W-27065 on 16 July 2002 that stated that a review of car parking charges was to be undertaken; calls upon the Scottish Executive to publish results of that review as a matter of urgency, and expresses concern that hospital staff on shifts, with modest income and working in essential medical services, are being charged in this manner. Supported by: Stewart Stevenson*, Ms Sandra White*, Kay Ullrich*
