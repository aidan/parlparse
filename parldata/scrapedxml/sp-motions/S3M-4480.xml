 *S3M-4480 John Wilson: Jobcentre Plus Failing Job Seekers—That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to address the disturbing conclusions of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) report, Now It’s Personal: Personal advisors and the new public sector workforce, which highlights significant inadequacies in the role of personal advisors and asserts that an upskilling of the advisor workforce is needed to increase service effectiveness; is concerned that soaring levels of unemployment have resulted in more people receiving back-to-work support from personal advisors at Jobcentre Plus than at any point since its creation in 2002; worries that major gaps exist in specialist training, including in relation to childcare, homelessness, drug and alcohol misuse and mental health problems, and that the needs of the most vulnerable groups in society are not being adequately addressed by personal advisors, and is concerned that, despite a £1.7 billion allocation to the Department of Work and Pensions to increase the personal advisor network, evidence continues to suggest that low pay amongst Jobcentre Plus staff is resulting in a loss of skilled advisors and high levels of staff turnover, which means a lack of continuity in support for job seekers.
