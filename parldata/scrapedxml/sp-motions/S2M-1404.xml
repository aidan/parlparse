*S2M-1404 Fergus Ewing: Scottish Football Supporters Against the Scottish Premier League-That the Parliament believes that the refusal by the Scottish Premier League (SPL) to accept First Division Champions, Inverness Caledonian Thistle Football Club, as being entitled to promotion to the SPL is unfair and unreasonable and urges every MSP to register concern by signing the on-line petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/spl/petition.html set up by the fans of Inverness Caledonian Thistle which reads: "Scottish Football Supporters against the SPL - To: Scottish Premier League, Scottish Football Association, Scottish Football League, Scottish Parliament - The following persons wish to make known their anger at the Scottish Premier League's ("SPL") decision to deny Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC the right to take up their place in the SPL (on 1st June, 2004). We would also like to protest against the SPL's management of the Scottish game as a whole, and to call for the Scottish Football Association ("SFA") to take control of the administration of all leagues in Scotland. This, in our opinion, is the only way that the Scottish game can progress." Supported by: Alasdair Morgan*, Rob Gibson*, Stewart Stevenson*, Murdo Fraser*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Jim Mather*, Mike Pringle*, Mr David Davidson*, Alex Johnstone*, Christine Grahame*, David Mundell*, Richard Lochhead*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Carolyn Leckie*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Mrs Nanette Milne*
