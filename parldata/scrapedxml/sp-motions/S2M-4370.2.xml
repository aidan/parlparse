*S2M-4370.2 Fiona Hyslop: Drugs and Hidden Harm—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4370) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from first "acknowledges" to end and insert "notes that in 2002 the current First Minister, formerly minister with responsibility for children, said that the Executive and relevant agencies had three years to get their collective act together on child protection; recognises that child protection issues generally, including the increasing number of cases where drugs misuse is a factor, are complex and need thought-through policy solutions and concerted action for delivery, and calls on the Executive to redouble its efforts to complete implementation of the child protection recommendations contained in the 2002 report, It’s everyone’s job to make sure I am alright, which it committed to fulfil but which are still outstanding, and to ensure that it adopts a comprehensive policy approach to proposed legislation for child protection, adoption and fostering and children’s hearings which puts the child at centre stage and which addresses support for kinship care, listens to children and to professionals in the field and also addresses support services where current spend on children’s services by local authorities on average far exceeds GAE allocation to a disproportionate extent."
