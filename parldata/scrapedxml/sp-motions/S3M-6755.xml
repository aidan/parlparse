*S3M-6755 Jack McConnell: Nil by Mouth Marks Ten Years in Campaign Against Sectarianism—That the Parliament acknowledges the 10th anniversary of the formation of Scotland’s only dedicated anti-sectarianism charity, Nil by Mouth; recalls that the charity was set up in response to the senseless sectarian murder of Mark Scott in Glasgow in 1996; notes that over the last decade Nil by Mouth has encouraged and supported a range of community-led anti-sectarianism projects and events, delivered workshops to thousands of school children across Scotland and worked with government, football clubs, workplaces and community groups to promote greater religious tolerance and understanding; considers the progress made over the last decade in challenging sectarian attitudes and behaviour, including anti-sectarianism summits, new penalties for conviction, agreements on rules for parades, school twinning projects and the introduction of the first National Action Plan on Tackling Sectarianism in 2006 and commends the charity on the role that it has played in challenging sectarianism in Scotland, and applauds the commitment of the charity’s trustees, volunteers and staff to tackling sectarian attitudes wherever they are found.
