*S2M-2042 Rosie Kane: The Continued Harassment and Abuse of Mordechai Vanunu by the Israeli State—That the Parliament strongly condemns the latest detention of Mordechai Vanunu on alleged suspicion of passing on classified information on Israel’s nuclear weapons programme to foreign journalists; notes that Mordechai Vanunu has served 18 years in jail in solitary confinement for making public Israel’s nuclear arsenal; further notes that, when Mordechai was released earlier this year, his civil and human rights were further restricted and abused by the Israeli authorities refusing to allow him a passport, banning his contact with foreigners except with permission and barring him from meeting the foreign press and broadcast media and from giving media interviews; believes that Mr Vanunu is not a threat to the Israeli State but is a beacon of peace, justice and integrity at a time when world leaders seem intent on war and destruction, and calls on the Scottish Executive to actively campaign and speak out on behalf of Mordechai Vanunu and to make representations to the Israeli Government for the immediate release and cessation of harassment of Mr Vanunu.
