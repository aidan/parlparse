*S2M-302 Richard Lochhead: Struan Stevenson MEP's Support for the Common Fisheries Policy—That the Parliament deplores Struan Stevenson MEP's call, made in a draft committee report to the European Parliament, to extend and constitutionally enshrine control over the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP); believes that his campaign has the potential to damage efforts to transfer control over our fishing grounds to Scotland's Parliament given the CFP's disastrous record; regrets that Struan Stevenson's actions undermine attempts by our fishing communities to unite public and political opinion behind policies that will protect their future; urges his Conservative colleagues to publicly disassociate themselves from his actions and demand that he withdraws the aforementioned draft report, and calls on him to resign his convenership of the European Fisheries Committee if he is unable to withdraw the draft report.
