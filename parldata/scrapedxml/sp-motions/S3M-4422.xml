 *S3M-4422 Willie Coffey: Tackling Identity Fraud—That the Parliament notes with concern recent evidence of the growing problem of identity fraud; recognises, from UK-wide research released by Liverpool Victoria, that 2% of people have been a victim of identity fraud and that cases of identity fraud have risen by an average of 33% annually for the last eight years; highlights that victims of identity fraud face costs of over £2,100 to clear their names, and considers that, when a lender’s inadequate procedures lead to a reported case of identity fraud, the lender should support the victim in dealing with the consequences and accept responsibility for notifying the police that an offence may have been committed. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
