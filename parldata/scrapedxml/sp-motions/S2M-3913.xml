*S2M-3913 Rosie Kane: No to the Dalkeith Bypass, Yes to the Clean-up of the Land—That the Parliament welcomes the findings of the Fairhurst report, commissioned by the Scottish Executive, into the proposed Dalkeith bypass; notes that the report shows evidence of potential contaminants, such as mercury, arsenic and phenol amongst other poisons, on the proposed site, and therefore calls for an immediate cessation of all work and for a full and thorough environmental assessment of the site to be carried out in order to ascertain the extent of the contamination and for a full decontamination programme to then be undertaken to clean up the land and restore it for use as a natural heritage site for the local community.
