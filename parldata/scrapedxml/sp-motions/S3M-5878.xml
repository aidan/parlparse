*S3M-5878 John Farquhar Munro: Commemoration Statue for Tom Johnston—That the Parliament considers that the North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board (NOSHEB) brought valuable economic and social benefits to communities across the Highlands and Islands after it was set up in 1943; believes that, without the work of Tom Johnston, first as the wartime Secretary of State for Scotland and then as Chairman of NOSHEB, NOSHEB may well not have been established and almost certainly would not have had the enlightened social and economic outlook that brought so many benefits to the Highlands and Islands, and further believes that Tom Johnston should be commemorated by a statue overlooking one of the great hydro-electric schemes that were his legacy to the people of the Highlands and Islands and to Scotland so that future generations never forget what Scotland owes him.*S3M-5877 Margaret Curran: Glasgow East YouthBank—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow East YouthBank (GEYB) on its five-year anniversary; notes that GEYB, which is run and managed by young people, continues to provide the opportunity for people between the ages of 11 and 25 to benefit their local community by funding projects proposed by the members of GEYB, such as sports activities, community safety, youth development and community relations; further notes that, in the last five years, Glasgow East YouthBank has funded 310 projects that have been proposed by a total of 730 young people throughout the east end of Glasgow, and encourages further support for this organisation and praise for the demonstrated benefits that it has for both the young people involved and the wider community in the east end of Glasgow as a whole.
