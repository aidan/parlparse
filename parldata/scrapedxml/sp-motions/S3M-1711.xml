*S3M-1711 Jamie Hepburn: Emotional Health at Work—That the Parliament congratulates the Samaritans and the STUC on their continuing campaign for a right to enjoy emotional health at work; notes the findings of their survey which showed that over 20% of workers questioned had taken time off work due to stress and that over 50% found their work more stressful than it was five years ago, and believes that employers across Scotland should work with unions and the Samaritans to make sure that their workers have the necessary support to maintain a good level of emotional health and wellbeing.
