*S3M-1902 Nicola Sturgeon: Free Personal Care—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Lord Sutherland’s independent review of free personal and nursing care and the Scottish Government’s acceptance in full of the report’s recommendations, including the commitment to provide £40 million a year in additional funding; notes Lord Sutherland’s clear conclusion that the UK Government should not have withdrawn the attendance allowance funding in respect of self-funding clients in care homes, currently valued at over £30 million a year, and urges the Scottish Government to pursue vigorously with UK Ministers the reinstatement of this funding while longer-term work to re-assess all funding streams relevant to the care of older people in Scotland takes place.
