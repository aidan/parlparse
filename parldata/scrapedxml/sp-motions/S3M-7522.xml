*S3M-7522 Bill Wilson: The UK’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment’s Apparent Support for Corruption—That the Parliament notes Prince Andrew’s reported comments railing at British anti-corruption investigators, who had had, according to the remarks attributed to him, "the idiocy to almost scuttle the al-Yamama deal with Saudi Arabia"; believes that several regimes that it considers to be corrupt and undemocratic have been supported and sustained by the actions of companies based in the United Kingdom and its allies, and that defending corruption for the sake of profit reflects badly on the values of the UK and of the royal family; believes that this is damaging to the interests of UK citizens and those of other countries; considers that this increases political tensions in the latter, impedes their development and is conducive to human rights abuses and terrorism, and calls on the UK Government to investigate these allegations and, if found to be true, to cease to use Prince Andrew as a special representative for trade and investment.
