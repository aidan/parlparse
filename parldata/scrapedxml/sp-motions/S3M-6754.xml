*S3M-6754 Richard Baker: 30th Aberdeen International Football Festival—That the Parliament congratulates the Aberdeen International Football Festival (AIFF) as it celebrates its 30th anniversary this summer, 2010; notes that the festival, which took place between 18 and 25 July, saw some thirty teams from across Scotland and Europe compete at the University of Aberdeen’s Balgownie pitches; recognises the efforts of the AIFF board to make this year’s event such a success; also congratulates Grampian Police on working at the festival to promote campaigns on crime prevention, drugs awareness and, along with Grampian Fire and Rescue Service, the Safe Drive Stay Alive campaign, and recognises that major events like the football festival are an excellent opportunity to raise the profile of these important campaigns with young people.
