 *S3M-7864 Alasdair Allan: A Dream Comes True for the Community of South Uist—That the Parliament congratulates Sustainable Uist, Oxfam Scotland and the Lochboisdale Community Amenity Trust on their joint award of £100,000 from the People’s Postcode Lottery Dream Fund for their Climate Change Adaption and Developing Livelihoods project; considers that the community of South Uist is living at the sharp end of climate change; is of the view that, if nothing is done, there is a real danger that the island could, over time, become uninhabitable; commends the People’s Postcode Lottery for making a dream come true for the community of South Uist by giving them the resources to help themselves and mitigate the effects of climate change on their island; commends the collaborative and diverse range of approaches being taken in this project to meet the local community’s needs, and looks forward to realising the benefits that it is hoped that this project will deliver to the community of South Uist by preserving cultural heritage and promoting sustainable livelihoods.
