*S3M-1125 Jackie Baillie: Keeping Health Services Local—That the Parliament is dismayed at the decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to transfer emergency medical services from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; considers that the board has ignored the views of the local community, local clinicians and the Independent Scrutiny Panel, led by Professor Mackay; further believes that the board’s attempts to usurp the consultation process with the immediate transfer of services ride roughshod over any public engagement; notes that the final decision on service change lies with the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that health services, including the medical assessment unit, are maintained locally.
