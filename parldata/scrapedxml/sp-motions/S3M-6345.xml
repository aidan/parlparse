*S3M-6345 Bill Wilson: Biodiversity Week and Proposed Downsizing of University of Glasgow’s Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences—That the Parliament welcomes Scottish Biodiversity Week, running from 15 to 23 May 2010; recognises the importance of the maintenance of biodiversity to a healthy ecosystem, to the development of new medicines and to sustainable agriculture; finds the timing of the announcement by the University of Glasgow that it is considering downsizing the Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences, with significant job losses, to be surprising, particularly in view of the fact that it appears to be the only faculty so targeted for job cuts, and calls on the university to reconsider its proposals in the interests of not just the individuals directly affected but also in the long-term interests of society as a whole.
