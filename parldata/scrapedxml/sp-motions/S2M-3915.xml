*S2M-3915 Chris Ballance: Newsquest Job Losses—That the Parliament notes the announcement by the Newsquest group of up to 65 planned job cuts at The Herald, Sunday Herald and Evening Times, around a third of which may be journalists; offers sympathies to affected workers and their families; notes that this follows the announcement last year by Trinity Mirror of extensive job cuts in Scotland, despite a 20% rise in operational profits and a 5.8% increase in revenue; expresses concern that newspapers are increasingly under-resourced and under-staffed; believes that a wide range of vibrant newspapers with a plurality of opinion is vital to democracy, and calls on Newsquest to reconsider the proposed cuts. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Donald Gorrie*, Ms Sandra White*, Tommy Sheridan*, Kate Maclean*, Bill Butler*, Rosie Kane*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Eleanor Scott*, Carolyn Leckie*, Mark Ballard*, Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Shiona Baird*, Pauline McNeill*, Fiona Hyslop*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Christine Grahame*, Robin Harper*
