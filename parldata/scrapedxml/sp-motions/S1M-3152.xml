*S1M-3152# Bruce Crawford: Westfield Landfill/Recycling Plant-That the Parliament notes that since 1975 there have been a number of EC Waste Directives demanding action on waste management and that consecutive governments have failed to make significant improvements particularly with regard to recycling; further notes that Scotland currently has the worst recycling record in Europe with only 4.5% of waste recycled compared to other small European countries, like Switzerland, who have reached 50%; recognises that Scotland sends £50 million per annum to Her Majesty's Treasury in landfill tax; believes that revenue raised from landfill tax should go direct to the Scottish Executive budget to support and develop the introduction of separation at source recycling, waste minimisation and packaging reduction: further believes that mandatory targets must be set for local authorities to achieve 30% to 35% recycling rates for domestic waste by 2010; is concerned that large landfill/recycling plants, such as that proposed for Westfield in Fife, which will draw in waste from all over Scotland, fail to meet the test of proximity, where waste should be dealt with as close to its source as can be achieved, and regrets that, if the Westfield proposals are agreed to, then the scale of proposals will have an adverse impact on the quality of life in the local communities that surround the site, on the health of children and adults resident in the area and will put additional and excessive pressure on the already under-funded roads and bridges infrastructure across Fife.
