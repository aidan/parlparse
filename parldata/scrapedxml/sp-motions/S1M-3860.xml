 *S1M-3860# Mr Andrew Welsh: Arbroath CAFE Project-That the Parliament applauds the pioneering work of the Arbroath CAFE Project which provides an invaluable service for young people in the area; notes that a safe, community alcohol-free environment was established where young people could socialise and engage in a wide range of activities, providing a positive alternative to "life on the street"; recognises the success of the project which has received national and international recognition and is being used as a model for projects elsewhere in the country and further afield; congratulates the project on being chosen as the launch pad in Scotland of the British Council's global Dreams and Teams project and on its plans to launch a pilot scheme, "Street Football for All " to take place throughout Angus with a view to becoming a national project, and wishes the CAFE Project every success with both these initiatives and in continuing to provide opportunities for young people and the wider community.
