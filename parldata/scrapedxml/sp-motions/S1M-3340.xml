*S1M-3340# Sarah Boyack: Unauthorised Transfer of Supplier by Energy Companies-That the Parliament notes with concern the number of complaints from energy consumers in Scotland who are erroneously transferred from their chosen energy supplier without their consent; recognises the distress and financial detriment this can cause; welcomes energywatch's Stop Now campaign, aimed at introducing solutions to this problem; further welcomes the action already taken by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government on this matter, and believes that it would be beneficial to consumers if a system is introduced which protects consumers from being transferred without their prior knowledge and explicit consent and that individuals affected by erroneous transfers should receive compensation from the energy supplier. Supported by: Brian Fitzpatrick*, Rhoda Grant*, Mr John McAllion*, Dr Sylvia Jackson*, Bristow Muldoon*, Cathie Craigie*, Kate Maclean*, Karen Gillon*, Jackie Baillie*, Bill Butler*, Margaret Jamieson*, Des McNulty*
