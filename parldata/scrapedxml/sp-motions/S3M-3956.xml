 *S3M-3956♦ Aileen Campbell: Scotland’s Road Haulage Industry—That the Parliament notes the announcement in the UK Budget of a planned fuel duty increase of 2p per litre from September 2009, which comes on top of the 2p per litre increase effective from the start of April 2009; believes that these rises will massively increase costs for road haulage companies in the South of Scotland region and across the country, putting them under extra pressure as the economic recession takes hold; recognises the important role played by the road haulage industry in providing support to other industries as well as direct employment, and further believes that the industry will need support during the economic downturn. Supported by: Anne McLaughlin*, Brian Adam*, Kenneth Gibson*
