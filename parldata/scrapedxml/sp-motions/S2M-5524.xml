*S2M-5524 Dr Jean Turner: RNIB Scotland: Visual Impairment and Learning Disabilities—That the Parliament recognises the work done by RNIB Scotland whose research suggests that one in three people with a learning disability will also have a visual impairment; notes that this often goes unrecognised because of individuals’ inability to communicate their vision deficit, thereby meaning that such individuals are at risk of not being diagnosed and treated; congratulates NHS Ayrshire and Arran on its pilot project which trains and works with 23 optometry practices with support from an RNIB Scotland development worker using RNIB Scotland’s vision assessment tool to identify, diagnose and treat such individuals and therefore enhance their quality of life, and believes that similar models should be promoted throughout Scotland to diagnose and treat this vulnerable section of society. Supported by: Mr Andrew Welsh*, Phil Gallie*, Frances Curran*, Mark Ballard*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Eleanor Scott*, Shona Robison*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Carolyn Leckie*, Mr Jim Wallace*, Rosie Kane*, John Swinburne*, Euan Robson*, Murray Tosh*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Ms Sandra White*, Christine May*, Donald Gorrie*, Ms Maureen Watt*, Karen Gillon*, Jackie Baillie*, Tricia Marwick*, Bruce Crawford*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Robin Harper*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*
