 *S3M-5557 Tom McCabe: University of Glasgow Beatson Pebble Appeal—That the Parliament congratulates the University of Glasgow’s Beatson Pebble Appeal on reaching the half-way stage in its fundraising, with £5 million of the £10 million raised; notes that the Beatson Pebble Appeal aims to build the Beatson Translational Research Centre (TRC) to help speed up the process of turning scientific discoveries into treatments for patients with cancer; applauds the appeal’s announcement that it will be the first cancer research facility in Scotland dedicated to translational research and welcomes the fact that the Beatson TRC will be part of the West of Scotland Comprehensive Cancer Centre in partnership with the NHS, Cancer Research UK and Leukaemia Research and will therefore directly serve over 60% of the Scottish population; recognises that scientific discoveries have the potential to be of benefit to patients worldwide, and wishes the Beatson Pebble Appeal, its fundraisers and supporters every continuing success in their important work.
