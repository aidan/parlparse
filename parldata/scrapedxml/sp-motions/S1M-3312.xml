*S1M-3312 Tommy Sheridan: Ancillary Staff in the NHS-That the Parliament congratulates the victorious ancillary workers of Glasgow Royal Infirmary who were forced to take strike action in pursuit of improved wages and employment conditions against the giant French multi-national Sodexho; condemns private contractors that continue to pay poverty wages and refuse proper employment conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to re-nationalise the National Health Service by removing all private contractors and improving the wages and conditions of all ancillary staff, who are essential to ensuring a first-class health service in the 21st century.
