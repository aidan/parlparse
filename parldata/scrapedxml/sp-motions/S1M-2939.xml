 *S1M-2939 John Farquhar Munro: Inverness and the Highlands’ Bid to be the European Capital of Culture 2008—That the Parliament wholeheartedly endorses Inverness and the Highlands’ bid to become the European Capital of Culture 2008 as Scotland’s only contender for the event; recognises the significant economic benefits that a successful bid could bring to the city, the rest of the Highlands and Scotland as a whole, including its potential to create a major increase in tourist spending and new temporary and permanent jobs; notes Inverness’s recently awarded city status; urges organisations and individuals throughout the Highlands to submit ideas and suggestions to Invernesshighland2008 to support and strengthen the bid; welcomes the £100,000 contributions each from the Scottish Executive, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Highland Council to the campaign, and urges the Scottish Executive to continue its active support for the bid.
