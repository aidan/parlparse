*S3M-7433 Robert Brown: Fighting Visual Impairment and Age-related Macular Degeneration—That the Parliament recognises the importance of eyesight to a full life; understands that age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for over half of registered blindness; is concerned that the prevalence of AMD is set to grow markedly with the increasing age profile of the population; notes that treatment for AMD requires repeat application of appropriate treatments, commonly a regime of eye injections, but that outcomes are good if diagnosed early and believes that it is vital that NHS boards are able to meet demand for treatment effectively now and in the future.
