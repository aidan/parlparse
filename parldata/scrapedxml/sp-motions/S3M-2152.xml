 *S3M-2152 Aileen Campbell: HMRC Office Restructuring Proposals—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs that it will review its operations, with proposals to withdraw from 19 local offices that it currently operates across Scotland, threatening 700 jobs as a result; believes that this is another example of the centralising tendencies of the UK Government, and further believes that any loss of jobs from the UK Civil Service gives the lie to the notion that Scotland somehow benefits from a Union "dividend" as part of the United Kingdom. Supported by: Jamie Hepburn*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Alasdair Allan*, Alex Neil*, Bill Wilson*, Stuart McMillan*, Brian Adam*, Christina McKelvie*, Sandra White*
