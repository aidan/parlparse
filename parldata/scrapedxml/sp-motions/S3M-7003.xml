 *S3M-7003 Kenneth Gibson: NHS Ayrshire and Arran Street Nurse Initiative—That the Parliament congratulates NHS Ayrshire and Arran on its Street Nurse initiative, developed as part of the Healthy North Ayrshire programme; applauds this initiative for its work on improving health awareness by allowing the people of North Ayrshire to share their concerns with a Street Nurse who is able to give health information and advice on the spot and can also provide onward referral to community services if appropriate; recognises the value of what it considers this innovative approach to community engagement and health improvement, which deploys the Healthy North Ayrshire nursing team to work in local regeneration communities and directly with groups that are known to experience poorer health and wellbeing to carry out rapid lifestyle assessments, and is supportive of this scheme and its delivery of key health information to those who may be at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.
