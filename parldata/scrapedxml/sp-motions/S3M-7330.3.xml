*S3M-7330.3 John Swinney: Managing Scotland’s Finances—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7330) in the name of Andy Kerr, leave out from second "that" to end and insert " the dire condition of the United Kingdom’s finances due to years of Labour economic mismanagement; regrets the impact of the UK Comprehensive Spending Review that takes £1.3 billion out of the Scottish budget, including £800 million from the capital budget; regrets that UK Government cuts go too far and too fast, jeopardising the Scottish economy and putting jobs at risk, and calls for the Scottish Parliament to be given full financial responsibility as the best means of ensuring that Scotland can build sustainable economic recovery."
