*S2M-2279 John Swinburne: Commission on Boundary Differences and Voting Systemsâ€”That the Parliament objects to the intrusion by an unelected, undemocratic commission on boundary differences and voting systems under the chairmanship of Sir John Arbuthnott which lacks a true gender balance or any representation of senior citizens, greens, socialists, independents or ethnic minorities and which will sit in judgement of our democratically-elected Scottish Parliament and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland to bring an end to this undemocratic exercise.
