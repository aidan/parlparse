*S2M-1784 Mr David Davidson: Centralisation of Health Services—That the Parliament is opposed to the centralisation of health services across Scotland; notes the threat facing many local hospital services including those at Caithness General Hospital, Western Isles Hospital, Lorne and Islands District General Hospital, Belford Hospital, Inverclyde Royal Hospital, the Vale of Leven Hospital, St John’s Hospital, Stobhill Hospital, the Victoria Infirmary, the Western Infirmary, Wishaw General Hospital, Hairmyres Hospital, Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, Queen Mother’s Hospital, Ayr Hospital, Perth Royal Infirmary, Forth Park Hospital, Queen Margaret Hospital, Stirling Royal Infirmary, Falkirk Royal Infirmary, Monklands Hospital and Balfour Hospital and the additional threat to many community and long-term care hospitals right across Scotland; believes that this is part of a strategy of centralising services at a handful of elite hospitals which has led to uproar from coast to coast over hospital reorganisation plans, and therefore has no confidence in the ability of the Minister for Health and Community Care to devise and implement a strategy for the NHS which serves the needs of local communities throughout Scotland.
