*S2M-3461# Patrick Harvie: Air Pollution in Glasgow—That the Parliament recognises that Glasgow city centre, now designated as an Air Quality Management Area, has the most serious air pollution problems in Scotland, with a 70% reduction of nitrogen dioxide levels required in some areas if the objectives set by the Scottish Executive are to be met; is concerned at the health implications for those who live and work in the city, such as breathing problems, chronic bronchitis and many premature deaths; accepts that this problem is overwhelmingly caused by increasing road traffic levels; is further concerned that Glasgow City Council’s Air Quality Action Plan does not propose measures which will reverse increases in road traffic levels or prevent further increases, and believes that the Executive should work with Glasgow City Council to ensure that Glasgow’s citizens and workers can breath air which meets the minimum standards which are the norm in other European cities.
