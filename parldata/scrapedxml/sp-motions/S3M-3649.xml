*S3M-3649 Robert Brown: Scrutiny of the Scottish Government’s Alcohol Reforms—That the Parliament expresses its serious concern over the Scottish Government’s intention to introduce its alcohol framework without comprehensive scrutiny by the Parliament; recognises that elements of the proposals, for example the introduction of minimum retail pricing for alcohol, are deeply controversial and could potentially have a substantial impact on Scottish industry, the retail trade and consumer choice; considers that it is unacceptable for major reforms of this nature to bypass full public and parliamentary scrutiny; believes that measures to tackle Scotland’s complex alcohol problems require a considered approach and should not be brought forward without due and democratic consideration, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward all of its key alcohol proposals in a parliamentary Bill so that they can be subjected to full and detailed public consultation, parliamentary scrutiny and debate and to detailed votes by a parliamentary committee and by MSPs in the Chamber. Supported by: Ross Finnie*, Liam McArthur*
