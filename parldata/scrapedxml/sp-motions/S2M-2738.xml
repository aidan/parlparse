*S2M-2738# Cathy Peattie: International Workers’ Memorial Day—That the Parliament supports International Workers’ Memorial Day on 28 April 2005 which commemorates those who have died or suffered accidents or ill-health as a result of work; welcomes West Lothian Council’s commitment to lower flags on council buildings on 28 April every year; notes that every year over 1.3 million workers across the world die from accidents and diseases at work, nearly twice the number of deaths caused by war, and that many such deaths are preventable by improved health and safety; calls for this day to be widely observed in Scotland through action to improve safety and provide a healthier working environment, and believes that the Scottish Executive and others should formally recognise International Workers’ Memorial Day as an annual event, when they take stock and advance plans for health and safety improvements in the year to come.
