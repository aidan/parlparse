*S2M-3406 Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Life Expectancy—That the Parliament welcomes the recently disclosed findings from the General Registrar Office for Scotland showing that people in Scotland are living longer, with the gap between the sexes closing, but is concerned that, yet again, the people with the shortest life expectancies live in Glasgow; is alarmed that a male child born in Glasgow has a life expectancy of only 69 years and four months, whereas a male child born in neighbouring East Dunbartonshire will, on average, live until he is 77; notes that Scotland, with its vast amount of natural resources and economic potential, should not exhibit this alarming regional variation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to act quickly to ensure that those living in Scotland’s largest city do not continue to suffer simply because of where they live, to improve this abhorrent inequality and to be proactive about eliminating the poverty being experienced by Glaswegians which is, arguably, the root cause of these statistics.
