*S3M-2530 Sarah Boyack: The Economic Impact of Rugby Matches at Murrayfield—That the Parliament welcomes the report into the economic impact of matches at Murrayfield for the 2008-09 season, prepared for Scottish Rugby by Napier University; notes with interest the findings, which see a contribution of £50 million net spending to the local Edinburgh economy and  £104 million to the national economy of Scotland; recognises that through hosting both rugby and non-rugby events there are clear and tangible benefits for tourism, enhanced business opportunities and increased revenue for local and national economies; believes that Murrayfield Stadium is an invaluable resource for Edinburgh and the nation, and, as such, welcomes recent moves by Scottish Rugby to ensure that these matches are coordinated and delivered with the full involvement of all local, regional and national authorities and agencies and in consultation with local communities so that the economic benefits can be felt by everyone involved.
