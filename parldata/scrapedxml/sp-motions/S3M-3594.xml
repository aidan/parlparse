*S3M-3594 Gil Paterson: Thanks to Scottish Gymnastics—That the Parliament congratulates all the coaches, volunteers and others from the world of Scottish gymnastics who participated in the Beginner and Intermediate Floor and Vault Competition for girls aged from eight to 16, held at the Bell’s Sports Centre in Perth, which attracted individuals and teams from Shetland to Dumfries and all points in between and thanks all those who give up their time to ensure that events such as this are a success but, more importantly, to provide the expertise and advice on a long-term basis to encourage our young sports enthusiasts, which assists in keeping Scotland’s young people fit in body and mind.
