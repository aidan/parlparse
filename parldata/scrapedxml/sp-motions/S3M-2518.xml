*S3M-2518 Elizabeth Smith: Mountain Rescue Service - Happy Anniversary—That the Parliament congratulates members of the UK Mountain Rescue team who celebrate their 75th anniversary; notes that since 1933 UK mountain rescue teams have provided outstanding service to the outdoor community, ensuring safety and speedy recovery in times of difficulty; further notes that the teams are made up of volunteers who provide first class professional support when it comes to saving lives, often in circumstances where they encounter danger themselves; notes that perhaps the best birthday present they could wish for is a recognition from the public of just how important this service is and an understanding of the need for much greater responsibility when individuals take to the hills and mountains, and wishes UK Mountain Rescue teams well in the years ahead and thanks them for their life-saving support. Supported by: Nanette Milne*, Bill Aitken*, Bill Kidd*, Sandra White*, Jamie McGrigor*, John Lamont*, Ted Brocklebank*, Ken Macintosh*, Stuart McMillan*, Mike Pringle*, Murdo Fraser*, Mary Scanlon*, Jamie Stone*, Alex Johnstone*, Patrick Harvie*, Ms Wendy Alexander*
