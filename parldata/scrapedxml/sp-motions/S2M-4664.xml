*S2M-4664 Shona Robison: Samaritans’ 24:7 Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes the 24:7 campaign being held by the Samaritans on 24 July 2006 to raise money for, and awareness of, the life-saving work carried out by the Samaritans; notes that the money raised will help to pay for volunteers to answer calls, training of staff and recruitment of new volunteers; recognises the excellent service that the 951 active volunteers provide in the 20 branches of the Samaritans throughout Scotland; further notes that a series of events will be held throughout the United Kingdom in a bid to link up all Samaritan branches which includes sponsored walks and runs and five-a-side football tournaments; congratulates the Dundee branch for its innovative method of linking up with other Scottish branches as they travel to Perth via an aeroplane, and urges MSPs to publicise this campaign in their constituencies.
