*S3M-4367 Jackson Carlaw: Hampered by Hormones? Addressing the Needs of Men with Prostate Cancer—That the Parliament supports the Prostate Cancer Charity in launching the Hampered by Hormones? campaign, which aims to address the needs of men with prostate cancer who are receiving hormone therapy treatment; notes that the side effects of hormone therapy can have a significant impact on men’s lives; expresses concern that research undertaken by the charity shows that over half of these men are receiving too little information and support to help them manage the side effects of hormone therapy and are not receiving the standard of care and support that they are entitled to; calls on the Scottish Government and the Scottish Cancer Taskforce to review the charity’s research findings and campaign recommendations and take action to improve the care of men living on hormone therapy, and further calls on the Scottish Cancer Taskforce to ensure that, through the National Cancer Quality Steering Group, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland takes into consideration the findings of the campaign report during the development of the planned standard for the management of urological cancer services.
