 *S2M-486 Patrick Harvie: Sexual Health Misinformation-That the Parliament notes the publication of pamphlets stating that condoms are not reliable in preventing the spread of HIV, as discovered by BBC Panorama researchers working in Kenya and other areas of high HIV prevalence; opposes the spread of such misinformation in Scotland; condemns those who publish, promote or endorse such life-threatening propaganda, whether abroad or in Scotland; notes the opinion of the US National Institutes of Health and other expert opinion worldwide that intact latex condoms are essentially impermeable to even the smallest sexually transmitted virus, hepatitis B; notes the intention of the Scottish Executive to publish the report of the Sexual Health Strategy expert group in the near future, and believes that any effective sexual health strategy for Scotland will include the promotion of condom use and safer sex practices among other approaches.
