 *S2M-279 Colin Fox: Voting Reformâ€”That the Parliament recalls that the voting system for elections to the Parliament was settled upon after extensive discussions with Scottish society through the Scottish Constitutional Convention and was endorsed by the Scottish people in the 1997 referendum on the establishment of a Parliament; notes that the composition of the Parliament is vastly more representative of the people of Scotland than either the Westminster Parliament or local authorities throughout Scotland; considers that before there is a change in the voting system for the Parliament there should be a reconvening of the convention and full consultation of the Scottish people at which not only the voting system, but the powers of the Parliament, are considered, and believes that the most urgent matter regarding voting systems is the requirement for reform of the systems for Westminster and local government elections.
