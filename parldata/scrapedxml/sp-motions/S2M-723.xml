*S2M-723 Trish Godman: Banks, Credit Companies and Loan Sharks-That the Parliament welcomes the recently announced measures designed to (a) control the unseemly practices of banks and other agencies that encourage people to take on financial burdens that they can ill afford and (b) pursue the loan sharks, who batten upon poor people, whom the banks ignore, and inflict upon them scandalously high levels of interest; believes that there is no place for such activities in Scotland in the 21st century, and supports the Scottish Executive, Her Majesty's Government and local authorities who are introducing measures that will drive these loan sharks from the streets whilst at the same time encouraging those in debt to approach the appropriate agencies for help in dealing with this serious problem.
