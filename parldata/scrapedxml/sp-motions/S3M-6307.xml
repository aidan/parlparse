*S3M-6307 Pauline McNeill: A Year until Riverside—That the Parliament welcomes the near completion of the Riverside Museum in Glasgow; notes that the Riverside Museum Appeal must raise an additional £1.7 million toward its contribution to the work; hopes that the appeal reaches its goal, and looks forward to the opening of the new museum in 2011, which will celebrate Glasgow and Scotland’s impact on the transport and technology industries on the banks of the River Clyde, famed for its shipbuilding heritage.
