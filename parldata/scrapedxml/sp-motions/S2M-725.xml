*S2M-725# Carolyn Leckie: Danger Faced By Iraqi Trade Unionists-That the Parliament is concerned to hear of the appeal by the Iraqi Federation of Workers Trade Unions (IFTU), which tells of a raid by dozens of US troops in 10 armoured cars on the IFTU temporary headquarters in Baghdad on Saturday 6 December 2003, where windows were smashed, documents seized, posters and banners condemning terrorism torn down, eight IFTU leaders arrested but subsequently released and no reason or explanation given for the raid, and supports the call of the IFTU for President Bush to conduct a full investigation into the raid and to ensure that it will not be repeated and for the United States of America to respect the right of workers under international law to form free and independent trade unions.
