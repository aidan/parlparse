*S3M-284 Christine Grahame: The Wilson Doctrine—That the Parliament notes that the Wilson Doctrine, developed in the late 1960s, banned the tapping of MPs’ and peers’ telephones; further notes that in 2006, following representations to have the doctrine revoked, the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, rejected revocation after a backbench rebellion and that this remains the position to this day; notes with concern that the Wilson Doctrine does not apply to MSPs, and considers that duly elected members of the Scottish Parliament should be offered the same protection from intrusion as applies to duly elected members of the Westminster government in the interests of performing their public duty free from covert surveillance and in the interests of democracy.
