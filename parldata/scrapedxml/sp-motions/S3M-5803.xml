*S3M-5803 Brian Adam: Future of Core Store at Gilmertonâ€”That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by the British Geological Survey (BGS) to move the UK continental shelf core and records collections from Gilmerton, Edinburgh, to Keyworth in Nottingham; believes that this move will disadvantage the oil and gas industry, Scottish businesses, academics and students who regularly use the store for study and research; expresses concern at the costs and potential damage of moving the core store; welcomes the recent survey undertaken by the Petroleum Exploration Society of Great Britain (PESGB) into the move, which showed that 77% of members who responded believe that the core store should remain in Edinburgh, with 89% of active users agreeing; understands that only three active users were aware of the consultation exercise undertaken by the Tribal Group on behalf of the BGS; further welcomes the view of PESGB President Henry Allen that a steering group should be formed of all stakeholders to discuss an appropriate way forward, and calls on the BGS or Minister of State for Higher Education and Intellectual Property to stop the move of the core store and address the concerns raised by its users.
