 * S2M-2952 Frances Curran: Don’t Let G8 Turn Scotland into a Dictatorship—That the Parliament believes that, when the powerful and wealthy prevent those without power from protesting, we have a dictatorship; notes that the G8 is made up of the most powerful countries in the world and that their leaders, who will be meeting at Gleneagles, are the same people who enforce economic policies which result in mass poverty in developing countries and that the group includes countries which have bombed two countries, killing 100,000 people; believes that it is “make your mind up time” for MSPs and the First Minister about who is in charge of our streets, whether it is Scotland’s democratically elected Parliament or the powerful men of the G8, and reiterates its support for the right to protest at Gleneagles.
