*S3M-5057 Michael Matheson: Halifax Bank of Scotland Charges—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by Halifax Bank of Scotland to change its charges for overdrafts, whereby customers will pay £1 per day for an authorised overdraft while those with an unauthorised overdraft will pay £5 per day; considers that anyone with an overdraft below £1,872 is likely to be worse off as a result of these charges; believes that these charges will impact on many customers, particularly those on lower incomes, and calls on Halifax Bank of Scotland to reconsider these charges.
