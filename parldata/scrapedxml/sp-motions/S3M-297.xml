*S3M-297 Bill Wilson: Children of Asylum Seekers - Access to Tertiary Education—That the Parliament notes the recent report by HM Inspectorate of Education which highlighted the frustrating situation in which many children of asylum seekers find themselves that, having successfully completed their school education in the Scottish system, they are effectively disbarred from entering tertiary education due to being categorised as overseas students for the purpose of tuition fees and accordingly calls on the Scottish Executive to examine the practicalities of treating the children of asylum seekers as Scottish students for the purpose of these fees.
