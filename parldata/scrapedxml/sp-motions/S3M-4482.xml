*S3M-4482 Brian Adam: A New View for the Scottish Premier League—That the Parliament notes with regret the difficulties that the broadcaster, Setanta, has suffered; notes the decision of the Scottish Premier League (SPL) to take back from Setanta the rights to broadcast SPL games in the United Kingdom from the 2009-10 season onwards; further notes the decision of the SPL to seek a new television contract; believes that Scottish football fans and clubs would be best served by a free-to-air broadcaster winning the rights to these matches and urges free-to-air networks to make realistic attempts to secure the rights to more Scottish football television; further notes that the BBC has a firm form of funding through the licence payers’ money and a duty to the public in what it broadcasts; urges the BBC to recognise the cultural importance of such an opportunity to the Scottish viewing public, and asks it to make a competitive bid for the rights.
