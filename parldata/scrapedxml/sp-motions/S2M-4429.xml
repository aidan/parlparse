 *S2M-4429 Pauline McNeill: Action on Ticket Touting—That the Parliament supports the campaign initiated by DF Concerts to prohibit the unauthorised resale of tickets for concerts and events; notes that ticket touting is extremely prevalent and that many unofficial outlets are guilty of huge mark-ups on a ticket’s face value, for example at events like T in the Park or major UK tours; condemns the exploitation of concert goers and music fans; notes that there is a particular effect upon young people who are often more likely to be persuaded into paying prices which they may not be able to afford; further notes the disgraceful actions of Get Me Tickets Ltd whose recent sale of non-existent tickets resulted in 200 young people being stranded outside a venue; supports the work of the Secretaries of State for Culture, Media and Sport and for Trade and Industry who aim to protect the public from this exploitation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to investigate how it can better support legitimate events promoters and work with the UK Government to protect Scotland’s events and concert goers.
