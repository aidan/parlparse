 *S2M-2271 Carolyn Leckie: A Right to Sexual Health and Equality of Access to Sexual Health Services—That the Parliament is concerned at reports of amendments being made to the Scottish Executive’s sexual health strategy that, if implemented, will restrict the right of all people to optimum sexual health and will create and perpetuate inequalities in access to sexual health services; believes that the sexual health needs of the population, including young people, should be the focus of the strategy and that those needs should be met equally; further believes that the meeting of those needs is of paramount importance and should take precedence in the formation, finalisation and delivery of the sexual health strategy; recognises the rights of all sections of the population to express their views, but believes that a majority of Scottish people perceive sexual health and access to sexual health services as a universal right and that it is this will that should be heeded when the full content of the strategy is published, and believes that compromises that create inequalities should be resisted.
