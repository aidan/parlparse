*S3M-121 Liam McArthur: Underfunding of Orkney Islands Council—That the Parliament notes the disparity of funding provided by the Scottish Executive to the three island councils, with Orkney Islands Council receiving significantly less funding per head of population than that received by the councils in Shetland and the Western Isles; further notes that the challenge Orkney Islands Council faces providing services across their 18 inhabited islands is no less a challenge than that faced in the other two island council areas so that the shortfall in funding is causing severe problems in Orkney; believes that the shared challenges faced by island councils justify all three island councils receiving the levels of funding currently provided to Shetland and the Western Isles, and calls on the Executive to reach agreement with COSLA at the earliest opportunity on a means of bringing Orkney’s funding levels into line with the other two island councils.
