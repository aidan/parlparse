 *S2M-4432 Ms Maureen Watt: Local Food is Miles Better—That the Parliament notes that the tonnage of food air freighted around the world has risen by 140% since 1992 and that, although air transport only accounts for 1% of food miles, 11% of food miles’ carbon dioxide emissions are down to air transport; further notes that there has been a 23% rise in food transported by HGV since 1978 and that the average distance travelled has increased by 50%, and supports Farmers Weekly’s Local Food Is Miles Better campaign, which aims to cut food miles and pollution and to support local food producers.
