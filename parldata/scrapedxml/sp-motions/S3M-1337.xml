*S3M-1337 Christine Grahame: There is No Such Creature as British Lawâ€”That the Parliament expresses its concern that, in the context of comments made by the Archbishop of Canterbury anent adopting some aspects of Sharia law into English law, the media, both UK and Scottish, the Prime Minister and other London political figures have referred to "British" law, reflecting an appalling ignorance of the distinctiveness of Scots law both substantively and in its procedures; further notes that there is no such legal creature as British law as opposed to UK legislation and legal processes; affirms again the proud tradition of the independence of Scots Law, both civil and criminal, and considers that all parties concerned should apologise to the Scottish people for once again equating "English" with "British".
