 *S3M-2383 Nigel Don: Aberdeen Post Offices—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision to close three post offices in Aberdeen, at Mount Street, Mannofield and Nigg, and to consult on a further replacement closure at Bieldside by way of replacing the saved Middlefield post office; congratulates the campaigners who helped to save Middlefield; considers that the inclusion of Bieldside as an additional closure proposal demonstrates that the closure campaign is driven by an artificial quota rather than a robust business case; regrets that Aberdeen’s Labour MPs did not vote to halt the closure campaign when given the opportunity in March 2008; hopes that the community of Bieldside will rally to save their post office, and calls on the UK Government to take urgent action to prevent any further culling of post offices by securing the long-term future of the Post Office card account.
