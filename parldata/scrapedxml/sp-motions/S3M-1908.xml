*S3M-1908 Keith Brown: Stirling - Scotland’s Sporting Flagship—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the First Minister that the University of Stirling is to be recognised as Scotland’s flagship institution for the practice, study, and research of sport; believes that the symbolic recognition of this status is as important as the award of £600,000 through the Scottish Funding Council; recognises the excellent achievements already by the University of Stirling in developing world-class facilities for sports such as golf, tennis, swimming and football, as well as Scotland’s first professorial Chair of Sports Policy; notes that the campus already hosts bases of the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland, the Scottish Institute of Sport, Scottish Swimming, Scottish Gymnastics, Tennis Scotland, Fitness Scotland, Triathlon Scotland and the Scottish Football Association; believes that developing a recognised specialism in this field to an elite level has the potential to propel the university and the city onto a world stage and further boost Scotland’s national reputation globally, and in particular looks forward to the University of Stirling making an extensive and praiseworthy contribution to Scottish success at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
