*S2M-3780 Pauline McNeill: Christmas Card Recycling Schemeâ€”That the Parliament notes that 100 million Christmas and New Year greetings cards are thrown away by Scottish households in the days following New Year; welcomes the Christmas Card Recycling Scheme promoted by the Woodland Trust Scotland and supported by the Scottish Waste Awareness Group (SWAG); urges people to help achieve a target of 6 million cards recycled by taking their cards to special recycling bins placed in WH Smith and Tesco stores from 2 to 31 January 2006; encourages people who do not traditionally recycle their waste to participate in the scheme and make recycling part of their daily lives all year round, and notes that the funds raised from the scheme will help to save woods and trees.
