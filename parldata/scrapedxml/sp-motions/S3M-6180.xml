 *S3M-6180♦ Malcolm Chisholm: Lymphoedema Services in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the increased numbers of women surviving breast cancer in NHS Lothian but is concerned that many survivors are still at risk of developing lymphoedema; recognises the impact that lymphoedema has on quality of life in terms of movement, discomfort and appearance of the arm and other parts of the upper body; is further concerned that access to and provision of high-quality lymphoedema services varies across the country, and believes that a high quality and equitable service that meets the needs of people in Scotland with or at risk of lymphoedema is needed.
