*S3M-326 Jackie Baillie: Scottish Manufacturingâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern over the steady decline of the Scottish manufacturing sector in that employment levels have now fallen to 235,000 in Scotland and three million across the United Kingdom; recognises the crucial importance that such secondary industry plays in our economy and our heritage, and calls on the Scottish Executive to develop a more effective manufacturing and public procurement policy that will underpin Scottish manufacturers and to encourage companies to have improved and more meaningful dialogue with workers before making employment decisions.
