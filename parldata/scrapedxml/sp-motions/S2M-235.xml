*S2M-235 Frances Curran: Johnstone Hospital-That the Parliament notes that the demographic changes taking place within Scotland mean both an increase in the elderly population and an increase in demand for elderly services, especially within the NHS; notes that, as a result, there will be an increase in demand for elderly care beds within the NHS, but that Argyll and Clyde NHS Board is proposing to close Johnstone Hospital and cut beds for elderly people; recognises that this proposal is despite massive opposition in the local community; demands that the board listens to local people and reverses the decision to cut 163 elderly care beds in the board's area; considers that the real reason for these cuts is the need to pay back Â£30 million of debt which the board has accumulated; affirms that, after working all their lives and paying for the NHS, elderly people deserve better from both the board and the Scottish Parliament, and therefore calls on the Minister for Health and Community Care to guarantee the future of Johnstone Hospital.
