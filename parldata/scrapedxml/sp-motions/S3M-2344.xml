 *S3M-2344 Christine Grahame: Extending the Winter Fuel Payment—That the Parliament is concerned that, with the increasing cost of fuel, more and more elderly, disabled and low income families will be unable to heat their homes this winter and, therefore, calls on the UK Government to extend the Winter Fuel Payment to those on high-level disability benefits and those receiving Child Benefit while at the same time increasing the amount payable to reflect increased heating costs by using the additional revenues of £6 billion from fuel duty to fund the programme.
