 *S2M-4132 Stewart Stevenson: E85 Biofuel—That the Parliament notes the pilot introduction in Somerset, England, of E85 fuel, which is largely ethyl alcohol distilled from renewable resources and hence is nearly carbon neutral, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote a pilot in Scotland which will have the benefits of raising awareness, moving local production of ethyl alcohol for fuel closer to being commercially attractive and giving Scottish farmers a new cash crop by growing a range of raw materials which may feed the distillation process. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Mr Andrew Welsh*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Mike Pringle*, Fergus Ewing*, Jim Mather*, Ms Sandra White*, Brian Adam*, Christine Grahame*
