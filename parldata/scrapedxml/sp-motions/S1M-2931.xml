 *S1M-2931# Mary Scanlon: Parkinson's Awareness Week—That the Parliament acknowledges Parkinson’s Awareness Week, 8-14 April 2002; recognises the impact Parkinson’s Disease has on 12,000 people in Scotland as well as their families, friends and carers; congratulates the Parkinson’s Disease Society on raising awareness of this degenerative and debilitating condition; notes the serious difficulties often caused by the lack of awareness of the impact of Parkinson’s Disease, particularly with regard to its prevalence in younger people, the fluctuations in symptoms and also the importance of the timing of medication; applauds the Society’s education programme to deliver essential information and advice to a wide range of professionals, organisations and individuals, and considers that the Scottish Executive should give priority status to neurological and other long term conditions, promote better understanding throughout the healthcare professions and continue to address the variation in standards and access to services across the country through a National Service Framework for Neurological Conditions in close consultation with people with Parkinson’s Disease and other specialists in the field.
