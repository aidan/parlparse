*S2M-5301 Elaine Smith: Solidarity with the Victims of the Pinochet Dictatorship—That the Parliament recalls with pride the warm welcome and secure refuge that Scotland provided to the many Chilean families who fled persecution in the 1970s; supports the efforts of all those, in Chile and internationally, who continue to seek justice for the many victims of the Pinochet dictatorship; notes that during General Pinochet’s 17-year rule over 2,000 people were murdered, in excess of 1,000 "disappeared" and many thousands more were tortured and forced into exile; observes that, before he died, Pinochet had been indicted both on human rights and fraud charges; applauds the efforts of the victims’ relatives and of advocates and judges in the Chilean justice system to bring to account before the courts not only Pinochet but also his collaborators; believes that efforts to secure truth and justice should continue irrespective of General Pinochet’s death; congratulates President Michelle Bachelet, herself a victim of the regime, on the progress of Chilean democracy, and renews Scotland’s commitment to upholding the cause of human rights both at home and throughout the world. Supported by: Bill Butler*, Tommy Sheridan*, Campbell Martin*, Fiona Hyslop*
