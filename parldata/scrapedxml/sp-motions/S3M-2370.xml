 *S3M-2370 Liam McArthur: Rev Dr Andrew Ross—That the Parliament notes with great sadness the death of Rev Dr Andrew Ross; applauds Dr Ross’ efforts to forge closer ties between his native Scotland and adopted Malawi; acknowledges his long-standing commitment to Malawi, where he did so much invaluable work as a minister in the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian and from where he was forced to flee by its first president, Hastings Banda; also recognises Dr Ross’ enormous contribution to the Church of Scotland and the University of Edinburgh, notably the Faculty of Divinity; believes that his popularity with colleagues and students stemmed from his genuinely global perspective on religion, history and politics combined with his patient, good-humoured and utterly compassionate treatment of all those with whom he came into contact; celebrates the doc’s other great passion, Edinburgh University Association Football Club, of which he was Honorary President and the most ardent, faithful and exasperated supporter; sends its condolences to Joyce and the rest of his family, and gives thanks for a life well lived and with absolutely no "gesture tackles".
