*S3M-244 Bill Wilson: Afghanistan and Scotland, Opium and Heroin—That the Parliament considers that US and UK policy in bringing peace, stability and the rule of law to Afghanistan has been ineffective; notes the recent UN World Drug Report’s finding that more than 90% of the world’s illegal heroin comes from that country and that opium production has increased dramatically there despite the presence of more than 30,000 international troops; notes that Helmand province alone, where UK troops are stationed, produces half of the world’s opium; notes the related availability of heroin in Scotland and its devastating effect on individuals and communities; considers that drugs policies here have been ineffective in tackling this scourge; further notes the repeated calls by senior police officers, such as John Vine, the Chief Constable of Tayside Police, for heroin to be prescribed to addicts, and accordingly calls for the Scottish Government to investigate the costs and benefits of an integrated and rational national and international drugs and crime policy including such measures as the purchase of Afghanistan’s opium crop and the prescription of heroin to addicts.
