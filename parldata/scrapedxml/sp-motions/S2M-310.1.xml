 *S2M-310.1 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Strategic Framework for Aquaculture-As an amendment to motion (S2M-310) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "but regrets that the strategic framework for Scottish aquaculture increasingly looks more like a straightjacket, with no fewer than eight bodies currently overseeing it, and further regrets that the Executive has failed to make meaningful financial provision to the industry in terms of research and development, especially of new species, failed to protect the quality "Scottish" brand for farmed salmon and failed to safeguard the 6,500 Scottish jobs in salmon farming by its inadequate approach to dumping of inferior foreign product on the European market with the subsequent collapse in Scottish prices."
