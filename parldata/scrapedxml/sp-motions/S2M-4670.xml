*S2M-4670 Mr Brian Monteith: Scottish Women’s Hospital for Foreign Service—That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the recent Edinburgh commemoration service for the Battle of the Somme, remembering those who sacrificed life and limb, failed to recognise the vital role carried out by the heroic volunteers of Edinburgh’s Scottish Women’s Hospital for Foreign Service and considers that Scottish parliamentarians and members of the Edinburgh City Council should redouble their efforts to support and deliver a commemorative statue to the women who contributed so much during the Great War of 1914-18.
