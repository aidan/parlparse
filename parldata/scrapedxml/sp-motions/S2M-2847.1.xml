 * S2M-2847.1 Shiona Baird: Developing Marine Energy Technology—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2847) in the name of Richard Baker, leave out from “the substantial” to end and insert “with disappointment that the support offered thus far by the Scottish Executive has been inadequate to allow Ocean Power Delivery (OPD) to install any commercially-operational Pelamis wave energy convertors off the coast of Scotland; acknowledges that the support offered to OPD by the Portugese Government far outstrips anything available in Scotland; echoes concerns expressed by the marine energy industry about the inadequate level of Executive support offered to date, and strongly believes that, unless there is a dramatic improvement in the support, financial and otherwise, offered to the offshore renewable energy sector to develop a domestic market for this vital technology, Scotland runs the risk of losing contracts, jobs and investment opportunities to our European competitors.”
