 *S1M-2691 Trish Godman: Scottish Public Service Employees—That the Parliament has every confidence in Scottish public service employees and acknowledges their integrity and commitment to the efficient and effective provision of a vast range of public services; notes their readiness to adapt to changing circumstances and willingness to improve services especially when such changes are based upon genuine consultation, and believes that many of the individual and communal needs and requirements in both urban and rural communities are best met by services, utilities and resources which are retained in the public sector and managed and staffed by those who have a sympathetic understanding of, and engagement with, a public service ethos.
