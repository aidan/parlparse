 *S2M-803.3 Murdo Fraser: Impact of Top-up Fees on Higher Education in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-803) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from "will" to end and insert "imposing top-up fees may have an adverse effect on Scottish higher education; calls on the Scottish Executive to set out its proposals for dealing with any consequential impact on Scottish universities and on Scottish students if top-up fees are introduced in England; rejects the politically opportunistic stance of the SNP on this issue which is intended to destabilise the Union, and calls on all Scottish MPs to follow the lead of Peter Duncan MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, and abstain from voting on this Bill and, indeed, all Bills that relate only to England and/or Wales."
