*S3M-5892 Jackie Baillie: Proper Funding for Dumbarton Academy, Not a Cut-price School—That the Parliament is alarmed by the apparent substantial reduction in funding being proposed by the Scottish Government for the rebuilding of Dumbarton Academy; understands that West Dunbartonshire Council and the former Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning acknowledged that it would cost approximately £30 million to rebuild Dumbarton Academy on its current site; further understands that West Dunbartonshire Council committed itself to £10.3 million of capital borrowing and expected £20 million from the Scottish Government; is deeply concerned that it now appears that the Scottish Government is prepared to contribute only £11 million; believes that this significant reduction will compromise the quality and facilities at the new school and potentially jeopardise the timetable for delivery, and therefore calls on the First Minister to intervene and restore the previously expected level of funding to ensure that Dumbarton gets a top-quality school, not a cut-price one.
