 *S1M-1427 Phil Gallie: Public Inquiry into Chhokar Case-That the Parliament notes the apologies made by the Lord Advocate to the Chhokar family; welcomes the inquiries that are to follow; considers that, in line with both the principle of open government referred to by the Minister for Justice and the wider public concern over the way in which the prosecution process is currently being pursued, the inquiry undertaken by Sir Anthony Campbell should be held in full public view, and registers its concern that a person with known connections to the Labour Party has been appointed to conduct the second inquiry, as this undermines public confidence in the integrity of the inquiry.
