*S2M-222# John Swinburne: Scottish Lottery—That the Parliament notes the recent news that the National Lottery is facing financial difficulty under its current operation following a steady drop in sales; further notes with concern the resulting decrease in money for good causes; recognises some of the reasons for the fall of interest in the National Lottery; welcomes Her Majesty’s Government’s pledge to "give the lottery back to the people", and therefore considers that a not-for-profit Scottish lottery should be set up with the money spent by lottery customers in Scotland exclusively used for the benefit of the people and communities of Scotland.
