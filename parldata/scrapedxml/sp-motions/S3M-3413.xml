*S3M-3413 Bill Kidd: No Place for Trident in Civilised Society—That the Parliament notes with concern, following the accidental publication of a top secret Ministry of Defence document, originally prepared in 1978, in the National Archives in London last year, the revelation that Trident was deployed to allow ground-bursts that could subject 55 to 60% of Moscow to a "radiation dose sufficient to cause rapid debilitation followed by death for most people in the area" and to cause "sufficient damage to bring about the breakdown of the city as a functioning community"; believes that the Dr Strangelove-esque logic that guided the strategic decisions of Margaret Thatcher during this period was profoundly misguided, and further believes that, in the absence of the desire to annihilate the civilian population of Moscow, the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown MP, and the Secretary of State for Defence, John Hutton MP, should put an end to this defunct reasoning and scrap Trident.
