 * S2M-3299# Helen Eadie:Coalfields Communities in Fife—That the Parliament commends the work of the Coalfields Communities Campaign and, in particular, its publication, Deprivation in Scottish Coalfields Communities, which is based on an analysis of the Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2004; further notes that coalfields communities continue to struggle some twenty years since the pits closed, the extent of which deprivation has not always been noticed because of the concentration of deprivation in Glasgow; recognises that Fife includes the former coalfield with the largest population in Scotland and that this coalfield remains disproportionately deprived in relation to the Scottish national average with some of the most deprived data zones in Scotland being in Fife, the poorest of which areas are contained in the wards of Ballingry, Lochore, Methil, Smeaton and Overton and that, across the central Fife coalfield area, one in three people are on state benefit or unemployed or are in the lowest grade of workers; finally notes that health indicators are particularly concerning with Lochore, for example, where the rate of people unable to work due to illness of disability is 89% above the Scottish average and the rate of claimants with disability living allowance is 103% above the Scottish average, and hopes that the Scottish Executive will urgently consider establishing a taskforce to develop a matrix of targeted support from all agencies involving the public and private sector.
