*S3M-5046 Christina McKelvie: Bad Science at the UK Border Agencyâ€”That the Parliament notes with dismay that, despite widespread condemnation by the scientific community, the UK Border Agency has announced that it will continue with its nationality-swapping Isotope analysis and DNA-testing process, or so-called Human Provenance Project, intended to establish the race and national origin of people seeking asylum in the United Kingdom and specifically to identify Somali nationals; notes that Sir Alec Jeffreys, the pioneer of DNA fingerprinting, has described the project as "wildly premature, even ignoring the moral and ethical aspects"; further notes that an editorial in Nature magazine describes the project as "scientifically flawed, ethically dubious and potentially damaging to science"; believes that, even if these test results are not used to determine the outcome of individual asylum claims, they are nonetheless invasive, of questionable purpose and open to potential abuse, and calls on the Home Office to cancel the Human Provenance Project forthwith.
