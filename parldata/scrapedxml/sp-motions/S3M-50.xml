 *S3M-50 Kenneth Gibson: The Single Transferable Vote—That the Parliament considers that the single transferable vote deeply disadvantages candidates with surnames towards the end of the alphabet when two or more candidates from a single party stand in the same council ward; is aware that in Cunninghame North, in the eight instances that two or more candidates from either the Conservative, Labour or Scottish National party stood, in every case the candidate whose surname came first in the alphabet obtained a much higher number of votes for that ward than colleagues whose surnames were further on in the alphabet; notes that the bigger the alphabetic gap the bigger the gulf in votes; is aware that this took place even on the two occasions where surnames were grouped by party and that the pattern was repeated elsewhere in Scotland, and therefore resolves, in the interests of fairness, that where more than one candidate from a party stands, their position on the ballot paper should be decided by lottery.
