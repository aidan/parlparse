 *S3M-7938 Willie Coffey: Willie Lincoln, Powerlifter Extraordinaire—That the Parliament notes what it considers the remarkable success of powerlifter Willie Lincoln of Kilmarnock, who, since turning 60 in 2010, has stormed into the top ranks of the world’s over-60s powerlifters, winning titles and setting records at European, Commonwealth and world levels; further notes that Willie, who trains three times a week at Kilmarnock Weightlifting Club, is looking forward to defending his title at the 2011 World Masters Powerlifting Championship in St Catherines, Canada, and considers that Willie, a grandfather of four, is an excellent example of what Scotland’s older citizens can achieve and a role model for younger athletes.
