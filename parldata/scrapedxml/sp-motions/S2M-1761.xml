*S2M-1761 Christine Grahame: World Alzheimer’s Day 2004—That the Parliament notes that 21 September 2004 was World Alzheimer’s Day; notes that some 62,000 people in Scotland have dementia and that the number grows as the population ages; notes that, according to Alzheimer’s Scotland, the status quo is not an option and that changes need to be made to health and community care services to ensure that both sufferers and their families, who are often unpaid carers, are properly supported; notes that the direct costs of this disease are substantially greater than strokes, heart disease and cancer but that expenditure on research does not reflect this, and believes that the Scottish Executive should therefore increase research funding into the causes, and possible treatments, of dementia and should ensure that proper systems are in place to identify, fund and support carers.
