 *S3M-5517 Elaine Smith: Grand Theft Childhood—That the Parliament notes with concern recent research that indicates that video games featuring high levels of violence can be detrimental to those playing them; acknowledges that these games can have a particularly negative effect on children and young people; recognises that violent video games are successfully marketed to and easily obtained by children and young people; notes with concern evidence to suggest that parents are purchasing video games for children younger than the certified age range; believes that parents should be made aware of the possible risk to children’s emotional and psychological development as a result of prolonged use of violent video games; further believes that the Scottish Government should engage in a productive debate among parents, legislators and video games producers to highlight the potential dangers of high rates of exposure to virtual violence, and encourages the Scottish Government to define the public policy options that are likely to be most effective in addressing the negative effects of these games.
