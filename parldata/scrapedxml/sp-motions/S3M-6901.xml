*S3M-6901 Bill Kidd: Bravehearts of Scotland and Panjaabâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the second historic Scottish-Sikh event celebrating 300 years of a Sikh Braveheart, Banda Singh Bahadur (1670-1716), the Sikh equivalent of William Wallace (1272-1305) at a public event at the Smith Art Gallery and Museum in Stirling on 4 September 2010, which will bring together the stunning sword displays of the Baba Deep Singh Gatka Akhaara and the traditional Scottish skills of the Clan Wallace; notes that, as well as speeches, bagpipes, turban tieing and traditional Sikh food, there will be a presentation of pictures to the gallery, a celebration of all things Scottish and Sikh and of the contribution that Sikhs have made to Scotland over many years and a coming together of two peoples with much in common, and expresses thanks to the Sikh Community Action Network and to the people of Stirling for making all of this possible.
