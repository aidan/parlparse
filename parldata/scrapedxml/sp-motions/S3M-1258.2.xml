 *S3M-1258.2 Jeremy Purvis: Education—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1258) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end "recognises the publication of the Scottish Government’s consultation on the Scottish Futures Trust and its support for the use of private finance, and is concerned that the failure of the SNP government to bring forward an alternative funding mechanism and support is causing confusion and uncertainty and is holding back councils across Scotland who want to improve schools in their areas."
