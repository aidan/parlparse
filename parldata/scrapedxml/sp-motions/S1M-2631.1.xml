 *S1M-2631.1 Tricia Marwick: Abolition of Council Tax-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2631) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from second "believes" to end and insert "notes that it is part of an unsustainable system of local government finance which, under Labour's stewardship, has resulted in an increase of Â£103 to the average householder's yearly tax bill while local services have deteriorated, and calls for a full review of local government finance which includes the replacement of unfair property based taxation with a system of local income tax, which takes account of ability to pay."
