*S2M-748 Tommy Sheridan: Reinstatement of Sacked Glasgow College of Commerce Lecturer-That the Parliament welcomes the result of the Glasgow employment tribunal on 10 December 2003 which ordered the reinstatement of Glasgow Central College of Commerce lecturer Jim O'Donovan who had been sacked for trade union activities; further notes the comments of the tribunal that the attitude adopted by the college management during the disciplinary process was "despicable", and believes, in the light of this outcome and the scores of other disputes in further education colleges across Scotland, that a full investigation into the management of Scotland's further education colleges is required and that Scotland's colleges should be returned to the democratic control of local authorities as the best way to deliver further education.
