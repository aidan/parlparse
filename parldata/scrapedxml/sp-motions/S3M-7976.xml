*S3M-7976 Robert Brown: School Clothing Grant Report Axed—That the Parliament appreciates what it sees as the considerable effort put into producing the report of the short-life working group on the review of school meal and school clothing grant provision across Scotland; is concerned that the final report was completed in March 2009 but not published until January 2011, some 22 months later; notes the main recommendations that the Scottish Government and COSLA should produce guidance for local authorities on the school clothing grant and that the minimum level should rise to £70 per pupil per annum; notes further that councils are under a statutory duty in terms of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to make clothing grant provision to eligible parents; is aware of the value of the grant to hard-pressed parents, and regrets that the Scottish Ministers appear to have pigeonholed the report without any proposals for present or future action on it.
