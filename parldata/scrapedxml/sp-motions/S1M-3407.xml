*S1M-3407# Rhoda Grant: European Capital of Culture Bid - Inverness Highland 2008-That the Parliament notes the on-going competition to decide the United Kingdom's nominee for the European Capital of Culture in 2008; further notes that Inverness Highland 2008 is the sole Scottish bid; recognises the imaginative plans that the bid team have proposed including capitalising on the Highlands' unique culture and the development of a cultural plan; further recognises the immense economic, social and cultural benefits that a successful bid would bring to Inverness and the Highlands, and considers that, as this is the sole Scottish bid, the Scottish Executive, MSPs, government agencies and the wider Scottish society should do all in their power to support the bid and promote a successful outcome.
