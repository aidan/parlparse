 *S3M-7227 Elaine Smith: There Is a Better Wayâ€”That the Parliament commends the STUC on the launch of its There is a Better Way campaign; believes that deep, savage and immediate cuts are neither unavoidable nor inevitable and that they would actually threaten economic recovery; further believes that a sensible and sustainable response to the current economic crisis is to promote growth and ensure fairness through creating jobs and protecting services, through fair taxation and a living wage, and encourages MSPs from across the chamber to join with others who care for the wellbeing of Scotland and support the STUC campaign.
