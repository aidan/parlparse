 *S3M-2308 Patrick Harvie: Glasgow Women’s Library—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow Women’s Library on its successful bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has agreed to provide a grant of £410,000 for the creation of a dedicated archive space at the Mitchell Library and the recruitment of a full-time archivist; recognises that the bid was of a very high standard and attracted 110 letters of support; believes that the work of Glasgow Women’s Library, which includes redressing the neglect of women’s historical and cultural contributions to Scottish society and creating new approaches to culture and heritage that bring together women from the most diverse backgrounds, is of immense value to Glasgow and to Scotland, and offers everyone at the Glasgow Women’s Library the very best wishes as they take this significant step forward in the development of their service.
