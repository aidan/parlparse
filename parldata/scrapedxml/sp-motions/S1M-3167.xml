*S1M-3167# Alex Neil: Congratulations to The Robert Gordon University for Scrapping Archaic Academic Contracts-That the Parliament congratulates The Robert Gordon University and the Association of University Teachers for reaching an agreement that will see academics currently classed as contract research staff put on open-ended permanent contracts and hopes that other universities will follow The Robert Gordon's example; recognises that around 4,700 academics in Scotland, Scotland's brightest and best, are still stuck on fixed-term contracts and are faced with insecurity, poor promotion prospects and low pay, and considers that the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning should use the example set by The Robert Gordon University as an opportunity to give the higher education sector clear guidance and leadership on this issue.
