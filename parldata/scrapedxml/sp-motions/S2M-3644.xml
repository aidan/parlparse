*S2M-3644 Roseanna Cunningham: Black Watch Red Hackle—That the Parliament notes and reaffirms the terms of motion S2M-2165 in the name of Murdo Fraser on proposed defence reviews from a Scottish perspective, which was debated and passed, as amended by S2M-2165.1, by the Parliament on 16 December 2004; further notes that even many of those members who opposed the motion supported the belief that the traditions, community links and identities of Scotland’s infantry battalions should be maintained; expresses deep concern at the decision by the Army Board to renege on its much-publicised deal to allow the Black Watch to continue to wear the Red Hackle, and believes that this move signals a determination to end all sense of individual identities within the new amalgamated regiment.
