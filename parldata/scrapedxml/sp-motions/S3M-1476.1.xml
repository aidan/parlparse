 *S3M-1476.1 Jamie Hepburn: Rail Services in Airdrie—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1476) in the name of Karen Whitefield, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "welcomes the Scottish Government’s continued commitment to the link, reaffirmed by the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change in the Parliament on 21 February 2008; notes that the Scottish Government is investing record levels in the rail network in Scotland, including progressing the Airdrie-Bathgate rail link, and has made the same commitment to new stations as the previous administration; notes that there have been cost overruns and delays in other transport infrastructure projects commissioned by the previous administration; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that options for additional stops and further improvement in the Airdrie to Bathgate line are left open for future development, and considers that the text of motion S3M-1476 is at best political opportunism and at worst an attempt at misrepresentation of the Scottish Government’s position on this issue."
