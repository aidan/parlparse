 *S1M-3197.2 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3197) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "but seeks assurances that Scotland’s recent decommissioning programme will be taken into account with regard to reductions in fleet sizes; supports a collaborative and regional approach to reform involving the fishing industry and other stakeholders; acknowledges the need for a more sustainable balance between the catching capability of the fleet and available fish stocks; recognises that a process of tough negotiations with other member states now lies ahead, which was highlighted in yesterday’s u-turn by the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Franz Fischler, over the issue of deep water species which has left our fleet with only 2% of that total allowable catch in their local waters, and further recognises that action of this kind will only serve to undermine confidence in the overall Common Fisheries Policy reform programme." Supported by: Mr David Davidson*, Ben Wallace*
