*S2M-4985 Ms Rosemary Byrne: European Week for Safety and Health 2006—That the Parliament notes this year’s European Week for Safety and Health 2006 - Safe Start for young workers; notes that young workers are often more susceptible to damage from exposure to toxic substances which may not become apparent until much later in life; further notes that young people’s bones and muscles are still developing and that heavy repetitive work can lead to muscular and skeletal problems and impaired growth; further notes that in the European Union the injury rate for workers aged 18 to 24 is more than 40% higher than other age groups, that in just five years it is estimated that 50 under-18s have lost their lives in UK workplaces and nearly 13,000 were badly injured and that at least 45 children and young people have died and more than 400 have been seriously injured on farms in the last 10 years; recognises that over a quarter of a million young people are involved in apprenticeship programmes in the UK, some of which involve the 14 to 16 age group; notes with concern that a recent TUC poll found that 37% of 15 to 24-year-olds had not had any health and safety training, and therefore calls for the Scottish Executive to do all it can to ensure that Scottish employers understand and implement the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 for all employees, including providing a safe workplace, safe systems of work, safe plant and equipment, instruction, training and supervision, and safe use, handling, storage and transport of articles and substances.
