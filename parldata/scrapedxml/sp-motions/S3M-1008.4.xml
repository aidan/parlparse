 *S3M-1008.4 Jim Hume: The Benefits of Woodland and Greenspaces—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1008) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "and calls" to end and insert "believes that the voluntary and public sectors can work proactively to promote the use of existing woodland and other greenspace, particularly by young people, through such activities as nature kindergartens, outdoor education centres and footpath networks; recognises the importance of local authorities developing core path plans in improving public access to greenspace; further recognises the need to work with land managers to increase access to land through management contract incentives; therefore calls on the Scottish Government to commit to long-term funding to sustain better access for everyone to urban and rural woodland and greenspace through management contract incentives; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that local authorities create better public access to their area by developing and implementing core path plans, and calls on the environmental and health sectors to work together to further develop the contribution of woodland and other greenspace to Scotland’s health."
