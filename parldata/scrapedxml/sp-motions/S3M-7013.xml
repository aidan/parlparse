 *S3M-7013 Liam McArthur: The Closure of Orkney Todayâ€”That the Parliament notes with disappointment the news that the Orkney Media Group is to close the award-winning Orkney Today newspaper, which is the current Highlands and Islands Newspaper of the Year; believes that the newspaper has become an important feature of Orkney life and its distinctive style and coverage of local events will be missed by Orcadians; hopes that those affected by the closure will be able to find other employment opportunities in Orkney, and commends the editors, journalists and their support staff for the service that they have given to the Orkney community over the lifetime of the newspaper.
