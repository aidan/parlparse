*S2M-83 Colin Fox: Cuban Miami Five—That the Parliament expresses concern at the trial and detention in the United States of America of Cuban nationals Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, Fernando Gonzalez Llort, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo, Ramon Labanino Salazar and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert, known as the Miami Five; considers that the nature of the charges, the location of the trial in Miami, Florida, in an atmosphere of media and public intimidation and the length of the sentences subsequently handed down call into question the safety of the judicial process; notes that the immediate families of the detainees have been unable to visit them as they have been denied entry to the USA, and believes that the US Government should support the petition for a retrial and ensure that it is held in a jurisdiction that guarantees a fair trial.
