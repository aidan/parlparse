*S3M-1122 Jamie Hepburn: Accessing BBC Local Content Using Catch-Up TV Servicesâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the lack of BBC Nations and Regions news and current affairs output on the Catch-Up TV service provided by various cable television suppliers; believes that it is unacceptable that viewers in Scotland and BBC regions in England can access only the London region content of the Politics Show and other news and current affairs programmes through this service; recognises that "on demand" services are currently being promoted as a reasonable expectation of licence-fee payers; further believes that this situation strengthens the case for control of broadcasting to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, and considers that the BBC should take swift action to ensure that viewers throughout the UK have equal access to relevant local content.
