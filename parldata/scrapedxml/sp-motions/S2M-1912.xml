 *S2M-1912# Roseanna Cunningham: Pools Companies Holding Scottish Football to Ransom—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the decision by Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters football pools companies to cease payment to the Scottish Football League (SFL) of copyright payments for the right to use SFL fixtures in their pools games; notes that, for this season, the SFL was scheduled to receive around £600,000, which would have meant an income of some £20,000 for each club; recognises that 20% of the SFL’s commercial income comes from this source and that this decision will have a major impact on the finances of every member club of the SFL, and therefore believes that the three pools companies should reverse the decision. Supported by: Michael Matheson*, Rob Gibson*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Bruce Crawford*, Alex Neil*, Stewart Stevenson*, Donald Gorrie*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*
