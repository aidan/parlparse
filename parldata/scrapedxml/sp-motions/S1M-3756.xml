*S1M-3756# Elaine Smith: UNICEF Report, The State of the World's Children 2003-That the Parliament notes the publication of the report The State of the World's Children 2003; commends UNICEF's commitment to monitoring children's rights and development internationally and congratulates it for its contribution for achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals: is concerned that the report shows that children's participation in society is largely undeveloped and that millions of children and young people have doubts about the usefulness of voting as a method of improving their lives and often do not see government leaders as role models; considers that the Scottish Executive should take all possible action to assist Her Majesty's Government in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and supports the creation of a protective environment to allow children world-wide to grow up free from poverty, abuse, neglect and exploitation. # - Members' Business
