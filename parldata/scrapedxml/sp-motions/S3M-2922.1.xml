*S3M-2922.1 Rhona Brankin: Supporting Scotland’s Looked-after Children—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2922) in the name of Adam Ingram, insert at end "; in that spirit recognises that looked-after children are among those considered as most vulnerable and therefore believes that integral to their success is for the Scottish Government to ensure that local authority funding for the care and safety of children more generally is properly protected, particularly in light of the recent worrying HM Inspectorate of Education report into child protection services in Aberdeen, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to make a statement on that report and to revisit the Children’s Services Bill consulted on in the previous parliamentary session."
