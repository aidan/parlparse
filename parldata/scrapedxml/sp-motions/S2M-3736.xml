*S2M-3736 Carolyn Leckie: Iraq: 1,000 Days Under Occupation—That the Parliament notes the passing of the 1,000th day since the invasion of Iraq by US and British military forces on 20 March 2003; notes that, despite President Bush declaring that major hostilities were over on 1 May 2003, 183,000 British and American troops remain in action at the end of 2005; further notes that the United States of America has spent over $204 billion on the war so far but has totally failed in its promise to reconstruct Iraq after the war; recognises that the biggest issue facing Iraqis today is personal safety, with criminal gangs and death squads bringing a complete breakdown in law and order; notes that many Iraqis who initially welcomed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein have been humiliated and brutalised by the occupying forces who have conducted full body searches of Muslim women in front of men and in their own bedrooms, have entered mosques without removing their boots, have used mass arrests of young men and held them without charge for months on end and have routinely used torture in prisons such as Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca; further notes reports from Iraq that show that the occupying forces are using air strikes, tanks and artillery against civilian targets, including the use of white phosphorus during the actions in Fallujah, which have been described as war crimes; believes that it is the actions of the US and British military forces that are driving Iraqis to resist the occupation politically, physically and through trade union action; notes the magnificent work of Iraqi non-governmental organisations, such as International Peace Angels, who bring medical and humanitarian aid to Iraqis who find themselves caught up in the fighting, and believes that the situation in Iraq can come to a positive outcome if the occupying forces are withdrawn immediately and Iraqis are able to determine the future of their country, free from foreign occupation.
