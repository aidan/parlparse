*S2M-1054 Mrs Nanette Milne: Congratulations to "Young Live and Loud in Aberdeenshire"-That the Parliament congratulates the young people and youth workers who organised the "Young Live and Loud in Aberdeenshire" event, on running a very successful and enjoyable day on Saturday 13 March 2004; notes that the entire Thainstone Mart complex was given over to the event which raised the awareness of over 2000 young people of the activities and leisure opportunities available to them in the Aberdeenshire region; hopes that the organisers will be able to build upon their successes by turning it into an annual event, and further hopes that other regions will follow the example set by Aberdeenshire in promoting activities to engage with young people and increase their participation in physical leisure and community opportunities.
