*S2M-1092 Dr Jean Turner: Campsie Memorial Hall Premature Closure-That the Parliament deplores the unexpected, premature closure of the Milton of Campsie Memorial Village Hall in the early hours of 22 March instead of 28 March 2004, when East Dunbartonshire Council, through the application of delegated powers, surreptitiously erected heras fencing; notes that observers witnessed approximately 10 council vehicles with 40 staff on board as well as the Commercial Strategic Director of East Dunbartonshire Council, a police chief inspector and a constable; believes that such people were all likely to be on overtime at immense public cost; further deplores the allegations made by the council that public disorder and illegal occupation of the facility would arise; notes that the council has not yet fully provided alternative arrangements for current hall users resulting in like-for-like facilities being unavailable and requiring a change of day and time for activities, and finally notes that many personal effects were locked away without prior warning to the public to retrieve such items.
