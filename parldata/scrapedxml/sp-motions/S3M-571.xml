*S3M-571 Sarah Boyack: Calls for Restraint in Myanmar Crisis—That the Parliament notes the growing tension in Myanmar, previously known as Burma, with thousands of protestors facing an increasing threat of violence from the country’s military rulers; remembers that the peaceful democracy protests in 1998 were met with violent repression and many deaths; respects the basic human right of all people to freedom of expression and protection from oppression, and therefore hopes that the calls from the international community for restraint will be heeded by the generals who rule Myanmar.
