 *S1M-3124# Bruce Crawford: Closure of Longannet Deep Coal Mine-That the Parliament regrets the closure of Scotland's last deep coal mine at Longannet in Fife; is deeply disappointed that over 500 mining jobs were lost and that Scotland has also lost its most valuable low sulphur coal reserve; is concerned that the pit flooded at a time when Scottish Coal (Deep Mine) Ltd was experiencing financial and production difficulties and that the reasons for the flooding have not yet been adequately explained; is further concerned that, despite the substantial public investment, in excess of £45 million, inadequate steps were taken by Her Majesty's Government to protect the public's investment in the mine, save the jobs or retain this valuable energy resource for the nation, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should carry out a full public inquiry to determine how the flooding was allowed to take place that resulted in the mine's closure.
