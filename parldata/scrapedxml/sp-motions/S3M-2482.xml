*S3M-2482♦ Trish Godman: Action on Thrombosis—That the Parliament notes with concern that, according to provisional figures from the Scottish Government, the total number of deaths from thrombosis in 2007 was 12,275, which represents 21% of all deaths in Scotland; further notes that in 2006 thrombosis killed more than fifty times the number of people who died from MRSA and Clostridium difficile combined, and therefore considers that action should be taken to increase awareness of thrombosis among the public and health professionals and establish an effective prevention strategy for thrombosis in Scottish hospitals, such as some sort of screening regime, to help save valuable NHS resources from treating a disease that can often be prevented if a patient knows they are at risk in the first place and to help avoid tragedies like that of Katie McPherson from Langbank, who died as a result of deep vein thrombosis.
