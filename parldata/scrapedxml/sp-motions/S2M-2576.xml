 * S2M-2576 Rosie Kane:Alleged US Plot to Assassinate President Chavez and Visit to Scotland of Women’s Development Bank—That the Parliament notes that Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez, has accused the US Government of plotting to assassinate him for refusing to privatise and hand over to US corporations the oil and water that belong to the Venezuelan people; condemns any attempt to overthrow popular elected governments whilst preaching democracy, and welcomes to Scotland, as part of its European tour, Venezuela’s Women’s Development Bank, which aims to “eliminate poverty by giving power to the poor, creating a caring economy, an economy at the service of human beings, rather than human beings at the service of the economy”.
