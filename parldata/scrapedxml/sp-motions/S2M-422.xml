*S2M-422# Colin Fox: The Airborne Initiative—That the Parliament condemns the trial by media of the alternative to custody project, the Airborne Initiative, and any attempts to cut the project’s funding; notes that this project works with some of Scotland’s toughest offenders and offers a course that addresses offending behaviour and is regarded as a model of rehabilitation across the western hemisphere; considers it to be completely unacceptable for the future of such projects to be put in jeopardy by the incomplete and subjective evidence of a scene in a television documentary, and commends the Airborne Initiative for taking part in a programme that shows the extent of the problems those attempting to address offending behaviour have to face on a daily basis.
