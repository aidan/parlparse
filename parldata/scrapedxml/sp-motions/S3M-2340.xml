*S3M-2340 Bill Kidd: Time to End Discrimination Against All Unpaid Carers—That the Parliament welcomes the European Court of Justice’s decision that the laws that protect disabled people against discrimination apply not only to the person themselves, but also to their unpaid carer; notes that this follows the historic case taken by carer, Sharon Coleman, who claimed that she was discriminated against and harassed because she had a disabled son and was treated less favourably than employees whose children were not disabled; further notes that this could give new rights to millions of unpaid carers who are struggling to combine caring with paid work, and agrees with Carers Scotland’s view that, although this ruling appears to apply only to parents of disabled children, government should ensure that it is applied to all people providing unpaid care to others and take a proactive approach to include all carers, rather than awaiting further cases to be taken through the courts.
