*S3M-2553.2 Sarah Boyack: Hill Farms and Less Favoured Areas—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2553) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from "and welcomes" to end and insert "notes the publication on 18 September 2008 of the Scottish Government’s consultation on the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme; calls on the Scottish Government to simplify and streamline the Rural Development Programme (RDP) application process and to clarify the decision-making process to ensure transparency, effectiveness and fairness in the distribution of RDP allocations; further calls on the Scottish Government to set targets for public sector food procurement that would deliver a significant percentage of locally sourced and fairly traded produce, and encourages stakeholders to work in partnership to consider the range of relevant economic, social and environmental issues with the aim of securing a sustainable future for agriculture on our hills and in our remote communities."
