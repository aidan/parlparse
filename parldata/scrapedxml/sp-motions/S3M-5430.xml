*S3M-5430 Irene Oldfather: Can Gerry Robinson Fix Dementia Care Homes—That the Parliament commends the BBC-produced documentary series, Can Gerry Robinson Fix Dementia Care Homes?, for highlighting the poor living conditions that frail elderly people can face in the care home sector; recognises that, while the documentary is based in England, the problems experienced match up with those in Scotland as highlighted in the recent joint report by the Care Commission and Mental Welfare Commission, Remember, I’m Still Me; notes that the programme found examples of senior staff members with no training in dementia care and residents being kept inside during very good weather without access to the outside and garden and with no regular provision of mental or physical stimulation; further notes the concern expressed in the programme about residents’ bruising; believes that this programme demonstrates the need for a not-for-profit care home model to be piloted and that there is a need for improved staff training for all, with the possible introduction of a national qualification in dementia care, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the forthcoming national dementia strategy recognises the fundamental problems facing frail elderly residents with dementia in care homes, brings forward policies to address these issues and enables significant culture change in the sector.
