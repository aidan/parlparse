*S3M-3797 Bill Wilson: Curbing Pay Excesses While Sustaining Tax Revenues—That the Parliament notes the remarks by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rt Hon Alistair Darling MP, that the UK Government is keen to take action on excessive remuneration in the financial sector but is concerned that a strict ceiling would leave a black hole in tax revenues; believes that this concern could be addressed if more was done by the UK Government to eradicate tax havens and close tax loopholes, its actions potentially including the lobbying of global institutions and other governments; suggests that the UK Government should impose on financial institutions, and potentially on others, a maximum ratio of earnings, including bonuses and share options, of their best-paid employees to the earnings of their worst-paid employees, and believes that this would make for a more stable economy and a more equal society, with considerable benefits for UK society as a whole.
