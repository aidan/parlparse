 *S3M-944 Brian Adam: Road Hauliers and a Fuel Price Regulator—That the Parliament supports the Road Haulage Association’s campaign to introduce a fuel price regulator; notes the burdensome cost of fuel for motorists and the road haulage industry which affects Scotland; notes that Scotland is one of the world’s largest oil producers with oil at record prices; further highlights the negative effect of soaring fuel prices on competitiveness; urges the UK Government to close the gap between fuel duties charged in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe; considers that the revenues from fuel duties and VAT, accounting for 60% of the price of petrol and diesel, pose an unfair burden on industry and consumers, and calls on the UK Government to introduce a fuel price regulator which would ensure the smooth modulation of VAT on fuel to reflect changes in the price of oil thus protecting hauliers and consumers.
