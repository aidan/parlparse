*S2M-5198 Karen Whitefield: Child Fuel Poverty—That the Parliament notes the calculation by Barnardo’s, Capability Scotland, the Child Poverty Action Group, Children in Scotland and Save the Children that there are now 100,000 Scottish children living in fuel poverty; understands that this is a result of massive and sustained increases in energy prices which have overwhelmed the benefits from increases in income and Scottish Executive and local authority programmes on energy efficiency; believes that the recent advice from npower that parents should send their children to bed wearing socks and a hat represents an entirely inadequate response to the worsening situation for vulnerable families, and looks forward to the energy companies accepting the case for discounted tariffs for vulnerable households.
