 *S1M-2764 Christine Grahame: Young People at Risk—That the Parliament notes with concern that the Young People’s Unit at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital had, at 7 February 2002, 88 young people on its waiting list for only 12 beds, nine of which were at that time occupied, with NHS Lothian having access to six beds, NHS Forth Valley having access to two beds each, with two beds for Scotland-wide emergencies; notes that allocation is on the basis of clinical priority which can mean that it takes one or more suicide attempt to be allocated a bed; further notes that it is estimated that one in five young people suffer from some form of mental health problem, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive, which purports to put young people at the top of its agenda, to provide more resources to the NHS for mental health so that these many vulnerable young people have the care they require before the situation becomes a crisis.
