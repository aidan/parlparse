*S2M-1511 Dennis Canavan: The Crisis in Darfur-That the Parliament expresses its concern about the crisis in Darfur, Sudan; believes that the principle of non-refoulement as enshrined in refugee law should be respected with regard to refugees in Chad and that the same principle should be applied with regard to people displaced internally; urges the international community to provide financial and in-kind support for humanitarian appeals for Darfur and refugees in Chad; supports the African Union (AU) in calling for the immediate establishment of the ceasefire commission and of protection units that were requested in the 8 April 2004 agreement between the Darfur rebels and the Sudan government and for the deployment of adequate numbers of AU ceasefire monitors and the facilitation of their free movement throughout the region, and calls on Her Majesty's Government and the international community to use their influence to ensure that the recently agreed north-south peace accord is implemented effectively.
