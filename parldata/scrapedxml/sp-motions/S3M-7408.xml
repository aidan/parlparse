*S3M-7408♦ Kenneth Gibson: Banking on the Basics—That the Parliament welcomes Citizens Advice Scotland’s (CAS) most recent research report, Banking on the Basics, outlining issues experienced by people living in Scotland in accessing basic bank accounts; notes the finding that one in 10 public survey respondents did not have a bank account although two thirds of these had tried to open one; further notes the report’s findings that a number of people living in Scotland are unable to open a bank account due to having a poor or no credit history, being unable to meet set ID requirements, owing money to a bank or due to an undischarged bankruptcy; considers that access to bank accounts is essential for receiving wages, accessing affordable credit, receiving lower utility bills and for financial inclusion; further considers that the CAS use of client evidence means that it speaks with authority on the effects of policies and practices adopted by financial service providers in Scotland, including those who provide services to people living in Cunninghame North,and would welcome the implementation of the recommendations made in the report, including the introduction of a universal right to a bank account for all.
