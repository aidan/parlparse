*S1M-2338# Irene McGugan: Pay scales for new teachers-That the Parliament notes that trainee primary and secondary school teachers were encouraged into the profession by assurances that age and experience would be recognised on qualification; is concerned that the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers is considering making changes to teachers' pay scales as they apply to probationary and recently qualified staff which would impact significantly on the situation of mature students; considers that these changes can only have a generally detrimental impact on the national teacher recruitment campaign; believes that the Scottish Executive should consider the implications which such a proposal will have, particularly on mature students who are currently part of the way through their training and many of whom gave up well-paid careers, and recommends that such students be given assurances that what they were promised will be honoured.
