 *S2M-4714 Dr Elaine Murray: Pardon for Executed Soldiers—That the Parliament welcomes the statement by the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne MP, that he intends to seek posthumous pardons for the 307 soldiers court martialled and executed for cowardice, desertion and other offences during the 1914-18 war; regrets that after 90 years few of the immediate relatives of the men executed are able to appreciate the restoration of the names and reputations of these soldiers, and trusts that colleagues in the UK Parliament will approve granting a group pardon to these victims of war.
