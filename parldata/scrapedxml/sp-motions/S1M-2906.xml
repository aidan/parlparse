 *S1M-2906 Mr John McAllion: Criminal Responsibility and the Piper Alpha Disaster—That the Parliament recalls the killing of 167 men in the Piper Alpha disaster which was the result of the negligence of the Occidental Oil Company, as clearly demonstrated by the Public Inquiry into the disaster; notes that there has never been a parliamentary inquiry into the Crown Office’s decision not to prosecute in this case, and therefore calls for such an inquiry into that decision.
