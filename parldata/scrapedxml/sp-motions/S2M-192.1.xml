 *S2M-192.1 Carolyn Leckie: Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill - Stage 1-As an amendment to motion (S2M-192) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "does not agree to the general principles of the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill because it would allow the contracting out of primary medical services to private healthcare providers and fails to guarantee the continuing provision of out-of-hours services to patients and believes that the Executive's overall goal should be to bring primary medical services under NHS control through moving towards GPs becoming salaried employees of the NHS."
