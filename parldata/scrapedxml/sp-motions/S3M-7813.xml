*S3M-7813 Bill Kidd: Sick, Tired and Caring—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, Sick, tired and caring: The impact of unpaid caring on health and long term conditions, by Carers Scotland, which looks at the health of Scotland’s carers, and is appalled at the findings that carers are more than twice as likely to have a long-term illness or disability as the rest of the population, that 96% of respondents said that caring had impacted negatively on their health and that almost half the carers, 42%, reported that their conditions had started after they began caring.
