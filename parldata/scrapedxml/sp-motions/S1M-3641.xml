*S1M-3641 Bill Aitken: Drug Courts—That the Parliament notes the growing prevalence of drug abuse and drug-related crimes; regrets that the Scottish Executive continues to send out mixed messages on drugs; further regrets that the Executive’s flagship drug courts have become a means of avoiding a prison term, and therefore calls on the Executive to ensure that (a) those sent to drug courts have committed only a minimal number of offences, (b) there are sufficient resources to ensure that those who are sentenced by drug courts have the option of immediate and instant treatment to undergo rehabilitation and (c) any breach of orders from the drug courts are dealt with properly.
