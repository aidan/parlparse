*S3M-6501 Rhona Brankin: Congratulations to Gorebridge Community Development Trust on Big Lottery Funding—That the Parliament congratulates Gorebridge Community Development Trust on its award of £835,000 from the Big Lottery Fund; recognises that this will help greatly toward its target of £3.2 million needed for a new community hub, which would provide office space for charity, community and youth groups, accommodation for private functions, childcare and conference facilities and a one-stop-shop for Midlothian Council services; further recognises that the trust still requires £1.38 million for the project to go ahead; hopes that this Big Lottery award will act as a catalyst in acquiring further funding, and wishes the trust all the very best in securing this funding toward an excellent community facility.
