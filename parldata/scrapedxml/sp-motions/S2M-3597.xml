*S2M-3597 Patrick Harvie: Former MI5 Chief’s Comments on ID Cards—That the Parliament agrees with comments by Dame Stella Rimington, former MI5 Director General, that ID cards are documents that could be easily forged and are therefore effectively useless in efforts to end terrorism; notes that Dame Stella further commented that people working for intelligence services, particularly MI5, would be unlikely to press for ID cards; further notes that, of the 25 countries that have been most adversely affected by terrorism since 1986, 80% have national identity cards, one third of which incorporate biometrics; believes that the introduction of the UK Identity Cards Bill will be a costly, impractical and ineffective response to the problems of security and fraud, and calls on the UK Government to drop its current proposals for ID cards and a national identity database. Supported by: Fiona Hyslop*, Stewart Stevenson*, Carolyn Leckie*, Murdo Fraser*, Derek Brownlee*, Ms Sandra White*, Campbell Martin*
