*S2M-5601♦ Cathy Peattie: Future For Our Post Offices—That the Parliament welcomes the statement by the Future for Our Post Office campaign, a diverse range of stakeholder groups including the Communication Workers Union, the National Federation of SubPostmasters, Age Concern and the National Pensioners’ Convention; is concerned about the impact that current UK Government proposals will have on post office services to the public across Scotland, both in towns such as Grangemouth and Bo’ness and in smaller communities such as Brightons, especially for vulnerable groups in rural and urban deprived areas; notes that the role of the Scottish Parliament and the regional assemblies is part of the consultation being undertaken; believes that there should be a greater role and remit for the Scottish Executive and Scottish Parliament in respect of Post Office Ltd and more devolved and local accountability regarding post office provision, and believes that the Executive should make a submission in support of this to the current DTI consultation, calling also for the UK Government to (a) provide additional funding for the entire post office network, (b) enhance the products and services on offer to customers, (c) ensure that the post office is the shop front for national and Scottish government services, (d) extend the Social Network Payment to include additional funding for the urban deprived network and crown post offices, (e) establish a more functional replacement product for the post office card account that tackles financial exclusion, to be run and operated through Post Office Ltd, (f) improve and strengthen proposed access criteria so that these genuinely meet the needs of local communities in Scotland, (g) prevent further avoidable closures of rural and highland post offices and (h) ensure that a significant national network of crown post offices has a central role in Post Office Ltd’s future strategy.
