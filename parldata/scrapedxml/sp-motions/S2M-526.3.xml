*S2M-526.3 Mark Ballard: Building Better Cities - Delivering Growth and Opportunities-As an amendment to motion (S2M-526) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "since" to end and insert "; welcomes the bringing together of a wider range of policy strands; believes, however, that sustainability must lie at the heart of urban policy rather then being an afterthought to economic growth, and urges the Scottish Executive to take forward a policy of urban regeneration that is led primarily by the needs of local communities, rather than by big business."
