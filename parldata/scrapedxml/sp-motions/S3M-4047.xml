 *S3M-4047 John Lamont: Dispensing GP Practices in Rural Communities—That the Parliament recognises the important role of dispensing GP practices in remote and rural communities across Scotland; acknowledges the high level of patient satisfaction with these practices; is concerned about the process of the community pharmacy application in Chirnside, which has failed to involve properly the affected GPs or take account of the views of the local population; is aware of the current inquiry on dispensing under consideration by the Public Petitions Committee; therefore supports the British Medical Association’s calls for the pharmacy regulations to be reviewed, and agrees that all decisions regarding pharmacy applications should be suspended until this process is concluded.
