*S2M-162 Murdo Fraser: Water Industryâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the dramatic increases in charges by Scottish Water to businesses in 2003-04 which, in some cases, amount to nearly 500% more than the amount charged in 2002-03; believes that these increased charges bear no relation to the service provided by Scottish Water to these customers; is concerned that these rising costs have increased the competitive disadvantage faced by Scottish firms, particularly in relation to England; further notes that household bills have gone up by 94% in real terms over the past decade, while English domestic bills have only risen by 22% since 1989; acknowledges that privatisation in England has brought substantial capital investment which has led to lower bills for businesses and households alongside improved water quality; calls on the Scottish Executive to address urgently the concerns of domestic and business customers in relation to these higher charges and to look at widening competition with a view to reducing costs, and further believes that, as public ownership has failed customers in Scotland, the Executive should investigate models of private ownership.
