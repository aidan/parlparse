*S3M-2515# Richard Baker: Aberdeen Crossrail Project—That the Parliament supports the Aberdeen Crossrail project as an integral part of a future transport strategy for the north east; believes that a frequent rail service with new stations running between Stonehaven, Inverurie and Aberdeen is vital to tackling congestion in Aberdeen and to economic growth in the north east; believes that the project is essential for a sustainable transport strategy in the area and to provide much improved public transport options for residents and commuters; believes that supporting Aberdeen Crossrail will enable even more ambitious plans to be developed for new rail services in other parts of Aberdeenshire; is concerned at recent reports that the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland are no longer supporting the scheme, and hopes that the long-established consensus to support Aberdeen Crossrail will continue.
