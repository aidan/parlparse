 *S2M-5084 Nora Radcliffe: Congratulations to Clydesdale Bank—That the Parliament notes the second anniversary of the alliance between Clydesdale Bank and the Post Office Ltd; notes that to date over 2.3 million transactions, totalling over £500 million, have been made by Clydesdale Bank customers through the Post Office, demonstrating the value of this service, especially to people in rural areas where 60% of villages have a post office but only 9% have a bank branch, and commends Clydesdale Bank for allowing all of its customers to access their money at any of the 1,800 post offices in Scotland, the only major Scottish bank providing a service for its customers and helping to support the post office network in this way.
