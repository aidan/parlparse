*S2M-3221 Patrick Harvie: Removal of Asylum Seekers’ Children—That the Parliament congratulates the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland, Professor Kathleen Marshall, for raising the issue of the inhumane methods used by the UK Government in the removal and detention of children prior to deportation; endorses Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) which states that governments should protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse; considers that the early morning raids being carried out on vulnerable families by officers in body armour violate this article as well as the spirit of the UNCRC; agrees with Professor Marshall that this treatment amounts to terrorising families; is concerned that Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 will worsen this situation and lead to many more families being subjected to this inhumane treatment, and calls on the UK Government to repeal this legislation and to ensure that all asylum and immigration policy is consistent with the UNCRC.Supported by: Fiona Hyslop*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Campbell Martin*, Mr John Swinney*, Shiona Baird*, Chris Ballance*, Mark Ballard*, Rob Gibson*, Robin Harper*, Alex Neil*
