 *S2M-3394 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Improve Broiler Chicken Welfare—That the Parliament recognises that the intensive farming of chicken for meat production is one of the least regulated areas of food production within the whole livestock industry; notes that immense suffering, including lameness and brittle bones, can be caused to broiler chickens through genetic selection for fast growth and high stocking densities; believes that the proposed EU directive on the welfare of broiler chickens is a welcome first step in the raising of broiler chicken welfare standards across the whole European Union (EU), and calls on the Scottish Executive to urge the UK Government to use its Presidency of the EU to demand genuine improvements in broiler chicken welfare.
