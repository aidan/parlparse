*S3M-285 Margaret Mitchell: Scottish Spina Bifida Association Centre, Cumbernauld—That the Parliament acknowledges the vital work carried out by the Scottish Spina Bifida Association by providing the only specialist family support service for spina bifida and hydrocephalus in Scotland; welcomes the new family support centre in Cumbernauld which has allowed the association to expand its support services to best meet users’ needs by providing a relaxing environment for families to visit and training, recreation and support services; congratulates the association on the creation of a specialist telemedicine suite which is the first to be located outwith a hospital setting and which enables those with spina bifida and hydrocephalus to receive medical advice from health professionals based across the United Kingdom; recognises that Scotland has more live births with spina bifida per head of population than anywhere else in the UK, resulting in one pregnancy per week in Scotland being affected by spina bifida and/or hydrocephalus, and notes that taking folic acid supplements at the correct recommended dose could prevent over 75% of those pregnancies from being affected.
