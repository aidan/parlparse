*S3M-5106 Alasdair Allan: Teampull na Trionaid—That the Parliament welcomes efforts by the Teampull na Trionaid Conservation Association to preserve Teampull na Trionaid at Carinish on North Uist; notes that this scheduled ancient monument, which is thought to date originally from 1203, is one of the Western Isles’ most iconic medieval churches and was a seminary and a centre of pilgrimage before falling into disuse by the 1600s; congratulates island residents on their determination to stop further deterioration of the building and to preserve as much as possible of this site, which is integral to island history, and wishes the islanders success in raising the necessary funds to enable rescue work on Teampull na Trionaid to start as soon as possible.
