*S3M-3495.1 Kenneth Gibson: Future of Scotland’s Retained Firefighters—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3495) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from "disappointed" to end and insert "aware that since the May 2007 Scottish Parliament election Lib Dem MSPs have only attended 73% of debates compared to 100% for SNP MSPs, including 97% for backbenchers, 96% for Labour MSPs and 99% for Tory MSPs; notes with concern that since Tavish Scott MSP became party leader the Lib Dem attendance has worsened with only 60% of MSPs recorded as contributing to Members’ Business debates compared to 100% of SNP MSPs, 97% of Labour MSPs and 100% of Tory MSPs; views the non-attendance of Lib Dem MSPs at serious debates including the debate on the fifth anniversary of the Iraq war, violence against immigrant women, three debates on energy and climate change and nine debates on health-related issues, including cancer poverty, heart disease and Parkinson’s Disease, as a blatant disregard for voters and their concerns, and calls on the Liberal Democrats to stop pretending to be interested in the issues important to voters and actually take action, do the work, and speak up in the Parliament when the opportunity arises."
