*S2M-5187 Eleanor Scott: Public Campaign of the Year 2006—That the Parliament warmly congratulates all those who took part in the Sakchai Makao campaign, named Campaign of the Year at the Herald Diageo Politician of the Year Awards 2006, and all those from around Scotland and the world who supported the campaign; hopes that the campaign’s lasting legacy will be to prove that arrests and deportations should not be used to deflect political pressure, and urges the Scottish Executive in future to defend all Scots, whether born here or not, with the determination, compassion and humanity that Shetlanders have shown in defending Sakchai.
