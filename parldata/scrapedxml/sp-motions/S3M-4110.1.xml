 *S3M-4110.1 Iain Smith: New Secondary School for North East Fife—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4110) in the name of Ted Brocklebank, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "welcomes the progress made to date by the Liberal Democrat/SNP administration in Fife to address the grossly inadequate accommodation at Madras College, St Andrews; believes that there is an urgent need to replace the present Madras College school buildings with accommodation that is fit for purpose and designed to provide the best possible educational opportunities and facilities for all secondary pupils in North Fife and St Andrews, and recognises that any replacement accommodation must be based on a robust business case, including accurate and externally audited school roll projections."
