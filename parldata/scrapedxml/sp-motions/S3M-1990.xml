*S3M-1990 Nigel Don: Post Office Card Account and Further Post Office Closures—That the Parliament notes that over 4 million people choose to use the Post Office card account across the United Kingdom, including many in Scotland, and that these transactions earn the Post Office £200 million in income each year; notes that the UK Government will soon announce its decision on which company should operate the successor product to the Post Office card account from 2010; recognises that the Post Office is best placed to provide this service through its unrivalled geographical reach, its status as a trusted brand and its ability to offer customers a seamless transition; believes that the continuation of the Post Office card account as a Post Office product is essential to the future viability of the post office network following the Network Change Programme; understands that a further 350 post offices will be forced to close in an unplanned manner across Scotland if the UK Government does not award the successor product to the Post Office, and urges the UK Government to award the contract to the Post Office.
