*S2M-541.4 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Scotland's Transport-As an amendment to motion (S2M-541) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "and the proposals" to end and insert "; notes with concern the underperformance of the Executive on major transport schemes to date; notes that for the new agency to be successful there must be transparency, accountability and direction for Scotland on all aspects of transport policy whether road, rail, marine or air, and recognises that the new agency should be strategic and should not undermine the role and function of Strathclyde Passenger Transport nor any future statutory regional transport authority elsewhere in Scotland and that the performance of the agency should be monitored to ensure that it delivers improvements to allow Scotland's transport system to match those of its European competitors."
