*S1M-1922.1 Tommy Sheridan: Urban Regeneration—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1922) in the name of Jackie Baillie, insert at end "; believes that the construction of a Glasgow light rail scheme would provide enormous benefits to the city in relation to jobs, improving the environment, tackling congestion and related pollution and regenerating the city as a tourist attraction; calls upon the Scottish Executive to reappraise urgently the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive’s private legislation proposal for a light rail scheme, developed in 1994, with a view to incorporating it into the Neighbourhood Renewal statement, and agrees to allow Glasgow City Council to retain all the business rates raised within its boundaries from 2001-02 onwards.
