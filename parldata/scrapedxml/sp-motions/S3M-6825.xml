*S3M-6825Rob Gibson:Keep Inverness to London Rail Services—That the Parliament notes the publication, A Review of the Intercity Express Programme, by Sir Andrew Foster, in which he suggests that the long distance routes between London and Inverness could stop being served by through trains; believes this to be an unacceptable approach to rail services in the United Kingdom, which could have far reaching effects on travellers forced to change trains unnecessarily, raising serious concern for increased greenhouse gas emission, threatening the promotion of tourism and attacking the quality of life, connectivity and sustainable economy of the Highlands and Islands, and, finally, supports motion S3M-6790 in the name of Brian Adam MSP in calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to reject Sir Andrew Foster’s proposals.
