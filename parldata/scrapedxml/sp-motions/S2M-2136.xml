*S2M-2136 Tommy Sheridan: Verification of the Number of Civilian Deaths in the Iraqi Conflict—That the Parliament notes the open letter sent to the Prime Minister by 46 high-profile individuals representing the army, church and legal establishment, following a study published in The Lancet in October which estimated the number of excess deaths in Iraq since the beginning of the war in March 2003 as 98,000, most of them being women and children; notes that the letter was signed, amongst others, by Lord Garden, former assistant chief of defence staff, retired General Sir Hugh Beech, Sir Stephen Egerton, ex-ambassador to Iraq, Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, Colin Bennetts, Bishop of Coventry and Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford; supports the signatories’ call for an independent inquiry to establish in detail the numbers killed or injured in Iraq, along with the reasons, so that the true extent of the human suffering caused by the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq is publicly documented and recognised by the UK Government, and, in addition, calls on the UK Government to put pressure on the US administration to publish the Pentagon’s records which do document the number of civilian deaths in the conflict. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Carolyn Leckie*, Rosie Kane*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Colin Fox*
