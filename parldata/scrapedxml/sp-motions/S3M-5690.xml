*S3M-5690 Marlyn Glen: Diana and Actaeon Come to the Newly Restored McManus, Dundee’s Art Gallery and Museum—That the Parliament congratulates those involved in bringing the £50 million Titian masterpiece, Diana and Actaeon, to Dundee; recognises that Diana and Actaeon has been seen by thousands of people in London and Edinburgh in the past year and that there has been a vigorous campaign to ensure that it receives the widest possible audience; notes that this announcement comes on the first anniversary of its acquisition by the National Galleries of Scotland and the National Gallery in London and celebrates the partnership between these British cultural institutions; further notes that this prestigious national acquisition will be hosted in the newly restored McManus, Dundee’s Art Gallery and Museum, following its exhibition in Aberdeen and Glasgow, and believes that this positive message from the national galleries illustrates Dundee’s status as a growing centre of culture.
