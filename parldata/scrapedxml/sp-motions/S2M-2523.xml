*S2M-2523 Shiona Baird: Developing Better Legal Responses to Rape—That the Parliament welcomes the many activities and events organised as part of the International Women’s Day celebrations in 2005; commends the work over the last 30 years and more by the rape crisis movement in Scotland, which has helped dramatically to change attitudes towards rape and sexual abuse by raising public awareness about how widespread sexual violence is and contributing to changes, such as improvements to the way the health service and the criminal justice system respond; is appalled that, despite the successes that have been achieved, Scotland still has one of the lowest conviction rates for rape in Europe; recognises that two reviews have been established in Scotland, in 2003 and 2004, which intend to develop better legal responses to rape, and urges the Scottish Executive to act promptly on the reviews’ findings in order to improve the criminal justice system for survivors of rape and sexual abuse.
