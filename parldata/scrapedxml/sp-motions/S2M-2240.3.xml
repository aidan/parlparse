*S2M-2240.3 Dennis Canavan: Make Poverty Historyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2240) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "calls for a summit" to end and insert "; therefore welcomes the recent meeting between the Scottish Executive, aid agencies and other interested parties; recognises that more than 200,000 people die of preventable causes every week and that more assistance by the richer countries is needed to tackle global poverty; notes that the Make Poverty History campaign is a timely reminder that the richer countries must take more effective action on debt repayments, trade agreements and aid, which are inextricably linked; demands that, if the poorest countries are to be lifted out of abject poverty, the G8 and the European Union (EU) must require governments of countries in receipt of economic and structural aid to do all in their power to ensure its fair and equitable distribution, and reminds the G8 and EU of their responsibility to ensure that their policies are not ultimately rendered ineffective by the actions of national and international organisations which have prospered under the current unfair international trade, debt and aid conditions."
