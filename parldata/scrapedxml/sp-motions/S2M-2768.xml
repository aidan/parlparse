 S2M-2768# Dr Jean Turner: Royal College of Nursing’s "Wipe it Out" Campaign—That the Parliament commends the Royal College of Nursing’s "Wipe it Out" campaign on MRSA which highlights the need for a range of practical improvements to help reduce rates of healthcare-associated infections; believes that the minimum standards for infection prevention and control outlined in the campaign, including ensuring the supply of sufficient clean uniforms for staff, the universal provision of staff changing and laundry facilities and the availability of 24-hour cleaning teams in all acute hospitals, should be supported in order to help make further progress in dealing with MRSA and other healthcare-associated infections, and recognises the huge amount of work already being carried out across Scotland by the whole healthcare team and that staff need the support of politicians and public to maintain and enhance this vital work. Supported by: Shiona Baird, Brian Adam, Frances Curran*, Eleanor Scott*, Nora Radcliffe*, Patrick Harvie*, Mike Pringle*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Christine Grahame*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Robin Harper*
