*S1M-1932.1# Colin Campbell: Proposed Cuts to The Scottish Regiments—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1932) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "notes with alarm, following the reduction of the Scottish Territorial Army in the Strategic Defence Review, the proposed merger of the historic 51st Highland and 52nd Lowland Brigade Territorials into the 51st Brigade and the proposed relocation of the headquarters of that "super-brigade" to Edinburgh; opposes cuts to Scotland’s six regular infantry regiments; recognises the importance of maintaining strong geographical links at both brigade and regiment level; further recognises the damaging effect any cuts would have on morale, recruitment and the United Kingdom’s ability to fulfil its domestic defence and international peacekeeping and humanitarian relief obligations, and believes Her Majesty’s Government should categorically reject any such proposals."
