S3M-4595 John Wilson: An End to Concessionary Fares Scheme Abuses—That the Parliament notes with concern the abuses of the Scottish Government’s National Concessionary Travel Scheme, which have resulted in Transport Scotland pursuing approximately £100,000 in suspicious claims; further recognises that, in 2008, Transport Scotland claimed back £2 million following investigation into suspicious claims by bus operators; welcomes the zero tolerance approach adopted by Transport Scotland in 2009, which has resulted in several cases being referred to the police for further investigation and possible criminal convictions; worries that the National Concessionary Travel Scheme, which since 2006 has offered free travel to older and disabled people, will be undermined if suspect practices by rogue bus operators continue, but recognises the valuable work of the majority of transport operators who continue to abide by the regulations outlined in the scheme and who have assisted in highlighting incidents of bad practice.
