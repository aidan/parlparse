*S2M-3277 Tommy Sheridan: Support for First Bus Strikers—That the Parliament notes the strike action taken by Transport and General Workers’ Union (TGWU) members employed by First Bus in the Lothians and central Scotland; believes that the bus drivers’ pay and conditions are amongst the lowest in the country; supports the men and women who have reluctantly taken strike action in pursuit of an £8 per hour wage rate and improved pay and conditions; hopes that negotiations between the company and TGWU can be successfully concluded ahead of the next planned stoppages on 24 and 25 September 2005, and believes that it is time that the rate for the job was standardised across the company’s operations in Scotland with improved conditions and a reduction in the average working week spent driving.
