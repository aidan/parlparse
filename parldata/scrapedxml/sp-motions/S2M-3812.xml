*S2M-3812 Carolyn Leckie: Equal Treatment for Local Government Pension Scheme Members—That the Parliament is concerned that local government workers are faced with proposals to diminish their existing pension arrangements; believes that local government workers deserve at least equal treatment with other public sector workers in relation to pensions; is concerned that, despite the fact that the Scottish Executive has responsibility for the Scottish Public Pensions Agency, it has no direct input into the negotiations that will impact on Scottish local government pensions; is further concerned that the Scottish Public Pensions Agency has declared its intention to follow policy established in England and Wales, where the proposals for local government involve the removal of Rule 85, no protection for existing scheme members, a 1% increase in employee contributions and an increase in the age at which benefits can be taken from 50 to 55, and believes that the Executive should exercise its full powers and responsibilities in order to achieve a fair deal and equal treatment for local government pension scheme members and not leave their fate in the hands of negotiations being conducted in England.
