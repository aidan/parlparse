*S1M-1625 Michael Russell: Rights of the Palestinian People—That the Parliament deplores the injustices being visited on the Palestinian people, both collectively and individually; as an example notes the case of Su’ad Ghazal who was arrested at the age of 15, subjected to physical and psychological abuse while in detention, refused education, kept in prison with adults, illegally transferred from and detained outwith the occupied territories and has now, after two years in prison, been sentenced to a further six and a half years detention for an assault on an Israeli settler whilst an Israeli settler found guilty of pistol whipping and kicking to death an 11 year old Palestinian boy was recently punished with only six months community service and a fine, and urges everyone in Scotland to stand up for justice, freedom and self determination wherever they are denied.
