*S2M-815 Bruce Crawford: Tesco Discriminating Against Scots-That the Parliament notes with concern the actions of Tesco plc in discriminating against Scots and the Scottish legal system in the operation of its home phone service in that contracts with customers are governed by English law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts, even though the company's customer service centre is in Inverness; believes that this situation is symptomatic of Scotland's economic problems in that the high quality legal jobs are outwith Scotland while the call centre jobs are located here, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to use what powers it has to enter into discussions with major UK companies to encourage them to take due note of the discrete Scottish market.
