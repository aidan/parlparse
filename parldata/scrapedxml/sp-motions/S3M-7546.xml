*S3M-7546 Liam McArthur: Northern Isles Double Success in Scots Trad Music Awardsâ€”That the Parliament notes the double success for Orkney and Shetland in the MG ALBA Scots Trad Music Awards 2010, with the Orkney Traditional Music Project winning the Community Project of the Year award and the Shetland Folk Festival being chosen as the Event of the Year; believes that the awards reflect the strength and depth of the musical heritage of the Northern Isles, with young islanders taught by schemes such as the Orkney Traditional Music Project reaching high standards, which allow them to perform alongside the best musicians from far and wide at events such as the world-renowned Shetland Folk Festival, and congratulates everyone involved in the Orkney Traditional Music Project and the Shetland Folk Festival for what it considers their well-deserved awards along with all the other award winners and those shortlisted in a very strong competition across all categories.
