*S3M-7970 Claire Baker: Care Home Provision in Fife—That the Parliament expresses concern at Fife Council’s decision to withdraw funding for council-run care homes; considers that the proposals will lead to the closure of all local council-run care homes and notes that they are causing great concern among staff, care home users and their families; notes with surprise that Fife Council appears to have ignored the findings of its own public consultation on the issue, which supported the idea that the council remain a central provider of care in the region, and calls on Fife Council to re-assess its decision.
