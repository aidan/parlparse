*S1M-1971 Hugh Henry: Scotland CAN (Cleaner Air Now)—That the Parliament welcomes the first anniversary of the launch of Scotland CAN, an organisation of over 60 businesses, trade unions, football clubs, medical and children’s charities which supports the campaign to restrict smoking in public places; notes that over half of the businesses in the Scottish leisure industry have no smoking policies in place; further notes that passive smoking is a risk factor in childhood asthma, bronchitis and cot death and that an estimated 30 Scots die each year from lung cancer attributable to passive smoking; acknowledges that the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health Report stated that passive smoking causes lung cancer, increases the risk of heart disease and makes asthma worse; supports premises adopting the Voluntary Charter on smoking in public places; further supports the introduction of the Approved Code of Practice on smoking in the workplace with close monitoring of its effectiveness; believes that, if these measures fail, appropriate legislation should be introduced to protect those who do not wish to be harmed by passive smoking in enclosed or semi-enclosed areas open to members of the public and workplaces, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to highlight the dangers of passive smoking with a public information campaign.
