 *S3M-4027 Kenneth Gibson: Pro-anorexia Websites—That the Parliament is deeply concerned about the proliferation of pro-anorexia websites, which portray anorexia as a glamorous lifestyle choice rather than a potentially fatal psychiatric illness; acknowledges that such sites have been condemned by Beating Eating Disorders, the leading eating disorder charity in the United Kingdom; is aware that these sites share tips on how to accelerate weight loss and disguise fasting from concerned friends and family and advise on how best to induce vomiting and using laxatives; recognises that the appearance of pro-anorexia websites on social networking sites has allowed them to reach a much wider audience, aimed particularly at young women, and that they often pose as a means of support or claim that their intentions are neutral and support recovery while advocating an illness that can lead to infertility, heart disease and even death; understands that many people with anorexia go undiagnosed and up to 20% of those who become seriously ill die prematurely and are at particularly high risk of suicide, and calls on the UK Government to follow the example of the French Government in taking robust action against UK-based websites that actively promote harm and discourage vulnerable people with anorexia from seeking treatment by validating their behaviour, given that not all web portals are prepared to regulate these sites. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Sandra White*, Rob Gibson*, Robin Harper*, Ken Macintosh*, Bill Kidd*, John Wilson*, Elaine Smith*
