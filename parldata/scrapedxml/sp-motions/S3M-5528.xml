 *S3M-5528 Jackson Carlaw: A Medical Centre for Newton Mearnsâ€”That the Parliament notes that Newton Mearns is the largest centre of population in East Renfrewshire, with an age profile, unemployment level and disability rate all higher than the average for the area and that, despite having such a profile, it does not have its own medical facility; considers that this results in clinics having to be held in inappropriate council halls with no waiting rooms and poor parking or even in local supermarkets; further notes that, at its meeting on 11 January 2009, Newton Mearns Community Council unanimously voted for Newton Mearns to be given its own medical centre to bring such piecemeal and unsatisfactory arrangements to an end, and calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the Scottish Government and East Renfrewshire Council to take note of this development and work together to provide the residents of Newton Mearns with the medical facilities that they both require and thoroughly deserve, thereby putting them on an equal footing with other communities throughout East Renfrewshire.
