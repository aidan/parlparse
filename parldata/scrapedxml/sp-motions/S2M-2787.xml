*S2M-2787 Rosie Kane: Removal of the Little Princess—That the Parliament is outraged by the removal of Jugder, Shinee, Evsanna and little Misheel Narantsogt from Liverpool to Mongolia on 5 May 2005; recalls that little Misheel and her family were held in Dungavel Detention Centre in Scotland and were eventually liberated and returned to Liverpool where, in a blaze of publicity, little Misheel was crowned princess of the Liverpool parade; fears that Jugder (Tso) Narantsogt’s life and the lives of his family are now in danger in Mongolia due to his political activities as founder of a branch of the Democratic Union Party; recognises that the Home Office had sufficient evidence, including a front page article from The Mongol News which detailed Jugder’s political background, to mark him out as an individual who is in danger of serious persecution; is gravely concerned for the safety and well-being of the Narantsogt family; questions the fact that such a decision could be made by the Home Office when the Westminster Parliament was dissolved, and therefore wonders who exactly has such powers during this period and how many other families were brutally removed under the cover of election day.
