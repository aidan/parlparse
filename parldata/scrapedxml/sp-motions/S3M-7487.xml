 *S3M-7487 Dr Richard Simpson: Dropping of Antidepressant Prescribing Target—That the Parliament regrets what it considers the precipitate dropping of the target to reduce antidepressant prescribing by 10% without debate or discussion by the Parliament and considers that, while welcoming the new target to improve access to the so-called talking therapies, the Scottish Government has failed to match the NHS in England by training an equivalent to its 3,000 new therapists, a move that it believes could have contributed to at least stabilising if not reducing prescribing.
