 *S3M-7700 Stuart McMillan: Invest Fossil Fuel Levy in Scotland—That the Parliament considers that there is a growing call in Scotland for funds from the Fossil Fuel Levy account, currently over £190 million, to be invested in creating sustainable jobs in Scotland’s green energy industry; notes with concern the admission by the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Chris Huhne MP, and his colleague, Philip Wynn Owen, on 11 January 2011 that bankers’ bonuses could be a feature of a new green investment bank, which it understands is to be established using Scotland’s Fossil Fuel Levy money as part of the initial £1 billion capital investment; acknowledges the investment that has already taken place in the renewable energy industry by the current SNP government, which it considers has led to new jobs and world-leading technology, and therefore urges the UK Government to release Scotland’s Fossil Fuel Levy as a matter of urgency to allow Scotland to further enhance its green reputation.
