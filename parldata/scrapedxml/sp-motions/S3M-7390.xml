*S3M-7390 Jim Hume: Operation Christmas Child—That the Parliament congratulates Samaritan’s Purse for its annual Operation Christmas Child initiative to provide disadvantaged children with Christmas presents; notes that the initiative is now celebrating its 20th anniversary during which over 81 million shoeboxes full of gifts have been delivered to children across the world; further notes that Operation Christmas Child delivered shoeboxes to children in 14 countries last year, including Zimbabwe, Ukraine and Belarus; recognises what it considers to be the dedication and hard work of all the regional coordinators who give their time to collect the generous donations from members of the public; congratulates East Lothian coordinator June Vasey, who has been part of the initiative for 12 years and has physically delivered thousands of shoeboxes to children in that period, and wishes Operation Christmas Child continued success in the future.
