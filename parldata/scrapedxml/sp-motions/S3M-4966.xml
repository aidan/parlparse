 *S3M-4966 Maureen Watt: Aberdeenshire Homecoming Art—That the Parliament applauds the pupils of all 176 schools in Aberdeenshire that took part in producing the Homecoming-inspired artwork that has been on display in the Scottish Parliament during the week beginning 28 September 2009 as part of its tour around various locations; believes that it represents a unique glimpse of what Homecoming means to children throughout Aberdeenshire; further believes that it is an excellent example of the kind of work that the Curriculum for Excellence is intended to encourage, and congratulates Iain Mitchell, Aberdeenshire’s principal visiting art teacher, and all the other professionals involved in the project for making it such a success.
