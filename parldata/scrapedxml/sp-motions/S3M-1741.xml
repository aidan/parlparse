*S3M-1741♦ Roseanna Cunningham: Canine Partners—That the Parliament welcomes the arrival in Scotland of Canine Partners, the Assistance Dog charity that opens doors to independence, based in Milnathort; notes that a trained dog can free a disabled person from total dependence on carers; recognises that this provides much-needed respite and support for family carers, including children; notes the potential for an assistance dog to reduce by a third the number of hours per week required by a disabled person of an approved carer; welcomes the saving that this represents of up to £65,000 over the working life of a dog, and believes that some of this saving could be put towards the Direct Payments scheme.
