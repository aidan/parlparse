*S3M-6710 Jim Tolson: Older Veterans—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Age Scotland and Poppyscotland’s Fact Sheet for Older Veterans, which offers information about the support available for veterans living in Scotland including pensions, benefits, help with accommodation, employment, health, social opportunities and remembrance; notes that the community of ex-service people, their spouses and dependants makes up almost one in five of the population; recognises that veterans’ needs are often multiple and complex, and considers that ex-service personnel have sacrificed so much for their country and should be given the support that they need and deserve.
