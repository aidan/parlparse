*S2M-4360 Linda Fabiani: Strathaven Academy—That the Parliament congratulates the 1,000 plus pupils, past, present and future, of Strathaven Academy who, along with their parents and other residents of Strathaven and Avondale, marched through Strathaven on Saturday 6 May 2006 to show the strength of their view that South Lanarkshire Council’s plan for the replacement of Strathaven Academy, incorporating the decanting of pupils to East Kilbride for more than two years, is unacceptable; notes residents’ concerns about the adverse effects that removing this school from the heart of the community could have educationally, socially and economically, and requests that South Lanarkshire Council urgently considers alternative plans.
