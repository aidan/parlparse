 *S3M-607.1 Murdo Fraser: The Scottish National Party’s Broken Promises—As an amendment to motion (S3M-607) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "regrets" to end and insert "notes the SNP Government’s failure to implement a range of policies that the SNP pledged to take forward in its election manifesto and its document, It’s time to look forward, including reneging on the promise to set out plans to employ 1,000 additional police officers, backtracking on a council tax freeze, failing to implement smaller class sizes in every primary school, shelving the commitment to adopt the Better Regulation Commission’s policy of "one in one out" and not delivering on plans to give £2,000 to first-time house buyers; recognises that the SNP Government is already letting down communities and hardworking families across Scotland, and calls on Scottish ministers to make a statement to the Parliament explaining why they have failed to implement these policy pledges."
