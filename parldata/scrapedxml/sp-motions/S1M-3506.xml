*S1M-3506 Tommy Sheridan: Hairmyres Hospital Ancillary Staff—That the Parliament deplores the low level of wages across the National Health Service in Scotland; supports the action of ancillary staff at Hairmyres Hospital who will be striking to secure £5 per hour, which in itself still constitutes a low wage, and offers its fullest possible solidarity with the striking Hairmyres Hospital workers.
