*S2M-3253.3 Fergus Ewing: Clyde and Hebrides Lifeline Ferry Services—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3253) in the name of Tavish Scott, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications has stated that the tender process which he supports will result in extra cost to the taxpayer and believes that the Scottish Executive’s tender proposals may put employment and pension rights at risk, whilst not resulting in any improvement to ferry services for the Clyde and Hebrides; believes that documents published by the Executive on 12 September 2005 should be considered further but that as they stand the tender proposals are flawed, and calls on the Executive to remit the matter to the Local Government and Transport Committee with a view to the appointment of a task force to give final consideration to the question as to whether tendering is the sole method of satisfying the legal requirements and, insofar as possible, to devise solutions to the flaws contained in the Executive’s current proposals."
