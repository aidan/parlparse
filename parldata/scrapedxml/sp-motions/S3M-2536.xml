*S3M-2536 Liam McArthur: Congratulations to EMEC and OpenHydro on Deployment of Seabed Tidal Machine in Orkney Waters—That the Parliament recognises the critical importance of tackling climate change and the role that maritime renewables can play in helping achieve this goal; welcomes the contribution that the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney has played in the testing and development of wave and tidal energy devices; congratulates EMEC and OpenHydro on the successful deployment of a tidal turbine on the seabed at the Falls of Warness; acknowledges that this deployment was made possible by the development of a unique twin-hulled barge, OpenHydro Installer, which is registered in Kirkwall; believes that this latest success at EMEC enhances the prospects of tidal energy technology making a contribution to meeting our energy needs in the near future, and calls on the Scottish Government to take all steps necessary to ensure that EMEC is able to meet the changing needs of the marine renewables industry and maintain its competitive advantage.
