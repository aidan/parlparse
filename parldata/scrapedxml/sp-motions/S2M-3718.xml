*S2M-3718 Carolyn Leckie: Councils in Crisis—That the Parliament is concerned that COSLA and individual local authorities have declared that the local government finance settlement is insufficient to secure public services, jobs, terms and conditions or to achieve long-overdue settlement of equal pay; notes that Glasgow City Council has already announced cuts in services to vulnerable members of the community and job losses, whilst offering inadequate compensation for years of pay discrimination against women; further notes that Falkirk Council has indicated that it will be facing a shortfall of at least £2 million in the next financial year and has warned about cuts to services, such as emergency home care, even before any payments are made in relation to equal pay; believes that councils up and down the country may well follow suit, leading to disruption as trade unionists rightly mobilise to defend their members and services; believes that in no way should underpaid women be forced to choose between equal pay and the jobs and terms and conditions of their colleagues; affirms the responsibility of government and employers to implement equal pay by making adequate resources available, and believes that the Scottish Executive should convene a meeting, or meetings, between COSLA, individual local authorities and the trade unions to achieve a solution to this brewing crisis with the intention of delivering on equal pay, protecting public services and securing the jobs and terms and conditions of all local authority employees.
