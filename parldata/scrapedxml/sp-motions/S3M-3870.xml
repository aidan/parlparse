*S3M-3870♦ Karen Whitefield: Bookstart Rhymetimes—That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in delivering the Bookstart Rhymetimes programme across Scotland, including North Lanarkshire Council library staff, for the excellent work that they are carrying out in taking music and books to the heart of the parent and child relationship; recognises the significant benefits that this approach can deliver in terms of speech and language development and parent and child bonding; further recognises that research shows that babies and toddlers who are introduced to books at an early stage begin reading sooner and have a better chance at school, and looks forward to the continued success of this programme.
