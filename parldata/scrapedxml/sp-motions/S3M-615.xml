 *S3M-615 Elaine Smith: Still Human, Still Here—That the Parliament congratulates Amnesty International on the launch of its campaign, Still Human, Still Here, which seeks to highlight the plight of asylum seekers who, having reached the end of the asylum process, have no support and are living in destitution; is concerned that many such asylum seekers are unable to return home for various reasons; believes that cutting off support can be counter-productive as it can drive people underground and into the illegal labour market, and therefore believes that a better way must be found to allow asylum seekers in this situation the ability to access healthcare, housing and financial support until such time as they can return home safely or are granted leave to remain in Britain.
