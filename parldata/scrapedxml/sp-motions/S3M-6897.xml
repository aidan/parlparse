*S3M-6897 Patrick Harvie: Buchanan Galleries Expansion Plansâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Buchanan Partnership Ltd not to pursue plans to construct a multistorey car park on top of Buchanan Bus Station; considers that such a development would have diminished the attractiveness of the space for bus users and limited future flexibility and development of bus services; agrees that, regarding the related plan to demolish the popular Glasgow Royal Concert Hall steps and replace them with a new commercial entranceway, there is an intrinsic value to public spaces in our towns and cities that are non-commercialised, where people can be citizens, not consumers, and in this spirit urges Buchanan Partnership Ltd to also reconsider its plan to scrap the steps.
