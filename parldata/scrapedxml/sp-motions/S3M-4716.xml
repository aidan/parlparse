*S3M-4716 Bill Kidd: The Need to Protect Attendance Allowance—That the Parliament notes with concern proposals contained in the UK Government’s Green Paper, Shaping the future of care together, to abolish attendance allowance by integrating it into the care and support system in order to fund future support and care for the elderly in England, and that any changes to the care and support system in England that integrate some disability benefits funding would affect the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland and supports the retention of attendance allowance and disability living allowance as benefits which allow disabled persons to retain financial independence.
