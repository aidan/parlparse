*S3M-5298 Alison McInnes: 10:10—That the Parliament believes that it is vital that Scotland and the United Kingdom demonstrate political leadership in response to the climate crisis, particularly ahead of the United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen (COP15); reaffirms its view that it is vital that COP15 should lead to an international agreement on action that will avert the worst effects of catastrophic climate change; emphasises that action taken now to tackle the climate crisis will cost less than action taken in the future; welcomes the goals of the 10:10 campaign, which calls for a 10% reduction in carbon emissions in 2010; notes that almost 50,000 people, 2,000 businesses, 1,000 schools and colleges and 1,000 other organisations across the UK have already pledged to do their part, and so calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Scottish Government and all other public sector bodies to make it their policy to reduce their carbon emissions by 10% in 2010.
