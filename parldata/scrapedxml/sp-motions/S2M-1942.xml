 *S2M-1942 Eleanor Scott: Solar Panels—That the Parliament commends Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) on completing Scotland’s biggest photovoltaic installation at Sir E Scott School on Harris; recognises the important role that solar energy can play in helping to meet renewable energy targets and reducing climate change emissions, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make greater efforts to ensure that the roofs of all new buildings are used to capture energy from the sun as a matter of course and to increase funding for solar panel installations by local authorities, housing associations and others to provide people currently suffering from fuel poverty with access to free energy from the sun.
