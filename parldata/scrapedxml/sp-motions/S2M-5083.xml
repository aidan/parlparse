*S2M-5083 Alex Johnstone: Adam Smith to Feature on English Banknotes—That the Parliament is pleased to note that the Bank of England is to feature a portrait of 18th century Scottish philosopher, Adam Smith, on its new £20 note; notes that Smith was one of the first to argue the case for a free market economy and that his views are as relevant today as they were during his lifetime; further notes that Smith is the first Scot to be honoured in this way, and welcomes this as an acknowledgement that the United Kingdom as a whole has benefited immensely from a strong political and economic union.
