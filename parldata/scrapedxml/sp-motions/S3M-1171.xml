*S3M-1171 Murdo Fraser: Funding for Training in the Food and Drink Industry—That the Parliament regrets that food and drink industry training schemes have become ineligible for European Social Fund grants following the implementation of the Scottish Government’s Lowlands and Uplands Scotland Operational Programmes 2007-2013; notes that, in the bakery sector alone, it is estimated that this will result in a fall in the number of training places from around 800 to as low as 200 a year; believes that such cutbacks in training activity may jeopardise the industry’s status as one of Scotland’s major sources of employment and export income and provider of many products and services that enhance the quality of life of the Scottish people, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to work with the European Commission to amend the Lowlands and Uplands Scotland Operational Programmes 2007-2013 in order to make food and drink industry training schemes eligible for European funding once again.
