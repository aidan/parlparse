*S3M-7441♦ Jamie McGrigor: 2012, 400th Anniversary of the Birth of the First Marquis of Montrose—That the Parliament notes that 2012 is the 400th anniversary of the birth of James Graham, fifth Earl and first Marquis of Montrose; notes that he is considered significant in Scottish history as one of the country’s finest battlefield commanders; recognises also his importance as a political philosopher whose works are still considered relevant in the 21st century; acknowledges his membership of the first Scottish Parliament and his membership of the ruling Committee of Estates; remembers that, on 21 May 1950, a service was held in St Giles’ Cathedral in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of his death, and would welcome another service of commemoration in 2012 to mark the 400th anniversary of his birth, thus highlighting the importance of Montrose’s place in Scottish history and the importance of that period of Scottish history to present generations and providing a link between the old Scottish Parliament and the new.
