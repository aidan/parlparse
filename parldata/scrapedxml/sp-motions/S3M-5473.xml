 *S3M-5473 Joe FitzPatrick: Legal Action against Members of the Public Clearing Pavementsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the calls by Dundee City Council for residents to help during the cold weather by gritting pavements; condemns the scaremongering from some quarters regarding the possibility of people clearing paths facing legal action; notes the comments of Ronald Conway, a senior partner with Bonnar &amp; Co, personal injury solicitors, that he had never known of a case of someone being taken to court in Scotland accused of causing injury by failing to properly clear a frozen public path; further notes the comments of Gordon McBean, a partner at Thorntons in Dundee who specialises in personal injury law, who said that he believed that a court would be reluctant to convict anyone seen to be acting in the interests of public safety, and calls on residents in Dundee and across Scotland to help keep paths clear and to look out for neighbours, particularly older people, during the current spell of bad weather.
