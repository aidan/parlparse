 *S2M-4023 Robin Harper: International Self Harm Awareness Day—That the Parliament recognises the work being done by health care professionals, social services, child protection services, the voluntary sector, LifeSIGNS, the National Self Harm Network, Samaritans, Childline and the "See me" campaign to combat the seriously high numbers of people who self harm every year; views with utmost concern the latest figures that indicate that one-in-10 people self harm, this figure being based only on the numbers who admit to causing themselves harm; calls on the Scottish Executive and all concerned organisations to recognise 1 March 2006 as self harm awareness day; calls for full support for all organisations in their efforts to address what is a very serious problem, and congratulates the Scottish Executive for the support it is presently giving to the "See me" campaign.
