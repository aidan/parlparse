*S3M-7907 Peter Peacock: The Future of the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music—That the Parliament notes with concern the potential removal of funding by Highland Council from the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music based at Plockton High School; considers that this national centre of excellence is widely acclaimed to be an outstanding success, offering opportunities to talented young traditional musicians to develop their skills and potential while following a normal school curriculum; notes the success of the centre and of many former pupils who it considers are making a significant contribution to the traditional music scene in Scotland and the success of a number of individual pupils who have won acclamation as young musicians of the year; further understands that Highland Council previously received a specific addition to its grant aid to provide this centre and that additional funding was rolled into its annual grant when ring-fenced funding ended; urges Highland Council to reconsider any action that would threaten the future of the national centre and further recruitment of young people with particular potential in the field of traditional music, and expresses a strong desire to see the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music continue what is seen as its outstanding work in making a major contribution to enriching this dimension of Scottish cultural life.
