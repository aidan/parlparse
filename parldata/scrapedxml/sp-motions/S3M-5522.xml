 *S3M-5522 Cathy Peattie: Climate Change, the Road from Copenhagenâ€”That the Parliament recognises that, while the outcome of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen (COP15) was disappointing to many, particularly those countries most vulnerable to sea level rises or desertification, the conference was never going to be more than a step on the road to building comprehensive and effective global action on climate change; considers that Scotland has a sound basis for future action in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and that this Act has been widely applauded internationally as a yardstick for progressive climate change legislation, and believes that the Scottish Government should proceed, with the least possible delay, to implement and build on the commitments and initiatives of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.
