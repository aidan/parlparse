 *S3M-1687 Robin Harper: St John’s Hospital: Healthy Working Lives Gold Award—That the Parliament congratulates staff at St John’s Hospital in West Lothian for achieving the Healthy Working Lives Gold Award, which recognises highly sustainable working practices; observes that the investment in a "grey water" system at St John’s, similar to that used at Holyrood, has already paid for itself; notes that St John’s also recently retained the prestigious ISO 14001 award for environmental standards, and believes that this kind of work should be an inspiration to others working in the Scottish health service and illustrates how the NHS can be both environmentally and financially responsible.
