*S3M-7223 Robin Harper: Statutory Employment Rights for Cultural Coordinatorsâ€”That the Parliament is concerned that certain local authorities in Scotland are denying culture coordinators their statutory rights to redundancy payments and abrogating other rights under employment law on termination of their contracts; notes that Unison and the Employee Assistance Programme are of the opinion that rights are being denied, and urges the Scottish Government to consult with COSLA as a matter of extreme urgency with a view to resolving this most unfortunate situation.
