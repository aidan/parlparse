*S3M-2163 Johann Lamont: Learning Disability Week—That the Parliament welcomes Learning Disability Week from 16 to 22 June 2008; notes that the theme this year is "Forgotten Citizens", which has as its aim that everyone in Scotland should know about the experiences of their fellow citizens with learning disabilities, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that there is sufficient funding available to make "The Same as You" a reality for people with learning disabilities and their families.
