 *S3M-4003♦ Dave Thompson: Supporting Our Local Newspaper Industry—That the Parliament notes Local Newspaper Week, 11 to 17 May 2009, and recognises the crucial role played by Scotland’s local newspapers in providing a news service to their local communities; particularly notes the work of northern papers including The Inverness Courier, Highland News, North Star, The Northern Scot, Ross-shire Journal and West Highland Free Press, which serve, at times, a scattered and remote population; further notes the benefits to community engagement and the democratic process of the traditional local newspaper industry; acknowledges the increased pressures faced by the local newspaper industry due to falling circulation, loss of advertising revenue and increased competition from internet-based services, and considers that printed newspapers have served for centuries as a source of information on community affairs.
