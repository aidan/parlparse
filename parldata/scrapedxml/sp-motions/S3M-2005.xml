*S3M-2005 Robert Brown: Dog Rental Companies—That the Parliament notes the intention of dog rental company, FlexPetz, to expand to various cities across the United Kingdom, including Glasgow, in 2008; acknowledges that the UK dog rental business is currently very small but recognises the potential for its growth due to the increase in fashion accessory dogs; disapproves of causing distress to dogs as a result of being rented out to numerous people; believes that this encourages irresponsible attitudes to dog ownership; further believes that dog renting is, or should be, a breach of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 in that it is highly likely to inhibit dogs from having the ability to exhibit normal behaviour patterns; disapproves of renting dogs for profit, and calls on the Scottish Government to take action to ensure compliance with the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and to consider the banning of dog rental companies in Scotland.
