*S2M-4990 Rosie Kane: Use of Phosphorous Shells by Israel in Southern Lebanon—That the Parliament utterly condemns the use of phosphorous shells by Israel in its recent campaign against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon; notes that Israel has justified its use of phosphorous shells as not contravening international norms; believes that use of such weapons in civilian areas of southern Lebanon is not in line with international norms and is, in fact, a clear breach of the Geneva Convention, thereby making Israel complicit in war crimes, and calls on the UK Government to use its best efforts to prevent all further supply of weapons and military equipment to Israel.
