*S2M-1446 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Dying from Cancer is No Pleasure-That the Parliament notes with dismay the comments made by Dr John Reid, UK Secretary of State for Health, that "people from those lower socio-economic categories have very few pleasures in life and one of them they regard as smoking"; notes that the people Dr Reid speaks of are those most at risk of dying of smoking-related illnesses; considers these remarks to be ill-judged and dangerous and also that these comments are unhelpful to the Scottish Executive's proclaimed strategy to cut smoking levels among all categories in society, and urges its members to make it clear that the health of those in the lower socio-economic groups is equally as important as those in other socio-economic categories and support speedy legislation to get anti-smoking legislation on the statute book as soon as possible to protect the health of all the people of Scotland.
