 *S3M-3325.1 Michael Russell: Forestryâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-3325) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from "widespread" to end and insert "the consultation on climate change and forestry that has just closed; welcomes the widespread agreement that there must be a significant planting increase to assist the process of combating climate change; is grateful to all those who brought a variety of ideas and views forward, and looks forward to a report to the Parliament on the outcome of the consultation."
