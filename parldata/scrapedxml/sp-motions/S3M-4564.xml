*S3M-4564 Rob Gibson: Forres Academy’s 40 Years of Teaching—That the Parliament congratulates Forres Academy on reaching 40 years of teaching excellence; acknowledges the thousands of pupils from the wider community and outlying villages who have passed through its doors over the last 40 years; notes that the commemorative whisky being produced by the Glen Moray distillery is a fitting tribute in the Year of Homecoming 2009 and is pleased that a percentage of the revenue will go to the school’s Enrichment Fund, and finally notes that events will be taking place throughout the year and wishes Forres Academy every success in its next 40 years.
