*S2M-2478 Mark Ballard: Law Lords Judgement on Detainees at HM Prison Belmarshâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the historic ruling of the Law Lords on 16 December 2004, granting the appeal of nine men detained without charge or trial at HM Prison Belmarsh and elsewhere under Part IV of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001; notes that in order to apply this law Britain has had to derogate from the part of the European Convention on Human Rights that prohibits arbitrary imprisonment; welcomes the decision by the Law Lords that this derogation is unjustifiable; affirms that the rights of people in Scotland would be better safeguarded by legislation which complies, fully and without derogation, with the European Convention on Human Rights, which respects the ancient principle of habeas corpus and the principle of innocent until proven guilty, which ensures that individuals can only be deprived of their liberty as a result of a fair and open trial in a properly constituted court and which avoids implicit or explicit racial discrimination, and expresses the hope that the men who were certificated as "suspected international terrorists" under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 will be afforded respect for their right to liberty and to freedom from persecution and will not be deported in violation of these rights.
