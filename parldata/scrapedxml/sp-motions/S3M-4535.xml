 S3M-4535 Sandra White: International Committee of the Red Cross Report on Gaza—That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) report, which states that, six months after Israel launched its three-week military operation in Gaza on 27 December 2008, Gazans still cannot rebuild their lives, seriously ill patients face difficulty obtaining the treatment that they need, many children suffer from deep psychological problems and civilians whose homes and belongings were destroyed during the conflict are unable to recover, and supports the recommendations of the ICRC, which call for import restrictions to be eased to allow vital infrastructure to be rebuilt, access to essential medical supplies and for action to be taken to rebuild the shattered economy that has led to the alarming level of poverty within Gaza. Supported by: Bill Kidd, Rob Gibson, Alasdair Allan, Bill Wilson, Aileen Campbell, Liam McArthur, Gil Paterson, Hugh O’Donnell, Joe FitzPatrick, Mike Pringle, Shirley-Anne Somerville, Dr Richard Simpson
