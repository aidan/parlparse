 *S2M-595# Tricia Marwick: MMR Vaccine-That the Parliament is concerned that the number of children who have been immunised against measles, mumps and rubella is too low; acknowledges that the weight of current scientific evidence does not establish a link between the MMR vaccination and autism but recognises that many parents are still concerned about the safety of the vaccine, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make the single vaccine available to those parents who request it in order to ensure that the level of immunisation against measles, mumps and rubella is maintained at a level which protects children against these dangerous diseases. Supported by: Shona Robison*, Jim Mather*, Rob Gibson*, Brian Adam*, Murray Tosh*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Campbell Martin*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Tommy Sheridan*, Rosie Kane*, Linda Fabiani*, Bruce Crawford*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Mr Andrew Welsh*, Christine Grahame*
