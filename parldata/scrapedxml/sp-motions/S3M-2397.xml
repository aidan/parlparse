*S3M-2397 Bob Doris: Helping Cambuslang Allotments Forum Grow—That the Parliament commends the work of the Cambuslang Allotment Forum and the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society; welcomes National Allotment Week as an opportunity to highlight the immense physical and mental health benefits tending allotments can bring; believes that by growing fresh produce people can play an important part in improving the nutrition of Scots and help tackle serious issues such as obesity; supports, in particular, the efforts of the Cambuslang Allotment Forum in its attempt to identify suitable land to deal with the list of local residents currently waiting to secure allotments; calls on South Lanarkshire Council to acknowledge that allotments make a significant contribution to 14 of the 45 National Outcomes as detailed in the Scottish Government’s historic concordat with local authorities and therefore strongly encourages South Lanarkshire Council to work constructively with the forum to ensure suitable sites are located, and calls on all budding green-fingered allotment enthusiasts in Rutherglen and Cambuslang to get in contact with the Cambuslang Allotment Forum to find out how they can help the campaign and hopefully have their own allotments in the future.
