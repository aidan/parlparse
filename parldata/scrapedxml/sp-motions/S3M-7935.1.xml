 *S3M-7935.1 Jackson Carlaw: Scottish Ferry Services—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7935) in the name of Brian Adam, leave out from first "welcomes" to end and insert "believes that the first consideration when examining the future of ferry services in Scotland must be the need to protect the interests of ferry users as opposed to defending existing structures; is concerned that there has been a huge increase in subsidy to Scotland’s state-run ferry operations in recent years, as noted by SNP councillor Roy Pedersen who stated in State Aids and Scottish Ferries: Submission to the European Commission that "In contrast with other state subsidised ferry systems worldwide, Scotland does not compare favourably. Subsidy levels as a proportion [of] operating costs have risen in the case of CalMac from 18% of operating costs in 1991 to 45% in 2007, yet fares and charges remained relatively high and traffic growth is sluggish. For Northlink, the comparable percentages are 22% in 1991 to an astonishing 62% in 2007"; notes the further comments of Councillor Pedersen expressed in evidence to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee’s inquiry, Ferry Services in Scotland, that "There is a lot of scope for the private sector to contribute to ferry services in Scotland. The current tendering system seems almost designed to inhibit the private sector in contributing ... Something more flexible is required for the future"; also notes the view expressed in the cross-party Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee’s 4th Report, 2008 (Session 3): Ferry Services in Scotland that "little new thinking or real innovation has taken place in respect of delivering ferry services in Scotland. In most cases, established practice has prevailed … there has been a lack of clear strategic policy direction and leadership"; notes the examples of Western Ferries and Pentland Ferries that, it considers, provide popular and high-quality ferry services without any public subsidy despite having to compete with subsidised services, and therefore calls for the immediate publication of the Scottish Government’s Scottish Ferries Review coupled with a robust debate about the future funding and structure of ferry services."
