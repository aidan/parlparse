*S2M-145# Elaine Smith: Obesity Amongst the Scottish Population—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the recent study carried out by Dr Andrew Walker of the University of Glasgow, The Cost of Doing Nothing – the economics of obesity in Scotland; recognises that an estimated 21% of adults are now obese and that the annual cost to the NHS of obesity and obesity-related illnesses has been estimated at £171 million; acknowledges the efforts of the Scottish Executive and health care providers in attempting to address this problem, in particular those of Coatbridge Local Healthcare Co-operative whose "Weigh-In Without Women" programme recently received the National Obesity Forum award for excellence in weight management, and considers that such examples of best practice could be rolled out across the country as part of a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to tackling this problem.
