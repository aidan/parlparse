*S2M-4119 Colin Fox: Lothian Buses Fares Increases—That the Parliament expresses its deep disappointment at the decision by Lothian Buses to increase its fares by up to 25%; believes that the increases will act as a further disincentive to people to use public transport in the region at a time when the city faces significant congestion problems and car exhaust emissions; notes that the company blames the rise on the fuel prices over the past year, yet in recent months these costs have in fact been falling; calls on Lothian Buses to reconsider its decision and recognise that the costs of short bus journeys in the city of Edinburgh are now among the most expensive in Scotland, and believes that Lothian Buses’ decision is both economically short-sighted and detrimental to strategies for encouraging greater public transport and countering environmental pollution.
