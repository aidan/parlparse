 * S2M-2695 Mr Mark Ruskell:Tesco’s Profits—That the Parliament notes the £2 billion profit reported by Tesco; further notes that the average farm income is only £11,500; is concerned by reports from the National Farmers Union in Scotland that farmers receive just 17 pence a litre for milk that costs 19 pence a litre to produce; condemns the supermarket practice of paying farmers below the costs of production for milk and other produce; is further concerned by recent news that Kettle Produce Ltd, a food supplier of Tesco, is facing job losses in north-east Fife as a result of being squeezed by multinational companies in the retailing industry; notes new research by ActionAid that exposes the appalling working conditions of thousands of women workers in South Africa, casual labourers who grow fruit for Tesco, who are exposed to pesticides without protective clothing and receive poverty wages equivalent to a paltry £32.50 for two weeks’ work, which barely gives them enough money to feed their families; further condemns Tesco for its predatory behaviour and exploitative practices; notes the failure of the Office of Fair Trading to effectively regulate the increasing power of large supermarkets, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use its influence to ensure that the Supermarket Code of Practice provides effective protection for those in Scotland and abroad who produce our food. Supported by: Mark Ballard*, Patrick Harvie*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Shiona Baird*, Eleanor Scott*, Richard Lochhead*, Rob Gibson*, Chris Ballance*, Rosie Kane*
