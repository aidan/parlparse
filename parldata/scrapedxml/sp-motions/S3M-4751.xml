*S3M-4751 Joe FitzPatrick: Dundee United FC Centenary—That the Parliament congratulates Dundee United Football Club on its 100th anniversary; notes that United played its first game on 18 August 1909 as Dundee Hibernian in a game that resulted in a 1-1 draw with Hibernian; notes that in 1910 Dundee United joined the Scottish football league and went on to win all of Scotland’s major football honours, winning the league cup in 1979-80 and 1980-81, the league in 1982-83 and the Scottish Cup in 1993-94; further notes that united was the first Scottish side to reach the final of the UEFA Cup in 1987 where, although they were narrowly beaten by IFK Gothenburg, FIFA awarded its first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans at Tannadice Park; acknowledges the contribution that Dundee United has made to International football, hosting International players from three continents and producing some of Scotland’s greats, including Dave Narey who famously put Scotland ahead against Brazil in the 1982 World Cup with a"toe poke", and wishes all the players, staff and fans good luck for their centenary year.
