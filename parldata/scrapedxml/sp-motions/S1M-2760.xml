 *S1M-2760# Shona Robison: Dundee City Council Budgetâ€”That the Parliament notes that Dundee City Council on a motion supported by the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Councillors set a budget which includes the closure of a library and a neighbourhood centre and the reduction of funding to an anti-poverty information centre, all of which are located in or serve areas covered by social inclusion partnerships; further notes that the SNP Group presented a budget which, for a pound a year extra per Band D household, would have preserved all of the services noted above and would also have resulted in the delay of a steep increase in the price of school meals, and concludes that the unionist parties in Dundee will go any length, including attacking the very poorest in society, in order to preserve power in the Council chamber.
