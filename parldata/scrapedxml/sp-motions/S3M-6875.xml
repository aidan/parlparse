*S3M-6875 Elaine Smith: NHS Lanarkshire is UK Pioneer for New Osteoporosis Service—That the Parliament congratulates NHS Lanarkshire on being the first NHS board in Scotland to offer a new service for osteoporosis across both primary and secondary care; recognises that osteoporosis is a devastating condition affecting many more women than men and causing a high risk of fractures in the elderly; understands that bisphosphonates are types of drugs that make bones stronger, prevent breaks and relieve bone pain; notes that the Lanarkshire Intravenous Bisphosphonate Service will transform the way that this type of medication is delivered to the people who need it most; further notes that the drug will be administered by a nurse as a once yearly intravenous infusion; considers that this innovative approach, promoted by Dr Eamonn Brankin, will mean that those who were unable to benefit from the existing treatment of a weekly tablet due to other medical conditions, health issues, or an inability to comply with the requirement to remain upright for a couple of hours after taking the tablet will now be able to benefit from this medication, and welcomes the fact that NHS Lanarkshire have recognised the worth in spending on this new service to save money in the longer term and, most importantly, to save lives.
