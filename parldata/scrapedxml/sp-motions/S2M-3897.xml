*S2M-3897 Mr Mark Ruskell: UK Government Report - Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change—That the Parliament notes the report, Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, published by the UK Government Meteorological Office and endorsed by the Prime Minister;notes that this report updates the science of climate change since the Third Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was published in 2001; notes with grave concern the report’s findings that melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and shutting down of the Atlantic Gulf Stream may be triggered by temperature rises within the 1.6 to 5.8C range which are predicted for the next century; further notes the Prime Minister’s foreword which states, “It is clear from the work presented that the risks of climate change may well be greater than we thought. It is now plain that the emission of greenhouse gases, associated with industrialisation and economic growth from a world population that has increased six-fold in 200 years, is causing global warming at a rate that is unsustainable”, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the review of its Climate Change Programme is further strengthened, given the seriousness of these findings, and that it brings forward a programme that will reduce Scotland’s carbon dioxide emissions year-on-year in line with a national target of 60% reductions by 2050.
