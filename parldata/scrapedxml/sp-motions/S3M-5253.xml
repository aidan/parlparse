*S3M-5253 Karen Whitefield: Lighting up Centenary Park in Airdrie—That the Parliament notes that, on Thursday 12 November 2009, the viaduct illuminations at Centenary Park in Airdrie were switched on for the first time; notes that the Viaduct Illumination Project has been funded by the People’s Millions Fund, securing a £58,750 grant from the Big Lottery Fund after receiving the votes of thousands of STV viewers in a contest with other worthy causes for the public vote; recognises the hard work and commitment of local volunteers and the valuable support of North Lanarkshire Council in making this impressive project a reality; recognises that the lighting up of Centenary Park will ensure that the viaduct is an important landmark night and day, making the park more accessible and enjoyable for the local community and visitors; welcomes the involvement of local schoolchildren in designing images for the lights, and believes that the lighting up of Centenary Park is a positive and welcome development for Airdrie and the surrounding area. Supported by: Patricia Ferguson*, Trish Godman*, Pauline McNeill*, Jackie Baillie*
