*S3M-6435 Jim Hume: Protecting Vital GP Dispensing Practicesâ€”That the Parliament recognises the important role of dispensing GP practices in remote and rural communities across the South of Scotland; acknowledges the high level of patient satisfaction with these practices; is concerned about the threat posed by unrestricted commercial pharmacy applications to the sustainability of health services provided by dispensing GP practices; is aware of the current consultation on the control of entry arrangements relating to NHS pharmaceutical services; supports the implementation of new improved regulations in which a first stage or pre-application process is used to eliminate speculative applications, repeat applications where no significant change in circumstances has occurred and substantially inaccurate applications, and further supports the provision of local, holistic health services whereby health care professionals work together to plan and deliver more flexible services.
