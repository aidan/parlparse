*S3M-4316 Robin Harper: UN World Ocean Day—That the Parliament celebrates the first official UN World Ocean Day on 8 June 2009; congratulates the film, The End of the Line, based on the novel by Charles Clover, as the first major feature documentary film revealing the impact of overfishing on the world’s oceans; notes with concern the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s estimation that 11 of the world’s 15 major fishing areas are in decline and in need of urgent management and that around half the world’s fish stocks are fully exploited, while another quarter are either over-exploited, depleted or recovering from depletion; expresses specific condemnation that two-thirds of Europe’s fish stocks are estimated to be over-exploited; acknowledges that there has been a five-fold increase in the number of fish taken out of the oceans over the last 50 years; accepts that such levels of fishing are unsustainable and that, without drastic changes in fishing practices and trends, by 2048 all of the world’s fishing stocks could be fully exploited, resulting in mass starvation and ecological devastation, and accepts that there is no room for further expansion of the sea fishing industry.
