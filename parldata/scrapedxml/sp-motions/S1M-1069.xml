*S1M-1069 Fergus Ewing: Criminal Injuries Compensation—That the Parliament believes that it is manifestly unjust that victims of sexual abuse are denied compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board scheme purely because that abuse occurred before 1979 and the abuse was committed by a member of the victim’s family; believes that this distinction is arbitrary and that those victims of such sexual abuse, including Susan Stuart and Jake Strachan, should receive fair compensation, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government for the award of such compensation to be made on an ex-gratia basis.
