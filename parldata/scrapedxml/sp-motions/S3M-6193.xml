* S3M-6193 Stewart Maxwell: Robert Tannahill Bicentenary—That the Parliament marks the bicentenary of the death of Paisley poet Robert Tannahill (3 June 1774 – 17 May 1810); acknowledges that much of his work was inspired by his walks around Paisley including his most famous works, Thou Bonnie Wood o’ Craigielea and The Braes o’ Gleniffer; wishes every success to the Robert Tannahill Bicentenary Concert that stars the Tannahill Weavers and is scheduled to take place on 21 May 2010, exactly 200 years after Tannahill’s burial at Castlehead Church, Canal Street, Paisley, and hopes that the anniversary will lead to greater awareness of his work in Paisley, Scotland and beyond.
