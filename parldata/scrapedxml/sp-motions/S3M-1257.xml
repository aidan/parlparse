*S3M-1257 Bob Doris: Concern Over Glasgow Housing Association Rent Increase—That the Parliament notes with concern that Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) has agreed a 5.2% increase in rent; observes that this increase, the maximum allowable, was pushed through on the casting vote of the tenant chair against the wishes of 60% of tenants, while the rent on GHA properties remains significantly higher than that charged by other registered social landlords; recognises that many tenants remain in unmodernised properties with the threat of demolition hanging over their heads; further notes that this increase comes at a time when public sector pay increases are running at a low level and that the increase is likely to contribute further to financial hardship, and calls on the GHA board to consult further with tenants with a view to reconsidering its decision.
