*S3M-1414 Christine Grahame: Think Differently About Autism - I Exist—That the Parliament agrees that all adults with autism should be supported to achieve their potential, including those with Asperger syndrome; recognises that too many adults with autism are isolated and ignored, struggle to access the support that they need and are heavily dependent on their families; congratulates the National Autistic Society - Scotland for highlighting these issues in its campaign, "Think Differently About Autism - I Exist"; believes that recording the number of adults with autism nationally and locally would help to improve the planning and delivery of appropriate services; further believes that the barriers which prevent adults with autism from accessing services can be overcome; asserts that social support and person-centred services for adults with autism are required, and urges the Scottish Government to expand its expertise and leadership on autism and work with local authorities and NHS boards to put in place changes that will transform the lives of adults with autism.
