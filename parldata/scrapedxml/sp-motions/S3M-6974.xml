*S3M-6974 Elaine Murray: European Shark Weekâ€”That the Parliament notes that 9 to 17 October 2010 has been designated as European Shark Week by the Shark Alliance; notes that during European Shark Week 2009 over 300 activities were held in 15 countries, including the United Kingdom, promoting education about sharks and shark conservation; understands that shark species are seriously threatened by human activity and that European sharks are at greater risk of extinction than sharks in many other parts of the world, and encourages Members of the European Parliament to support regulations to strengthen the EU finning ban and to close the existing loopholes that it believes are contained in that legislation.
