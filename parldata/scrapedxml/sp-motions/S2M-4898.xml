*S2M-4898 Margaret Jamieson: Retailing Recognition for Kilmarnock and Loudoun—That the Parliament congratulates the shopkeepers of Kilmarnock for working hard to achieve national recognition for the excellent service they provide, resulting in Kilmarnock being voted the friendliest shopping town in the United Kingdom, and wishes success to Keystore, Stewarton, which has managed to beat off competition from hundreds of local shops from throughout the west of Scotland to reach the regional finals of Robert Wiseman Dairies’ Neighbourhood Shop of the Year 2006.
