*S3M-4583 Christina McKelvie: Congratulations to Team Lanarkshire—That the Parliament congratulates Team Lanarkshire, Scotland’s only representatives at the International Children’s Games in Athens, on its magnificent tally of one gold, two silver and four bronze medals; notes that the girls’ 4 x 100 metre relay team stormed home to win gold; further notes that the silver medal-winning boys’ football team only narrowly missed out on gold following a penalty shoot-out; further notes that East Kilbride athlete Rachel Whittle not only contributed to the gold medal relay performance but also took silver in the individual 100 metres and bronze in the high jump, and believes that Rachel’s achievements along with those of Emma Brown and Ciaran Johnston from East Kilbride, Mhairi Hendry from Hamilton, Arlene Barr from Cambuslang, Darren Brownlie from Bellshill, Dean McLean from Carluke, Craig Moore from Uddingston, Jack Smith from Carfin, Anthony Brady from Glenboig, Ross Burnett and Calum Baxter from Airdrie, Euan Alston, Lynn Macarthur and Leanna Marshall from Cumbernauld, Jonathan Stuart from Blantyre, Rochelle Callan from Coatbridge, Emily Lauder from Bargeddie and Charlotte Walker from Bothwell reflect highly on the quality of Scotland’s young athletes and bode well for the success of the 2011 International Children’s Games when it takes place in their home county of Lanarkshire.
