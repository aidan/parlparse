*S3M-3471 Aileen Campbell: UK Government Conspired to Prevent Scotland Claiming North Sea Oil—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent uncovering of documents that reveal the Labour Government’s proposals in the 1970s to prevent Scotland laying claim to North Sea oil in the event of independence; further notes that UK Government Treasury officials proposed the redrawing of the boundaries of Scotland’s coastal waters, inventing and sustaining spurious independence campaigns for the Shetland and Orkney Islands and ultimately delaying devolution for Scotland; highlights the successive attempts that have been undertaken by UK governments to curtail the independence movement and restrict the people of Scotland from achieving their rightful claim to North Sea oil; further notes the comments from Murdo Fraser MSP about it only being "political anoraks" who would be interested in the contents of 30-year-old documents and considers these comments ironic given the number of motions submitted by the member to highlight historical issues such as the Lübeck letter, Bannockburn Battlefield and the Black Watch Heritage Appeal, and believes that Scotland is held back much more by representatives wearing political blindfolds than it is by said "political anoraks".
