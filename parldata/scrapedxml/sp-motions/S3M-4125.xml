*S3M-4125 Stuart McMillan: Help for Inverclyde Veterans—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Poppyscotland and SAMH to pilot their initiative to offer specialist support to veterans suffering problems due to alcohol misuse in Inverclyde; notes that the pilot scheme is going ahead in Inverclyde due to its large veteran population, estimated to be over 300; further notes that the service will be run from SAMH’s Greenock office and will include staff from the local authority as well as organisations working with ex-service personnel and other existing services; also congratulates the Scottish Government on its work in leading the way in support for veterans in Scotland by supporting such schemes, and recognises that the meeting held between ministers, the First Minister and the heads of the army, navy and RAF to discuss social issues for military personnel and veterans is significant for the future of our hard-working service personnel.
