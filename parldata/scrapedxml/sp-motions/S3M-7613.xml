*S3M-7613 Murdo Fraser: Perth City Status 2012—That the Parliament notes that 2012 will mark Her Majesty the Queen’s diamond jubilee; understands that, as part of the celebrations to mark this, there will be a United Kingdom-wide competition to bestow city status on one settlement and that the closing date for applications is set for 27 May 2011; notes that, although considered to be a historic city, Perth does not share legal city status on a par with Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling; understands that Perth’s general public, businesses and civic society all strongly support official city status and believes that it would boost Perth’s national standing and the local economy; considers that official city status would reflect Perth as being one of Scotland’s leading places for business, education, art, culture and sport, and supports Perth’s bid to become a city during Her Majesty the Queen’s diamond jubilee.
