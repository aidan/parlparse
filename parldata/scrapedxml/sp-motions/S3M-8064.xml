 *S3M-8064 Sandra White: 21st Century Universities—That the Parliament notes the submission to the Scottish Government’s consultation on higher education by a number of academics expressing concern over the way in which universities are currently run and managed and calling for the influence of senior management to be reduced; further considers that the submission suggests that the powers of the university court and senate have been eroded by the emergence of executive management groups within which strategic decisions are made in the absence of widespread consultation; believes that this erosion is evidenced by the current lack of transparency and openness surrounding the University of Glasgow’s proposed cuts to a number of its courses; considers that Scotland’s universities must take action to ensure that they adhere to modern democratic levels of openness, transparency and inclusion, and calls on the universities themselves to take the lead in effecting these changes.
