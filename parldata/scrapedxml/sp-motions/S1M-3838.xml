*S1M-3838 Tommy Sheridan: Mail Services in the Parliament-That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Mail on the excellent service that it has provided to the Parliament over the last four years; expresses concern that the contract has been put out to tender and could be lost to cost-cutting anti-trade union firms that do not share a public sector ethos, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to cancel this unnecessary competitive process and re-award the contract to the Royal Mail.
