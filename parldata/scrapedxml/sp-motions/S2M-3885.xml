*S2M-3885# Nora Radcliffe: Ellon Moves Towards Fairtrade Town Status—That the Parliament congratulates the Ellon Fairtrade Town steering group on the progress it is making towards meeting the criteria, assessed by the Fairtrade Foundation, which will allow Ellon to achieve Fairtrade Town status; notes that the criteria include generating popular support and media attention, securing the support of the local council and having fairly traded goods available in local shops and being used in local food outlets and workplaces; commends those already participating and contributing, and looks forward to a successful conclusion which will recognise a community working well together but, more importantly, being aware of and helping many other communities across the world who benefit from being able to sell their goods in a fair marketplace.
