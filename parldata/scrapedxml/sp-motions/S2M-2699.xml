 * S2M-2699 Donald Gorrie:Homeless World Cup—That the Parliament notes that the Homeless World Cup 2005 is being played in Edinburgh this summer from 20 to 24 July; welcomes the participating teams to Scotland’s capital city; hopes that as many spectators as possible will turn out to support the teams and the event; further hopes that the Scottish team in particular will be able to find some success on the field but that all teams will play with the goodwill and good wishes of the people of Scotland; notes that many of the players involved in the previous two tournaments in 2003 and 2004 have used their experience in the event to go on to find homes, jobs and training, and hopes that as many as possible of the players involved in this year’s event will be ineligible to play in the event next summer.
