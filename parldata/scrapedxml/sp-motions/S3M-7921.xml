 *S3M-7921 Jamie McGrigor: Oban Becomes a University Town—That the Parliament welcomes the news that Oban has officially become a university town for the first time following the confirmation that the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) Millennium Institute has gained university status; believes that the town’s Argyll College Oban campus and the Scottish Association for Marine Science Scottish Marine Institute are key parts of the UHI infrastructure and offer a very high quality of education to students, with excellent staff and a diverse range of courses; further believes that university status will boost the academic standing of the UHI and attract more students from across Scotland and further afield, and wishes all current and future students and staff in Oban and all other parts of the UHI network every success in the future.
