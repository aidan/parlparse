S2M-3449 Karen Whitefield: Scottish Gas Energy Trust—That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of the Scottish Gas Energy Trust, which was created by Scottish Gas but is governed by an independent board of voluntary trustees; notes that it provides financial assistance to Scottish Gas customers who can apply for help with energy bill arrears and other essential household bills in order for finances to be managed more effectively once the debt has been resolved, and also makes organisational grants to support debt advice in Scotland; recognises that over-indebtedness is often caused by unplanned events such as job loss, relationship breakdown or illness which can plunge individuals and families into financial hardship, and believes that this kind of initiative is one part of the solution to addressing the problem of fuel poverty in Scotland.
