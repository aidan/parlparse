 *S2M-4586 Richard Lochhead: 1986 International Whaling Commission Moratorium on Commercial Whaling—That the Parliament condemns the recent vote by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in favour of a return to commercial whaling; notes that although the vote will have no practical impact, as it lacks the required majority, it sends out the wrong message; regrets the decision taken by the IWC, and supports the continuation of the 1986 IWC moratorium on commercial whaling.
