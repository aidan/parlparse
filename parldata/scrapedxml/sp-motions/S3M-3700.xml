*S3M-3700 Maureen Watt: Operation Lochnagarâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Grampian Police on the success of Operation Lochnagar in targeting and arresting street-level drug dealers in Aberdeen; notes that the operation is of exceptional scale and has resulted in numerous arrests over the last two weeks; commends the continued work of Grampian Police to make communities safer by going after those individuals who blight their neighbourhoods with drugs, and hopes, through the provision of a more visible police presence on the streets of Aberdeen, that members of the public will continue to help the police in identifying those involved in this evil and illegal activity.
