*S2M-12 Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire Council Secondary School Public Private Partnership Proposal and Hamilton—That the Parliament shares the concerns of parents and pupils in Hamilton regarding the public private partnership secondary school proposal of South Lanarkshire Council which, if implemented, will mean the closure of Earnock High School; notes that local residents feel so strongly with regard to the closure of this school that they have elected two independent "save our schools" councillors to the council; further notes the concern of parents in Hamilton that the council's consultation process is inadequate, and calls on the council and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, in consideration of the local community's deep-felt anxiety on this issue, to reconsider this deeply flawed proposal.
