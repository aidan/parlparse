*S3M-4150# Liam McArthur: Electronic Indentification of Sheep—That the Parliament notes with concern that the EU Council of Ministers has voted to press ahead with the introduction of compulsory electronic identification (EID) of sheep across the European Union; recognises that this decision was taken despite outright opposition from some member states and growing unease among others about the cost and practicalities of such a scheme; doubts that a system of EID can be found that is workable on most of Scotland’s sheep farms, particularly those in the Highlands and Islands; further notes that £3 million has been committed to a large-scale pilot to try to find a workable and cost-effective solution, and believes that the European Commission has much to learn from observing the pilot and, should a solution not be identified, that a derogation from a compulsory EID scheme would be in the best interests of Scotland’s sheep farmers. Supported by: Jeremy Purvis*, Jamie Stone*, Ted Brocklebank*
