*S3M-3196 Jackson Carlaw: Hospital Parking Charges—That the Parliament notes the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing’s claim to have abolished hospital parking charges, in particular the assertion that they have "no place in a National Health Service" and that "abolishing charges eases the financial burden at a difficult time"; believes that, despite this claim, some NHS boards are already hatching plans to introduce an alternative car parking charge such as that to be implemented at Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital, where car park users are to be restricted to a four-hour stay and thereafter subject to a £40 fine and potential criminal conviction, with what seems a distressing and cumbersome procedure being the only means of redress; further believes that such a scheme is incompatible with the Scottish Government’s claim to have abolished hospital parking charges and is especially prejudicial to staff, and therefore calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to make clear to all NHS boards across Scotland that alternative plans to impose charges on those with legitimate reasons to be parked in publicly-owned NHS car parks must be abandoned.
