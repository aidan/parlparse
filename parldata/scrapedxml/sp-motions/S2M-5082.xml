*S2M-5082 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Congratulations to the Lost Children Campaign—That the Parliament notes that it is 30 years since three-year-old Sandy Davidson disappeared from his home in Bourtreehill, Irvine; notes that it is estimated that a child disappears in the United Kingdom every five minutes, equating to approximately 100,000 children every year and that, according to campaign groups, speed is critical in locating missing children; congratulates Sandy’s sister, Donna Davidson, on the launch of her nationwide campaign to help track down the thousands of children who disappear every year in this country; notes that the campaign will involve displaying posters of missing children on 450 vans across the country, and calls on local authorities across the country to aid this campaign in every way possible.
