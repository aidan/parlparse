*S1M-3529 Mr Gil Paterson: Business Bulletinâ€”That the Parliament believes that, for the purpose of good time management and the ability to keep members fully informed in a cost-effective manner, the Business Bulletin that is published each Monday should be restored to its former effective condition by containing all live motions with a full list of members who have supported each motion.
