*S3M-4049 John Park: Betfred, Stop the Cuts—That the Parliament notes Betfred’s staff notification to remove overtime premium pay for Sundays, bank holidays and general overtime; considers that the poor compensation package will leave staff out of pocket in year one and all remaining years; also notes that in the year to March 2008 Betfred’s operating profits for the group improved by 22.7% to £13.2 million, its recent acquisition of a further 23 betting shops and its recent multi-million sponsorship of the World Snooker Championship; believes that wider economic challenges should not be a pretext or excuse to cut terms and conditions, especially in industries where profit continues to be made; understands that Betfred is issuing termination of contracts notification to those not accepting the compensation package; commends the work of Community: The Union for Life in its work to stand up for betting shop workers, and calls on Betfred to rethink its proposals, engage in meaningful consultation with its staff and their union representatives and refrain from cuts to terms and conditions.
