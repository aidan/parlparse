 *S3M-2066 Aileen Campbell: 2008 G8 Summit in Japan—That the Parliament notes that this year’s G8 summit will take place in Hokkaido, Japan from 7 to 9 July 2008; further notes reports from various NGOs that progress toward meeting aid and development goals set at the 2005 Gleneagles summit has been painfully slow and that world economic circumstances and budget pressures may see reduction in rich countries’ overseas assistance budgets; believes that there is both an economic and moral imperative on rich countries to work for poverty eradication and global economic justice; further believes that G8 decisions must be adhered to by member countries or else the forum risks losing international credibility, and calls on voters in the G8 nations, and the world community through the United Nations, to hold G8 governments accountable for pledges made at their summit meetings.
