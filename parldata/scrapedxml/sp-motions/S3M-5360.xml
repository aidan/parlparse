*S3M-5360 Ian McKee: Berlusconi Ignores Political Reality in Belarusâ€”That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the remarks of the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, during an official visit to Belarus on 30 November 2009 during which he stated that President Alyaksandr Lukashenka was loved by his own people, as outlined by his clear successive electoral victories; believes that such statements contradict reality in a country branded the last dictatorship in Europe; notes that the political situation in Belarus has been condemned by the European Union for its poor record on human rights and respect for minorities, lack of freedom of the press and for failing to organise transparent elections; further notes that Silvio Berlusconi is the first EU leader in over a decade to visit Belarus, and believes that the Italian leader has failed to promote EU values of democracy, liberty and freedom in a country suppressed by dictatorship.
