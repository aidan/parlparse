 *S3M-3143 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Evictions by Social Landlords in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the December 2008 report from Shelter, Evictions by Social Landlords in Scotland; notes with alarm that social landlords, both councils and housing associations, took legal action, which resulted in 3,573 tenants losing their homes in 2007-08; further notes that almost all of these evictions were for rent arrears; observes that social landlords are twice as likely to obtain a decree of eviction against their tenants than a mortgage lender is for a private homeowner, and urges social landlords and the Scottish Housing Regulator to take action to reduce the number of evictions in line with the general acceptance of the need to avoid mortgage repossessions.
