*S2M-5597 Richard Lochhead: Diageo’s Proposal for New Malt Whisky Distillery in Moray—That the Parliament warmly welcomes Diageo’s announcement that it is investing £100 million to expand its Scotch whisky operations in Scotland; is delighted to note that these plans include a proposal to build a new malt whisky distillery in Roseisle in Moray; recognises that this announcement signals the enormous success of the iconic Scotch whisky industry which is benefiting from expanding overseas markets; appreciates that the prospect of new distilleries opening locally illustrates the growing confidence in Moray’s international reputation as the home of malt whisky distilling, and calls for continuing cross-party support for an industry that makes a huge contribution to the Scottish economy.
