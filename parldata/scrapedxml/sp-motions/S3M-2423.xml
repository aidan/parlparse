*S3M-2423#Ian McKee:Childhood and Sport-Related Injuries—That the Parliament notes with concern the lack of data available in Scotland on childhood and sport-related injuries; understands, however, that Scotland has signed up to the Child Safety Action Plan, part of the European Commission’s public health programme that will provide an opportunity to address child safety; observes that Sweden, with its child injury and surveillance system, has the lowest rates of injury and the highest levels of sports activity in Europe, as well as obesity rates half that of the United Kingdom; notes the partnership between NHS Lothian and the Scottish Rugby Union, and hopes that this and similar initiatives to increase sport participation across deprived communities will include provision for surveillance and monitoring of injuries.
