 *S2M-2070# Alasdair Morgan: Rascarrel Bay Hutters—That the Parliament notes with concern the position within Scots law of hutters in places such as Rascarrel Bay in Galloway, where their legal position as regards tenure allows landowners to impose very large rent increases; notes that the Scottish Executive’s position of encouraging local discussions does not work in practice in situations where one party is not willing to enter into negotiations, and considers that the Executive should re-examine its position with a view to implementing a suitable level of protection in law for hutters in Scotland.
