 *S2M-5034 Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Change - A Moral Issue—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Africa – Up in Smoke?, the second report by the new economics foundation on the impacts of climate change on Africa; congratulates all members of the Working Group on Climate Change and Development, the coalition of environmental, development and faith organisations responsible for the report; is reminded once again of the vulnerability of Africa to climatic variations causing drought, food shortages, desertification, conflict over water resources and increases in disease; notes the cruel paradox of climate change, that the harshest and most damaging impacts are frequently felt by those countries with the lowest carbon emissions, which are also the least able to afford the measures needed to adapt to a rapidly changing climate, and believes therefore that finding a global solution to climate change is a profoundly moral issue and that both the developed and the developing world must be involved in future international initiatives to tackle climate change.
