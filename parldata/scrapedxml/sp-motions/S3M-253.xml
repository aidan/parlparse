*S3M-253 Bashir Ahmad: Importance of Democracy in Palestine—That the Parliament expresses concern at the recent developments that have resulted in the formation of an emergency government in Palestine; expresses further concern at the dissolution of the national security council, believing that these actions will conversely lead to a worsening of the situation in Palestine for the ordinary people, and calls on the UK Government always to support the promotion and preservation of democracy which requires taking due notice of the democratic will of the people.
