 *S3M-7158 Patrick Harvie: Crosshill Post Office—That the Parliament believes that the decision taken by the Post Office to move Crosshill Post Office on Victoria Road, Glasgow, to Cathcart Road, Glasgow, is regrettable, given what it considers to be the excellence of service, ease of access for pedestrians, better transport links and purpose-built building of the existing site; sympathises with those post office employees who are now uncertain of their job security; considers that too many of Scotland’s post offices are being closed down, and calls on the Post Office to take full account of the views of local users of Crosshill Post Office, many of whom, it believes, strongly oppose the proposed move. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*
