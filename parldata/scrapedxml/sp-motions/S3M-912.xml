 *S3M-912 Keith Brown: Employability of Disabled Graduates—That the Parliament commends the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular Article 27 on the right to work and employment on an equal basis; notes that disabled people are three times more likely to be unemployed than non-disabled people; agrees that disabled students and graduates face specific employment issues; further notes that, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, some 7.3% of first degree students in 2005-06 declared a disability and, according to the Scottish Funding Council, some 14% of further education students did so; recognises the efforts of the National Union of Students Scotland’s Disabled Students’ Campaign, including its Decent Work network event scheduled for International Day for Disabled Persons on 3 December 2007, and encourages colleges and universities to do more to include their disabled students and graduates in their career services and provide employability support that is suitable and accessible.
