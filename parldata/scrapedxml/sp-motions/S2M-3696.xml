*S2M-3696 Ms Sandra White: Disability and Income Poverty—That the Parliament notes the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, Monitoring poverty and social exclusion in Scotland 2005, which was released in early December; further notes that the report highlights the fact that “A third of all (both workless and working) working-age disabled adults in Scotland live in income poverty, double the rate for their non-disabled counterparts and higher than the rates for either pensioners or children”, and considers this to be a matter of grave concern and believes that the Scottish Executive should be looking into the causes of this as a matter of urgency.
