*S3M-560 Marlyn Glen: Dispute at Edinburgh’s Telford College—That the Parliament notes with concern the current dispute resulting from Edinburgh’s Telford College enlisting a private agency to contract temporary and fixed-term lecturers, instructors and learning assistants at lower rates of pay than those of permanent staff and without pension rights; considers that introducing a two-tier system of pay and employment rights can only have a negative impact on staff morale and inevitably will affect the standards and quality of education available; believes that such a situation is unacceptable in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to support the introduction of the EU agency workers directive and the introduction of legislation at UK level to establish the principle of pay and conditions for agency workers being equal to those of workers who are permanently employed. Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Bill Butler*, John Park*, Elaine Murray*
