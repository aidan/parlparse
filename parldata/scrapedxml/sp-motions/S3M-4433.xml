*S3M-4433 Alasdair Allan: Uist Defence Jobs Cuts—That the Parliament expresses its grave concern at the impact on the people of Uist of the anticipated job losses at defence contractor QinetiQ’s bases in Uist; notes that the Ministry of Defence and its contractors have for decades been one of the largest employers in those islands and that the cuts planned to take effect between now and 2013 will have a severe impact on a fragile island economy; expresses disappointment that the many years of support that the community has given these bases has been so poorly rewarded by HM Government and calls on that government to reconsider its position, taking account of the superb facilities for rocket tracking and other activities that exist in Uist, and seeks urgent information from HM Government as to how it intends to recompense this community if it goes ahead with its present plans.
