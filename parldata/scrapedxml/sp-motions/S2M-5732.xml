 *S2M-5732 Maureen Macmillan: Support for Micropower—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive is currently finalising its planning guidance on renewable energy, Scottish Planning Policy 6 (SPP 6); believes that micropower, including community-scale combined heat and power, has considerable potential to power and heat Scotland’s homes, public buildings and businesses if given the right support at this crucial stage in the industry’s development; believes that micropower can help reduce CO2 emissions from buildings and therefore has a vital role to play in combating climate change; believes that SPP 6 should set ambitious but achievable targets for the inclusion of micropower in new developments, and therefore calls on the Executive to require new developments to reduce their predicted CO2 emissions by at least 15% over building regulations through the use of on-site micropower technologies, to apply initially to developments over 500m2 in size, and to all new developments over time.
