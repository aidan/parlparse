*S2M-1903 John Swinburne: 10th Anniversary of the National Lottery—That the Parliament notes that the National Lottery is currently celebrating its 10th anniversary; further notes the lack of support for good causes in Scotland and therefore congratulates the Fair Share funding initiative which is designed to target lottery money at areas, including specific areas in Glasgow, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire and Dundee, which have not received a fair share of lottery funds in the past, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to work with Her Majesty’s Government to set up a not-for-profit Scottish lottery with the funds raised by lottery customers in Scotland being exclusively used for the benefit of the people, communities and organisations in Scotland.
