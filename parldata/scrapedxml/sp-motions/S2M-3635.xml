*S2M-3635 Frances Curran: Terminate Fizzy Drinks in Schools—That the Parliament is surprised to be congratulating free marketeer and Republican Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has banned fizzy drinks, including Coca-Cola, from all schools in California in an attempt to target childhood obesity; notes that the “Terminator” has terminated the sale of these drinks in schools in the same period that the Scottish Executive has been unable to decide what to do; further notes that Scotland is now lagging behind many countries which have also banned junk food and drink from their schools, and believes that decisive action on banning junk food and drink in schools cannot come soon enough in Scotland, where child obesity levels in Scotland have doubled in the last 10 years.
