*S3M-7416# Kenneth Gibson: Energy Best Deal Scotland Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes Consumer Focus Scotland’s Energy Best Deal Scotland campaign and its aim of supporting consumers in Scotland to get the best deal on their energy bills; particularly welcomes the work that it will do with advice agencies to build the advice and support available for low-income consumers who are most likely to save by switching but currently least likely to do so; notes that Consumer Focus Scotland’s Paying the Right Price research found that almost half of all households in Scotland have never switched energy supplier or tariff, meaning that around one million households are potentially missing out on average savings of £100 per year, with many lower income households able to save much more; further notes that, of those who have switched, the vast majority have either saved as much or more than they expected to and that most also found it easy to switch; recognises the important contribution that switching energy supplier or tariff can make to saving on household outgoings and tackling fuel poverty, alongside wider energy savings initiatives, and backs the campaign’s aim to support Scottish households in constituencies such as Cunninghame North to get the best deal on their energy bills. Supported by: Christina McKelvie*, Bob Doris*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Sandra White*, Robert Brown*, Rob Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Joe FitzPatrick*, John Wilson*
