 *S3M-2395 Cathy Jamieson: Summer Academy at Strathclyde—That the Parliament celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Summer Academy at Strathclyde (S@S), which seeks to widen access to further and higher education and challenge educational inequality in Scotland; notes that over the last 10 years S@S has raised the aspirations of over 9,000 young people drawn from over 135 schools, including Auchinleck, Cumnock and Doon academies, across 13 local authorities through its dynamic, interactive and thought-provoking range of activities; welcomes the fact that the S@S concept has been adopted by educational institutions across Europe and that several hundred international students have visited Scotland to participate, and praises the commitment of the course director, Christine Percival, her staff and the hundreds of mentors who have worked tirelessly over the past 10 years to create such a Scottish success story.
