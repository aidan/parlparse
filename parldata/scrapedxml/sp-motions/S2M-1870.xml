S2M-1870 Pauline McNeill: Gender Segregation and Modern Apprenticeships—That the Parliament welcomes the report of phase one of the Equal Opportunities Commission’s (EOC) investigation into gender segregation and modern apprenticeships in Scotland; is dismayed that, almost 30 years after the Sex Discrimination Act was passed, only 1.92% of engineering workers in Scotland are female and 4% of childcare workers are male; believes that skill shortages and high numbers of vacancies in construction, plumbing and engineering could be addressed through mainstreaming gender equality in the modern apprenticeships programme; further believes that, until low pay and low status are addressed and a coherent accredited training route is established, the childcare sector will continue to maintain a massive under-representation of male workers; notes that the EOC’s findings indicate significant shortcomings associated with the statistical monitoring of modern apprenticeships and an apparent difference in perspectives on the objectives of modern apprenticeships between the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise; believes that until gender equality is mainstreamed into design, reporting and delivery, occupational segregation will continue to be a key feature of the modern apprenticeships programme, and considers that the Executive and Scottish Enterprise should develop a transparent national strategy to tackle gender segregation in skills generally and modern apprenticeships in particular, explicitly including gender targets to encourage non-stereotypical choices.
