*S3M-5426# Liam McArthur: Car Parking Charges at HIAL Airports—That the Parliament notes the welcome, if belated, decision by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) to postpone the introduction of car parking charges at Kirkwall Airport; regrets that this decision was taken only after the board of HIAL initially rejected the unanimous recommendation of the statutory Kirkwall Airport Consultative Committee to put the introduction of the charges on hold until a proper consultation was undertaken; further notes that HIAL is considering imposing similar charges at its airports at Sumburgh and Stornoway; is concerned that the introduction of car parking charges at these island airports will add still further to the high cost for island residents of using their lifeline internal and external air services and of island life in general; expects the consultation to be thorough and to enable the detail of HIAL’s proposals, as well as the principle of charging, to be robustly challenged, and considers that the delay offers the opportunity for all Orcadians to make their views known and for islanders from Shetland and the Western Isles to add their voices to the campaign against the Kirkwall charges in order to avoid a precedent being set at Kirkwall, which HIAL could use to impose charges at Sumburgh and Stornoway. Supported by: Tavish Scott*, Alasdair Allan*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Mike Pringle* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
