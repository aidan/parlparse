 *S3M-7548 Jackie Baillie: Going Snowhere—That the Parliament is disappointed that SNP-controlled West Dunbartonshire Council has cut its winter maintenance budget, which, it considers, has resulted in residents being stranded by the recent severe weather; notes that £83,370 was cut in 2009-10 and subsequently earmarked funding of £100,000 was cancelled in its October 2010 emergency budget; is of the view that many areas in West Dunbartonshire have been left untreated due to these cuts and, as a result, older and vulnerable people have been left stranded in their own homes; praises the staff who it considers have worked exceptionally hard to keep the roads and pavements clear but recognises that they have to be given adequate resources to do their jobs, and regrets that West Dunbartonshire Council has made cuts to what it considers are essential services at a time when they have millions of pounds in financial reserves. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
