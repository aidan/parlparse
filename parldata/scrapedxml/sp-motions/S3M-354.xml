*S3M-354 Irene Oldfather: NACCO Material Handling Group Job Losses, Irvine—That the Parliament notes with regret the end of production in January 2009 at NACCO Materials Handling Group’s Irvine factory, with the loss of 220 jobs; recognises that NACCO has been a major employer in Irvine since 1957; acknowledges the highly skilled and loyal workforce at NACCO; welcomes the fact that there are contracts on the books which will ensure work for the factory for the next 18 months, and calls on the Scottish Executive to meet urgently with the appropriate agencies and the company to consider what can be done to ensure the retention of these 220 jobs in the local area after January 2009.
