*S1M-550.1 Mr David Davidson: Tourism—As an amendment to motion (S1M-550) in the name of Mr Alasdair Morrison, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the publication by the Scottish Executive of the New Strategy for Scottish Tourism and regrets that it fails to address the need for a restructuring of responsibilities and fails to clarify and confirm the essential funding of Area Tourist Boards."
