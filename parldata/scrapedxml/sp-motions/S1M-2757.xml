*S1M-2757 Michael Russell: Anniversary of the Old Parliament of Scotland —That the Parliament notes the 295th anniversary of the adjournment of the former Parliament of Scotland on Monday 25 March 2002; recalls the words of Dr Winnie Ewing MSP at the first session of the reconvened Parliament on 12 May 1999, and believes that the Parliamentary Bureau should mark the anniversary of the adjournment on the nearest sitting day by providing time for a debate on a motion honouring the past, present and future of Scottish democracy, those who fought tirelessly for the Parliament’s restoration and those who still campaign for the completion of its powers and for national independence.
