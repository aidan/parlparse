*S2M-3171# Margaret Jamieson: Victims Rights—That the Parliament notes recent court decisions which put the human rights of prisoners before those of their victims by ignoring the rights of victims to pursue their assailant for damages when compensation is awarded and believes that the Scottish Executive should pursue all avenues to ensure that no convicted criminal has the opportunity to gain financially from their crimes or imprisonment and that victims should be advised of awards of compensation, inheritance or other financial gain.
