 *S2M-1673.1# Michael Matheson: Dying with Dignity—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1673) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from "further" to end and insert "notes that the Scottish Executive has been attempting to tackle Scotland’s high level of suicide and self harm; notes the evidence submitted to the House of Lords’ select committee by the Royal College of Nursing that involving nurses in assisted dying would undermine the nurse-patient relationship and frighten vulnerable people and that the Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill normalises the concept that some lives are not worth living; notes the BMA conference’s 2000 decision to reject any moves to change the law on physician-assisted suicide; rejects the principle that suicide is acceptable, and calls for better provision of palliative care and treatment for terminally-ill patients and sufferers of depression."
