*S3M-3351.1 Rob Gibson: Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3351) in the name of Liam McArthur, insert at end "notes with surprise that the sole Scottish Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament voted to end the UK opt-out as opposed to the SNP, Conservative and, indeed, English Liberal Democrat MEPs who voted to support the Scottish and UK governments’ shared position for retention of an opt-out; nonetheless welcomes the change of heart on the part of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, which may help to clarify their position to the retained firefighters of Scotland; commends the mature and responsible joint efforts by the Scottish and UK governments to resolve this potentially confused legal situation in a calm and rational manner as opposed to resorting to scaremongering with hypothetical situations; looks forward to a sensible resolution of this dispute, and considers that the actions of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have confused the issue and have been ultimately unhelpful." Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Ian McKee*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Michael Matheson*, Bashir Ahmad*, Dave Thompson*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Brian Adam*
