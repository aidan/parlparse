 *S3M-7011 Bob Doris: RSA Investment Boost for Scottish Aviation—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the airline, Jet2.com, that it will be establishing a base in Glasgow, which will result in the creation of around 150 jobs and introduce nine new direct international flights to Glasgow Airport; believes that the £150,000 grant that was awarded from Scottish Enterprise’s Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) scheme to help with the creation of what it considers to be high-value maintenance jobs at the base demonstrates a sensible use of public funds, and anticipates benefits in the years ahead for the area’s economy and for Glasgow Airport as a result of this RSA investment.
