*S3M-6960 Hugh O’Donnell: Gathering of Education Statistics—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government’s proposals to cease the collation and publication of key education statistics, including those regarding school exclusions, the uptake of free school meals and teacher vacancies; considers that the regular collection and publication of these statistics is vital for the tracking of Scotland’s educational performance, not least by parents and carers, and believes that the Scottish Government should reverse this move and continue to collect and publish all those education statistics that it currently makes publicly available.
