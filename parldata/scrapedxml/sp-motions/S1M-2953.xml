*S1M-2953# Alex Fergusson: Timber Industry—That the Parliament acknowledges the value of timber as a primary product within rural Scotland and the 11,000 jobs which are dependent on that industry; recognises the very real difficulties faced by some rural local authorities in maintaining and improving minor roads for timber extraction, and believes that the Scottish Executive should meet COSLA’s Rural Affairs Committee and representatives of the forestry industry to determine a satisfactory way forward, recognising that the placing of weight restriction orders, which effectively landlock large areas of mature timber, is not a realistic solution. R Supported by: David Mundell*, John Scott*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Mr David Davidson*
