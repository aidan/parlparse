*S2M-2031 John Swinburne: Winter Cold-Related Deaths—That the Parliament finds totally unacceptable the figure of 2,900 winter cold-related deaths in 2003, which is an increase of 400 on the 2002 figure; believes that the Scottish Executive’s free central heating programme should be expanded and its delivery improved to meet the needs of many who are still living in fuel poverty; recommends that more work is done with the energy companies to encourage them to lower their charges and to ensure they do not disconnect vulnerable, elderly customers, and therefore calls on the Executive to pledge to guarantee that there will be a significant reduction in cold-related deaths in 2004 and no such deaths in 2005.
