 *S3M-4715 Margaret Mitchell: Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi—That the Parliament condemns the Cabinet Secretary for Justice and the SNP government for releasing Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi; notes that Mr Megrahi has served only eight years of a life sentence that was passed for his part in murdering 270 people in the 1988 Pan AM disaster; recognises that Alex Salmond’s government has mishandled this whole affair and has alienated friends and allies of Scotland; further recognises that the SNP government has done a disservice to the relatives of the victims of the Lockerbie atrocity, and offers its deepest sympathy to the families of the victims at this difficult time.
