*S3M-6313 Bill Wilson: Taxpayer-owned Banks Should Not be Destroying the Environment and People’s Lives—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Lloyds Banking Group’s chief executive to waive his bonus for 2009 but deplores its remuneration committee’s decision to make this award and the support offered to Lloyds’ remuneration proposals by UK Financial Investments; considers that there is abundant evidence that very high pay is no guarantee of good performance but that it is associated with inequality and therefore with poor health, short lives, unhappiness and crime; further notes the reported involvement of UK banks in supporting what are considered environmentally and ethically dubious projects such as the exploitation of the Alberta tar sands; urges the UK Government to change the criteria by which UK Financial Investments operates, such as to compel it to consider human rights, environmental criteria and the long-term wellbeing of the people of this country and elsewhere rather than encouraging the taxpayer-owned banks to chase short-term profits at the expense of such things, and believes that the banks should remain in public ownership if this would be the best way of preventing destructive investment policies.
