*S3M-772 Patricia Ferguson: North Kelvinside Sports Complex—That the Parliament recognises that recent surveys have identified a shortage of sports pitches in the north of Glasgow and welcomes therefore the decision by Glasgow City Council to build a sports complex in the grounds of the former North Kelvinside School; recognises the valiant efforts of North Kelvin Community Council and Councillor Jim Mackechnie to save the existing pitches and to have them enhanced in this way, and further recognises the sterling efforts of the Compendium Trust which has also worked hard to secure playing field provision in the area.
