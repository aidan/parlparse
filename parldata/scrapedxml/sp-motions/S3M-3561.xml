*S3M-3561 Robin Harper: Medical Student Top-up Fees—That the Parliament notes that medical students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland studying at Scottish universities pay an additional fee of £1,075 compared to students studying other subjects; believes that students should not have to choose what they study based on how much it costs, and calls on the Scottish Government to scrap this top-up fee for medical students at the earliest opportunity.
