*S3M-4005 Duncan McNeil: Tenth Anniversary of the National Minimum Wage—That the Parliament notes that April 2009 marks the tenth anniversary of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 coming into force; further notes that the introduction of the Act resulted in an immediate wage increase for some two million people; believes that the Act represents one of the most important pieces of social justice legislation of the 20th century, which complimented the policies pursued by the new Scottish Executive following its election later the same year; considers that the experience of the national minimum wage confounded predictions by the Conservative Party, including several members of the current UK shadow cabinet, that it would cost jobs, and regrets the fact that, despite their rhetoric before and since, not one Scottish National Party member voted for the legislation when it was finally passed in the House of Commons.
