*S3M-5573 Fergus Ewing: Scotland’s Water Rescue Review—That the Parliament welcomes the findings of Paddy Tomkins’ Independent Review of Open Water and Flood Rescue in Scotland, which examined the arrangements and protocols for inland water rescue in Scotland, and believes that the report’s recommendations should be carefully considered and acted on in order to strengthen multi-agency arrangements and ensure that an effective and proportionate response capability exists across Scotland.
