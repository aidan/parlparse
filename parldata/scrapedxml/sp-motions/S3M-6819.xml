 *S3M-6819Christina McKelvie:Inquest into the Circumstances of the Death of Dr David Kellyâ€”That the Parliament supports the call from a group of prominent medical experts and a cross party group of politicians for a full inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr David Kelly; notes the calls come from a former coroner, Michael Powers, and Julian Bion a professor of intensive care medicine, and that there is political support from Labour leadership contender Diane Abbot MP, Conservative peer Michael Howard, two former Labour defence ministers and a number of Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs; further supports calls that the proposed inquest includes disclosure of all documents sealed for 70 years in respect of evidence to the Hutton inquiry, and further notes that recent evidence by the first police officer on the scene, together with new statements by doctors, raises serious questions which should be considered by the inquest.
