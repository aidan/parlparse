*S2M-4532 Jackie Baillie: Solar Powered Boat on Loch Lomond—That the Parliament welcomes Scotland’s first solar powered boat based in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park; notes that it will be used as a floating classroom, providing passengers with a knowledge of the loch and its islands, crannogs, plants, animals, geology and history; acknowledges that the boat is practically silent, generates no emissions and can accommodate up to 12 passengers, including wheelchair users; considers, in light of the recent good weather, that a solar powered boat is an imaginative and environmentally friendly addition to the national park, and encourages all to visit Loch Lomond and enjoy its natural beauty.
