*S3M-2713 Alex Neil: HBOS Takeoverâ€”That the Parliament gives a general welcome to the measures taken by the UK and other governments to tackle the current banking crisis but calls on the UK Government to reverse its decision to make the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS a condition of its bail-out funding; considers that the promises of the Lloyds TSB management that only the Scottish headquarters of the merged bank would be retained in Edinburgh are a totally inadequate response to Scottish demands and would result in a huge loss of jobs and decision-making powers in Scotland, particularly in Edinburgh and Fife, and calls on the UK Government to use its stakeholding in HBOS to retain it as an independent bank with its corporate headquarters in Edinburgh and to make this a condition of funding for HBOS.
