*S2M-5304 Frances Curran: More Support Needed for Motor Neurone Disease Sufferers—That the Parliament believes that the work done by the Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association has greatly improved the lives of the 280 sufferers from motor neurone disease (MND) in Scotland; in particular believes that the funding that the association provides for MND care teams is crucial in allowing MND sufferers to live as normal a life as possible; further believes that NHS boards are not currently meeting their responsibilities to patients with MND as they are failing to fund MND care teams, thus making sufferers reliant on charity for their care, and calls on NHS boards to shoulder their fair share of caring responsibilities to patients by meeting 50% of the costs of providing MND care teams.
