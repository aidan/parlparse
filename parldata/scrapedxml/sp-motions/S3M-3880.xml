*S3M-3880 Sandra White: World-class Drama—That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD) on its continuing world-class appeal and excellence as evidenced by the results achieved in its latest Research Assessment Exercise; applauds the Scottish Government’s record investment of over £1 billion in Scotland’s university sector, which includes an increase of over 30% for the RSAMD and an extra £126 million through the introduction of a new Horizon Fund to act as a catalyst for change in support of Scotland’s future economic, social, civic and cultural future; echoes the comments of John Wallace, principal of the RSAMD, that "The Scottish Funding Council is to be congratulated on achieving a perfectly pitched solution to underpin world class drama training in Scotland. This is a milestone in the history of the Academy and for the continuance of excellent drama training in Scotland", and believes that the Scottish Government’s record investment in the university sector will ensure that Scotland’s world-class reputation for excellence in this field continues to flourish.
