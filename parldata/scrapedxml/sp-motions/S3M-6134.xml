 *S3M-6134# Duncan McNeil: Halt Hospice Cuts—That the Parliament commends the volunteer drivers who have provided a valued transport service on behalf of Ardgowan Hospice in Inverclyde for the last 29 years; recognises that more than 1,000 cancer patients rely on them to attend hospital appointments in Glasgow every year; notes the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Palliative Care Health Needs Assessment 2010, which stated that "patients found this to be a very welcome support that reduced the added stress that the ambulance transport brought to an already stressful experience"; further notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has since withdrawn funding for this transport service, and believes that funding should be found so that Ardgowan Hospice volunteers are given all the support that they need and deserve to ensure the future of this important service.
