*S3M-748 Bill Wilson: Cancellation of Indonesian Arms Debts—That the Parliament calls for the cancellation of over £500 million of Indonesian arms debt lent to the Suharto regime in the 1980s and 1990s; acknowledges that this money was said to have been used to kill nearly one-third of the population of East Timor and murder 500,000 Indonesian civilians; believes that the people of Indonesia, half of whom now live on less than £1 of food a day, should not be forced to pay the very debts incurred through purchasing the means to oppress and murder them; recognises the democratically elected government of Indonesia and the burden that these odious debts impose on such burgeoning democracies, and believes that Scotland should set a global example by condemning the unethical support of oppressive dictatorships and denouncing the practice of forcing citizens to pay for the political and military mechanisms that oppressed them.
