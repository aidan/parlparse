*S3M-7047.3 Liam McArthur: A Low Carbon Economy for Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7047) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, insert at end "; welcomes the announcement by Ofgem of a review of the charging arrangements for gas and electricity transmission networks and hopes that this will pave the way to removing barriers to the development of Scotland’s renewable energy industry, and believes that the UK Government’s plans for a Green Investment Bank to fund low-carbon transport and energy schemes and a Green Deal to overhaul the energy efficiency of homes and small businesses will benefit Scotland’s efforts to build a low- carbon economy."
