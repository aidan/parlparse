 *S1M-3067.2 John Scott: Sustainable Development - Meeting the Needs... Priorities, Actions and Targets for Sustainable Development in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3067) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from first "believes" to end and insert "expresses its concern that the statement has not gone far enough, particularly in its indicator list given that, 27 months after first promised, 24 indicators have been selected but less than 50% have set targets; questions whether the indicator list therefore provides an adequate basis to measure progress; further believes that the inclusion of no less than 15 other consultations, strategies, forums and plans may hinder the long-term delivery of the new vision, and supports the development of a more focused action plan for the continuation of sustainable development in Scotland.
