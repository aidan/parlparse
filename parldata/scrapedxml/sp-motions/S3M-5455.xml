*S3M-5455 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Billâ€”That the Parliament notes with grave concern the proposals contained in the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which is currently being considered by the Parliament of Uganda; strongly condemns the oppressive legislation that could result in life imprisonment for homosexuality and also threatens imprisonment for anyone who does not inform the authorities of someone who is gay; recognises that the Bill is a gross violation of human rights, and calls for the international community to put continued pressure on the Ugandan Government to immediately withdraw the proposals.
