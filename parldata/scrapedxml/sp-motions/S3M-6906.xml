*S3M-6906# Bill Butler: Glas-goals Aiming High—That the Parliament supports the Evening Times’ Glas-goals campaign and its three targets of encouraging Glaswegians to walk or run a million miles, stub out a million cigarettes and shed half a million pounds in weight between them over the next year; notes that the paper will work with partners including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Glasgow Life, Glasgow City Council, Glasgow 2014 and Glasgow Housing Association to deliver a year-long series of events aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles; is alarmed that Glasgow, as it heads towards the 2014 Commonwealth Games, has one of the worst public health records in Europe with men in Glasgow having the lowest life expectancy in the United Kingdom, and with nearly a third of the city’s population suffering from obesity and over 190,000 of its citizens still smoking; believes Glas-goals has the potential to make a significant contribution in addressing these deep-seated problems; encourages Glaswegians to join the campaign by participating in the Glas-goals events, which so far have included fun runs, cycle races, bunny hops and the World’s largest tea dance, and encourages other local authorities and health bodies to consider using Glas-goals as a blueprint for campaigns across Scotland.
