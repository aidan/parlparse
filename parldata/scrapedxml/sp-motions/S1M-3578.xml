*S1M-3578# Christine Grahame: Bah Humbug-That the Parliament notes that the advertising, promotion and sale of Christmas as a commercial calendar event is now encroaching earlier and earlier in the year and that such activities put unacceptable pressures particularly on parents with young children, leading some understandably into financial difficulties; further notes that retail staff and shoppers are subjected to endless jingles before even Halloween masks have been reduced to half price and pumpkins are buy one get six free, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to take such steps as are required to consign Christmas to where it belongs, no earlier than the month of December. Supported by: Mr John McAllion*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Margaret Smith*
