*S3M-3137 Jamie Hepburn: Future of BAA Airports in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the recent confirmation by the Competition Commission that BAA will be required to sell one of its Scottish airports, most likely Edinburgh; considers that the airports that are publicly owned and operated by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd and the Manchester Airports Group are very successful; believes that there is considerable merit in such a public ownership model being considered for any Scottish airport put up for sale by BAA, and encourages relevant local authorities and other public bodies to examine ways in which such models could be taken forward.
