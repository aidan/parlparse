*S2M-855.3 Lewis Macdonald: The Scottish Economy-As an amendment to motion (S2M-855) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "with" to end and insert "the evidence of an upturn in global economic activity and the opportunities for Scottish businesses and the Scottish economy to grow; rejects the proposition that increased competitiveness is best achieved by reductions in business taxation; believes instead that economic growth and wealth creation require targeted investment in skills and learning, business growth and innovation, and global connections, and supports the Scottish Executive's strategy of sustained investment in these areas to improve Scotland's competitive position in the global economy." Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace*
