*S2M-3484 Phil Gallie: Recognition and Action on Gulf War Syndrome—That the Parliament requests the Scottish Executive to express the view to the Prime Minister that for far too long the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has turned its back on the veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War campaign by ignoring the high incidence of so-called Gulf War syndrome, despite the findings of Lord Lloyd’s public inquiry, the recognition given to the illness by our US allies, the support of former chiefs of staff and the magnitude of evidence which shows many Scottish veterans and their families to be victims, and demands that the MoD takes action now to alleviate the plight of those victims and to bring a degree of closure to those who have suffered so much. Supported by: Mike Rumbles*, Margaret Mitchell*, Ms Sandra White*, Nora Radcliffe*, Mr David Davidson*, Linda Fabiani*, Murray Tosh*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Brian Adam*, Murdo Fraser*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Bruce Crawford*
