*S2M-3946 Fergus Ewing: Fuel Tax Concessions for Scottish Highlands and Islands—That the Parliament notes that more tax is paid on a litre of fuel in the Highlands and Islands than any other area of the United Kingdom; notes the French Government’s recent decision to allow its regional councils to introduce reduced rates of duty for road fuel consumed within their territories; further notes that this decision was reached with the prior approval of the Council of Ministers which included ministers from the UK Government; observes that the European Commission elected to allow this derogation from the Energy Products Directive to permit this measure; condemns Her Majesty’s Government for its refusal to countenance any move to reduce fuel prices in rural or island communities of Scotland; notes that Her Majesty’s Government has ruled out any assistance for rural and island Scotland whilst supporting a similar policy of the French Government which would see reductions of fuel duty by 3% until 2011; believes that this refusal shows that Her Majesty’s Treasury, led by a Scot, is totally out of touch with the needs of rural and island communities of Scotland and has no understanding of how high fuel taxes affect areas of Scotland like Na h-Eileanan an Iar; further believes that, since these powers exist to assist regional economies, the UK Government should consider at least a 3% reduction in the rate of duty on petrol and diesel for extension across other areas of the Highlands and Islands and other rural and remote parts of Scotland, where it is required; calls on the Scottish Executive, including the Liberal Democrat Minister for Transport and Telecommunications, the Liberal Democrat Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning and all Liberal Democrat MSPs, to give its backing to the campaign to see in Scotland the same powers available to protect rural and island communities from higher fuel prices as are to be enjoyed by French communities, and further calls on Liberal Democrat MSPs to set a new precedent by adopting the same policy in Scotland as that of Liberal Democrat MPs in London.
