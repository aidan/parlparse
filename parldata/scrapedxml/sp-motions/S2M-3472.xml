*S2M-3472 Linda Fabiani: Treatment of Asylum Seekers—That the Parliament deprecates the treatment of asylum seekers in this country and, in particular, condemns the dawn raids and forced removals which have been a feature of the treatment recently; agrees with the sentiment expressed by the Minister for Communities in the Chamber on 22 September 2005 of “absolutely appalling” in connection with the forced removal of the Vucaj family (Official Reportc. 19391); calls for an immediate amnesty, similar to the 2003 amnesty, for all asylum-seeker families resident in Scotland with children in the school system, and asserts that the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 should apply to all children in Scotland.
