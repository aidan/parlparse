*S2M-154 Malcolm Chisholm: Patient Focus and Public Involvement in the NHS—That the Parliament welcomes the measures in Partnership For Care: Scotland’s Health White Paper and the Partnership Agreement to step up progress to ensure that greater patient engagement and wider public involvement are at the heart of a modernised NHS and supports the Scottish Executive’s commitment to placing the patient at the heart of the design of services, implementing a patient information initiative, ensuring public involvement in health service reorganisation plans by obliging NHS boards to consult stakeholders more effectively and setting up a Scottish health council as a national body with a local presence across Scotland. Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe*
