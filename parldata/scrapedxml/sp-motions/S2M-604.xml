*S2M-604# Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire Secondary Schools PPP Proposal-That the Parliament shares the concerns of parents and pupils in East Kilbride with regard to South Lanarkshire Council's public private partnership proposal for secondary schools which, if implemented, will result in 50% of secondary schools in East Kilbride being closed and school rolls amongst the highest in Scotland; notes that, as the locations of the proposed schools are all in the north of the town, this will lead to considerably longer school journey times for pupils; further notes that St Andrews School, which is earmarked for closure, currently operates at over 80% capacity and has a healthy mix of denominational and non-denominational pupils thus contributing to the Scottish Executive's stated policy of combating sectarianism, and considers that the Executive should fully investigate this situation and the concerns of parents and pupils prior to agreeing the closure of St Andrews school and giving approval to South Lanarkshire Council's secondary school provision proposal.
