*S3M-1725 Sarah Boyack: Right to Rent—That the Parliament believes that there is a serious lack of affordable housing in the city of Edinburgh; notes the City of Edinburgh Council’s view that 1,200 new affordable houses are needed in each of the next 10 years; understands that students, graduates, young professionals and families all find it increasingly difficult to get their feet on the property ladder and choose to rent instead; believes that houses in multiple occupation (HMO) legislation was a landmark achievement in terms of improving basic standards of health and safety in the private rented sector but is concerned that HMO legislation must be properly regulated and enforced to be successful, including ensuring that landlords manage their properties in line with the legislation; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that local authorities have adequate resources to enforce HMO legislation and to use the powers they have to tackle antisocial behaviour so that blanket use of HMO quotas is not seen as the simple solution to ensuring decent housing choices and securing sustainable communities; welcomes the Edinburgh University Students’ Association’s Right to Rent campaign and believes that local authorities should work with student organisations, universities and colleges to ensure that sufficient, new and affordable student accommodation is identified in local authority development plans, and supports students’ associations across Scotland in their efforts to ensure a mixed tenure of properties in their local communities.
