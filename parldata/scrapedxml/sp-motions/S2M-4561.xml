*S2M-4561 Tommy Sheridan: Closure of the National Minimum Wage Helpline for Scotland—That the Parliament notes the scourge of low pay in the United Kingdom, which, disgracefully under the Labour Government, has not been eradicated; notes that people caught in the poverty trap of low pay are more likely to be in debt and work longer hours to make ends meet as, for example, low-paid workers are more likely to have signed an opt-out of the EU Working Time Directive 48 hour maximum with their employers to make more money and could be working up to 80 to 100 hours per week; further notes that low pay results in poverty, debt, rent and mortgage arrears, poor health, stress, lower life expectancy and malnutrition and, for example, many working parents on low pay will ensure that their children have a meal and go without themselves; also notes the abolition of the wages councils and the introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 allowing for a national minimum wage which employers must pay to their workers otherwise they are breaking the law and can be prosecuted and fined, as well as having to pay employees the backdated arrears; notes that since 1998 there have been many breaches of the national minimum wage regulations by employers and backdated arrears have been awarded to workers, but there has been not one prosecution of any company for breaking the law; further notes in this connection the significance of the National Minimum Wage Helpline for Scotland, which was set up in 2003, based at the office of the Scottish Low Pay Unit and funded by HM Revenue and Customs and the Department of Trade and Industry; condemns the Government’s decision to cease funding the helpline, which means that it will have to close at the end of June 2006 if alternative funding is not found and notes that in 2005 the helpline achieved over £15,000 in back pay for low-paid workers in Scotland who had not been paid the National Minimum Wage; notes that the helpline advised 1,003 low-paid workers and received enquiries from every single local authority area in Scotland and that after June 2006 low-paid workers in Scotland will have to call a helpline in Newcastle which is run by the UK Government and whose hours are going to be reduced while it operates as a helpline for the whole of the United Kingdom; further notes that the Scottish Executive has been contacted and asked if it will fund the National Minimum Wage helpline, which covers the whole of Scotland, to ensure its survival and notes that there has not yet been a positive response; further notes increasing cuts in the voluntary sector in Glasgow, such as the closure of the Scottish Human Rights Centre and the Scottish Civic Forum; believes that these cuts specifically target services for the most vulnerable communities and that when services are cut, not only do workers lose their jobs, but the entire community of low-paid workers, especially women as well as people of different race and ethnic backgrounds, loses valuable services; therefore challenges the cutting by the Government of a valuable helpline in Scotland which helps the poorest workers when at the same time it can spend millions of pounds on a war in Iraq that benefits no-one and calls on the Scottish Executive to secure the current funding and consider long-term funding of the helpline; regards it as a priority that enough public money in Scotland is made available to help the poorest paid workers in Scotland to enforce their right to a national minimum wage with independent professional advice, as well as catering for the needs of a rapidly expanding migrant workforce from Eastern Europe in Scotland who are being exploited as workers and frequently need advice on the national minimum wage, and considers that this has increased resonance at a time when the money needed to keep the helpline open, £36,000, is insignificant when compared to the millions that it cost to build the Scottish Parliament and the public money that Scottish Enterprise has wasted in building up debts instead of creating jobs.
