*S3M-7718 Mr Frank McAveety: Bus Service Withdrawals in the East End of Glasgow—That the Parliament is concerned by the decision by First Bus to withdraw what it considers to be the vital 43 service in the evening and the 64 service after 7 pm on weeknights and on Sundays; believes that insufficient consideration has been given to those adversely effected by the changes; is of the view that the east end of Glasgow cannot afford to lose any more bus services; is troubled by what it considers as the easy discarding by First Group of its undertaking, made when awarded its contract, not to withdraw services; understands that this decision will disproportionately affect some of the most vulnerable people in Glasgow, and considers that bus providers should be obliged to protect all vital routes and that this serves as a further indication that the regulation of bus routes in Scotland is in need of major reform.
