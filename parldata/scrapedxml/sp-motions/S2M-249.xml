*S2M-249 Brian Adam: Aberdeen Recycling and Waste Management-That the Parliament welcomes the monies allocated to Aberdeen City Council for recycling and waste management projects over the next 17 years; recognises that Scotland needs to recycle more and discard less, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government to introduce legislation to ensure that manufacturers and retailers reduce the excessive amount of packaging that some persist in using to wrap their goods.
