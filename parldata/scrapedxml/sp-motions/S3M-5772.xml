* S3M-5772 Mike Pringle: Hands off Lothian Busesâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Competition Commission to investigate issues relating to local bus markets in the United Kingdom, excepting London and Northern Ireland; considers that the Edinburgh bus market does not have any of the serious failings evident in other areas that have prompted this general investigation; further considers that the vast majority of Edinburgh residents are well served by a number of operators, among them Lothian Buses, whose quality of service has been recognised in a number of awards over recent years; understands that Lothian Buses charges lower fares, has a more modern fleet of buses and provides a more comprehensive range of services, especially outside of peak hours, than is provided in any other local bus market outside of London, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with local authorities and other key stakeholders to ensure that, in its findings, the Competition Commission promotes the integration and increased usage of public transport and does not act to the detriment of those, such as Edinburgh residents, who currently benefit from an industry-leading bus service.
