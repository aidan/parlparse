 *S3M-1627♦ Tricia Marwick: MS Awareness Week 21-27 April 2008—That the Parliament welcomes the focus on the emotional, physical and financial costs of multiple sclerosis of this year’s MS Awareness Week which runs from 21 to 27 April 2008; recognises that Scotland has the highest rate of the condition in the world and that its costs can be significant for the approximately 10,500 people living with multiple sclerosis in Scotland as they deal with the impact that it can have on every aspect of their lives; supports the work that the MS Society Scotland does to provide advice, support and information to people affected by MS, and recognises that, while considerable progress has been made in the provision of MS specialists in NHS boards, the statutory services available to people affected by MS remain variable across the country and that social care services in particular need to improve so that high-quality support is available wherever people live in Scotland.
