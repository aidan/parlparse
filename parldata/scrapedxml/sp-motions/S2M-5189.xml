*S2M-5189 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Maggie’s Highland Cancer Caring Centre—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow design firm Page and Park Architects for winning the prestigious Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland Andrew Doolan Award for Maggie’s Highland Cancer Caring Centre in Inverness; notes that the building beat off competition from Perth Concert Hall, Glasgow’s Saltire Centre and the new Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters, and endorses comments by Professor Simon Unwin of Dundee University, one of the award judges, that, with a complex tangle of intertwining curves and using a palette of warm and pliable materials, the interior meets uncertainty with companionship and reassurance, the design is sympathetic to the original beliefs of Maggie Keswick Jencks that good design can influence good health.
