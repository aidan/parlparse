*S2M-4140 Christine May: Proposed Demutualisation of Standard Lifeâ€”That the Parliament is concerned to note the proposed demutualisation of Standard Life, in light of the recent report of the Cross Party Group at Westminster which found, in line with previous research by the Building Societies Association, that demutualisation "had a largely negative impact on customer choice and financial services provision in the UK", that mutuals had "largely out-performed their plc rivals" in value for savers or borrowers and that the best way of "ensuring that inter-generational equity created over the last 180 years in this successful company is available in the years to come to benefit the greater community of Scotland" is for Standard Life to retain its mutual status.
