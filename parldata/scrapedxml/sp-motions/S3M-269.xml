*S3M-269 Jeremy Purvis: The Future of Scotland - Scotland’s Young People—That the Parliament believes that more time and effort must be dedicated to improving opportunities for young people in Scotland; believes that young people should have genuine access to power and a clear set of rights; further believes that young people have much to offer in public life and therefore young people require proper representation in national and local decision-making; notes the importance of youth work and services for young people and the need to improve access to a range of core services, and therefore believes that these measures should be put on a statutory footing in a Future of Scotland Bill to help young people to meet their potential.
