*S3M-1855 Kenneth Gibson: Congratulations to Garnock Valley Rugby Club—That the Parliament congratulates Garnock Valley Rugby Club on winning the Scottish Hydro Electric Shield on Saturday 3 May 2008 at Murrayfield; notes that Garnock Valley defeated Kirkcaldy, a team from the division above, after an enthralling match, won 31-24 by Garnock Valley in the dying minutes; recognises that the victory was all the more remarkable as Garnock had to play without captain, Graeme Reid, and lock, Willie Clark, who were involved elsewhere as best man and groom that day, with Paul McCrorie, the stand-in skipper, delivering victory with his third try three minutes from time; is aware that hundreds of supporters travelled from North Ayrshire to cheer on their team and that the wedding guests were able to join the team at their post-match celebrations in Beith; salutes the hard work of everyone connected with Garnock Valley RC over many years culminating in this historic victory after near misses in the past and notes the comments by club president, Billy Walker, that it was "definitely the best day in the club’s history"; acknowledges that Garnock Valley RC are a real family club with all but two of the final 22 players being home-grown, and hopes and believes that Garnock Valley RC will now go from strength to strength, ensuring the continued growth and popularity of rugby in the Garnock Valley and across North Ayrshire.
