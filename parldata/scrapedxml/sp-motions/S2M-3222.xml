*S2M-3222 Tommy Sheridan: Aftermath of Hurricane Katrinaâ€”That the Parliament congratulates President Chavez of Venezuela for his prompt offer of oil reserves and food aid for the flood and storm-hit areas of the United States of America; notes that the eminent climate specialist, Professor Kerry Emanuel, published research in the magazine, Nature, on 4 August 2005 which concluded that the destructive potential of tropical storms, such as Hurricane Katrina, had doubled over the last 30 years primarily because ocean surfaces have grown warmer; further notes that the majority of scientific opinion believes that such rises in temperature are attributable to the climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions; notes that federal budgets for flood control in Louisiana have been slashed and that oil company canals in Louisiana have contributed significantly to the loss of over 40 miles of wetland which provided a natural buffer to storms and flood; notes that national guardsmen and helicopters from the hurricane-affected areas of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi are currently deployed in Iraq and therefore unavailable for search and rescue, evacuation and distribution of aid relief work, and believes, therefore, that far from being a natural disaster, the scale of human tragedy now unfolding is largely man-made and attributable to the bankrupt policies pursued by US President George W Bush.
