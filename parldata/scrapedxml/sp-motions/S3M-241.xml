*S3M-241 Jim Tolson: Land for Affordable Housing—That the Parliament recognises that house prices have risen by 180% in the last 10 years and as such are increasing the demand for affordable housing; notes that one of the great obstacles to developing affordable housing is obtaining appropriate land for development, particularly in urban areas; congratulates the Scottish Churches Make it Happen campaign which has identified potential for affordable homes from redundant and underused church properties, and calls on the Scottish Executive to enter into negotiations with Scottish Churches and other landholding bodies such as the Ministry of Defence, the NHS and the Forestry Commission to ensure that the necessary land is made available to meet the demand for affordable housing across Scotland.
