*S2M-5443 Colin Fox: British Airways Cabin Crew Strike Vote—That the Parliament notes with concern the threatened strike action by British Airways (BA) cabin crew over new company demands on sickness leave that they believe force them to work despite being ill; believes that the strength of feeling in the workforce was amply demonstrated by a union ballot last week which saw 96% vote in favour of strike action on the issue; regrets that the latest talks between the Transport and General Workers’ Union and the company have broken down, but calls on BA to take up the union’s offer of further talks aimed at avoiding a damaging dispute and reaching an agreement on changes to the current sickness leave arrangements.
