*S3M-439 Sarah Boyack: Icelandic Government’s Recent Decision on Commercial Whaling—That the Parliament welcomes the recent decision by the Icelandic Government not to allow any more commercial whaling quotas at this stage; commends the comments of the Icelandic Fisheries Minister that there is little market for whale meat in Iceland and so no sense in allowing more whales to be killed; notes that this is a significant development given the Icelandic Government’s decision in 2006 to allow commercial whaling of minke whales and endangered fin whales contrary to international agreement; further notes that, while the whale-watching industry in Iceland is now worth over £10 million per year, a Gallup poll in 2006 found that only 1% of Icelanders said they ate whale meat regularly, and calls on Iceland, along with Japan and Norway, to observe in full the International Whaling Commission’s ban on commercial whaling.
