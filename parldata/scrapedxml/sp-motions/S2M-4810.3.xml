 *S2M-4810.3 Ross Finnie: A Greener, Fairer Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4810) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "mankind" to end and insert "the planet; recognises that the Scottish Executive has already embodied fresh ideas, radical thinking and a uniquely Scottish approach in its response to this challenge in Changing our Ways: Scotland’s Climate Change Programme, and welcomes the significant initiatives that the Executive has taken to increase the level of renewable energy generation, improve the energy efficiency of new buildings, boost micro-renewables, reduce energy poverty and increase investment in public transport, the introduction of Strategic Environmental Assessment and the promotion of sustainable development across its policies."
