*S2M-5572 Mr Andy Kerr: Making the NHS Local—That the Parliament supports the goal of further shifting the balance of care away from reactive, episodic care in the acute sector towards preventive, integrated and continuous care embedded in local communities; congratulates NHS Scotland on the significant progress in making its service more local, as required by "Delivering for Health"; welcomes for instance the 50% increase in funding for primary medical services over the period from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and unprecedented investment in primary and community care premises; supports the new community hospital strategy with its focus on providing local facilities and services appropriate to modern-day demands; welcomes the establishment of the Scottish Centre for Telehealth in Grampian and the approaches it will bring to widening access to specialist services, such as seen in the tele-neurology service in Orkney; commends the shift from hospital-based provision to local access for services such as chemotherapy and dialysis and expects community health partnerships to continue to accelerate such a shift; recognises the benefits to communities of more local access for the majority of their unscheduled care needs that will be brought about by the development of community casualty units; welcomes the continuing development of new staff roles and expertise as a means to carry services closer to patients; supports the community pharmacy minor ailments service as an excellent example of improved local access; supports the Scottish Executive’s intention to improve Scotland’s health, focussing especially on reducing inequalities between those with the best and worst health; acknowledges the contribution to improving health of services in local communities for people of all ages, from improving children’s dental health in Glasgow to promoting walking for health by older people; applauds the world-leading anticipatory care "Keep well" services which tackle coronary heart disease in the most deprived communities, and welcomes this package of service change and the continued development of local community health partnerships as a strong and coherent response to the changing pattern of demand that NHS Scotland will face.
