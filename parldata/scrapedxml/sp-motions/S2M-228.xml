*S2M-228 Rosie Kane: Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre-That the Parliament fully supports the efforts of Bishop Mone, President of the Catholic Church in Scotland's Justice and Peace Commission, to secure the closure of Dungavel House immigration removal centre; demands the restoration of human dignity and freedom for those held at the centre; agrees with Bishop Mone that, because children are being held in prison-like conditions, their rights under the UN Convention on the Human Rights of the Child are being breached, and supports the statement from the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland that giving children locked in Dungavel a mainstream education is "the civic duty of the whole of Scotland". Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Nora Radcliffe*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Colin Fox*, Campbell Martin*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Frances Curran*
