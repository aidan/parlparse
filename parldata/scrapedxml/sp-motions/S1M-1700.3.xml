 *S1M-1700.3 Mr Keith Harding: Fuel Poverty—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1700) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "notes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to tackling fuel poverty and that a major part of the action being taken is the continuation and expansion of the Housing Energy Efficiency Scheme introduced by the last Conservative Government in 1991; urges the Scottish Executive to expedite further transfers of Council housing stock to community ownership to facilitate the necessary investment to ensure the eradication of the poor housing conditions that contribute to fuel poverty, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to assist the Social Justice Committee in consideration of the detailed implementation of the Central Heating Programme in order to ensure that the Executive targets the available resources at those most in need.
