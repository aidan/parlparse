 *S2M-3753 Patrick Harvie: Civil Partnership in the Western Isles—That the Parliament condemns Comhairle nan Eilean Siar for its decision not to perform civil partnership ceremonies, making it the only local authority in the United Kingdom to take this stance; recognises that for many couples a public ceremony in front of family and friends is an important aspect of any act of union; notes that, although ceremonies are discretionary, both for civil partnership and for civil marriage, no local authority has refused to offer them for the latter; considers the council’s decision to be an insult to all same-sex couples and that such couples will be less likely to exercise their right to registration as a result, and calls on the Scottish Executive to contact Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to explain the meaning of the council’s duty under the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 to discharge its functions in a manner which encourages equal opportunities, as the council has clearly demonstrated a limited understanding of this duty. Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell*, Margaret Smith*, Carolyn Leckie*, Robin Harper*, Ms Rosemary Byrne* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
