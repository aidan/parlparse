*S3M-3805 Karen Whitefield: Sweet 16? One Year On - Is Life Any Sweeter?—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland (SCCYP) of Sweet 16? One Year On - Is life any sweeter?, a follow-up report to the SCCYP’s 2008 report, Sweet 16? The Age of Leaving Care in Scotland; recognises the Scottish Government’s interest and willingness to consider the issues raised in the Sweet 16 report but expresses concern that significant further action is still required by central and local government to implement fully the original report’s 23 recommendations; fully supports the establishment of a system of care that ensures that young people can successfully make the difficult transition from care to independent living; supports the report’s recommendations that the Scottish Government should set a timetable for prohibiting the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for care leavers, consider adding registered social landlords to the list of those required to cooperate with local authorities in discharging their responsibilities towards children and young people, introduce a system of classification for hostels for the homeless that indicates their suitability for care leavers, consider seeking a power to order local authorities to fulfil their statutory duties and continue to monitor implementation and provide appropriate challenge to local authorities; shares the SCCYP’s belief that, in times of financial distress, we need to make sure that children and young people are the first to receive support and that this issue must remain high on the political agenda, and therefore urges the Scottish Government and local authorities to continue to ensure that the original Sweet 16 recommendations are fully implemented as quickly as possible to ensure that all young people in care in Scotland receive the best possible information, guidance, advice and support.
