*S1M-3748.1 Bill Aitken: Review of Child Protection-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3748) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from "and supports" to end and insert "calls for an overhaul of the children's hearing system which would not only better deal with young offenders, but offer greater protection to vulnerable young Scots, and further calls for a substantial increase in the number of police officers visible within our communities to deter and detect crime which would help make all sections of society safer."
