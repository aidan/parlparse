*S3M-878 Bill Kidd: Anti-Bullying Week 2007—That the Parliament welcomes Anti-Bullying Week 2007, the theme of which is "Cyberbullying, schools and the community"; notes that Anti-Bullying Week has in the past few years had great success in raising awareness of this issue and looked at practical solutions under the themes of "Bystander" and "children and young people’s participation - involving children and young people in tackling bullying"; believes that these events are of great importance in helping to tackle a problem that affects a great number of people not only in schools but also in the wider community; hopes that as organisations such as Respectme, Scotland’s anti-bullying service, become more widely known the vision set out by Respectme of a respecting, just, equal and inclusive Scotland in which all children and young people can live free from bullying and harassment and are encouraged to reach their full potential will be achieved, and wishes it every success in this endeavour.
