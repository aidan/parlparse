*S2M-3414 Des McNulty: Trade Justice—That the Parliament recognises that global trade rules are weighted against poor countries, their people and the environment; believes that governments in poor countries should have the flexibility to choose those policies that will help them to end poverty and protect the environment; notes the Trade Justice Movement’s mass lobby of the UK Parliament on 2 November 2005, and recognises that more than 600,000 people across the United Kingdom have already voted for trade justice, an end to export dumping and regulations that stop big business from profiting at the expense of people and the environment.
