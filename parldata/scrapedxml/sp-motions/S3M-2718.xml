*S3M-2718 Rob Gibson: Class 5b Dunoon Primary Win—That the Parliament congratulates primary class 5b at Dunoon Primary School on winning the Making a Mint competition organised by innovation agency NESTA; believes that the Mint Magic air fresheners that the pupils designed and made themselves are both practical and imaginative; hopes that they use their prize of £1,000 of Amazon vouchers wisely both for enjoyment and education; thanks NESTA for organising and funding the competition and commends it for its work in encouraging children’s creativity and enterprise skills; further hopes that initiatives like Make a Mint will continue in the future, and looks forward to more winners from Scotland.
