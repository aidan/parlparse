 * S2M-2871 Dr Jean Turner: Medical Student Debt—That the Parliament notes with concern the ever-increasing debt levels of medical students in Scotland with an average debt of £11,406 and one in five more than £20,000 in debt; further notes that 59% of applicants to medicine in 2003 came from managerial and professional backgrounds and that inadequate financial support currently available to medical students may act as a significant obstacle to those from poorer backgrounds which made up only 10% of such students; notes that students from less affluent backgrounds are likely to incur far higher levels of debt because of their parents’ inability to contribute to the costs of maintenance, and believes that rising levels of debt have a serious impact on student well-being and that consideration should be given to replacing the student loan system with a grant system for all students. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Patrick Harvie*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Ms Sandra White*, Colin Fox*, Roseanna Cunningham*, John Swinburne*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Carolyn Leckie*
