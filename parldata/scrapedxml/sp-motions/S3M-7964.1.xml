 *S3M-7964.1 Linda Fabiani: Creative Scotland Expenditure—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7964) in the name of Hugh Henry, leave out from "concerned" to end and insert "considers that throughout history the inspiration for artistic expression has come from all manner of sources, some of which have appeared unlikely at the time; recalls, for example, that in 2001 in Hampden Park 200 children performed an acclaimed dance sequence based on Archie Gemmill’s 1978 World Cup goal against Holland; believes that isolating Scottish culture from international influences would be damaging to Scottish creativity and Scottish national life; further believes that there should be no place for politicians to limit or dictate the subject matter of any art form, and deplores any suggestion that difficult economic circumstances can be used to justify censorship of the arts."
