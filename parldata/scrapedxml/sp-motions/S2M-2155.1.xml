*S2M-2155.1 Mr David Davidson: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "continuing" to end and insert "there is an urgent need to reform the NHS in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to place patients’ needs at the centre of the service, to give patients the choice to move anywhere within the NHS, to ensure that NHS capacity is supplemented where necessary by better collaboration and partnership with the independent and voluntary health and care sectors and to move to a system where money follows the patients, and further calls on the Executive to free health professionals and local managers to respond to patient needs on a local basis and to transfer resources away from bureaucracy and into front-line care."
