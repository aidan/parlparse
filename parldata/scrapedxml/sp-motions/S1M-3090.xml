*S1M-3090 Christine Grahame: Timber Industry in the Scottish Borders-That the Parliament notes the terms of S1M-2953 in the name of Alex Fergusson; further notes that the largest timber growing area in the UK is the Kielder forest in the Scottish Borders and that the most effective manner of removing dangerous and destructive lorries hauling timber through the small towns and villages of the Southern Borders is to reinstate not just the northern but also the southern half of the Waverley line, and believes that the Scottish Executive should undertake a fresh and full study into the environmental impact of removing this freight from road to rail.
