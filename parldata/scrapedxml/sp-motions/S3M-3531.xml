 *S3M-3531 Karen Whitefield: North Lanarkshire Social Work Services—That the Parliament congratulates North Lanarkshire Council and the staff within social work services on the excellent report received from the Social Work Inspection Agency; recognises that this is the second best inspection report in Scotland, which is particularly impressive given the relatively high levels of deprivation within North Lanarkshire, and acknowledges that, following on from the positive HM Inspectorate of Education report last year on child protection services, this is a clear indication of the commitment of social work staff within North Lanarkshire to provide the highest levels of care for all clients.
