*S2M-4347 Frances Curran: Aberdeen University Staff Threatened with Pay Stoppage—That the Parliament is appalled at the threat made by Professor Stephen Logan, Senior Vice Principal of the University of Aberdeen, to stop entirely the pay and pension contributions of all staff taking part in the present industrial action short of a strike; considers that this threat, conveyed by Professor Logan in an email to all staff, would constitute an unlawful deduction of wages if carried out; supports the AUT, NATFHE and EIS members in their campaign for better wages and conditions; considers that the union members were forced to take industrial action by the failure of the employers to respond to their pay claim; commends the university staff for the goodwill displayed with regard to carrying out unpaid overtime to ensure that students’ assessments are marked on time and regards the draconian response to the industrial action as seriously undermining this goodwill; believes that if this pay stoppage goes ahead the unions would be fully justified in stepping up their action to all-out strike, and demands that the Court of the University of Aberdeen refuses to authorise the pay stoppage and forces the employers to engage in constructive and unconditional pay talks. Supported by: Rosie Kane*, Carolyn Leckie*, Tommy Sheridan*
