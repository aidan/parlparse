*S2M-3467 Mr Mark Ruskell: GM Contamination and the Impossibility of Coexistence—That the Parliament notes with concern the publication of Persistence of seeds from crops of conventional and herbicide tolerant oilseed rape, a DEFRA-commissioned report showing that enough GM contamination to breach the EU reporting threshold can remain viable for up to 15 years after the harvest of the initial GM crop; believes that such research demonstrates that coexistence between GM and conventional crops is unlikely to be possible but is likely to result in widespread contamination of Scottish crops, and acknowledges the need for a comprehensive GM-liability regime to protect the economic interests of farmers wishing to remain GM-free.
