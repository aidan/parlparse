*S3M-2966.2 Liam McArthur: Sea Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "welcomes the work that Scottish fishermen have been taking forward with government, scientists and others over recent years to develop a more sophisticated approach to protecting cod and safeguarding fishing opportunities; recognises that the process of improving stakeholder involvement in EU fisheries policy began with the establishment of the influential regional advisory councils, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue driving forward this regionalised approach as a means of improving fisheries management decisions within the Common Fisheries Policy in the interests of sustaining stocks, Scotland’s fishing fleet and the communities that depend on it."
