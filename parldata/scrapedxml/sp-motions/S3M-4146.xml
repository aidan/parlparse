 *S3M-4146 Aileen Campbell: Putting Lanarkshire Onlineâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Carstairs Junction resident Arthur Grainger on his initiative to put the towns of South Lanarkshire, including those in the South of Scotland region, on the internet with a series of social networking sites for each town and village in the area; notes that these sites have already attracted great interest from the local community and support from traditional media outlets including the local newspapers and radio stations; believes that initiatives such as this provide an important opportunity for people to link up and learn more about their local area, and wishes Arthur and the project every success in the future.
