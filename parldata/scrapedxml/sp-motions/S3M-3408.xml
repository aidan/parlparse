 *S3M-3408# John Wilson: Pressurised Area Status in North Lanarkshireâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Scottish Government to grant pressurised area status to the North Lanarkshire Council areas of Cumbernauld and Moodiesburn, which enables the council to suspend the right to buy to tenants who started their tenancy after 30 September 2002, and considers that the action by the government and council should stop the decline of housing stock lost through right to buy and ensure that the council can maintain control over existing housing stock.
