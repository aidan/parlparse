*S3M-6593 Rhoda Grant: Action Scotland Against Stalking—That the Parliament congratulates Action Scotland Against Stalking on winning the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations’ Campaign of the Year Award in recognition of its work to introduce a definition of stalking into Scots Law; notes in particular the work undertaken by Ann Moulds who, after losing her home and business after becoming the victim of a stalker, launched the campaign to introduce stalking legislation into the Scottish criminal justice system; further notes that, as a result of that campaign, training modules are now being developed to be delivered throughout police forces, along with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service developing a stalking-awareness training DVD to be delivered to all Crown Office and Procurator staff, and considers that training and awareness in this area is important in ensuring that the crime of stalking is dealt with properly and effectively.
