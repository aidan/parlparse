*S3M-924 Patrick Harvie: Smart Metering—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Look Smart, a campaign by energywatch, the Energy Retail Association and Utility Week; recognises that smart metering has the potential to put an end to estimated energy bills, give consumers accurate, understandable and up-to-date information on the energy that they are using, remove the additional cost to service pre-payment meters and have a positive impact on fuel poverty and carbon emissions; notes that a national introduction of smart meters has broad support from the energy industry, consumer groups and environmental organisations, and calls on the Scottish Government to press the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to fulfil the expectation outlined in the Energy white paper that, within the next 10 years, all domestic energy customers will have smart meters.
