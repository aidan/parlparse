 * S2M-1635 Patrick Harvie:Sexual Health and Relationships Strategy—That the Parliament notes that the draft Sexual Health and Relationships Strategy recommends full implementation of the McCabe report published in June 2000; condemns the misinformation being circulated about the contents of the draft strategy, in particular the suggestion that the strategy proposes the use of “graphic and intimate sexual instruction” in pre-school settings; believes that the description of “the growing army of sexual health service providers who push a value-free agenda” is another such gross distortion; regrets that a public figure with the prominence of Cardinal Keith O’ Brien should choose to misrepresent the strategy in such a way, and would welcome an apology from Cardinal O’ Brien for his comments in the press.
