*S2M-1028 Chris Ballance: Protection of Aucheninnes Mossâ€”That the Parliament recognises that Aucheninnes Moss in Dumfries and Galloway is one of the few examples of active raised bog habitat that survives in the lowlands and as such has significant conservation value at local, regional and even international level; is concerned about the decision to destroy the habitat at Aucheninnes Moss and replace it with a landfill site; is further concerned that this action threatens the extinction of two species of insect in Scotland, the bog bush-cricket (Metrioptera brachyptera) and the Sorrel pygmy moth (Enteucha acetosae) and that it will also destroy a population of the endangered large heath butterfly (Coenonympha tullia) and a foraging area for vulnerable nightjars (Caprimulgus europaeus); welcomes the report by Buglife, The Invertebrate Conservation Trust, showing that Aucheninnes Moss fits the EU Habitats Directive category of an "active raised bog" habitat and also the category "degraded raised bog capable of regeneration", and, therefore, calls on the Scottish Executive to request that Scottish Natural Heritage afford Aucheninnes Moss protection by designating it a Special Area of Conservation.
