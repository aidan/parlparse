*S1M-1828 Ms Margo MacDonald: Palestine Recognition—That the Parliament recognises the importance of recent statements on Palestine emanating from the Arab League summit in Jordan; notes that the summit’s condemnation of Israel reflects growing anger in the Arab world at the torment of Palestinians under occupation; further notes that the present level of lethal force employed by the Israeli Defence Force in the West Bank and Gaza, and its policy of collective punishment, are destabilising factors in the region; encourages the peace movement within Israel to maintain its efforts to persuade Israeli citizens that until there is a just settlement which gives the Palestinians the same rights, justice and dignity which Israelis claim for themselves, that is a free independent state, the spiral of violence will not abate, and calls upon the United States and Israel to recognise the need to meet Palestinian aspirations, starting with an immediate de-escalation of the military force now used by Israel.
