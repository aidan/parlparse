*S2M-3177 Richard Baker: Aberdeen City Council Pay Restructuring—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by the administration of Aberdeen City Council to restructure pay in a way which could see some staff have their pay reduced by as much as 30%; notes that staff are now considering industrial action as a result of this decision; believes that the dismay and anger of the Council’s workers not only result from this decision but also from the entirely inadequate consultation with trade unions during the pay restructuring process; further believes that, while the national agreement between COSLA and the trade unions to ensure that poorly paid council staff do indeed receive fairer wages is very welcome, Aberdeen City Council’s administration has approached this process in an inept and unfair manner, and urges the Council administration to acknowledge the concerns of its staff, meet with trade unions and reconsider its proposals.
