*S2M-648# Eleanor Scott: European Chemicals Regulation-That the Parliament applauds WWF Scotland's chemicals campaign; notes with serious concern mounting evidence that suggests that hormone-disrupting chemicals and chemicals that persist and bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife are linked to a range of adverse physiological and mental effects, including effects on reproduction, cancers, genital deformities and neurological and developmental problems; considers that exposure to such chemicals in the environment must be reduced to protect human health and the environment; notes the importance of the Parliament reaching a view on the proposed new European Union (EU) chemicals legislation known as REACH, carrying out an inquiry into the matter and making its view known to the UK Parliament and the EU, and in the meantime considers that the EU and UKRep should support the strongest possible controls on endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the phasing out of hazardous and potentially harmful chemicals in favour of safer alternatives where they are available.
