 * S2M-3102 Linda Fabiani: Human Rights in Western Sahara—That the Parliament notes with concern recent reports of demonstrations and arrests in the occupied territory of the Western Sahara, while noting with particular concern credible reports of disappearances and torture of Saharawi students, activists and human rights workers by Moroccan security forces; condemns these actions by Morocco and calls on the Scottish Executive to do likewise; calls on MINURSO to investigate and report on the recent turmoil and to reinvigorate efforts to find a solution to the Western Sahara dispute, and further calls on Her Majesty’s Government, under the United Kingdom’s responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to propose at the UN Security Council a deadline for Morocco to accept the Baker Plan, which was fully endorsed by the Security Council in 2003 under resolution 1495 (2003) and has since been rejected by Morocco.
