 *S3M-1343# Sandra White: Domestic Violence and Alcohol—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the link between the over-consumption of alcohol and a rise in domestic violence, illustrated by figures showing that 60% of all domestic abuse cases reported to Strathclyde Police between April and December 2007 were alcohol related; welcomes the important work to tackle domestic abuse undertaken by the present and previous administrations; further welcomes the commitment by Strathclyde’s new chief constable, Stephen House, to promote a more rigorous approach to ending domestic violence, such as removing the offender rather than the victim from the family unit, and hopes that these achievements can be strengthened and built on to bring an end to the terrible suffering of the victims of domestic abuse.
