*S3M-6472.2 Margaret Smith: Student Fees—As an amendment to motion (S3M-6472) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "notes the ongoing review of higher education and student finance in England and Wales; recognises that the Scottish Government will need to consider any outcomes of this review and the potential impact on Scottish universities; commends the National Union of Students’ student fee pledge, and welcomes that, thanks to the actions of the previous and current administrations in Scotland, full-time Scottish higher education students studying in Scotland do not pay tuition fees or top-up fees."
