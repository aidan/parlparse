*S2M-4607&lt;&gt; Christine Grahame: The Hidden Price of Treatment—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of Macmillan Cancer Support that, while the average cancer patient in the United Kingdom pays £325 in travel and parking costs over the course of treatment, in Scotland this cost rises to £636 as cancer patients travel on average 53 times to hospital for treatment, a situation which is exacerbated in rural areas such as the south of Scotland; further notes that, of the 70% of cancer patients who face extra costs to get treatment, only 22% receive financial help and, of these, only 4% receive help from existing government schemes; notes that this situation is compounded by an average loss of income of 50% as a direct result of cancer, and therefore considers that the Scottish government should review urgently the financial assistance available for travel costs and consider an exemption from hospital car parking charges for all who require repeat courses of treatment for cancer and other life-threatening conditions. Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Mr John Swinney*, Fiona Hyslop*
