*S3M-2689 Nanette Milne: Gordon Rural Action’s 30th Anniversary—That the Parliament congratulates Gordon Rural Action (GRA) on its 30th anniversary; notes that GRA began its life as the Huntly Area People’s Information Centre with the first advice centre opening in Huntly on 16 October 1978, that by 1983 the name Gordon Rural Action and Information Network (GRAIN) had been adopted as the organisation’s services extended to cover the whole of the Gordon district, that a second advice centre was opened in Inverurie in 1984 and a third in Ellon in 1989; further notes that over the years GRAIN has been involved in setting up a job club, training groups, after school clubs and play schemes and launching a mobile advice centre, Huntly Mental Health and a number of local groups; also notes that the Carers Support Service was set up in 1992 to identify unpaid carers throughout the community and that by 1997 the support worker was noticing the number of young carers potentially needing support and help, this leading to a Young Carers Support service being set up; notes too that in 1999 the organisation changed its name from GRAIN to GRA; recognises that today GRA provides services to people in central Aberdeenshire such as advice on benefits, housing and employment law and a wide range of issues, plus a money advice service, carers and young carers support and a skillsharers befriending project, all of these delivered via advice centres in Huntly, Inverurie and Ellon; notes also that Gordon Rural Action relies on grants, donations and fundraising activities to exist; acknowledges the success of the thrift shop in Huntly in raising money to support its work, and congratulates all who have been involved over the past 30 years in responding to the needs of the community and wishes all involved well for the next 30.
