*S1M-3356 Ms Margo MacDonald: Drug Testing Regime of the International Olympic Committee-That the Parliament urges the International Olympic Committee to adopt a more rigorous regime that will conclusively and unambiguously identify methamphetamine in tests for banned substances carried out on athletes to ensure that no athlete is automatically banned from competing with the subsequent loss of reputation, earnings and, in the case of Alain Baxter, an Olympic medal which was won fairly and without the use of a performance-enhancing drug, as objective scientific opinion now verifies. Supported by: Donald Gorrie*
