 *S2M-1153 Donald Gorrie: Support for the Scots Language-That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to set up a board to promote the use and study of the Scots language similar to the Ulster-Scots Agency, set up under the Good Friday Agreement, which advises ministers and co-ordinates activities relating to the promotion of Ulster-Scots as a living language and to respond to international criticism such as "That Scots language in Scotland is very clearly under-funded, under-researched, under-maintained compared to Gaelic, Irish or Ulster Scots" by providing greater support for the Scots language.
