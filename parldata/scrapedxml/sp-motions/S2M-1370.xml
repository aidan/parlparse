*S2M-1370 Frances Curran: US Aggression Towards Cuba-That the Parliament condemns the report announced on 6 May 2004 by the misnamed "Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba", appointed by President George W Bush, which contains measures to further tighten the US Government's hostile policy against Cuba; notes that the measures include new restrictions on Cuban-born citizens living in the US travelling to Cuba and spending money on their families there and, even more worryingly, measures aimed at subverting the Cuban Government by increasing the funds provided to counter-revolutionary groups, developing a global media campaign to undermine Cuba's image at international level and creating a worldwide disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the Cuban tourist industry, thereby affecting the Cuban economy; further notes that some $59 million has been earmarked for these measures, which also include promises of assistance to a "post-Castro government"; considers that these measures are part of a longer-term plan to recolonize Cuba; condemns the US Government's attempt to increase the extremely difficult conditions already imposed on the Cuban people by the illegal economic and investment blockade it has enforced for 45 years; declares that this further attempt to subdue the Cuban population through hunger and disease is a violation of human rights and constitutes a flagrant breach of international law; notes that the Cuban Government fears that these measures are a prelude to invasion by the United States, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to distance itself urgently from the US policy of aggression towards Cuba and join with countries, including Spain and Mexico, in denouncing this report and the measures contained within.
