*S3M-3085 Jim Hume: Save Our Forests—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the Scottish Government’s proposal to lease 25% of the most commercially viable, publicly-owned Scottish forests to private investment companies for up to 75 years; further notes that the 25% could equate to 40% of production for the Forestry Commission, which could significantly diminish essential income for investment in maintaining tourist activities such as the 7stanes network and for creating new leisure-access initiatives such as mountain biking, walking, orienteering and other community woodland projects; recognises the importance of Scotland’s woods and forests and the potential for raising capital for expansion of woodland cover; considers that Forestry Commission jobs and associated jobs are under threat; recognises that timber and wood processing companies depend on security of wood supply and that Forestry Commission cutting contracts face an uncertain future if those cutting rights are taken away; urges the Scottish Government to commit to maintaining sufficient availability of wood for these industries; considers that the Scottish Government should commission a comprehensive survey of wood availability and demand, in conjunction with Forestry Commission Scotland, Forestry Commission Wales and Forestry Commission England and with the wood industries; recognises with concern the detrimental effects that this proposal could have on the Scottish landscape, economy and environment, and calls for its immediate withdrawal from the Scottish Climate Change Bill.
