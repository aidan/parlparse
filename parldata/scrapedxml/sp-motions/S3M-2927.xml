*S3M-2927 John Scott: Robert Burns 250th Anniversary Souvenir Stamp—That the Parliament notes the intention of the Royal Mail to produce a Robert Burns 250th anniversary issue souvenir sheet of stamps; further notes that it is not intended that individual Burns 250th anniversary stamps be produced and that the only way in which the Burns anniversary stamp can therefore be purchased is as part of the souvenir sheet at a cost of £2.66; believes that this represents a huge missed opportunity to promote Burns in the year of Homecoming Scotland 2009, both at home and abroad, and calls on the Royal Mail to reconsider its position and to commission the issue of individual Burns 250th anniversary stamps, to be available for purchase at face value through post office branches.
