 * S2M-2801 Robert Brown:Right to Buy—That the Parliament notes the need for provision for pressured area status in respect of right to buy under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001; notes, however, the lack of take-up of the status by local authorities and the extent of the requirements made of local authorities by the Scottish Executive on the matter; believes that a balanced use of right to buy requires an effective pressured area status, and takes the view that the Executive should simplify the criteria required to obtain pressured area status.
