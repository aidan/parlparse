 *S3M-7052♦ Bill Wilson: Business and Human Rights Conference, October 2010—That the Parliament welcomes to Edinburgh the business and human rights conference of 80 national human rights institutions from around the world, taking place in the Parliament from 8 to 10 October 2010; considers that the corporate sector has a significant impact on the enjoyment of human rights from Paisley to Phuket and believes that humanitarian concern does not compromise but rather helps deliver long-term commercial success; believes that the integration of human rights into business practices should be enabled and encouraged, building on the United Nations Global Compact and the framework developed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and, as a first step, would welcome an acknowledgement of the relevance of human rights principles and standards in defining Scottish business practice at home and abroad.
