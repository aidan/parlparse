 *S2M-1846 Donald Gorrie: Supporting Community Cultural, Sports and Educational Services—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the continuing reductions in public libraries’ book funds, in the number of books issued each year and the number of professional librarians employed and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that local authorities can resource a continuing increase in access to IT in libraries for the public, a reversal of the decline in money spent on books and provide library services in conjunction with other community, sports, cultural or educational services to encourage greater use of all of these services.
