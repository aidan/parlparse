 *S1M-3806 Brian Fitzpatrick: National Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January 2003 -That the Parliament acknowledges that the Holocaust shook the foundations of modern civilisation and that its unprecedented character and horror will always hold universal meaning; condemns the evils of prejudice, discrimination and racism and affirms the values of a free, tolerant, and democratic society; believes that the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation's collective memory; honours the survivors still with us and reaffirms our commitment to the shared values of mutual understanding and justice; encourages educators, policy-makers, elected representatives, church and community leaders and parents to work together so that future generations understand the causes of the Holocaust and reflect upon its consequences and vows to remember the victims of Nazi persecution and of all genocide; values the sacrifices of those who risked their lives to protect or rescue victims, as a touchstone of the human capacity for good in the face of evil; recognises that humanity is still scarred by beliefs that nationality, race, religion, disability or sexuality make some people's lives worth less than others and notes that genocide, anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination still continue to scar humanity's conscience; pledges to work together against these evils and to strengthen our efforts to promote education and research about the Holocaust and other genocide to make sure that the lessons of such events are fully learnt, and further encourages continuing Holocaust remembrance by holding an annual UK Holocaust Memorial Day and associated local events.
