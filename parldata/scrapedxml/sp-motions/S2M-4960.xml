*S2M-4960 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Protection for Rural and Special Schoolsâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern that the Scottish Executive has closed 64 rural and 23 special schools since 1999; further notes that rural and special schools foster an ethos of inclusion and sense of community which is advantageous to the intellectual and social development of children; believes that children learn better in smaller class sizes; calls therefore for smaller class sizes of no more than 20 children, and further calls on the Executive to initiate a presumption against closure of rural and special schools until an analysis has been undertaken of the needs and future needs of the local communities, including any present and future housebuilding and a projection of numbers of children likely to access local schools.
