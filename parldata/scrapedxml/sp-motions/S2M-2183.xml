*S2M-2183# John Scott: Inadequacies of Funding for Care—That the Parliament notes the Cost of Care Report which was independently audited by the Scottish Local Authority Management Centre and points out the inadequacy of Scottish Executive funding for care; regrets that the funding shortfall will reduce the number of continuing care beds and the quality of care provision and will increase bed blocking; notes that nursing home fees are running at £73 per person per week below the cost of provision; further notes that residential home fees are running at more than £42 per person per week below the cost of provision, and agrees with COSLA and Scottish Care that the Executive must address this shortfall.
