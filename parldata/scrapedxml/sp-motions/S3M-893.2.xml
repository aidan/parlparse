*S3M-893.2 Sarah Boyack: Annual Sea Fisheries Negotiationsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-893) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "agrees that the precautionary principle should prevail in setting levels of permissible fishing activity; acknowledges that much more work needs to be done to create a truly sustainable fishery in the North Sea, including measures to reduce dramatically if not eliminate discards, recognising that one good year class does not of itself create a sustainable fishery stock, and further agrees that there needs to be dialogue between the fishing industry, scientists and conservation interests to ensure continuous improvement in stocks and a long-term sustainable future for the industry."
