*S3M-6894 Jamie Hepburn: Airdrie Savings Bank Expansion Plans—That the Parliament welcomes the announced £10 million investment in the Airdrie Savings Bank in order to support its expansion and development; notes that the bank, which this year celebrated its 175th anniversary, is the last remaining independent bank in Scotland; believes that the bank’s principles and prudence have allowed it to weather the current economic storm more effectively than many other financial institutions; further notes the bank’s expansion plans to open at least one new branch, possibly two, over the next 18 months; encourages anyone interested in opening an account with the bank to register this on the bank’s website; wishes Airdrie Savings Bank every success with these plans, and hopes that the bank will be a model and inspiration for savers, investors and other financial institutions in Scotland in the coming years.
