 *S2M-5788 Jackie Baillie: Caring for Older People in Argyll and Bute—That the Parliament deeply regrets that Argyll and Bute Council continues to spend below the level of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) on care of the elderly services; notes that the underspend has grown from the previous financial year, with £6 million diverted from the home-based elderly/personal nursing care budget alone; further notes that there is currently a waiting list for care packages amounting to £2 million; believes that Argyll and Bute Council is the only local authority that has seen an increase in delayed discharge cases; recognises that the Social Work Inspection Agency is currently inspecting the service at the instigation of the Scottish Executive, and calls on Argyll and Bute Council to reinstate immediately the funding required to serve the needs of older people in the area and, if they fail to do so, calls on the Executive to intervene formally to ensure that the interests of older people are properly served.
