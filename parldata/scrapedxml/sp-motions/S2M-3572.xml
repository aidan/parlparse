*S2M-3572 Michael Matheson: Scottish Football Team—That the Parliament condemns the British Olympic Association (BOA) on its attempts to undermine the Scottish Football Association (SFA); notes its latest stunt of an internet survey which it claims demonstrates that a majority of Scots support the idea of a GB football team; notes that the survey results included responses from Cumbria and the Isle of Man, demonstrating the BOA’s need for a lesson in Scottish geography; further notes that in total only 90 Scots responded to the survey, highlighting that this was nothing more than a political stunt orchestrated by the BOA; supports the SFA and the majority of Scottish football fans, including the tartan army, who wish Scotland to maintain an independent international football team, and calls on the BOA to focus on organising a successful London Olympics and to respect the decision of the SFA.Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham*, Rob Gibson*, Jim Mather*, Christine Grahame*
