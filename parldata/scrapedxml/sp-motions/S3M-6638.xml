*S3M-6638 Peter Peacock: Illegal Killing of Birds of Prey—That the Parliament considers that birds of prey are important indicators of the health of the environment and that, despite best efforts, many of Scotland’s native species of bird of prey have an unfavourable conservation status, often due to illegal killing; considers that the prevalence of this criminality is most obvious in upland areas, particularly in some areas managed for driven grouse shooting in the southern uplands and central and eastern Highlands; welcomes the steps taken by PAWS and recent environment ministers to address the problem of illegal killing of birds of prey; welcomes recent statements by landowning bodies condemning illegal poisoning but hopes that this will be translated into positive action on the ground and demonstrable improvements in the range and breeding success of key bird of prey species; expresses concern at any prospect of licensed control of birds of prey to protect reared pheasants or other gamebirds; applauds the work of the Langholm Moor Demonstration Project as a constructive approach; understands that any move toward licensed control of birds of prey would make Scotland the only country in Europe to routinely sanction such action, sending out mixed messages to land managers about the obligation to conserve some of our most threatened species, and expresses concern that this would have implications for Scotland’s international reputation and for important sectors, such as tourism.
