*S3M-5274♦ Aileen Campbell: Leaked Documents Raise Serious Questions about Iraq Conflict—That the Parliament notes with serious concern the publication of leaked documents and post-operational reports regarding the conflict in Iraq; further notes that these documents appear to suggest that planning for UK military activity in Iraq had been taking place since February 2002, while UK Government ministers denied that such planning was taking place; notes the widespread opposition to the war in the south of Scotland region and across the country as a whole, and would welcome the examination of these documents, along with any and all other evidence about the build-up to the conflict, the conflict itself and its aftermath and that, should evidence emerge of wrongdoing and illegality in decision making, those responsible be held to account. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*, Bill Wilson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Alasdair Allan*, Brian Adam*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Stuart McMillan*, Sandra White* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
