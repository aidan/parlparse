*S3M-1858 Mary Mulligan: National Epilepsy Week—That the Parliament recognises the contribution made by Epilepsy Scotland and fellow Scottish members of the Joint Epilepsy Council of the UK and Ireland (JEC) to raise awareness and combat the stigma associated with epilepsy; supports these organisations in marking National Epilepsy Week; acknowledges that just 50 years ago some people with uncontrollable seizures were hidden away in asylums or sent to live in epilepsy "colonies"; congratulates JEC organisations in challenging this kind of segregation and informing public attitudes; applauds initiatives by the Cross-Party Group on Epilepsy and Scottish JEC members to educate school staff and pupils about epilepsy; values the Scottish Government’s ongoing support for Epilepsy Scotland’s Employer of the Year award which recognises epilepsy best practice, and praises the awareness training provided for the Parliament’s own staff so that epilepsy is no longer hidden and misunderstood.
