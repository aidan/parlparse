*S3M-7442 Jeremy Purvis: Heriot-Watt University School of Textiles and Design Links with China—That the Parliament congratulates Heriot-Watt University’s School of Textiles and Design on its exhibition held last week in Beijing’s Tsinghua University as part of its ongoing partnership with both Tsinghua University and the leading cashmere firm, Johnston’s of Elgin; notes that, by displaying Scottish expertise in the textile and fashion industry as well as developing the textile skills of Chinese students, Heriot-Watt is helping with the promotion of what is considered the valuable Scottish cashmere business in China’s emerging market, and, finally, welcomes what it considers the important social and economic links with China that are being developed by the university.
