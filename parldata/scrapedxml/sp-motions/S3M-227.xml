 *S3M-227 John Scott: Scottish Bowel Screening Programme—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme which will invite all men and women in Scotland between the ages of 50 to 74 for screening every two years; recognises that the programme is now being phased in across Scotland and by the end of 2009 will be available in all NHS board areas, and considers however that the screening programme should be extended to include the children of bowel cancer sufferers under the age of 50.
