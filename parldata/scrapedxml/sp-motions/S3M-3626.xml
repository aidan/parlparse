*S3M-3626♦ Johann Lamont: Credit Unions, Pioneering Roles in the Community—That the Parliament notes the important role of credit unions within the Glasgow Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland; in particular, congratulates Pollok Credit Union on its unique and pioneering decision to set up an enterprise trust to take over the running of Pollok Post Office, manage a daycare nursery and offer a budgeting service to those with multiple debt problems, thereby securing jobs and services in the local community and beyond; recognises the real opportunity that these partnerships can provide in offering financial services and money advice to communities feeling the impact of economic recession, and considers that all possible ways by which further such enterprises can be encouraged should be explored.
