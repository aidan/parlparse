*S3M-4133 Bob Doris: Continuing Support for Glasgow Parents Against School Closures—That the Parliament congratulates parents from across Glasgow who have campaigned against school closures; welcomes their visits to the Scottish Parliament, including their visit on Thursday 14 May 2009; is outraged at Glasgow City Council’s decision to push ahead with closures in the face of 96% opposition during the consultation process; notes that there is no system of call-in by which the Scottish Government can intervene in the process and that only a system of referral by local authorities to the Scottish Government exists; supports any legal recourse that may be taken by parents to prevent closure and hopes that this will be successful, and further hopes that even at this late stage Glasgow City Council will have a change of heart and halt the impending closures. Supported by: Jamie Hepburn*, Alasdair Allan*
