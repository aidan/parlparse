*S2M-4134 Mr Mark Ruskell: Wild Animals in Circuses—That the Parliament is concerned for the welfare of wild animals in circuses; commends the Born Free Foundation for its investigation into this issue and notes the findings of the scientifically based report by the Born Free Foundation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; recognises that, due to their dependency on regular travel, circuses cannot provide sizeable and complex living conditions for wild animals; further recognises that, under such circumstances, satisfactory standards of welfare cannot be provided, and therefore supports the introduction of measures to end the use of wild animals in circuses.
