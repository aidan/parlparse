 *S2M-4504 Alex Neil: TV Licensing Savings Stamps—That the Parliament notes that individuals will no longer be able to purchase TV Licensing savings stamps from the Post Office after 31 July 2006; regrets this move which, when added to the increase in cost of the licence, will hit hard those who have been used to paying for their TV licences in this manner, and calls on the BBC to rethink its decision to remove this service and to retain it to operate in tandem with its new services offered by PayPoint plc to allow those who would prefer to continue using the savings stamps at their local post office to do so.
