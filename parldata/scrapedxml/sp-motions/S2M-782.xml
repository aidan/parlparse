 *S2M-782 Nicola Sturgeon: Religious Dress-That the Parliament notes the intention of French President Jacques Chirac to ban the wearing of religious symbols including Islamic headscarves in schools; further notes that other European leaders, notably Gerhard Schroeder, have made statements against Islamic dress and a number of German states are planning legislation outlawing the dress; believes that it is the right of any person to dress as they believe as long as there is no threat to public health, order or morality; further believes that this position is reflected in Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and supports the International Day of Action for the hijab (headscarf) on 17 January 2004, including a protest outside the French Consulate in Edinburgh.
