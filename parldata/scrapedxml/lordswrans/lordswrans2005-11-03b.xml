	<p pid="b.39.2/1">Avian influenza is a disease which mainly affects birds, with infrequent cases in those people who are closely exposed to infected poultry. However, if the virus evolves into a strain which readily infects people and is easily transmissible, this could result in a human influenza pandemic. We are working to ensure that both health professionals and the public have access to information about pandemic flu. The Chief Medical Officer has produced an explanatory guide on pandemic flu. In addition, a public information leaflet, frequently asked questions and key facts sheets have been developed. These are available on the Department of Health website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu">www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu</a> and have been distributed to primary care professionals.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/2">In the event of a pandemic, in order to reduce their risk of pandemic flu, people will be advised to:</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/3">If you are ill during a pandemic:</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/4" class="indent">stay at home if you are ill, or think you may be ill;</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/5" class="indent">drink plenty of fluids;</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/6" class="indent">take medicines to reduce fever; and</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/7" class="indent">if your symptoms are getting worse, contact your general practitioner or NHS Direct.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/8">To reduce risk of infection:</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/9" class="indent">wash hands frequently (particularly after contact with people who are ill);</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/10" class="indent">cover mouth and nose with a tissue while sneezing or coughing;</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/11" class="indent">dispose of used tissues promptly and carefully&mdash;bag and bin them;</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/12" class="indent">wash hard surfaces (for example, worktops, door knobs) with a domestic cleaner regularly;</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/13" class="indent">avoid unnecessary travel;</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/14" class="indent">avoid crowds where possible; and</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/15" class="indent">ensure your children follow this advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.43.8/1">There were three main agenda points at the European Union informal meeting of Health Ministers, held on 20 and <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.8/2">The first session focused on EU pandemic preparedness. Ministers received a technical update on scientific predictions of the size, scale and likelihood of a human pandemic outbreak. The World Health Organisation and European Commission made a presentation on pandemic preparedness and Ministers discussed requirements at EU, national and international level.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.8/3">The second session was on the shared values and common principles in health systems. Although there is much diversity in health systems throughout the EU, there is also much that unites countries across the political spectrum in Europe in terms of universality, equity and solidarity. There are also shared challenges such as ageing, technology and consumer expectations. Discussions covered how the EU can both meet the challenge of economic development in a globalised world and still maintain its commitment to high levels of social protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.8/4">The final session was on patient mobility. Co-operation has existed for decades between EU health systems so that workers, tourists and people who have retired to other member states can get the care they need. However, there is an increasing need for clarification of patients' entitlements and Ministers looked at the impact of patient mobility and specific areas where there is a lack of clarity about entitlements.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.0/1">Along with other members of the international community, we have been working very hard with President Mkapa, Presidential candidate Kikwete, President Karume and all concerned, to put their personal authority behind a process that would result in a free and fair election on <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase>. I visited Zanzibar in June and made clear to President Karume and the opposition that a peaceful and successful electoral process was central to Zanzibar's future stability and prosperity.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase>, the EU agreed to introduce an extensive ban on imports into the Community of wild birds, along with new restrictions on the import of pet birds. In line with previous EU-wide measures, we have already banned imports of all live birds and. products which could potentially transmit the disease from countries with the H5N1 strains of avian influenza.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.3/2">The UK recognises that the situation continues to develop worldwide. Defra has reviewed its overall risk assessment of the threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza. In light of the recent cases in several non-EU countries, it concludes that there is a high risk of further global dispersion. The UK has increased its vigilance to match this increased global risk.</p>
