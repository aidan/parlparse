We welcome the continued commitment of the leaders of both sides to these basic principles. Our continued support for a settlement is not affected by the presence of the sovereign base areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.9/1">We recognise that education, training and employment are a key route out of homelessness and the cycle of disadvantage. We are working closely with colleagues across government, at the Learning and Skills Council and in the voluntary and community sector to tackle the wider causes and symptoms of homelessness, including improving access to learning and skills provision, benefits and jobs. We believe one of the most effective ways we can help homeless people is to ensure that they have access to the skills they need to gain employment and to help them transform their own lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.9/2">Through our World Class Skills reforms, we are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all learners, including the most vulnerable in our communities. Our targets cover workers and learners of all ages and backgrounds and our reforms balance skills and economic prosperity with fairness and inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.9/3">The funding settlement announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review represents the biggest ever government investment in skills. Of the &pound;3 billion we are investing in each of the next three years in adult skills participation, we will invest some &pound;1.5 billion annually in learning below level 2, to help the low skilled and workless learn, progress and achieve sustainable employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.9/4">Our vision for the workforce of the future is of one unrivalled in its skills, dynamism, equity and inclusiveness. We are working with employers through train to gain to meet skill needs and to ensure that all employees have the basic skills, including literacy and numeracy and level 2 skills, to sustain and progress in employment. We also want employers to fill more of their vacancies with people who are further away from the labour market and to actively engage with their sectors and localities to lead on appropriate reform. We are increasing funding for train to gain from &pound;440 million in 2007-08 to over &pound;900 million in 2010-11.</p>

This is the largest ever cash injection for homelessness services, and there are no current plans for further funding over and above this three-year settlement. Homelessness grant is used to support delivery of the Government's targets on homelessness and rough sleeping. Eligibility for public services, including housing, is determined by migrants' immigration status.</p>

The vast majority of local authorities and other bodies which fall within the ombudsman's jurisdiction abide by the ombudsman's recommendations. In 2007-08 to date, only two local authorities have been required to publish a statement of the kind referred to in my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-26">26 February</phrase>. No statements were published in 2006-07 and only one was published in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="a.241.6/1">We have no plans to amend planning policy statement 9 at this time. Planning policy statements set out the Government's national policies on different aspects of planning. Planning authorities must have regard to these policies when preparing plans and they are material considerations which must be taken into account, where relevant, in decisions on planning applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.0/1">Appointments to the boards of public bodies are made on merit. The Government encourage applications for appointment from a wide range of candidates&mdash;and advertises in national and regional media as appropriate. The final decision, however, is made on merit and the successful candidate will have evidenced the necessary skills and experience required for the role. Where a public body has a particular regional or local focus, every effort is made to encourage applications from the local area. As the report of the New Local Government Network makes clear, the boards of local and regional public bodies&mdash;such as primary care trusts and regional development agencies&mdash;are already broadly representative of the communities they serve.</p>
