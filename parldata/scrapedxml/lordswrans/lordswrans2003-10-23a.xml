	<p pid="a.187.5/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has a statutory duty under Section 3 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the conduct of all criminal proceedings instituted by the police, but an exception is made for proceedings (termed &quot;specified proceedings&quot;) in relation to very minor matters such as regulatory road traffic offences, the routine nature of which does not demand an independent review by the CPS. Specified proceedings cease to be specified at any time a court begins to hear the evidence in the case, at which stage the CPS will take over the conduct of the prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/2">There is no intention to amend this aspect of the statutory relationship between the police and the CPS that underpins the constitutional independence of CPS prosecutors.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/3">There are provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament that do affect the working relationship between the police and CPS. Lord Justice Auld's Review of the Criminal Courts (October 2001) recommended that the CPS take on responsibility for determining the charge in all but minor or routine cases. Joint piloting of this recommendation by the police and CPS has proved very beneficial for the working relationship between the two services and improved their effectiveness in delivering justice on behalf of the public. Provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill will put this new working relationship on a statutory footing and have been widely welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/4">The new relationship that is developing between the police and CPS will impact across the range of criminal cases from relatively minor cases to the most serious of cases involving serious, international and organised crime. As part of this developing relationship, the CPS will have in place from early 2004 a network of lead prosecutors who will provide a focus on anti-social behaviour. These prosecutors will work with the police, local authorities and local communities to bring the expertise of the CPS to tackle low-level crime that can make life a misery, particularly for our poorest communities. This development re-emphasises the role of the CPS as a key part of the criminal justice system to act on behalf of society in bringing offenders to justice and in delivering justice for individual victims and for our wider communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.8/2">The department is considering the report and has not yet drawn any conclusions from it. Analysis published at the same time as the energy White Paper in February 2003 provided estimates of the ancillary benefits associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. A significant part of these benefits derives from improvements to public health. This paper is available at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/ewpscience/ewpancillaryeffects.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/ewpscience/ewp ancillaryeffects.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.192.8/3">The external costs associated with global warming are also covered in the White paper. The Government have a range of policies to encourage renewable energy as well as improving energy efficiency, which are designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by between an additional 15-25MtC by 2020 compared with our business as usual projection. Many of these policies can be achieved at costs which are likely to fall below the marginal external costs of coal and gas generation shown in the Commission's report.</p>
