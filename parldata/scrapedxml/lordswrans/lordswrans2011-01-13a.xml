There is clearly more to do to reduce inequality which is why the schools White Paper <I>The Importance of Teaching</I> highlights the importance of reducing attainment gaps between the rich and the poor while maintaining high standards.

We believe the best way to do this is to address the causes of child poverty, rather than just treat the short-term symptoms.

We will be publishing our child poverty strategy in spring 2011 which will show how we expect a range of policies to help eradicate child poverty.</p>

The spending review confirmed that early years funding has been protected so that all three and four year-olds will continue to receive 15 hours of free nursery education per week, delivered more flexibly. Furthermore, we want to make sure that the poorest two year-olds have the same opportunities as other children, and subject to parliamentary approval, have said that we will extend the entitlement to free early education to all disadvantaged two-year-olds from 2013. The investment over the next four years on free two year-old places will be &#163;64 million in 2011, &#163;233 million in 2012, &#163;331 million in 2013 and &#163;380 million in 2014. In 2011 and 2012 funding will come via the Early Intervention Grant.</p>

	<p pid="a.452.2/2">Vaccination for those in any of the identified risk groups for flu is the best form of protection, and is available from local GPs. H1N1 2009-swine flu- is one of the strains in this year's seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/3">Special schools teaching children with medical conditions that may make them more vulnerable should seek advice from health protection units if they become aware of any cases among their pupils.</p>
