	<p pid="a.149.5/1">The length of time that any individual chooses to spend connected to the Internet is only one measure of internet usage. The same Jupiter MMXI survey confirmed that the UK has the largest number of residential net users in Europe. Any measure is likely to be influenced by a number of factors of which price will be only one.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.5/2">The UK has a vibrant market in Internet service provision, with both pay-as-you-go and unmetered packages available to consumers. The latest set of results from OFTEL's benchmarking studies compared the dial-up Internet service costs--adjusted for purchasing power--for residential users in the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, and the US states of Ohio and California. The figures show that overall the UK consumer had access to the lowest prices of the countries considered for residential off-peak access. The latest OECD survey using similar measures for a more limited set of service providers also showed that the UK consumers benefited from cheaper off-peak connection than those in Germany and Spain and approximately equal to those in Italy.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.6/1">The OECD data are now four months out of date. The latest domestic figures demonstrate a rapid increase in broadband uptake in the UK with BT alone increasing the number of customers for its DSL technology from 14,000 in November 2000 to 54,000 in April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.6/2">The OECD data do, however, illustrate that broadband markets are at very early stages of development around the world. At the end of 2000, 21 of the 30 countries evaluated reported fewer than 1 line per 100 inhabitants. The comparison is, therefore, from a very low base.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.6/3">At such an early stage in the market it is more relevant to measure availability of broadband services as a foundation for market evolution. Using OECD figures, 50 per cent of UK households are now within the area of a broadband-enabled exchange. This is behind the leaders Canada (69 per cent), USA and Germany (both 60 per cent). However, the UK compares well with Italy (52 per cent) and Australia (50 per cent) and is ahead of Japan, France (32 per cent) and Holland (40 per cent), and BT forecast 60 per cent availability by the end of the year. Furthermore, the cable companies--which pass 50 per cent to homes and businesses in the UK--are also rolling out broadband cable modem services. Licences for broadband fixed wireless access have also been issued for areas covering 60 per cent of the population. Together, this represents a firm foundation for continued rapid growth in adoption of broadband services in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.2/1">The decision to proceed with the current proposals for universal banking services was taken at the end of last summer. These proposals will provide a range of banking services which will cater for as wide a range of customers as possible. It will ensure those benefit and pension recipients who wish to continue to collect their benefits money in cash, in full, across a post office counter, will still be able to do so. And it should lead to a substantial increase in the amount of banking at post offices, tapping into a very much larger customer base than benefit recipients alone. This will benefit sub-postmasters both directly and through increased footfall.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.5/1">The Commission has issued a draft Council Directive which would make permanent the temporary ban (introduced in December 1999) on the use of six phthalates in articles intended to be mouthed by children under three years of age and require the labelling of phthalate-containing toys and childcare articles for the under threes.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.5/2">In discussions on the proposed Directive, the UK, following the advice of the Department of Health, and in line with the opinion of the Commission's Independent Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (SCTEE), has adopted the position that the scientific evidence does not support the claim that phthalates are hazardous provided that the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) is not exceeded. Much is known about phthalates but very little is known about the effect of substitutes which could replace them. For this reason, we believe that the regulation of phthalates through migration testing is a practicable alternative to restrictions through banning and we continue to support the ongoing work which is being done, with the involvement of the Commission's Joint Research Council, to develop an acceptable test method.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.5/1">The Government have held the view that carcasses do not pose a major risk of spreading foot and mouth disease from the beginning of the outbreak. They have based this view on advice for the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease at Pirbright and the Environment Agency. The Government are also advised on disease control strategies by their Chief Veterinary Officer and their expert scientific group. Experimental studies have shown that the release of the foot and mouth disease virus from infected animals is greatly reduced after death. This is why it is so important to identify and slaughter infected animals as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/2">The risk from carcasses is greatly reduced as a result of the procedures followed after slaughter. Carcasses are sprayed with an approved disinfectant which has been shown to be highly effective in destroying any virus on the outside of the animal. Approximately 24 hours after slaughter, rigor mortis sets in, whereby lactic acid accumulates and inactivates virus in the muscles. Virus in other internal organs will be inactivated by the processes of decomposition and is, in any case, situated internally. Before burning, the operations team are instructed to spray the pyre with additional disinfectant to reduce any risk of infection spreading at this stage. The virus is then inactivated at temperatures above 50 degrees centigrade. There may be a small thermo-resistant element of the virus which is also destroyed at 70 degrees, but expert opinion is that this is likely to be insignicant in the possible spread of infection from pyres.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.0/1">The Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright has recently produced a report, in collaboration with MAFF and the Meteological Office, on the spread of the foot and mouth disease virus from the burning of animal carcasses on open pyres. This report is to be published in the Veterinary Record shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/2">Six pyres, located in Devon, Exeter and Worcestershire, were monitored. Additional pyres are currently being investigated in Cumbria and Devon. The report concludes that early results indicate that breakdowns due to virus dispersion from pyres are unlikely to occur in general and the pyres analysed to date have shown no evidence that breakdowns due to this cause have occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/3">The Pirbright Institute of Animal Health has informed the Ministry that the virus is inactivated at temperatures above 50 degrees centigrade. There may be a small thermo-resistant element of the virus which is also destroyed at 70 degrees, but expert opinion is that this is likely to be insignificant in the possible spread of infection from pyres.</p>

If these options cannot solve the problem, the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme provides a last resort: priority is being given to the most urgent welfare cases, and a team of vets supported by ADAS technicians and RSPCA experts is assessing applications according to welfare need.

	<p pid="a.162.9/2">Regarding hay and fodder crops, the foot and mouth virus will survive for only relatively short periods of time on pasture. The time taken for the virus to be inactivated is dependent on temperature and humidity; higher temperatures and dryness reducing survival times. In addition, the oral infectious dose is high compared with that which will cause infection when inhaled, so that any risks are judged to be minimal.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.11/1">Our principal concern at present is to increase the availability of British lamb, beef and pork to the UK market. We are anxious that, as far as disease control measures allow, as many animals as possible should enter the human food chain and we have recently announced changes in disease restrictions to facilitate this.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.11/2">To make a case for private storage aid in any of these sectors we should need to be able to satisfy the European Commission on three points:</p>
	<p pid="a.163.11/3" class="indent">That the market is operating normally;</p>
	<p pid="a.163.11/4" class="indent">That there is significant excess of supply over demand, leading to marked price weakness; and</p>
	<p pid="a.163.11/5" class="indent">That there is a reasonable prospect that meat taken into store can be released on to the market between three and seven month's storage, without leading to further market disruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.11/6">These conditions are currently not met. In particular, the Commission has indicated that it does not believe that private storage aid for sheepmeat should be granted at present (despite relatively weak prices) because most of the meat to be stored would be hogget (i.e. old season's lamb) meat which would not readily find a market when released from storage, as the market would then be dominated by new season's lamb.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.11/7">Market prices for beef and pigmeat are not sufficiently weak to justify an approach to the Commission in respect of private storage aid for these products.</p>

Arrangements for exempting rare breeds of sheep and goats, and other pedigree sheep and goats of high genetic value, and genuinely hefted sheep, such as Herdwicks and Swaledales, from contiguous and 3km culls have now been introduced and guidance issued. The guidance explains what information needs to be submitted to gain exemption. A copy of this guidance is being placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.5/2">These arrangements allow for owners of sheep or goats who think their stock may qualify and are notified it is to be slaughtered as part of a contiguous or 3km cull to apply for exemption from their local Divisional Veterinary Manager (DVM). Owners need to show that the animals can be isolated from other susceptible livestock, and managed in compliance with tight biosecurity. Before registration as an exempted flock/herd, the DVM will arrange for blood samples to be taken for testing. The results for these blood tests must be negative for registration to be granted; positive blood tests will result in the flock/herd being slaughtered.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.9/2">The UK is rolling out broadband at a rate comparable with most European countries, although we are arguably 12-18 months behind the United States. It is, however, right to be concerned about the need to accelerate and broaden roll-out, which is why an action plan aimed at making the UK the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 has recently been published by the Office of the E-Envoy.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.2/1">On March 6, 2001, I announced a wider remit for phase two of the enforcement review, Official Report, col. WA 20. The review has identified the need for independent expert advice from the private, independent and public sectors actively involved in enforcement and a market evaulation of the delivery of enforcement services. I will therefore establish an advisory group on the delivery of enforcement services to guarantee openness and transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">The broader remit of the enforcement review enables us to set better, more wide-ranging public service agreement targets, ensuring that enforcement is carried out to a consistent standard. The current target (to achieve a 10 per cent increase in the amount recovered per pound under executed warrants issued in the county courts in 2001-04) was due to be reviewed in July 2001. The new target will need to take account of the findings of the enforcement review, to be more closely linked to service delivery and to measure return to the customer. We will now set new targets for civil enforcement by December 2001 and implement them in 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.5/1">As part of the ongoing reform of the civil justice system and the review of civil enforcement, we have been reviewing the remedy of distress for rent. We recognise that there are concerns about the current procedure whereby landlords of (mainly commercial) property can seize their tenants' goods for non-payment of rent without a court order or any prior notice. The Government accept that some change is necessary and desirable, and I have today issued a Consultation Paper on options for reform of distress for rent. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The aim of this consultation is to:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/2" class="indent">Establish the extent to which, and way in which, distress for rent is currently used in both residential and commercial tenancies;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/3" class="indent">Consider the potential effect if it were completely abolished;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/4" class="indent">Consider the potential effect of its abolition in the residential sector; and</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/5" class="indent">Seek views on proposals for a modified procedure.</p>

The report sets out a range of options for tackling these three devastating diseases in developing countries as a contribution both to the UK Government's thinking and to the international debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.5/2">The report calls for a comprehensive global strategy to improve and expand coverage of health systems and health promotion; make affordable for those that need them vaccines, drugs, and other products to prevent and treat the diseases; and provide incentives for research into new, more effective health products.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.5/4" class="indent">a new global fund for health to finance the purchase of existing health products to tackle the three diseases, substantially scaling up the provision of these products to those most in need but least able to afford them;</p>

	<p pid="a.171.2/1">Current daytime provision of search and rescue (SAR) in Northern Ireland is carried out by both a Wessex helicopter from RAF Aldergrove and by Sea King helicopters at RNAS Prestwick and RAF Valley. The Wessex helicopter provides a limited daytime service incorporated within its principal task of providing a trooping capabilitiy. By night both Prestwick and Valley provide cover for Northern Ireland and the surrounding seas.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.2/2">The Wessex reaches the end of its operational service at the end of March 2002, and after that date day and night SAR cover will continue to be provided from the mainland. The Sea Kings are dedicated, all weather capable SAR aircraft, with fully trained crews, and can respond to an emergency much faster than a Wessex. They have greater endurance and greater lift capacity and can remain on a task for longer without needing to refuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.2/3">Other military aircraft deployed in Northern Ireland will be available for search and medical evacuations at one hour's notice in support of the mainland SAR aircraft. A decision on a replacement aircraft for the Wessex in the support helicopter role in Northern Ireland has yet to be taken, and so it is not possible at the moment to estimate expenditure on SAR operations in Northern Ireland during the next financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.8/1">The Nice Treaty introduces a number of additional safeguards on the use of enhanced co-operation to ensure it is undertaken only as a last resort; that it cannot be used simply for the benefit of a few; that it is consistent with the EU's other policies; that it does not undermine the Single Market; and that it does not exceed the EU's competence.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.8/2">Given all the safeguards now in place, it is right that one country should not be able to block an enhanced co-operation, particularly in a European Union of 27 or more member states. The appeal clause mechanism in Pillars One and Three, by which a member state can demand that the European Council look at the issue, provides the right balance between the interests of the member states and the benefits of greater flexibility in an enlarged EU. The veto remains for enhanced co-operation introduced in the Second Pillar (Common Foreign and Security Policy).</p>

Prisons, and their local health authorities, are currently completing joint assessments of the health needs of prisoners, identifying appropriate services to meet them and effective ways of delivery.

The Environment Agency's advice has been drawn on in guidance recently issued by the Department of Health which sets out measures to minimise the risk to public health from disposal sites, and the agency has issued guidance on the protection of ground and surface waters at disposal sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.8/1">The best available evidence from climate models suggests that, although the North Atlantic circulation could slow as the climate changes, it will not lead to a cooling of the United Kingdom, as direct greenhouse warming will more than offset the reduction in Gulf Stream heat. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that the risk of a major change in the North Atlantic circulation is remote over the next 100 years. However, since marked cooling linked to circulation changes are known to have occurred over 10,000 years ago, it is important to further explore the potential for such occurrences in the future. This is an area of active research, and includes work at the Met Office's Hadley Centre and other major UK institutes, and a new research programme (Rapid Climate Change) proposed by the NERC.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/2">In 1997, the Government established the UK Climate Impacts Programme to help organisations assess their vulnerability to climate change and assist them in planning responses to adapt to it. To underpin these assessments, the UKCIP provides information based on the latest understanding of climate change. The work of the UKCIP is helping to raise both institutional and public awareness of the effects that climate change might have on the UK. The Government also recognise the need to adapt to some changes in climate and have already taken initial action to build adaptation into their own policies in sectors such as flood defence, land use planning and water resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/3">The Government believe that the best way to address such potential irreversible changes is to ensure successful international action in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. We published our Climate Change Programme last year which sets out how the UK plans to meet its climate change targets, and are committed to making Kyoto work.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.3/1">The Government are aware of the valuable role that London provides in generating income for the United Kingdom. Since taking office we have significantly increased the provision for spending on transport and education. London has benefited from this extra money. It has seen provision for spending on education increase by &pound;640 per pupil in real terms over the last four years and further increases are built into the forward spending plans. The 10 Year Plan for transport allocates &pound;3.2 billion for grant for transport in London for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04, broadly a doubling compared with previous plans. The plan delivers a total of &pound;25 billion of public and private investment for London over 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.3/1">We set out a number of proposals concerning the national non-domestic rate in our Green Paper Modernising Local Government Finance (September 2000). These included a scheme of rate relief for all small businesses. This would provide rate relief of 50 per cent for properties with rateable values up to &pound;3,000, with the relief being gradually reduced for properties with higher values: there would be no relief for properties with rateable values above &pound;8,000. It was also proposed to target this relief explicitly at small firms (as opposed to small properties) so long as this could be done without making the rules too complicated. We therefore invited views on whether the relief should also take account of the turnover of the ratepayer's business or the number of employees.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.2/1">Information concerning the percentage of food originating from other member states of the European Union inspected at the point of destination in the United Kingdom is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/2">Retail premises receiving such food are subject to random as well as programmed checks. The frequency and nature of programmed inspections are set out in Codes of Practice 8 and 9 issued under Section 40 of the Food Safety Act 1990. Random checks are undertaken in response to consumer complaints and for other reasons. The costs of these inspections fall to the local food authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/3">Imports of meat and meat products from other member states of the European Union which are delivered to meat plants in the UK, licensed under the meat hygiene regulations, are subject to risk-based random checks by the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) and by its equivalent in Northern Ireland. The MHS has been instructed to review levels of checking to allow for additional volumes of imports while British supplies are disrupted by the effects of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The MHS is also checking all consignments of imported carcass beef following the recent cases where specified risk materials were found to be attached to the meat. The costs of normal MHS services are charged to the plant operator.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.5/1">The Government welcome National Diabetes Week, which each year helps to raise awareness of an important area of need. That is why we are developing a national service framework (NSF) for diabetes in England. The diabetes NSF will be published later this year for implementation from 2002. Its aim is to improve health outcomes for people with diabetes by raising the quality of services and reducing variations between them.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.5/1">The Fully Equipped report does not discuss the powered wheelchair or voucher schemes in detail as those initiatives had been the subject of the separate evaluation by the York Health Economics Consortium. The Audit Commission's recommendations on wheelchairs were directed at local services and auditors appointed by the commission carried out an overview of the wheelchair services at 45 trusts. A full study was then carried out in 38 of these, and individual reports given to the trusts for their local action.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.5/2">After careful consideration of the York Health Economics Consortium's evaluation of the indoor/outdoor powered wheelchair and voucher scheme initiatives, we continued the overall allocation of &pound;14 million for wheelchairs and vouchers, placing it within health authority revenue baselines which are increased annually. The distinction between what can be spent on powered wheelchair and voucher schemes was removed, so that users' needs can be met more effectively. We asked all services to continue to operate a voucher scheme which offers users a choice in having a wheelchair which meets their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.5/3">A new framework agreement for the supply of manual and powered wheelchairs was awarded by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency and began on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-01">1 October 2000</phrase>. This provides a wider choice of both manual and powered chairs is available through the NHS, including chairs made available through the voucher scheme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-05-08a.188.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="188"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010508/text/10508w10.htm#10508w10_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.188.0/1">In discussions with herbal interest groups, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has reached a wide measure of consensus that the current regulatory arrangements which permit unlicensed herbal remedies under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 do not provide adequate safeguards for the public: there are no specific standards for the safety and quality of individual products under this regime, and there are inadequate arrangements for providing the public information about the use of the product.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/2">The UK comments on the second draft of the directive on traditional medicinal products were set out in a letter from the MCA to the European Commission dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-30">30 April 2001</phrase>. The response took account of points made by a range of herbal interest groups in their continuing dialogue with the MCA on this issue. Copies of the letter have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/3">Although work is still at a relatively early stage, we are encouraged by progress on the draft directive. We expect that if negotiations are successful, this legislation would provide systematic regulatory arrangements for a wide range of traditional herbal remedies of the kind currently sold and supplied under Section 12(2).</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/4">Any systematic updated regulatory regime for traditional herbal remedies is likely to place greater constraints on companies than is currently the case with the weak regulatory arrangements for unlicensed herbal remedies. A potential advantage for companies, however, is the greater confidence the public could have in the safety and reliability of these products. The draft directive would not affect products which are not classified as medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/5">We take the view that traditional herbal remedies properly classified as medicines should be appropriately regulated within a medicines regime. Standards should be consistent with those applying to other licensed medicines, including the many herbal medicines which have received a marketing authorisation under Directive 65/65/EEC. We also wish to ensure that relevant regulatory requirements developed for traditional medicines are in practice applied in a way that is appropriate to the nature of the specific product under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/6">The current draft directive includes several features which would have the effect of containing the burden of regulatory requirements: for example, the possibility of a positive list of traditional medicines where in certain defined circumstances the safety of the product and the requirement to demonstrate traditional usage could both be accepted as met without the applicant presenting evidence and the possibility of simplified quality dossiers for defined categories of traditional medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/7">On product innovation, a key feature of the proposed directive is that the usual requirement for medicines to demonstrate efficacy would be replaced by a requirement to show evidence of traditional use. There will need to be continuing discussions about many aspects of the detailed contents of the directive. Our starting point, however, is that where companies are seeking to bring a new medicine, natural or otherwise, to the market the normal route should be through demonstration of the product's safety, quality and efficacy.</p>
