	<p pid="a.117.8/1">The summit was an important opportunity to take stock of progress in the fight against terrorism since <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase> and to set priorities for future action in a number of key areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.8/2">In particular, the UK was concerned to counter the threat of terrorist acquisition of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological materials in the former Soviet Union, especially Russia, where the world's largest stocks of such materials remain. Our priorities were the destruction of chemical weapons, the dismantling of decommissioned nuclear submarines and the employment of former weapons scientists. GB leaders agreed at Kananaskis to launch the new Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons of Mass Destruction to help ensure that deadly materials cannot fall into the hands of terrorist groups. The G8 agreed collectively to raise up to 20 billion dollars over the next 10 years to fund projects under the global partnership. As part of the this programme, the UK plans to commit up to 750 million dollars spread over the next decade. The summit saw similar pledges made by other countries and the start of a dialogue with Russia over how best to implement this programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.8/3">G8 officials have worked since March on a plan to ensure the greater security of international transport, with strong UK support. G8 members continue to work through international fora such as the ICAO and the IMO to encourage others to put in place appropriate transport security measures to guard against terrorism. Leaders agreed at the summit on the Co-operative G8 Action on Transport Security, a plan of action to promote enhanced security of land, sea and air transport while facilitating the cost-effective and efficient flow of people, cargo and vehicles for legitimate economic and social purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.8/4">The UK is leading co-ordination of international anti-narcotics assistance to Afghanistan. The G8 discussed the UK's anti-narcotics strategy paper and action plans for combating poppy growing in Afghanistan. As we had hoped, agreement was reached that the G8 would step up efforts to assist the Afghan Government combat opium production and trafficking and fulfil Tokyo conference commitments. Breaking Afghan dependence on the drugs trade will help reconstruction efforts, but the wider impact will be in securing regional stability and cutting one of the cash lifelines that allows terrorists to thrive.</p>

The number of children for whom statements were issued for the first time in the calendar year 2000 was 33,746 compared to 35,421 in the calendar year 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">During a comparable period, the permanent exclusion rate for pupils with statements of SEN in the academic year 2000&ndash;01, an estimated 0.3 per cent, was three times as high as that for pupils without statements. The rate in 1999&ndash;2000 was six times as high.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/3">Changes to the underlying data collections will, however, affect year-on-year comparability of these rates, but they do present some evidence that the rate of exclusion for pupils with statements has reduced compared with the previous year. We are looking into this. There could be a number of factors involved. We have no evidence at present to suggest that the fall in the rate of exclusions of children with statements is linked to the reduced number of new statements issued.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.2/1">The latest published (final) figures show that the number of pupils with statements in England rose from 252,857 in January 2000 to 258,200 in January 2001 (estimates). The number of children for whom statements were issued for the first time in the calendar year 2000 was 33,746 compared to 35,421 in the calendar year 1999, However, the number of new statements issued for children under five, for example, increased from 6,363 during the calendar year 1999 to 6,518 in the calendar year 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/2">There could be a range of factors accounting for the 19 per cent increase in the number of primary age pupils being excluded from school during the academic year 2000&ndash;01, the comparable period. We are looking at possible factors but have no evidence at present to suggest that the increase is linked to the number of new statements issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/3">A statutory framework is in place to ensure that local education authorities and schools identify and assess children with special educational needs as early as possible and guidance on this is provided in the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice. The current version came into force in January 2002 and places a greater emphasis on early identification, both during the early years and at every stage of a child's schooling. A &pound;25 million package has been put in place in support of SEN in the early years, including support for establishing SEN co-ordinators in early years education settings and area SENCOs, with a target of one area SENCO for every 20 non-maintained settings by 2004. This is in addition to the &pound;113.5 million being provided over the period 2001 to 2004 to improve the knowledge and skills of staff involved in government-funded early years education, which will include SEN training.</p>

Staff are currently being appointed into substantive posts in the new organisations based on their previous experience and skills. The human resources framework covering these changes set out as one of its key principles that every effort would be made to avoid redundancies in order to ensure that valuable skills and experience were not lost to the service. As a result, all staff affected have been guaranteed employment for a 12 month period ending <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>. It is expected that the majority will be found suitable alternative employment during that period but it is not possible at this stage to predict how many staff will be unable to find a suitable post. The redundancies which have taken place so far are among the former health authority chief executives. The provisional position here is that health authorities estimate that, at today's prices, they are liable to pay out about &pound;12.5 million in respect of chief executives' severance costs. Final figures for the totality of the changes will not be available until after <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>.</p>
