The Government would like to pay tribute to all those independent members who have taken the steps to join DPPs. The functioning of the DPPs is a matter for the policing board and in accordance with Section 19 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 the board may issue a code of practice containing guidance on the exercise by DPPs of their functions. This code has been revised by the policing board and is currently out for consultation.</p>

Oversight of and guidance to CSPs is provided by the NIO Community Safety Unit, which also assumes a central role for developing community safety policy and strategy in conjunction with the police and other partner bodies.</p>

	<p pid="b.132.6/1">The A325 is a local road and is the responsibility of Hampshire County Council as the local traffic authority. The recent 30 mph speed limit was introduced to enable the authority to carry out essential maintenance and improvement works on this stretch of road. The temporary speed limit was imposed as a statutory order due to the limited carriageway widths of the A325. A minimum separation is required between traffic and working areas for safe, efficient and expeditious operations during roadworks. Where a reduced width between traffic cones and live carriageway is 0.5m, as was the case on the A325, it is a requirement on safety grounds, as set out in chapter 8 of the <i>Traffic Signs Manual</i>, that a temporary 30 mph speed limit is applied for the duration of the roadworks. The temporary 30 mph speed limit was implemented following consultation and approval by Hampshire Constabulary.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.6/2">Advisory signs for the 30 mph temporary speed limit were in place during the roadworks. There are no standard signs to explain the rationale behind temporary speed limits and non-standard signing was not considered necessary for these routine road works.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.6/1">The Department for Transport does not hold information about the number of driving hazards there are on the stretch of the A325 in question. The prevailing local speed limit for this stretch of road is determined by Hampshire County Council (as the local traffic authority). This will have been set in accordance with, among other considerations, the characteristics of the road, number of accesses, road function, and visibility, as set out in the Department for Transport roads circular 193. The prevailing speed limit through Bucks Horn Oak to 150m south of Bucks Horn Oak junction with Binsted Road is 50 mph. From 150m south of Bucks Horn Oak it changes to the national speed limit. During the recent roadworks a temporary speed limit of 30 mph was imposed. This has now been removed following substantial completion of the works.</p>

	<p pid="b.135.8/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.135.8/2" qnum="HL386">Which aspect of pensions protection &quot;inflates dramatically the cost of selling pensions to middle-income people&quot;, as stated by the Prime Minister in his recent speech to the Institute of Public Policy Research; and what remedial action they plan to take.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-06-15b.136.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="136"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050615/text/50615w03.htm#50615w03_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.136.0/1">The Government's better regulation action plan promotes a risk-based approach to regulation where regulators take the lightest touch for the best performing and least risky companies and vice versa, rather than behaving in a risk-averse fashion for fear of a compensation culture.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/2">In the area of pensions, the authorities are at the forefront of the agenda to balance protection with need for provision. For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July</phrase> employers will be able to promote the uptake of their pensions by their employees without needing to secure authorisation from the FSA. This deregulatory reform, announced by the Treasury as part of the widespread package of deregulatory measures flowing from the FSMA two-year review, should place employees in a stronger position to make sound decisions about investing in their own pensions.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/3">Further measures may be pursued following the results of various pilots, studies and reviews currently being undertaken by government departments, including DWP and HM Treasury, as well as the Pensions Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.137.2/1">In July 2002, the Office of the e-envoy published a new policy on the use of open source software (OSS) titled <i>Open Source Software&mdash;Use within UK Government</i>. Among other conclusions, the policy stated that &quot;The UK Government will consider OSS solutions alongside proprietary ones in IT procurements.&quot; The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) published guidance on implementing the policy in September 2002. This recommended updating OGC procurement guidelines to reflect the policy, more advice being made available to all those involved in procurement exercises and discussion with academic research institutions about future research and development.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.2/2">CSIA&mdash;as the central intelligent customer for information assurance (IA) capability development&mdash;sponsors work at CESG, the UK national technical authority for IA. Among a range of IA capabilities being investigated is the future &quot;trusted computing platform&quot;, including the open source Xen software in development by a team led from Cambridge University.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.2/3">CSIA is also developing proof-of-concept systems using security enhanced Linux to support remote working and web services.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.2/4">Funding of formal security evaluation is an issue for any suppliers&mdash;whether of open source or proprietary systems&mdash;as high assurance evaluation is expensive and time consuming by its nature. Nevertheless, Redhat&mdash;a leading supplier of open source software&mdash;has achieved common criteria certification on certain IBM and HP systems to EAL3 and is in evaluation to EAL4 (both for specific system configurations against a particular protection profile).</p>
	<p pid="b.137.2/5">To address this problem, CSIA has introduced its claims tested mark scheme to achieve a basic level of assurance in a short time frame and at a much lower cost. This scheme will be of benefit to suppliers of open source or proprietary software.</p>

	<p pid="b.138.8/1">Human rights are a core element in the EU's policy towards Colombia, which was set out most recently in the General Affairs and External Relations Council conclusions of December 2004. We worked with other EU partners to ensure that human rights were properly covered in the chairperson's statement at the Commission for Human Rights in Geneva in April 2005. In addition, the EU regularly raises specific human rights cases with the Colombian authorities. The UK will actively take forward EU policy during our presidency of the EU, in close consultation and co-ordination with our EU partners, both in Bogota and Brussels.</p>
