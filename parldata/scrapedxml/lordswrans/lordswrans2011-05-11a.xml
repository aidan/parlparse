	<p pid="a.216.2/1">The Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 implemented in November 2008 provides greater protection for those at risk, preventing forced marriage and enabling courts to make orders to protect victims. While the Act cannot end a forced marriage that has already taken place, there is existing legislation to end a forced marriage under Section 11 (Void), and Section 12 (Voidable), of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/2">A marriage can be annulled by a court if it can be proved that the marriage was either void or voidable.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/3">A void marriage is one where, although the parties have been through a ceremony of marriage, they have never acquired the status of husband or wife owing to the presence of some impediment (ie the marriage could not legally have taken place). A marriage can be void for several reasons including where either party is under the age of 16, as may apply in a forced marriage case.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/4">A voidable marriage is a marriage which is legally valid when entered into but which may be subject to subsequent annulment by a court if a party to the marriage challenges its validity. In the absence of such a challenge a voidable marriage remains valid. A marriage can be voidable for several reasons including in cases where either party did not validly consent to the marriage, whether in consequence of duress, mistake, unsoundness of mind or otherwise. In a voidable annulment based on lack of consent due to duress, the party applying would have to prove to the court that there was sufficient fear or pressure to override their true intent. This is regularly used by victims of forced marriages.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/5">In partnership with other government agencies, such as the Forced Marriage Unit, we are continuing to raise awareness of forced marriage among communities and practitioners through community engagement and outreach programmes and to provide support to victims of forced through the ongoing provision of the Forced Marriage Unit's national helpline. The Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) cannot provide legal advice, but signposts victims to suitable advice and support. This includes the organisation resolution, who have established a specialist accreditation scheme for legal professionals which includes forced marriage and honour-based violence.</p>

In order to be a charity, an organisation must be subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court, be established for charitable purposes only, and its purposes must be for the public benefit. The Act provides a non-exhaustive list of descriptions of charitable purposes, but does not provide a statutory definition of public benefit, instead relying on the existing common law meaning of public benefit. Furthermore, the Act removed the presumption that charities established for the advancement of education were for the public benefit.</p>
