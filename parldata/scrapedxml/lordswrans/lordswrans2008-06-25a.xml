	<p pid="a.248.5/1">The LCS continues to engage solicitors on a bilateral basis on the issue of inappropriate deductions and has been encouraged by a number of responses received in relation to redress. We understand that the first phase of the scheme saw 3,643 in the Rother Valley contacted, with approximately 10 per cent of those contacted registering a complaint. Phase two of the scheme has led to 11 firms provisionally agreeing to write to their clients, amounting to a total of 306,872 claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.5/2">Once the position has been further established, the LCS intends to commence a staged mail-out to remaining claimants of those firms not willing to co-operate with them.

Once a firm plan has been established BERR will be providing the individual claimants' contact data to them.

	<p pid="a.251.2/1">We were already planning on the basis of our existing aspiration for 90 per cent participation among 17 year-olds by 2015. With compulsory participation, our modelling suggests that, nationally, this does not require a big expansion of places. Our current estimates indicate that there will be around 15,000 more 16 and 17 year-olds in schools in 2015 than there are this year and all of this growth is accounted for by the already planned growth in academies, most of which will have sixth forms. Of course, it does not follow that all new demand will go into academies, rather we will need to make sure that every young person has a suitable place in learning and the balance of provision across the system will cater for that. In FE, we estimate that in 2013 13,000 additional places will be needed compared to this year, and in 2015 another 31,000 will be needed. Demographic changes will vary between local areas and local authorities will need to use their own projections to plan accordingly. We do not have modelling on additional places by kind of qualification. However the Government have committed by 2013 to providing young people with an entitlement to a diploma place, and an entitlement to an apprenticeship place for those who meet the entry requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.256.0/1">Victims of trafficking who have no basis of stay in the United Kingdom may be repatriated either via the government-funded voluntary assisted returns programme run by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) or as an enforced return. However, voluntary returns are always the preferred option; removal action is only ever considered as a last resort. Victims of trafficking are routinely encouraged to make use of the assisted voluntary return (AVR) programme available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/2">The IOM's network of offices work in co-operation with local non-government organisations and generally provide specialist reintegration assistance for victims of trafficking where necessary. The assistance may include shelter, medical assistance/psychological counselling and vocational training. IOM monitor the provision of such services themselves. However, the availability of such services in a given country depends on what sort of provision the Government of that country have agreed can be made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/3">There is no post-return monitoring or sustainability programme for those persons who choose not to return as part of an AVR package and whose subsequent removal from the UK is enforced.</p>
