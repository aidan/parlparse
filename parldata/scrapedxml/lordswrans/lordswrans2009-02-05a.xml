	<p pid="a.137.8/1">There are two primary types of in-service very high frequency (VHF) Bowman portable radio. The MoD designation PRC 354, including battery, has a total weight of 3.38 kg. The PRC 355, including battery, has a total weight of 4.88 kg, excluding headset.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.8/2">There are no plans to reduce the weight of the radios or indeed the batteries, as there are currently no suitable lighter alternatives. Work to improve battery performance is, however, continuing. Whilst future batteries are unlikely to weigh less than their current counterparts, their improved performance should mean that fewer spare batteries are required, thus reducing the overall weight carried.</p>

The pupil characteristics are taken from the school census, which included gifted and talented pupil data from 2006 for secondary schools and from 2007 for primary schools. The Department for Children, Schools and Families has no current plans to publish any work in this area. The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills is also currently engaged in preliminary research using the NPD. This work starts from specific GCSE cohorts rather than key stage 2 cohorts and looks at the whole cohort, not just high-performing students. It is important to recognise that performance at a specific key stage alone does not measure or directly reflect talent and future potential. Work is at an early stage, and there are no current plans to publish it.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.0/1">Information on projects awaiting delivery of turbines or the quoted lead times for wind turbines are a commercial matter between the developer and the wind turbine manufacturer. The department does not record this information. However, in the last few years, the global annual growth in wind generation has been between 20 and 30 per cent and wind turbine manufacturers have been unable to increase supply to match this demand. The supply of key critical components&mdash;for example, gearboxes, forging and bearings&mdash;is the main cause for this and has resulted in lead times of around two to three years for offshore turbines (BERR report:<I> Supply Chain Constraints on the Deployment of Renewable Energy Technologies</I>)<I>, </I>although recent information suggests that global supply has increased due to global economic conditions, but at a rate lower than the current growth in demand.</p>

However, Clipper Windpower (a US turbine manufacturer) made an announcement in 2007 about establishing the development of the Britannia turbine (a 7.5 to 10 megawatt offshore wind turbine) in the north-east of England, and will manufacture the turbine in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">There is no scheme or requirement for registration by alcoholics with the National Health Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>, a national Alcohol Treatment Monitoring System (NATMS) began operation to collect and report local and national information on the provision of structured care-planned treatment for alcohol misuse in England. Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> there was no routine collection of data on numbers receiving alcohol treatment in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/3">Limited NATMS data is reported on the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System website, at <a href="http://www.ndtms.net/alcohol.aspx">www.ndtms.net/alcohol.aspx</a>. This shows that in December 2008, 53,179 people were in contact with specialist alcohol treatment in England, with a year-to-date figure for 2008-09 of 88,016 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/4">The data given above is unlikely as yet to be fully representative of alcohol dependent patients in contact with the NHS. They primarily represent contact with specialist alcohol treatment services, as defined in guidance on <I>Models of Care for Alcohol Misusers, </I>and are therefore unlikely to include a significant number of patients who receive interventions in primary care or other settings. To aid commissioners and providers in delivering effective interventions and treatment for adults affected by alcohol misuse, the department and the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse jointly published, in June 2006, best practice guidance, <I>Models of care for alcohol misusers (MoCAM).</I></p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/5">In 2004 the department commissioned the Alcohol Needs Assessment Research Project (ANARP) to measure the gap between the demand for and provision of specialist alcohol treatment services in England at a national and regional level.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/6">ANARP research was conducted over a period of six months between September 2004 and February 2005, and as part of this work ANARP estimated that around 5.6 per cent (approximately 63,000) of the alcohol dependent population were accessing alcohol treatment per year. The new National Alcohol Treatment Monitoring System suggests that actual numbers may now be higher than this.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/7">Since the department published ANARP, in November 2005, action has been taken to improve access to treatment for those dependent on alcohol:</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/8">From April 2008, a new indicator became part of both NHS Vital Signs and the National Indicator Set for local area agreements. This measures change in the rate of alcohol-related hospital admissions and is expected to encourage primary care trusts (PCTs) to invest in earlier identification of people who drink too much, leading to brief advice by general practitioners or other healthcare staff and, if necessary, referral to treatment. A total of 99 PCTs and 76 local authorities have included this indicator as one of their local priorities, setting out local targets and plans for reducing alcohol-related hospital admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/9">From November 2008, a new alcohol improvement programme is providing practical support and guidance to the NHS including:</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/10">regional alcohol managers to galvanise and support local action;a new National Support Team for Alcohol, to provide strategic advice to areas that experience the highest rates of alcohol-related hospital admissions;an online Alcohol Learning Centre with training resources for practitioners and tools and guidance for planners and commissioners; and20 early implementer PCTs in areas of high health inequalities are receiving funding and support to go further faster to reduce alcohol-related harms.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.0/3">The UK's position on rendition and Guantanamo Bay is clear. We do not render people in breach of our legal obligations and unreservedly condemn any practice of &quot;extraordinary rendition to torture&quot;. We have repeatedly called for the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and we welcome the steps President Obama is now taking to close it.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/4">The Government oppose any form of deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of the law. The UK supports the rule of law, and our policy remains that individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism should be brought to justice whenever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/5">(b) US assurances</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/6">The US is our closest bilateral partner, and we cannot proceed with them on the basis of mistrust or a presumption of deceit. Notwithstanding the new information which emerged in Feb 2008 concerning two cases of rendition through Diego Garcia in 2002, we fully accept that the US gave its earlier assurances in good faith. We have worked closely with the US to ensure that the renewed assurances they have given us are correct and that we are providing accurate information to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/7">(c) Deportation</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/8">The Government will not deport someone where there are substantial reasons for believing that there is a real risk of torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment, or where the death penalty will apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/9">We can only deport someone if their removal is compatible with our international commitments, including our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. Accordingly, we have secured arrangements on deportation with assurances with certain countries so that we can satisfy ourselves that a particular removal is compatible with those obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/10">We firmly believe that, in seeking assurances from countries to which we wish to deport foreign nationals who pose a threat to our security, we are both safeguarding their rights and protecting the public. The Government are satisfied that diplomatic assurances can provide effective safeguards for the proper treatment of individuals being returned and can ensure that their rights will be respected</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/11">(d) Public inquiry into whether UK agents have acted unlawfully</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/12">If there were any question of anyone acting in an official capacity being engaged in an unlawful act, then this would be a matter for the police. Where allegations of mistreatment have been made to us by British nationals or residents whilst in Guantanamo Bay or following their release, and where we have been asked to do so by the individual concerned, we have raised those allegations with the US authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/13">If individuals believe that their human rights have been infringed as a result of actions carried out by or on behalf of any of the UK intelligence agencies, then they may take their case to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/14">(e) Compensation for those tortured</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/15">The Government take all allegations of torture very seriously indeed. Where allegations of torture of British nationals overseas are made, we are able to make consular representations on behalf of the individuals concerned. We may also occasionally make representations on humanitarian grounds on behalf of non-British nationals. The question of compensation is one for the individuals concerned and their lawyers.</p>
