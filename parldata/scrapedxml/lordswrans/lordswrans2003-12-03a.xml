	<p pid="a.25.5/1">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) laid before Parliament Government White Paper Command 6052, UK International Priorities: A Strategy for the FCO, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-02">2 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/2">This strategy paper sets priorities for UK international policy over the next five to 10 years. These have been discussed and agreed between departments and endorsed by the Prime Minister. The paper also describes in greater detail how the FCO intends to work, with others and through its network of over 200 diplomatic posts abroad, to help the Government to meet these aims. This is the first time that the FCO has published a document of this sort.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/3">This is a time of significant change in international relations. Domestic and international policy are becoming ever more intertwined as a result of globalisation, travel and technological advance. As a consequence, what happens abroad is of more immediate concern to all of us. The FCO will need to work systematically with other government departments and with people outside government including parliamentarians, businesses, trade unions, NGOs and the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/4">The issues are also changing. We have made great progress since the end of the Cold War in achieving stability and democracy in Europe. But <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> underlined in the starkest way that we needed to pay close attention to new problems and threats elsewhere in the world, which affect the security and prosperity of the UK and other countries. That message was most recently reinforced by the tragic events in Istanbul on 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-20">20 November 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/5">The FCO strategy analyses the ways in which we expect the world to change in the years ahead. We shall welcome public debate of this analysis. It concludes, among other things, that our foreign policy should focus on a broad agenda of issues with global impact: they include countering terrorism and weapons proliferation, acting to prevent state failure and climate change, and dealing effectively with poverty, corruption and conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/6">We shall need to build a wider, shared international understanding of how best to deal with these problems. They affect us all. We cannot afford to stand back from them. The UK must remain diplomatically active and engaged, and be able to exert global influence through diplomacy, advice, persuasion, aid and other economic assistance&mdash;and if necessary military force.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/7">The eight international strategic policy priorities we have identified for the UK are:</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/8" class="indent">a world safer from global terrorism and weapons of mass destruction</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/9" class="indent">protection of the UK from illegal immigration, drug trafficking and other international crime</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/10" class="indent">an international system based on the rule of law, which is better able to resolve disputes and prevent conflicts</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/11" class="indent">an effective EU in a secure neighbourhood</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/12" class="indent">promotion of UK economic interests in an open and expanding economy sustainable development, underpinned by democracy, good governance and human rights</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/13" class="indent">security of UK and global energy supplies</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/14" class="indent">security and good governance of the UK's Overseas Territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/15">No country can address these issues alone. We shall need strong international institutions, and a wide network of partnerships, to achieve effective, collective action.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/16">We will work through the UN, the EU, the G8, NATO, the Commonwealth and other groups. We shall also aim to build stronger strategic partnerships with Russia, China, Japan and India, bilaterally and through the EU. One of our top priorities will be to engage constructively with Islamic countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/17">Our most significant partnerships will be within the EU and with the United States. We will work to build UK influence in the EU, which will progressively become more important for the delivery of a wide range of UK domestic and international policy priorities. We will also work to make the EU a stronger and more capable international actor.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/18">As the world's only superpower the US will continue to set much of the international agenda. Our close alliance will remain indispensable for our security. We will use this vital relationship to serve and protect UK interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/19">Above all, a strong partnership between Europe and the United States remains essential for the UK's, and the world's, security and prosperity. This partnership has come under strain as a result of different approaches to some areas of domestic and international policy and the erosion of a clearly understood sense of common purpose. The strategy sets the objective of working to build commitment to partnership on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/20">The public services which the FCO provides to UK citizens abroad are an increasingly important part of our work. Through our consular services we help UK citizens abroad, issue passports and offer travel advice. Our visa services, shared with the Home Office, issue visas to people visiting the UK. Through UK Trade and Investment, shared with DTI, the FCO helps UK companies to do business abroad and attracts investment to the UK. I am determined to see consistent, high standards of public service across in all these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/21">To achieve all this, we need to maintain a highly effective Diplomatic Service. I pay tribute to the professionalism, dedication and expertise of FCO staff, and the contribution they make all around the world&mdash;sometimes, as we have seen, in dangerous circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/22">The strategy is a basis for future decisions on FCO organisation and management. The FCO's network of diplomatic posts is a key asset for the nation, through which we help the Government pursue a wide range of policy priorities and build UK influence around the world. Maintaining a well targeted, adequately resourced and secure diplomatic network is the FCO's highest management priority for the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/23">We have also established a departmental change programme, derived from the strategy, which sets out the actions we intend to take to focus our resources on high priorities, become more flexible and responsive, improve the diversity of our people, skills and experience, and target all our activity to meet the needs of our customers across government and UK public.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/24">The purpose of this strategy therefore is to clarify our priorities so we can concentrate our efforts where they are most needed and respond flexibly to unexpected events. We shall welcome parliamentary and public debate on the document. We will review it every two years inviting external contributions.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-12-03a.28.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="28"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo031203/text/31203w01.htm#31203w01_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.28.0/1">The Children Act 1989 requires every local authority to open and maintain a register of disabled children within their area. This information would include children with autism and is used for the purposes of planning and providing appropriate social services. The registration of disabled children by parents is entirely voluntary, and is not required as a condition of receiving services from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/2">There is also a statutory duty upon health services and primary care trusts, under the Education Act 1993, in the exercise of any of their functions in relation to a child under the age of five years, where a question of special educational needs arises, to inform the child's parents of this, to discuss the situation with them, to suggest recourse to any voluntary organisation which is likely to be able to advise and assist further, and to bring the matter to the attention of the child's local education authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/3">At present all children are registered on a child health information system which is funded by their local primary care trust. The systems and information collected vary slightly from area to area. However, there is a model health record on which these systems are based and further consideration is being given to adapting the model to maximise its usefulness as part of the development of the National Service Framework (NSF) for Children. Officials are considering an information management and technology strategy. This will include identifying information requirements for the delivery of the NSF.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.3/1">Primary care trusts have the responsibility of improving the health of the community, securing the provision of high quality services, and integrating health and social care locally. They have the resources to commission services, and to identify the number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision of specialist speech and language therapy.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.6/1">Today we announce the publication of the Department of Health's 2003 autumn performance report (Cm 6073). It shows the progress the department has made towards achieving its public service agreement targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.6/2">The autumn performance report is an annex to the chief executive's report to the National Health Service, which has been placed in the Library. Together the two reports demonstrate the progress that we are making in improving health and social care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.6/3">The report shows that more and more NHS operations are being carried out in outpatient clinics and general practitioner surgeries&mdash;without the need for the patient to stay in hospital. The number of procedures carried out in outpatient clinics rose to 1,735,000 last year, an increase of 129,000, or 14.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.6/4">There are more and more NHS staff, but they are working harder and harder to treat more patients, cut waiting times and provide more operations. The number of doctors has increased by 9,500, or 10 per cent, since the NHS Plan was published, while the number of nurses has gone up by almost 38,000, or 11.5 per cent since the NHS Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.6/5">The number of NHS patients waiting longer than one year for their operation fell from 16,689 in September 2002 to just 114 in September 2003, a fall of 99.3 per cent. The number of people waiting longer than 21 weeks for a first outpatient appointment fell from 30,789 in September 2002 to just 198 in September 2003, a fall of 99 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.6/6">These are just some of the achievements of the NHS in the last year. They have been made possible by the increased funding the Government are investing in health and social care, as well as the hard work and dedication of people throughout the NHS and its partner organisations.</p>
