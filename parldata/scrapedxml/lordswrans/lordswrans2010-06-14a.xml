	<p pid="a.69.0/1">The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has a well established procedure for moving medicines from prescription-only (POM) status to over-the-counter (OTC) when it is safe to do so. Over-the-counter medicines include both those supplied from registered pharmacies by or under the supervision of a pharmacist (P) and those on general sale (GSL) available through outlets such as supermarkets and convenience stores. The decision to reclassify a product from POM status to P availability is taken following a comprehensive evaluation of the risks and benefits of availability under the supervision of a pharmacist. The independent expert advisory committee, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), is asked to give advice and there is a period of public consultation before taking the decision to reclassify the product.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/2">Six medicines have been reclassified to P in the past 12 months. Two of these reclassifications have been supported by a pharmacy protocol, a questionnaire and training materials supplied by the marketing authorisation holder which pharmacists may use to help ensure that these medicines are supplied in appropriate circumstances. These products are:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/3">Flomax Relief MR capsules containing tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg for the treatment of the functional symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men aged 45-75; andCyklo-f tablets containing tranexamic acid 500 mg for the reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding experienced over several cycles by women with regular cycles.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/4">Professional guidance is routinely issued by the pharmacists' regulatory body, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB), on standards to be met in the supply of reclassified products in new therapeutic categories. The professional guidance and support materials are intended to be used by the pharmacist and pharmacy staff to check that the product is suitable for the customer and identify any circumstances where referral to a doctor should be recommended. This may involve seeking personal health information from the purchaser. The extent to which pharmacists use these materials is up to their professional discretion.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/5">The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has not been notified of any complaints in relation to products reclassified from POM to P where pharmacists have refused to supply the product because the purchaser would not reveal personal health information or was not convinced that such personal information would be treated as confidential. Complaints of this nature would normally be directed to the RPSGB.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/6">For some products newly classified as P medicines, it is important that the pharmacist or a member of staff is able to obtain certain personal health information about the potential user before the product can safely be supplied. Customers are, however, not obliged to provide this information and it will be at the discretion of the pharmacist whether it is safe and appropriate to go ahead with the supply or not. In those cases where the pharmacist or staff member considers that they do not have enough information about the potential user to be able safely to supply the product, the customer will be advised to consult their doctor.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">Statins are a widely used class of medicines for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol) and other lipid disorders. The benefits of statins in reducing heart attacks and the need for vascular surgery and in saving lives have been demonstrated in a number of large clinical trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/2">The safety of statins has been kept under continuous review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in conjunction with its independent scientific advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines. Data from the adverse reaction (ADR) reporting scheme, the yellow card scheme, underpins the process of monitoring medicines' safety in the United Kingdom. In 2009, a total of 500 suspected ADR reports associated with statins were received through the yellow card scheme. During 2009, approximately 52,300,000 statin prescriptions were dispensed in England alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/3">It is important to note that the reporting of a suspected ADR does not necessarily mean that the drug was responsible for that event, and other factors may have contributed including pre-existing illnesses and other concomitant medications. It is also not possible to directly equate the number of reports received via the yellow card scheme to the number of patients who have suffered bodily harm from the prescribing of statins because the scheme is associated with an unknown and variable level of under-reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/4">In addition to data from the yellow card scheme, available data from clinical trials have been carefully evaluated and show that benefits far outweigh evidence of harm. A number of studies have been at least partly government-funded, including the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration<sup>1</sup>, and the Heart Protection Study<sup>2</sup>. The majority of side-effects associated with statins have been found to be mild and reversible upon ceasing treatment. Although there has been no general estimate of the direct cost of harm caused by statins, in a large UK study of hospitalisation due to ADRs in almost 19,000 patients statins were not among the 10 medicines most commonly implicated in causing adverse effects.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.0/1">We are concerned by news of this case. The Government regard forced marriage as an abuse of human rights and a form of domestic abuse and, where it affects children and young people, child abuse. We are committed to tackling all forms of violence against women and girls overseas. The UK has a regular dialogue with the Afghan Government on human rights issues and we always raise cases of particular concern with the Government. We welcome the Afghan Government's commitment to protecting the human rights of the Afghan people, as reiterated at the London conference in January 2010, and we are working to support them to implement the elimination of violence against women law. Effective rule of law institutions and procedures will be key in preventing future incidents, and the UK is working in partnership with the Afghan Government and the Department for International Development to achieve this. We are supporting the justice and legal sectors in Afghanistan including through building awareness of human rights, and funding two of Afghanistan's first legal aid centres for female victims of violence.</p>
