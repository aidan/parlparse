	GM Trial Crops: Effects on Bees, Honey and Fruit

	<p pid="a.161.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/2" qnum="HL2815">Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Whitty on 6 June (WA 146), by what methods the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment ascertained that genetically modified (GM) trial crops would have no adverse effects on bees or honey or fruit containing GM pollen; and whether they consider such methods to be valid and trustworthy.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-07-07a.161.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="161"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000707/text/00707w01.htm#00707w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.161.2/1">When making the applications for deliberate release consent, the applicants submitted data using a variety of multidisciplinary approaches to assess the possible effects on bees and impact of GM pollen on human health. These included observations on bees and other organisms in the field, toxicological tests, allergenicity tests, information on the biochemical properties of the transgenic proteins expressed in these plants and comparison of transgenic proteins with sequences in scientific databases of known toxins and allergens.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">The experts on ACRE considered this data in the light of their own knowledge and experience and in the light of the body of scientific understanding at the time before reaching a decision. The committee agreed that the risks posed to human health and the environment from these releases were very low. Details of the methods and assessments are held on the public register at Ashdown House.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/3">Further consideration has been given to GM pollen in honey by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP), an independent body of experts that advises the Government on the safety of novel (including GM) foods. ACRE was aware that ACNFP hosted a workshop in 1991 to consider the safety aspects of GM pollen in honey. It concluded that the levels of pollen in honey would be so low as not to be a health issue. Results from three research projects commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) support this conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.5/1">The current legislation authorising the collection of tolls at the Dartford river crossings is forecast to expire in June 2002. The cessation of tolling would be likely to have the effect of significantly increasing demand on the eastern sector of the M25, which would further increase the level of congestion at the crossings and elsewhere and have associated environmental and safety implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/2">The Government are therefore minded to continue to charge for the use of the Dartford river crossings when the current legislation expires. Subject to the consent of Parliament, we will consult next year on detailed proposals. Revenues from charging would be hypothecated for spending on transport.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.2/1">The Government are supporting several ongoing studies that are making an initial assessment of the effects of climate change on the migration of plant and animal species and the implications of climate change for UK habitats, species and nature conservation policy. These studies will give a first view of some potential migration patterns as they report over the next twelve months.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/2">The Government have also commissioned work on the global impacts of climate change by sectors, which has made a provisional assessment of the number of people likely to be affected--but has not assessed the likelihood of human migration. This research has been published and presented to the fourth and fifth Conferences of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/3">The possibility of human migration was discussed in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 1995. This report noted that sudden human migration may occur as a result of the projected climate changes and sea level rise, and that millions may be displaced by shoreline erosion, river and coastal flooding, or severe drought. Further assessment of this issue will be made in the IPCC's Third Assessment Report, to be published in 2001. The UK is participating actively in the development of this report.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.5/1">Information on the average police response times to emergency calls is not collected centrally. However, each police force sets its own target response time and performance against this is measured by the Audit Commission, which publishes the data in the Council Services Compendium for England, The Local Authority Performance Indicators. The information for 1998-99 is set out in the table. This relates to all the police forces in England and Wales. Similar data, from 1993-94 onwards, can be found on the Audit Commission website, <a href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/ac2/PIfirst.htm">www.audit-commission.gov.uk/ac2/PIfirst.htm</a>.</p>
