	<p pid="a.28.3/1">As the RAF's aircraft capabilities continue to evolve, the effect delivered by specific squadrons of aircraft also changes. For example, the forthcoming arrival into service of the additional Reaper Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft and the A400M will see squadrons stood up, while those currently operating C130 Hercules, VC10 and Tristar will either re-equip to these new aircraft types or will be disbanded as these aircraft go out of service. When squadrons are disbanded the number plate is placed on the dormant list, rather than being abolished. Those squadron number plates not currently allocated may be reissued, most notably when new capabilities enter service, based on seniority or their traditional role.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/2">Last Autumn No. 6 Squadron stood-up operating Typhoon aircraft, which will replace the Tornado F3 in the air defence role this month. As a result No. 111(F) Squadron will disband and Tornado F3 will be retired as planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/3">Following the strategic defence and security review (SDSR), the Royal Air Force Harrier squadrons (Nos. 1(F) and IV(R)) have been disbanded and the Nimrod MRA4 will not be brought into service which will mean that Nos. 42(R), 120 and 201 Squadrons will disband in May 2011. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March 2011</phrase> we also announced the disbandment, in June 2011, of Nos. XIII and 14 Squadrons operating the Tornado GR4.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/4">The SDSR decisions on Nimrod MRA4 and our fast jet fleet will also lead to a reduction in the size of our training pipeline. No. 76 (R) Squadron, which operates the Tucano training aircraft, will disband on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-12">12 May 2011</phrase>. We are still working through the full implications in this area and cannot therefore release further detail at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.2/1">There is no single solution to discards. They occur for a variety of different reasons, and so different solutions are needed to address the specific causes. It is not as simple as banning discards, as experience shows that it is difficult to enforce, and that discards still occur but are just not recorded. The focus must be on developing and implementing practical and effective measures in partnership with the industry that deliver results. In my earlier response to the Lord Eden of Winton, I outlined the excellent work that the UK Government are doing domestically on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.2/2">A significant part of the problem is the way fisheries are managed and the Government have made clear that tackling discards must be a priority for common fisheries policy (CFP) reform. I am delighted that at the high level political meeting on discards on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March</phrase> the EU Commission and other member states were able to agree on this too. It is now a matter for member states and the EU to agree the detail which will determine the solutions that are put in place for 2013.

	<p pid="a.36.2/3">Under a reformed CFP, the Government want to see a regionalised management framework, where those closest to the fishery have the flexibility to use a range of measures appropriate to local circumstances in order to meet high level objectives to reduce discards.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.5/1">The Government are committed to honest and accurate information on where a food comes from. While there is no legal definition for the term &quot;local&quot; for labelling purposes, where it is used it must not mislead. Consumers are protected from misleading labelling by a number of pieces of legislation. If the labelling is found to be misleading, enforcement authorities have powers to take appropriate enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.5/2">A consumer survey commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and published in 2007 indicated that the term &quot;local&quot; is interpreted differently by UK consumers with some considering it a small geographic area (40 miles) and some considering it as food sourced from a wider area (eg county, region or country). A number of organisations have sought to define local food. However, these differ greatly in their criteria and on the size of geographic area considered local, making them unsuitable for an over arching definition for general use. Where it is used, businesses should be able to explain what it means. If consumers have concerns about the origin of their food they can ask for details at the point of purchase.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.5/3">Finally, there are EU schemes which allows for the protection of certain food and drink products which carry the name of a geographical area and which owe their distinctive characteristics and reputation to the area in which they are produced. Scotch Whisky is probably the best known of these protected names but others include Cornish clotted cream, Scotch beef and Melton Mowbray pork pies. It is our policy actively to encourage more UK applications under these schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.2/1">The UK has been actively involved in EU negotiations on a new regulation for food labelling, the food information regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/2">We have been pressing for improved origin labelling in negotiations and have successfully included in the current text an extension making origin labelling compulsory to all fresh meat with the possibility, subject to a review, of extending origin labelling for other foods. We have also secured a requirement for origin information to be given for main ingredients when origin claims are made on food products (eg the origin of the steak in a steak pie labelled as made in the UK). EU member states have reached political agreement on this text and it will now be sent to the European Parliament for further consideration. We are not expecting the regulation to be adopted and published until early 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/3">In the mean time, we continue to work with the food industry, retailers and others to encourage better labelling. Indeed, I am pleased that food industry launched its own voluntary principles on origin labelling on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November 2010</phrase>. These principles have been agreed by trade associations representing manufacturers, retailers and the food service sector (British Retail Consortium, Food and Drink Federation, British Hospitality Association, Dairy UK, British Meat Processors Association). All of the major supermarkets have signed up to this approach. We will be carrying out an evaluation of the effectiveness of these voluntary principles for meat and dairy products over the next few months to provide a baseline for future assessments of the effectiveness of the voluntary approach to origin information.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">Forced Marriage Protection Orders are British civil orders and are enforceable within the borders of England and Wales. There are no formal agreements in place between the UK and Pakistan, India, or Bangladesh for the mutual recognition of Forced Marriage Protection Orders. Most cases where the victim has already been taken abroad are heard in the Family Division of the High Court under the inherent jurisdiction. The form of order made respectfully invites the judicial and administrative bodies and police authorities in the country to which the child has been taken to render assistance in establishing the whereabouts of the person to be protected and/or to arrange for them to be put in contact with the British high commission in that country. The Forced Marriage Unit and the British high commissions work closely with the Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian authorities on a case by case basis to ensure the safety and (where requested) repatriation of victims, using, where appropriate, the provisions of a Forced Marriage Protection Order.</p>

An opportunity to take stock of the achievements of the ICC was provided last year by the ICC's review conference. This was the first occasion since 1998 that the international community had come together to review the original statute, and allowed the court and its supporters to flag up the real impact that the ICC is having globally. This highlighted that the ICC has played a crucial role in:</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/2">establishing that justice is an important element of a lasting peace;recognising the rights of victims and enabling them to participate in judicial proceedings; andexpanding the judicial capacity of national jurisdictions to prosecute Rome statute crimes, in particular within Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/3">The global impact of the ICC is further underlined by the fact that 114 countries have ratified the Rome statute since 1998. The court's jurisdiction now covers all of South America and the European Union, and more than half of Africa. Many of these countries have also now adopted the necessary legislation that incorporates Rome statute crimes into their national legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/4">Despite the ICC being a relatively new institution, it is currently managing three trials with a number of other proceedings at the pre-trial stage. Judgment in the first full trial is expected during the course of this year. Furthermore, 11 situations remain currently under preliminary examination by the Office of the Prosecutor. We continue to engage with the ICC to ensure that it continues to develop as an efficient and effective institution. A further example of the primary role that the court has now established for itself within the international system was provided by the unanimous adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-26">26 February</phrase>, which referred current events in Libya to the ICC.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">The question of who is entitled to vote in any particular referendum will be considered and determined in the light of the subject matter of that referendum. The franchise for each referendum is commonly set out in the primary legislation which establishes that a referendum is to be held. For example, the franchise for the forthcoming voting systems referendum is based on the franchise for parliamentary elections. This means that some prisoners (those held on remand, for contempt of court, or for non-payment of fines) will be free to vote by post or proxy in the referendum to be held on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-05">5 May</phrase>, provided they are otherwise eligible.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">Section 59 of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998 (SSFA) maintains provision from the Education Acts of 1936 and 1944 when the context surrounding the teaching of RE was very different, and there was no legislation providing teachers with protection from discrimination in employment or associated employment rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/2">The current requirements in relation to the teaching of RE in both community schools and non-faith academies are similar. All academies must provide religious education in accordance with their funding agreements. Funding agreements require that academies that do not have a religious designation must provide a curriculum which, while reflecting that religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian, takes account of the teaching and practices of all the principal religions represented in Great Britain. The intention is that pupils can acquire an understanding of the practices and beliefs of all the major religions and no teacher in an academy without a religious ethos will be in a position where they would be required to teach denominational RE, which might be contrary to their convictions or principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/3">Whether a teacher in such an academy would ever be required to teach RE will be a matter that can be governed by their employment contract. However, if a teacher were able to demonstrate that being required to teach RE according to the locally agreed syllabus amounted to less favourable treatment on the grounds of their religion or belief then they would be protected by the non-discrimination provisions of the Equality Act 2010 (the legislation that implements the Employment Framework Directive (2000/78/EC)).</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/4">To the extent that Section 59 SSFA provides protection for staff on the grounds of their religion or belief, the Equality Act 2010 will do the same. This means that no teacher in an academy without a religious ethos can lawfully suffer less favourable treatment because of their religion or belief and this is what is required by the framework directive. It is not considered necessary to replicate the wording of Section 59 of the SSFA for academies without a religious ethos.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/5">The Government are therefore satisfied that their approach is compatible with the Employment Framework Directive 2000/78/EC.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.3/1">School uniform plays a valuable role in contributing to the ethos of a school and setting an appropriate tone. Most schools in England have a school uniform or dress code and other rules on appearance. The Department for Education strongly encourages schools to have a uniform as it can instil pride; support positive behaviour and discipline; encourage identity with, and support for, school ethos; ensure pupils of all races and backgrounds feel welcome; protect children from social pressures to dress in a particular way; and nurture cohesion and promote good relations between different groups of pupils. Above all, many schools believe that school uniform supports effective teaching and learning. The department's guidance on school uniform is available here: <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/school">http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/school</a> ethos/a0014144/guidance-for-schools-on-school-uniform-and-related-policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.6/1">Whether or not to invest in Zimbabwe is a commercial decision for individual companies to make. However, we are aware of increasing interest from British companies in investing in Zimbabwe. We have clarified that there is no UK embargo on doing business there and have facilitated networking events with the Minister for Africa so that British companies can discuss at first hand both the opportunities and the challenges of investing in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.6/2">We believe that improved international trade and investment will be vital to Zimbabwe's development. But it is up to the Government of Zimbabwe to create the conditions and environment that will attract such investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.6/3">In this context, we believe that the recent threats to nationalise UK and other foreign companies in retaliation for the renewal of the EU restrictive measures are irresponsible. Such action would not only damage Zimbabwean livelihoods but deter much needed foreign investment at a time when the Zimbabwean economy has started to recover after years of negative growth.</p>
