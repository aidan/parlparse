	<p pid="b.4.0/16">1. Source 1996, 1998, 2000, 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 BCS.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/17">2. As with all survey estimates, particularly those for comparatively rare behaviours such as class A drug use, these estimates are subject to uncertainty as shown by the low and high estimates shown in the table. Apparently large year on year changes can occur by chance and cannot necessarily be considered indicative of a real trend over time.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/18">3. From 2001, the reporting year for BCS data switched from calendar to financial years.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/19">4. The figures are calculated using population estimates provided by the Office for National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/20">However it should be noted that as a survey of households, the BCS does not cover some groups who may have relatively high rates of heroin and crack cocaine use, such as the homeless and prisoners. Nor, in practice, will any household survey cover people whose lives are so busy or chaotic that they are hardly ever at home. These estimates will therefore underestimate the number of heroin and crack users in the country. Research to obtain better estimates of the number of problematic drug users (PDUs) on a regular basis is currently underway. At present we estimate that for around 250,000 PDUs in England and Wales, drugs cause considerable harm to themselves and others.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.3/1">The Government deplore any threats made by any religious group against any individual who has chosen to apostasise. We want to ensure that individuals from any religious group have protection against hatred being stirred up against them. That is why we are, through the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, extending the existing incitement to racial hatred offences so that they also outlaw the stirring up of hatred against people because of their religious belief or lack of religious belief.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/2">These provisions will ensure comprehensive protection for converts from Islam to Christianity adding to the public order legislation that deals with any form of direct harassment, threats, or violence, and the common law offences which outlaw inciting the commission of any criminal offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/3">Additionally, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, as amended by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, provides for nine religiously-aggravated offences which make available to the courts higher maximum penalties where there is evidence of religious hostility in connection with the offence. There is also a statutory requirement for sentencers, where there is evidence of a religious element in the commission of an offence, to consider this as an aggravating factor meriting an increased sentence.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/4">Both the police and the prosecution services are taking seriously the need to protect people who may be targeted because of their race or religion. In its public policy statement published in 2003 the Crown Prosecution Service gave a commitment to prosecute racist and religious crime fairly, firmly and robustly. The Government welcome the fact that the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has published a guide (currently being updated and to be re-released shortly) that sets out the police service's approach to identifying and combating hate crime and hate incidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/5">The Government believe that adding protection against incitement to religious hatred to the existing measures will afford protection to anyone who might find themselves targeted because they have renounced their faith.</p>

	<p pid="b.6.0/1">The future aircraft carrier project is managed and executed by an integrated team drawn from the resources of each participant in the alliance.

	<p pid="b.6.0/2">Alliance participants are likely to include the Ministry of Defence, BAe Systems, KBR UK and Thales UK. Depending on developments, the inclusion of others is not ruled out. Final membership will be confirmed when we take the major investment decision to move into the demonstration and manufacture phases&mdash;currently targeted for the latter half of 2005. To achieve this, we will need to have finalised an alliance agreement and works contracts which, among other things, will document: the roles and responsibilities of each participant; and the risk and reward incentive scheme. These items will be defined through ongoing work with the companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/3">The National Audit Office commented on the carrier project and the alliance strategy in the 2003 and 2004 major projects reports. It is expected that this level of scrutiny will continue, although we would not wish to direct or prescribe the audit role of an independent body.</p>

	<p pid="b.6.3/1">The department has no plans to organise a national celebration of Europe Day in schools. Children gain most from special events which are organised by schools themselves to support and contribute to the learning experience. We encourage schools to do this, as I pointed out in my previous Answer.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.5/1">We believe that the substantial new safeguards introduced by the Gambling Bill should prevent an increase in problem gambling; and the system of regulation established by the Bill is flexible enough to enable the Gambling Commission and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to use their respective powers to strengthen those safeguards further should the need arise. The industry has already established, as recommended by the Budd report, an independent charitable trust dedicated to the prevention and treatment of problem gambling, and is on course to fund it to the level recommended in the report. We are also confident that the industry will co-operate with the commission in the formulation and implementation of the codes of practice for responsible gambling which the Bill requires it to issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.2/1">Customers who opt for a Post Office card account are issued with a letter, the personal invitation document (PID), from the appropriate government department, inviting them to apply for a card account. Post Office Limited is required to ensure that only genuine benefit, pension and tax credit recipients open a card account. To ensure this, customers must present the PID in their local Post Office branch where they will be handed a Post Office card account application form, which they are required to complete. The Post Office will use a PID as one form of identification for opening a card account. The majority of customers applying for a card account are already collecting their pension or benefit from the Post Office.</p>
