	<p pid="b.161.2/1">All service accommodation is formally exempt from the council tax regime; instead, my department pays contributions in lieu of council tax to local authorities, which are broadly equivalent to the amount of tax that would otherwise have been due. The average contribution, determined by the type of property occupied, is then recovered from service occupants with their accommodation charge. Where service families' accommodation is occupied by civilian personnel, they are responsible for payment of council tax direct to the local authority concerned. In Northern Ireland, domestic rates are payable on residential property owned by the British Army.</p>

The latest year for which the data required to calculate the index are available is the financial year 2004-05. This index was provided to the Health Select Committee in summer 2006. The estimated inflation in the sector in 2004-05 was 4.3 per cent. The department also calculates a separate index for services provided to adults only. In 2004-05, estimated inflation in the adult social care sector was also 4.3 per cent.</p>

Asset will include identifying information specific to each child, including information about their care status. It aims to identify key risk factors contributing to a young person's offending behaviour along with protective factors that might help to reduce the risk of reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="b.161.11/2">Social workers and YOT workers have shared responsibilities where a looked-after child is also a young person who offends, and information in Asset will include information drawn from the child's care plan. Where a child enters custody, the YOT worker should ensure that the custodial establishment is aware of the child's care status, including any entitlement to leaving care services, and their social worker's contact details. It is important that the custodial establishment receives the child's care plan alongside the Asset assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.161.23/1">The revised version of the core guidance document <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>, which was published in April 2006, incorporates changes made as a result of Section 53 of the Children Act 2004, making clear the requirement to take the wishes and feelings of children into account and setting out when specifically this needs to be done in individual cases. In addition, the guidance makes it clear that local safeguarding children boards should put in place arrangements to ascertain the wishes and feelings of children about the priorities and effectiveness of local safeguarding work more broadly. The first part of <I>Working Together</I> is statutory guidance for local authorities, and the document also informs the work of other agencies involved in safeguarding children. The new duty is being monitored, as with the rest of local authorities' social care work, through the work of the relevant inspectorate, currently the Commission for Social Care Inspection. Multi-agency safeguarding children work is monitored by the inspectorates more generally, and the inspectorates produce a series of regular joint chief inspectors' reports on safeguarding children.</p>

	<p pid="b.161.32/1">Genealogical research in Northern Ireland requires searching in a more diverse range of sources, both public and private, than is the case in the rest of the United Kingdom. The starting point is substantially different owing to the almost total absence of 19th-century census returns and of an official set of pre-1858 wills. These are available in England and Wales and in Scotland and have been the subject of extensive digitisation projects. Only the civil registration records for Scotland have been computerised, but the digitisation of those for England and Wales is now under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.161.32/2">Indexes of civil registration records on births, deaths and marriages in Northern Ireland have already been computerised and are available for use by members of the public in the General Register Office (GRO) Belfast. The GRO (Belfast) is also taking forward plans to digitise all civil registration records and to widen public access to them. This will bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.161.32/3">The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) has completed two significant digitisation projects of interest to genealogists. It is currently engaged in two further projects with plans to develop other digitised sources. Some of the primary sources that have already been digitised will act as substitutes for the destroyed census returns, thereby improving access to genealogical records in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.161.32/4">At the same time, PRONI has been engaged in a project to put its extensive and detailed descriptive catalogues online. This will open up a vast resource to genealogists, who, for the first time, will be able to undertake comprehensive searches using personal names in the same way as genealogists can do at present in England and Wales and in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.161.44/1">In principle, a very wide range of goods and technologies have potential for use within the nuclear industry. Export licences are required for any which are specifically controlled under the military or dual-use lists (which, in turn, reflect the control lists in the international non-proliferation regimes), and any which the exporter knows, suspects or has been informed are for use in a WMD programme of concern. It is primarily the exporter's responsibility to determine this. In the case of the items listed in Lord Sainsbury's Answer, many of the companies listed did approach the Export Control Organisation (ECO) for advice on these issues or submitted applications, and the ECO, having fully examined those cases, was able either to issue licences or to confirm that licences were not required. If we had judged that there was a risk of use within a WMD programme of concern, then licences would have been refused.</p>
