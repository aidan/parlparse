	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The Government continue to believe wind farm proposals should be assessed on a case-by-case basis according to their impacts. We recently commissioned separate reports assessing UK planning considerations of shadow flicker and noise from wind turbines. These reports which were peer reviewed are available on the DECC website at: <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/wind/onshore/comms_planning/comms_planning.aspx">http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/wind/onshore/comms_planning/comms_planning.aspx</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">They found that UK guidance is appropriate to assess significant adverse impacts from wind farms. In addition, at our request, the Institute of Acoustics has agreed to produce best practice guidance for industry to confirm and, where necessary, clarify the way that the current government guidance (ETSU-R-97) is implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.0/1">Carbon savings are generated within the UK power sector when low-carbon generation displaces conventional fossil fuel technologies. However, as the UK power sector is part of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) which has placed a cap on emissions, any carbon savings achieved in the UK power sector have to be netted off by lower carbon abatement elsewhere in the EU-ETS.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/2">The extent of carbon savings is dependent upon the assumed generation mix, which is dependent upon a range of factors, including fossil fuel and carbon prices, the economics of electricity generation, technological progress, and policies pursued (including those designed to meet climate change targets) . DECC models different generation scenarios in order to develop policy, rather than forecasting a specific generation mix. The net carbon savings will depend on the scenario used.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/3">For example, in DECC's recently published <I>Updated Energy Projections</I> central baseline scenario, 411 TWh of electricity is estimated to be supplied from wind (onshore and offshore) in the next 10 years (2011-20). If we assume this displaces generation from the marginal plant<sup>1</sup> it translates to 15MtCO2 net carbon savings. In this scenario, there is no new nuclear forecast until 2022. This scenario does not include the impacts of any proposed electricity market reform measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/4">By contrast, under the central scenario commissioned by DECC from the consultancy Redpoint (to inform the electricity market reform White Paper and including EMR policy options), 445TWh of electricity is supplied from wind and 38TWh of electricity from new nuclear in the next 10 years (2011-20). By the same method as before, this translates to 17MtCO2 and 2MtCO2 net carbon savings respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/5" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> The marginal plant for this period is estimated by the DECC energy model to be CCGT. <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/ec_social_res/iag_guidance/iag_guidance.aspx">http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/ec_social_res/iag_guidance/iag_guidance.aspx</a>.</p>

This grant would be paid to Basildon District Council after the clearance operation has been completed and upon receipt of a statement of expenditure on costs incurred. The Home Office has agreed to provide contingency funding up to a maximum of &#163;4.65 million should the costs of the policing operation exceed the level at which the costs are able to be managed by the police force from within their existing resources.

	<p pid="a.111.2/1">We are appalled by the ongoing practice of child sacrifice, and other forms of ritual murder in Uganda and around the world, as highlighted by the Jubilee campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/2">The Government of Uganda have taken important steps to address this problem. According to their official figures, there were 14 cases of ritual murder in 2010 including nine children. In response, 43 suspects were arrested, of which 32 were charged with murder, attempted murder or other offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/3">Despite these successes, the Jubilee report rightly highlights some of the challenges that Uganda faces in enforcing laws against ritual murder, and the related problem of child trafficking. The Ugandan Government have established a ministerial task force, and set up child and family protection units to tackle the problem. A national plan of action on child sacrifice is due by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/4">The Department for International Development office in Uganda has supported child protection work in Uganda through the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), which focuses on child sacrifice as part of its broader work. We are also engaged with local non-governmental organisations which are working to raise awareness of this problem and which are campaigning for tighter regulation of so-called &quot;traditional healers&quot; in the country.</p>
