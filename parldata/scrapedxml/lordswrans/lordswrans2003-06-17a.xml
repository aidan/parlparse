The Russian Government have had several meetings with the Crown Prosecution Service, which is representing the Russian authorities in this case. In keeping with established practice, Russian contacts with the latter are ongoing. Compiling a list of all the representations made by the Russian authorities on this case over the past two years would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-20">20 March</phrase> we suspended consideration of Iraqi asylum applications following the start of military action in Iraq. We have been keeping under review whether this suspension should be kept in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2">Large numbers of Iraqis have come to the UK to seek asylum in recent years. We have provided them with asylum or protection on other grounds when they have needed it. But the situation in Iraq has now changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/3">While there remain security and humanitarian concerns in some areas, we believe there has been a real and sustained improvement in the country situation, and that political persecution is no longer prevalent. We will therefore now resume consideration of Iraqi asylum claims. As with asylum applications from all nationalities, each case will be considered individually on its merits.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/4">This resumption coincides with the decision of the chief adjudicator that adjudicators should start listing Iraqi asylum appeals again as from <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-16">16 June</phrase>. Such appeals have been suspended for the same period as initial decision-making.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/5">We are developing a coherent returns programme. Initially the emphasis will be on facilitating voluntary returns. This will cover failed asylum seekers and others who wish to return to Iraq, including those who applied for or received protection before the military action took place. We will start the enforced return of failed asylum seekers later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/6">We have in the past given undertakings not to enforce the return of individuals to the Kurdish autonomous zone of northern Iraq via other parts of Iraq. That was because of the potential risks those individuals would face from the Saddam Hussein regime. Those undertakings are no longer necessary. Once enforced returns to Iraq are started they will be effected by the route deemed most appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.2/1">During consultation on the draft regulations published in October 2002 a number of representations were received. These made it clear that the draft exception for genuine occupational requirement provided in these regulations could cause practical difficulties in relation to employment for purposes of organised religion. It was decided to provide an additional and narrow exception to permit a requirement related to sexual orientation only where the employment is for purposes of organised religion, and where the requirement is necessary to comply with the doctrines of the religion or with the strongly held convictions of a significant number of the religious followers. If the latter applies, the context and nature of the employment should also be taken into account.</p>

Many of these representations, both those received following the consultation in October 2002, and those received since the amended regulations were laid before Parliament, said that although they support Regulation 7, they believe it should apply to a wider range of faith-based organisations.</p>
