	<p pid="a.27.2/1">The Defence Technology and Innovation Centre awarded a &pound;8.1 million contract to CORDA (a wholly owned subsidiary of BAE Systems) which allocated tasks to BAE Land Systems and QinetiQ to research the feasibility and associated technology requirement for the Army's 155mm ordnance to be fitted to the current Royal Navy 4.5 inch gun mount. This work stemmed from earlier analysis and feasibility studies carried out on four candidate naval gun systems:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/2">USA&mdash;BAE Land and Armament Systems (formerly United Defense) Mk 45 Mod 4 127mm (5 inch) gun;UK&mdash;BAE systems (RO Defence) 155mm (6.1 inch) third Generation Maritime Fire Support Proposal;Italy&mdash;OTO Melara 127mm (5 inch) lightweight gun; andGermany&mdash;MONARC 155mm (6.1 inch) naval gun.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/3">These systems are candidate solutions to address the MoD's requirements for a coastal suppression and naval fire support capability. The earlier analysis indicated that there would be cost and capability benefits of a 155mm gun solution but that further technological investigation would be required to support the technology. Work is currently under way to build a trials gun mount and firing trials are scheduled to take place on an MoD range next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/4">If the trials are successful, the MoD will have an option to proceed further towards manufacture and fit.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">The MoD has been working on alternative energy sources for several years. The Royal Air Force has led on examining fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources, including the wider application of biofuels and synthetic fuels across the land, sea and air environments. In 1999, RAF aircraft were among the first in the world certified to fly on up to 56 per cent non-crude oil derived synthetic fuel. Since April 2008, RAF aircraft have been certified to use 100 per cent synthetic fuel. Work continues to achieve the wider use of synthetic fuels for ships and land vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/2">The MoD is currently exploring the option of conducting joint international collaboration with France, industry and academia to examine reducing dependency on oil, exploiting renewable energy sources and scavenging energy from waste heat.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.2/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase>, income support paid on the grounds of incapacity or disability will be replaced by the new employment and support allowance for all new claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/2">Employment and support allowance is a radical move away from the existing system of support. Our underlying principle is to help a person back into work where that is possible. We have made very clear that we will not write anyone off.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/3">We recognise, however, that for the most severely disabled people, finding employment may not be an option. We will be targeting additional help and support on the most vulnerable through the support group and guaranteeing an income for those in the greatest financial need of &pound;102.10 per week. For some people that is almost &pound;16 a week more than the current income support rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/4">In addition, severely disabled people with care or mobility needs may be eligible for disability living allowance which makes a valuable contribution towards the extra costs of disability and can be paid regardless of whether someone is in or out of work, or also receiving employment and support allowance. Similarly, attendance allowance contributes to the extra costs of disability for people who become disabled after the age of 65.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/5">We will be evaluating the new benefit, including the commissioning of independent reports, to ensure it meets our aims and objectives and the needs of disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.0/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) does not collect data on the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The HFEA keeps a record only of cancelled cycles reporting the risk of OHSS&mdash;in other words, cycles which have usually been cancelled, either before or after egg collection, because of a perceived risk as opposed to patients where there is a clinical diagnosis of OHSS. In 2007, this applied to 611 out of a total of 35,946 cycles. These figures do not enable the HFEA to track the total number of patients who are at risk of or suffer from OHSS.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.5/1">As the survey did not ask any direct questions concerning the responsibility for licence conversion, it is impossible to determine directly the proportion of interviewees who fell into that category. However, we did ensure where relevant that all respondents were responsible for the provision of live music at that venue. This means they would have had knowledge of any changes to their licence in relation to live music. The survey did not ask about the length of time the interviewee had been working at the venue but did ask a related question about the length of time they had been responsible for live music at the venue. The contractors reported that 60 per cent of respondents had held this responsibility for more than two years. This may be an underestimate as some of the 40 per cent who did not hold the responsibility may have worked there for longer than two years in some other capacity.</p>

While I am not convinced that licensable activities should be exempt simply because they are carried on within a circus, I do recognise the particular regulatory burdens placed on travelling tented circuses because they move from site to site. We are looking at how we can simplify aspects of the application processes to relieve some of the burden and have also agreed to look at the feasibility of alternative licensing arrangements which better reflect the nature of travelling entertainment performed at multiple sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.3/1">There was no delay. The DCMS has been developing options for consultation to exempt low impact (de minimis) licensing activities from the scope of the 2003 Act. The Government do not undertake amendments to primary legislation lightly, particularly in the case of legislation which was only brought fully into force within the past three years. As part of that work, we are considering exemptions for small and incidental live music events, taking into account the recommendations made by the Live Music Forum. Officials have had discussions with stakeholders, including the Musicians' Union, which aim to develop exemptions that can benefit live music without jeopardising the licensing objectives. We hope to publish a consultation document in the autumn, and subject to the outcome, to have the exemptions in place by spring 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the St Andrews agreement. Discussions between the Northern Ireland parties on those elements of the agreement which relate to the devolution of policing and justice continue. It is for the parties to agree how and when these powers will devolve. There are also important issues relating to areas already devolved which the Executive need to resolve. The Government regret that the Executive have not met since June. The Government urge the parties to agree a way forward which enables the Executive to resume regular meetings and enables devolution to be completed as soon as possible. The Government believe that there is no single issue that the parties cannot resolve through constructive dialogue, if they are willing to do so, and welcome recent statements by the First and Deputy First Ministers committing them to such dialogue. The Secretary of State assesses progress through his contacts and meetings with the party leaders and with the First and Deputy First Ministers. The Government remain committed to working with the parties to ensure the successful implementation of the St Andrews agreement.</p>
