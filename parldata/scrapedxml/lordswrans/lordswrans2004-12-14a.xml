	<p pid="a.69.2/1">Senior responsible owners (SROs) are appointed to oversee the delivery of complex business change or new military capability programmes and their benefits. These typically involve planning and ensuring coherence across a number of top level budget holder areas and/or lines of development.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">The MoD's major non-equipment acquisition and change programmes are brigaded into the Defence Change Programme (DCP). The principal twelve programmes within the DCP each have an SRO, as does the DCP itself and other programmes under the governance of the DCP. An SRO has also been appointed to each of six major new military capability programmes. There are other SROs outside these areas, but there is currently no requirement to hold this information centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">SROs are directly responsible to the Defence Management Board. Further SROs will be appointed as required, but there are no predetermined numbers or dates for appointment, since SROs are identified and allocated as the need arises.</p>

I understand from the Police Information Technology Organisation that most of these technical issues have been resolved but it has been necessary to commission an audit of force communications networks. This will not be completed before the end of the year and the aim then is to analyse the report with a view to assessing the implications for individual police forces by the end of January. It is not possible to renegotiate a new roll-out schedule with forces until this information is available.</p>
