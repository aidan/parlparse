	<p pid="b.86.6/1">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Local Government Act 1972 are separate access regimes. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FoIA) gives a general right of access to information held by a public authority.

This order will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.6/5">The amendments, which follow consultation with key stakeholders, will have the effect of simplifying the exemptions in the schedule, and harmonising them with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the list of exemptions contained in the FoIA.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.5/1">The Standards Board for England is an independent body. Management of individual cases is entirely a matter for the board itself. I have asked the board's chairman to write to you directly in response to your Question, setting out the circumstances in which the investigation and determination of these cases took place, and <a href="/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060206wa1.pdf">/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060206wa1.pdf</a> will be placed in the Library. I regret the delays in these cases, but I understand that there were special circumstances. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has agreed with the board the performance targets of completing 40 per cent of investigations within four months and 90 per cent within six months. The board is currently meeting its four-month target and is completing 82 per cent of investigations within six months.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.2/1">We are in close contact with colleagues in the US Fish and Wildlife Service and have sought their views regarding the impact of the US Wild Bird Conservation Act 1992 on legal and illegal imports of wild birds. It is too early to say what lessons the United Kingdom might draw from this legislation but my officials will take this information into account in forthcoming round-table discussions with key stakeholders on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.5/1">The Government's position was reached after the detailed review whose findings were announced in 1998. This examined with great care and sympathy the issues and the cases of those executed. It recognised that the test for a pardon under the Royal prerogative sets a very high threshold and concluded that it would not be fair to put these cases to this test, just to see most and possibly all of them fail because we lack the required level of evidence. However, all these men are now recognised as victims of a terrible war and honoured among their fallen comrades, the stigma of their execution removed.</p>
