	<p pid="a.342.2/1">The bank levy is not deductible for corporation tax purposes so has no direct impact on the level of corporation tax paid by banks. The levy has been designed specifically to target risky short-term funding which led to serious liquidity problems that played a key role in the financial crisis. By design, the levy is not charged on insured customer deposits and only applies at half-rate to uninsured customer deposits (except for those from financial institutions) and funding that has over one year remaining to maturity. The levy therefore ensures that banks make a contribution reflective of the risks they pose to the UK financial system and wider economy. The treatment of deposits also reflects the general desirability of encouraging banks to increase the proportion of their funding from deposits.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.2/2">The Government are also clear that competition drives efficiency and helps to ensure that consumers are able to access the wide range of financial products that they need. As part of its remit, the Independent Commission on Banking will look at the state of competition in the industry and how customers and taxpayers can be sure of the best deal.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.2/1">Volunteers are able to drive community transport vehicles with up to 16-passenger seats, with some conditions, but without the need for a passenger carrying vehicle (PCV) driver's licence. The conditions are in place to ensure the safety of passengers and other road users, which is consistent with wider road safety policy. Safety is particularly important for large buses and is why a PCV licence is required for vehicles with more than 16 passenger seats. However, the Local Transport Act 2008 removed restrictions on payment, allowing the use of professional drivers for large community transport vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/2">The ability to allow volunteer drivers without a PCV licence to drive community transport vehicles was a concession secured in a European Union driver licensing directive after UK pressure on behalf of the community transport sector and other not-for-profit minibus operators.

Solihull and Wolverhampton's BSF projects were not affected by the Secretary of State's decision to halt the programme. Dudley had not yet entered the programme. Information on the number of BSF projects stopped, as well as the value of each local authority's total scheme is listed below:</p>

	<p pid="a.344.5/10">Birmingham, Walsall and Sandwell were in the early stages of the BSF programme and the value of each school project had not been determined. Just three of the Coventry school projects had been given firm funding allocations. These were, Broad Spectrum (PK) and President Kennedy which were co-located and had combined total funding of &#163;53 million and Westwood which had been allocated &#163;12 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.5/11">Partnerships for Schools also holds information on those projects which were due to receive funding from the co-location fund. The funding for Birmingham's co-location project, Stockland Green Young People's Centre, was withdrawn due to the lack of progress and the risk of the project not being completed by the deadline to which the city council had committed itself. Coventry and Wolverhampton's co-location projects were unaffected and Walsall, Sandwell, Dudley and Solihull did not have co-location projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.5/12">All further education colleges, including those now designated sixth-form colleges, that had capital projects under way and approved at the time of the formation of the coalition Government continue to be fully supported as previously agreed. This means that no further education college capital projects have been stopped as a result of a reduction in government funding.</p>

The Government are concerned that the number of pupils who currently receive a broad education in core academic subjects is far too small, particularly for pupils in disadvantaged areas. We want to encourage more pupils to study these subjects and to open up opportunities for all pupils to have a broad and rounded education. Other qualifications remain viable in their own right and we will encourage all pupils to study non-English Baccalaureate subjects and qualifications alongside the core English Baccalaureate in order to benefit from a well-rounded education.</p>

The Department for International Development (DfID) and the European Union (EU) fund Kenyan non-governmental organisations (NGOs) through a range of channels, including some in Kenya from the DfID bilateral aid budget, some from centrally managed DfID funds and some from EU civil society funding instruments. A criterion for DfID's centrally managed Civil Society Challenge Fund is that DfID can only fund UK-based organisations, which can then spend money through an implementing partner in-country-there is thus no direct funding to Kenyan NGOs through this channel, but some indirect funding. We do not hold disaggregated data on how much each NGO in receipt of UK funds spends in Kenya.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.2/1">The Chief Secretary to the Treasury's formula for splitting costs was as follows: the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) should contribute &#163;750,000, and the remaining costs (up to a maximum of &#163;10 million) should be split equally between the Department for International Development (DfID), the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Education and the Department for Communities and Local Government-reflecting the key themes of the visit. The FCO's contribution was lower in recognition of our agreement to take on the role of single budget holder for non-policing costs of the visit, entailing responsibilities well beyond our normal remit.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.2/2">The five departments each gave the FCO &#163;1.85 million in advance to cover expected costs of &#163;10 million. The actual cost paid by the FCO on behalf of the Government was &#163;6,981,330. The FCO will therefore offer reimbursement to each department of &#163;603,734, apart from DfID, where Ministers agreed the DfID money will be used to help pay for the UK's costs incurred for the New Zealand earthquake humanitarian assistance that has been provided rather than reimbursed.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.2/3">The Written Ministerial Statement published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-16">16 February 2011</phrase> by my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State provides further details. It is available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
