	<p pid="a.69.2/1">HM Government provided Citizens Advice with &pound;39.509 million in the last financial year (2006-07). This is about 85 per cent of its total income.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">BERR provides Citizens Advice with an annual grant in aid on behalf of all Government. The 2006-07 figure was &pound;21.47 million, and should remain the same for 2007-08. Citizens Advice also received another &pound;18.039 million in government funding for specific projects. Also, &pound;15.4 million is being provided by BERR over two years (2006-08) to fund face-to-face debt advice, helping tens of thousands of families to tackle debt. The remaining funding, including from the financial inclusion fund, comes mainly from other departments to fund such projects as the national homelessness project, veterans project, financial literacy, tax credit training, et cetera.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">The final distribution of the CSR allocation for 2008-11 has not yet been finalised, so we are unable to say at present what figure will be allocated to Citizens Advice for 2008-09 or any other year in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.5/17">There have been two major schemes for delivery of DTI grant funding to research and technology projects in the aerospace industry: CARAD (Civil Aircraft Research and Demonstration, later also known as the aeronautics research programme), which ran from 1990 to March 2004, with a budget of about &pound;20 million per year; and from April 2004, the technology programme, which was launched as the single vehicle for all DTI funding for research. The technology programme is now the responsibility of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and delivered through the Technology Strategy Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.5/18">Launch investment is a risk-sharing government investment in the design and development of civil aerospace projects in the UK. It is repayable at a real rate of return, usually via levies on sales of the product. Although civil aerospace programmes have been beneficiaries of nearly &pound;1 billion of government investment, as shown in the table, &pound;1.4 billion has been repaid to the Government over the same period, with repayments continuing.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.5/19">The latest figures available for Ministry of Defence expenditure on research and development for military aerospace&mdash;both combined and separately&mdash;are to be found in table 1.7 of chapter 1 of <I>UK Defence Statistics 2006</I>, copies of which are held in the Library of the House.</p>

This year DfID has committed up to &pound;20 million for assistance to Helmand, out of our overall &pound;107-million aid budget for Afghanistan (19 per cent).

DfID supports development in the north of Afghanistan in two main ways: through our commitment of unpreferenced funding to the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund (ARTF); and through our support to the Government of Afghanistan's national priority programmes. In 2007-08 DfID is providing &pound;55 million in unpreferenced funding to the ARTF, to enable the Government of Afghanistan to meet their recurrent costs. These include salaries of public sector workers throughout Afghanistan, including teachers, nurses and doctors. DfID is also supporting the Afghan Government's national priority programmes, which operate in the north and south of Afghanistan, including a total commitment of &pound;42 million (2003-10) to the national solidarity programme (NSP), and &pound;20 million (2004-08) to the microfinance investment support facility of Afghanistan (MISFA).</p>

	<p pid="a.75.3/1">In 1998 the Government asked the committee on toxicity (COT) to consider the evidence for long-term effects on human health from low-dose exposure to organophosphates.

	<p pid="a.76.0/1">The Consumer Credit Act requires that most businesses that offer goods or services on credit hold a consumer credit licence. Golf clubs and other private sports clubs which allow for payment of membership fees in more than four instalments may need a consumer credit licence. However, whether a licence is required will be dependent on the individual circumstances applicable to the operation of each individual club, such as whether the club is classified as &quot;carrying on a business&quot;, if so whether this would be classified as &quot;occasional business&quot; and whether the particular club's agreements might be subject to any exemptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/2">Given that unlicensed trading is a criminal offence, the Office of Fair Trading advice has been for clubs to apply for a consumer credit licence if they are in any doubt.

	<p pid="a.78.8/1">This information is not routinely collected by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The HFEA requires clinics to indicate on the treatment report form if a patient has experienced ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome so that no embryos were transferred back to the patient even though viable embryos were available for transfer. Where an egg collection was abandoned or cancelled, the reporting form also asks if this was due to an under- or over-response to ovarian stimulation. Reporting clinics also give details of any other adverse clinical effects recorded in these circumstances. Full information about each treatment cycle is recorded in patients' health records held by clinics and is subject to examination during a HFEA inspection.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.5/1">Good progress has been made on both the standard of food available in schools and investment in the capacity of the school food service. Challenges remain on the take-up of school lunches, but the department and the School Food Trust (SFT), its key delivery partner, are focused on action to reverse the current downward trend.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/2">New standards&mdash;these are being introduced to the following timetable: September 2006&mdash;food-based standards for school lunch; September 2007&mdash;food-based standards for food other than lunch; September 2008&mdash;nutrient-based standards for primary school lunches; and September 2009&mdash;nutrient-based standards for secondary school lunches.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/3">Capacity&mdash;the SFT continues to provide valuable support and guidance to schools, local authorities, caterers and others responsible for implementing the new food standards in schools. The department has announced investment in excess of &pound;600 million between 2005 and 2011 to support schools and local authorities through the transitional period, subsidise the costs of school lunches, and enable local authorities with particular needs to build new school kitchens. In addition, the SFT is establishing a network of regional training centres for school cooks, which will be instrumental in delivering to catering staff a comprehensive package of training and qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/4">Demand&mdash;increasing the take-up of school lunches is a high priority for the department and the SFT. We are working together on an action plan to persuade a range of stakeholders to play a full part in addressing the issue and, in particular, to encourage children and their parents to opt for a school lunch. The SFT has targets to increase take-up of school lunches from the 2005-06 baseline by 4 percentage points by March 2008, and 10 percentage points by autumn 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.4/2" qnum="HL5514">What consideration they have given to the view of the Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill that denying the existence of a biological father on birth certificates &quot;involves the authorities and we are deeply concerned about the idea that the authorities may be colluding in a deception&quot;; what importance they attach to the presence of a father in the upbringing of a child; and what consideration they have given to the long-term psychological and social implications of denying to a child that a father was involved in their conception.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.5/1">We gave careful consideration to all the Joint Committee's recommendations, including reviewing the argument that the fact of donor conception should be registered on a person's birth certificate. Our conclusion is that rather than forcing the issue in this way, it is preferable for parents to be educated about the benefits of telling children that they are donor-conceived. We are discussing the way forward with the Donor Conception Network. We recognise the role played by fathers in their children's lives. In the context of the draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill we have carefully considered whether research evidence supports the continued reference in primary legislation to a duty on clinicians to give specific attention to the need for a father when considering the provision of fertility treatment. Our conclusion is that the factor of prime importance is the quality of parenting, that the reference to the need for a father should be removed from primary legislation but that the general duty for clinicians to take account of the welfare of the child should remain.</p>

Under our VAT agreements with our European partners we can keep our existing zero rates of VAT, but we are not able to extend them or introduce any new ones.
