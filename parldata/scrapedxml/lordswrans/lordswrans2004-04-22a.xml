	<p pid="a.57.0/1">As I explained in my Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March</phrase> (WA 163), the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities does not define the term &quot;national minority&quot; nor is &quot;national minority&quot; a legally defined term in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/2">In choosing to apply the framework convention with reference to the definition of racial groups in the Race Relations Act (which is &quot;a group of persons defined by reference to colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origins&quot;), the Government have interpreted the framework convention relatively widely. For example, I understand that some parties to the framework convention apply it only to members of certain longstanding minority groups with a domestic legal status as &quot;national minorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/3">The Government believe that this threshold ensures that the United Kingdom complies with statement of the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention that &quot;implementation of the framework convention should not be a source of arbitrary or unjustified distinctions&quot;, in that it is based on criteria set out in an Act of Parliament that are a matter for interpretation by the courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.3/2">As I stated in my Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March</phrase> (WA 163), the Government therefore ratified the framework convention on the understanding that its principles should apply to members of &quot;racial groups&quot; as set out in the Race Relations Act 1976.

	<p pid="a.62.0/1">Census data show that the total area of orchards in England declined from 110,590 hectares in 1950 to 25,998 hectares in 2000. Figures for Scotland and Wales fall under the jurisdiction of the devolved authorities. The census data do not record the number of orchards, nor which orchards were traditionally managed or grazed.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.3/1">We are still considering the implications of detailed rules which were agreed in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-14">14 April</phrase>, especially in respect of the treatment of grazed orchards. However, traditional English orchards already enjoy considerable protection under countryside stewardship agreements. Decisions on the future of commercial orchards are for the grower to make taking account of the market prospects for the product concerned, in keeping with the general principles of the recent CAP reform agreement.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.6/1">Orchards throughout the European Union are generally ineligible for the single payment, which cannot be paid on land under permanent crops. In England, the environmental benefits provided by traditional orchards are recognised in the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, which now provides funding of &pound;600,000 a year for agreements covering two-thirds of the area of traditional orchards.</p>
