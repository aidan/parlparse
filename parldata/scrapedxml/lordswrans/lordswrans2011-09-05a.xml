A husband and his first wife are paid the ordinary couple rate (currently &#163;105.95 a week). An additional &#163;38.45 a week is payable in respect of second and subsequent wives, which is less than the &#163;67.50 they would receive if they were treated as individuals in their own right.

	<p pid="a.2.0/2">The department's IT system does not hold a breakdown of the number of polygamous households claiming benefit. However, as no one can contract a polygamous marriage in the UK and because under the Immigration Act 1988, it is not possible for people polygamously married overseas to bring second wives to the UK, the overall numbers are relatively small and reducing year on year.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 covers stalking. The Act was always intended to tackle stalking, but was drafted so that it could also include any form of persistent conduct which causes alarm or distress. Where an offender pursues a course of conduct which amounts to harassment and the offender knows or ought to know their conduct amounts to harassment, the offence can be charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The definition in the Act was chosen because it is capable of capturing a wide range of behaviours removing the need to update the law to keep apace with technological developments. The Home Office will continue to work with the CPS, Ministry of Justice and the Association of Chief Police Officers to keep this under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.2/1">Neither Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 nor the draft specific duties regulations require any public bodies to publish any particular information in relation to their workforce. It will be for each public body to decide exactly what information it publishes. Most large public bodies already have workforce monitoring processes in place. We therefore estimate that there will be no additional costs to public bodies from this requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/2">For central government departments, we estimate the one-off transitional cost to the new equality duty to be between &#163;19,000 and &#163;26,000, and that the new duty will result in an annual net benefit thereafter of between &#163;750,000 and &#163;800,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/3">This is in comparison to the cost of complying with the previous race, disability and gender equality duties, estimated at around &#163;1.6 million each year and requiring around 13.5 full-time equivalent staff per annum across central government departments. We do not intend to pilot a cost assessment, but we are committed to reviewing the Equality Act as a whole, and the equality duty will be an integral part of that review.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.0/1">Sport England recognises that national governing bodies (NGBs) are the experts in their sports and that they must take responsibility for growing participation in their sport. Therefore, NGBs, like the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA), are free to invest Sport England funding in activities or organisations they believe can help them meet their outcomes, this includes investing in local authority sports activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">If an NGB is not meeting its contracted outcomes, as set out in its whole sport plan funding agreement, and not making any attempt to redress performance in a way which is deemed satisfactory then investment will be decommitted. Sport England will also suspend or decommit funding if an NGB is judged to fall short of certain governance regulations or is not fit to receive public funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">NGBs are formally reviewed on a six-monthly basis by Sport England against the terms and conditions of the contracts for which they receive investment. This only takes into account the activities they undertake to deliver on the outcomes set within the contracts. Sport England has not specifically consulted local authorities to outline their levels of satisfaction with the ASA or views on its operations and conduct.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">The Minister for Sport and the Olympics has had no recent discussions about the conduct of the ASA.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5">Where there are issues relating to NGBs' performance or behaviour outside of governance or contracted outcomes, Sport England is not obliged to interfere.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/6">In regard to using public funds to run anti-competitive activity, Community Swimming Limited (CSL) is the self-sustaining private company that has been set up with support from the ASA to deliver swimming in venues that would not normally be available for community use. The company is controlled by a board of independent trustees where the ASA has a limited minority right of representation. As CSL does not use funding from Sport England, Sport England has no jurisdiction over the way in which it operates and it is up to the discretion of leisure operators who they appoint to deliver classes.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/7">In terms of the issues the Swimming Teachers Association has with the ASA regarding recognition of swimming teaching as a separate qualification from coaching swimming, a meeting is due to take place in September 2011. The purpose of which is for the ASA and the STA, together with SkillsActive and sports coach UK, to discuss the concerns of both parties and agree a way forward. The Minister for Sport and the Olympics will be kept informed of progress.</p>

Those NGBs involved in the pilots are due to report back at the same time as the Sheffield Hallam University pilot.

	<p pid="a.12.2/1">The Government's proposed reforms to public service pensions will ensure that expenditure on pensions is affordable to the taxpayer and that public service pensions are sustainable and fair to both taxpayers and public servants. Schemes are currently discussing proposed reforms with trades unions and other representative bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/2">Chart Ex.2 of the interim report of the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission, chaired by Lord Hutton of Furness, shows forecast levels of expenditure on pensions as a proportion of GDP. As set out in Annex C of the interim report, these forecasts are sensitive to several assumptions, particularly around the rate of GDP and workforce growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/3">This analysis in Lord Hutton of Furness's report shows that, after the switch to the consumer prices index for the uprating of pensions, and taking into account the cap-and-share arrangements agreed between the Government and the unions in 2009, the cost of pensions could be expected to fall to around 1.4 per cent of GDP by 2060.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/4">Analysis produced by the NAO and published in their report, <I>The Cost of Public Service Pensions</I>, published in March 2010, shows that, without the switch to CPI indexation or the savings from cap-and-share arrangements, the cost of providing pensions would only fall to 1.8 per cent of GDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/5">Current levels of expenditure on pensions reflect a large increase in spending on pensions. Over the last decade, spending has increased by a third, to &#163;32 billion. This is reflected in Lord Hutton of Furness's analysis. Chart Ex.2 of the interim report shows that, over this period, costs as a share of GDP have risen from around 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1999/00 to around 1.9 per cent in 2009/10.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.5/1">It is a great testimony to our veterans that the Malaysian Government wished to honour them with the Pingat Jasa Malaysia (PJM) medal which was introduced in 2005 in recognition of the role they played in supporting Malaysia and beforehand Malaya, between August 1957 and August 1966.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.5/2">As a foreign award, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has the Government lead on the PJM. I am delighted that an exception to our rules was recommended by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals to allow our veterans to accept the medal and that this recommendation was agreed by Her Majesty the Queen.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.5/3">Permission was not however recommended for the PJM to be worn by veterans as the majority had previously been awarded the British General Service Medal (GSM), for their service in the region. There was a period of time, between 1960 and 1962 and, in the case of the Army, from mid-1965 onwards when the risk and rigour was not deemed sufficient to award a medal to British troops stationed in the area. It is therefore the case that some personnel did not receive a British medal for the time that they served there and they may consider that receiving the PJM would not contravene our long-standing &quot;no double double-medalling&quot; convention as they do not have a British medal for their service. However, the qualifying periods for the GSM were very carefully considered at the time, and it must be assumed that those in authority had good reasons for the criteria prescribed. The lack of a General Service Medal, or a clasp to it, does not, in itself, mean automatic qualification to wear the PJM.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.5/4">The Governments of the Commonwealth are autonomous and independent of each other. Each Government apply their own rules and judgment to their own citizens. This applies to medals as it applies to other aspects of public policy. These differences do not constitute unfair discrimination, but the reasonable exercise of independent judgment by each country's Government in line with its own constitutional principles.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-09-05a.20.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101010" speakername="Lord Hill of Oareford" colon=":" colnum="20"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110905w0001.htm#1109052000033">
	<p pid="a.20.5/1">Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a form of abuse and is wholly unacceptable. The Government believe that schools are best placed to assess which materials or strategies might be useful to help raise the awareness of their pupils about particular types of harm such as female genital mutilation. This would include raising awareness among pupils who may themselves be vulnerable to such abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">The inter-agency guidance, <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children (2010)</I> and guidance to schools and FE colleges, <I>Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education (2006)</I><I>,</I> set out how schools and individuals should work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people. These documents include guidance on FGM.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/3">The Department for Education works closely with the Home Office, Department of Health, Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) on issues related to FGM. Together we have produced multi-agency guidelines for a broad range of front-line practitioners, including teachers, to help them when working with young people. In addition, the FCO has funded a short film made by young people on FGM and its consequences. This is accompanied by a teachers' resource pack designed to support teachers to deliver a lesson on FGM. This resource will be available for use in secondary schools in September 2011.</p>
