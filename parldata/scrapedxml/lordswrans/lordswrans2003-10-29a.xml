	<p pid="a.40.0/1">Together with his French and German colleagues, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary visited Tehran on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-21">21 October</phrase> for discussions on Iran's nuclear programme. They met President Khatami, Foreign Minister Kharrazi and the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Committee Hassan Rouhani. The discussions were aimed at underlining to the Iranian authorities the concerns of the international community regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions, and the necessity for Iran to comply fully with the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors' resolution adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-12">12 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/2">By the end of the visit, they were able to agree a joint statement which committed Iran to comply with the three key elements of the IAEA board resolution:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/3" class="indent">to engage in full co-operation with the IAEA to address and resolve, through full transparency, all requirements and outstanding issues of the agency, and clarify and correct any possible failures and deficiencies within the IAEA;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/4" class="indent">to sign the IAEA additional protocol, and commence ratification procedures. As a confirmation of their good intentions, the Iranian Government state that they will continue to co-operate with the agency in accordance with the protocol in advance of its ratification;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/5" class="indent">to suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, as defined by the IAEA.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/6">The full text of the joint statement has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/7">This joint statement represents a good start to the process of resolving international concerns over Iran's nuclear programme and is welcomed as such. But it was also made clear to the Iranian interlocutors that the real test will be full and early implementation of the commitments they have offered. They know that the international community will be looking closely at the evidence in the next report of the IAEA director-general, which is due to be presented to the board of governors in early November.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/8">The joint statement makes clear that, while implementation of the steps outlined should enable the IAEA board to resolve the immediate problem with Iran, there is also a longer-term issue. Britain, France and Germany remain ready to address that issue through dialogue with Iran on a basis for longer-term co-operation, which would provide all parties with satisfactory assurances about Iran's nuclear power generation programme. It was made clear that it is only once international concerns are fully resolved that Iran could expect easier access to modern technology and supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/9">The visit has demonstrated the value of a united approach between Britain, France and Germany, working to uphold the decisions of the IAEA and its board of governors, and consistent with the common approach to Iran agreed by several European Councils.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.8/1">The Wireless Telegraphy (Limitation of Number of Licences) Order 2003 was made under powers conferred by Section 164 of the Communications Act 2003. The order and the Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/2">Section 164 of the Act permits the order to specify the frequencies and uses for which Ofcom will grant or make only a limited number of licences. The order must set out the criteria which Ofcom will apply in determining the limit and the persons to whom licences will be granted. (The order was made by the Secretary of State rather than Ofcom for the reasons given in the Explanatory Note to the order.)</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/3">The order does not set out a maximum number of licences available for frequencies and uses. This was not a requirement of Section 164. Further, the Secretary of State does not limit the availability of licences in that way. What happens is that factors such as technical frequency assignment criteria and criteria relating to persons who may be awarded licences operate to determine the limit on the number of licences granted and the persons to whom they are granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/4">Schedule 2 to the order concerns the class of licences for broadband fixed wireless access at 28 GHz. Licences are only awarded to persons by a competition (as indicated in part 2 of the schedule). The fact that licences are awarded in this way is a factor which inevitably limits the number of licences which are available at any given time and the persons to whom they are awarded. The ability of applicants to meet the terms of licences will also be a factor limiting the numbers of licences (as described in Article 4(c) of the order). There are no further specific criteria limiting numbers so &quot;none&quot; was inserted in part 3 of the Schedule.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/5">Schedule 9 concerns the class of licence for amateur radio at a range of frequencies. Part 2 of the schedule sets out the criteria relating to persons to whom licences are awarded. Those criteria, together with the ability of applicants to meet the terms of licences, are the only factors limiting the numbers of licences. Amateurs who fulfil the criteria specified in part 2 of the schedule may all share use of the same spectrum. There were no further specific criteria limiting numbers so &quot;none&quot; was inserted in part 3 of the schedule.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/6">Schedule 10 concerns the class of technology development radio licences, which may be at any frequency approved case by case where no undue interference results to other authorised services.

	<p pid="a.44.3/1">This month the Government responded positively to the recent report Government: Supporter and Customer by the Better Regulation Task Force/Small Business Council (BRTF/SBC). This report made 11 recommendations in the area of public sector procurement with the aim of creating a level playing field for SMEs to compete against large companies for contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/2">The BRTF/SBC recommendations are being piloted through two SME procurement schemes&mdash;one in the West Midlands area and a second in the London Borough of Haringey. In the West Midlands, the Office of Government Commerce is working closely with the RDA (Advantage West Midlands), the Government Office for the Region, the Small Business Service and other government and regional partners. In Haringey, the pilot is being led by the Small Business Service, working with Trade Local, an award winning initiative of the borough council and its partners to promote a more open commercial relationship between local government and local businesses. It is intended that these pilots will implement, in a controlled way, many of the recommendations of the BRTF/SBC report and inform government of the most effective ways of assisting small businesses in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/3">The Small Business Service also co-ordinates the small business research initiative (SBRI). This initiative has the aims of stimulating demand for research and development from SMEs along with the creation of new market research. The government departments involved with the SBRI have an aim to buy at least 2.5 per cent of their R&amp;D requirements from SMEs during the project.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.2/1">Following a full option appraisal review, the Department for Work and Pensions took the decision that the best way to deliver an optimum value for money solution for the management of its estate was to expand the existing PRIME contract, through negotiation, to include the former Employment Service buildings. On this basis only Land Securities Trillium, as the incumbent service provider for PRIME, was invited to submit a formal proposal. The original PRIME contract did not have any specific exclusivity or preferential provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">Ensuring the key objective of obtaining value for money necessitated transparent and demonstrable calculations. Financial comparators have been used against all aspects of the bid, and the final negotiated package is deemed to offer DWP an overall price that compares very favourably with external benchmarks as well as delivering an improved and consistent level of service. The process has been subject to ongoing independent scrutiny to ensure the robustness of the outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/3">DWP commissioned the Valuation Office to value those properties being transferred as part of the expanded contract. This work was undertaken during the summer of 2003. The agreed valuation of the freehold properties being transferred to Land Securities Trillium, which was carried out on a vacant possession basis, is &pound;128.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/4">The expected number of freehold properties to be transferred is 336. These properties total 223,000 m <sup>2</sup> (net internal area) and have an estimated rental value of &pound;15.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/5">Under the agreed terms of the expanded PRIME contract and in line with DWP's departmental plan, in addition to existing surplus space, the department can vacate up to 228,000 m <sup>2</sup> of space during the course of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/6">Under the two different vacation scenarios cited, DWP would make the following estimated payments to Land Securities Trillium during the period up to 2018:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/7" class="indent">(a) a total of &pound;2,962 million if no properties are vacated; and</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/8" class="indent">(b) around &pound;2,200 million if all options to vacate properties are exercised as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/1">In September 2000, the Government introduced &pound;6,000 training bursaries for postgraduate trainee teachers and &pound;4,000 golden hellos for those who go on to teach priority subjects, including science, in a maintained school. Since September 2002, these incentives have been reinforced by the repayment of teachers' loans pilot scheme for new teachers of priority subjects. Recruitment to courses of initial teacher training in science accordingly rose by 15 per cent between 1999&ndash;2000 and 2002&ndash;03. Figures published by the Graduate Teacher Training Registry on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-01">1 October</phrase> showed that 10 per cent more graduates had been offered and accepted teacher training places in science for 2003&ndash;04 than last year. Partly as a result of these increases, the number of unfilled vacancies for science teachers has fallen by 23 per cent in only two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/2">The Government will build on these achievements over the coming years. The Teacher Training Agency is currently developing a number of new initiatives to bring more science specialists into the classroom. These include enhancement courses designed to allow prospective teachers of chemistry and physics to bring their subject knowledge up to the required level for entry on to a postgraduate teacher training course.

	<p pid="a.49.1/2" qnum="HL5053">Whether a teacher who receives a grant of up to &pound;100,000 towards the purchase of the home is obliged by contract to continue working in London for a minimum period following receipt of the grant; and what are the terms of such a contract in the event that the recipient should leave London or give up teaching before the minimum period is reached.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/1">The package of assistance announced by the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-21">21 October</phrase> is designed to help retain good teachers within London with the potential to rise to leadership positions within the profession, by enabling them to purchase the types of homes that suit their needs but which may have been beyond their means until now. In order to be eligible for the scheme teachers will also need to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to teaching in London. In the event that a teacher chooses to leave London, or leaves teaching in the maintained sector (including academies) for more than two years, we would normally expect the loan to be repaid. This two-year period is to allow eligible teachers the ability to undertake sabbaticals, periods of secondment or career breaks, without any penalty.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">There are two separate circumstances in which a driver is able to drive a minibus without needing to pass a specific test for the category of vehicle, or to meet the higher medical standards required of drivers of passenger-carrying vehicles (PCVs). Drivers who obtained full category B (car) entitlement before <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase> were also granted D1 (not for hire or reward) minibus entitlement. Volunteers driving a minibus for a non-commercial organisation and not for hire or reward are exempted from the requirements, provided that specific criteria are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/2">Although both the above exemptions are conditional on the vehicle being used &quot;not for hire or reward&quot;, there is no definition in domestic legislation of &quot;hire or reward&quot;. It is not for my department to judge whether a teacher's contract of employment and the circumstances surrounding the use of the vehicle constitute hire or reward. Each individual case would need to be considered according to the intended use of the vehicle and the contractual arrangements that are in place between the employer and employee. Ultimately, only a court of law could provide a definitive view of a particular case.</p>

A monitoring programme has been put in place to study the local environmental impact, if any, that is caused by the residual cargo remaining on the seabed over the coming months. We will consider any revised advice from the Scottish Environment Group if there is any change in the circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.3/1">There is a continuing right of passage through the Minch and this has to be maintained under international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/2">In August 2002, the department began undertaking a programme of vessel traffic surveys at sites around the UK that are environmentally sensitive and which may be at risk from shipping. The department proposes to undertake a comprehensive radar survey of vessels using the Minch early next year. This will allow a full assessment of existing traffic patterns and allow a review of the risks associated with shipping in the Minch.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/3">In the longer term, amendments to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention agreed by the International Maritime Organization in 2002 will make it a requirement, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>, for ships over 500 gross tonnes to carry automated identification systems. Coastal states wishing to install shore-based equipment will be able to monitor shipping around their coasts. For example, this will enable the UK to continuously monitor and record ship movements in the Minch and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/4">In partnership with the General Lighthouse Authority, the Government are participating in a test programme for transmitting navigational information for display on the electronic charts now used by many ships.
