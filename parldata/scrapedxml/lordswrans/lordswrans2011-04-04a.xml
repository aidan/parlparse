	<p pid="a.319.0/1">The Government propose to replace disability living allowance for people of working age with personal independence payment from 2013-14. We are in the process of developing the new assessment for personal independence payment, which we are designing in collaboration with a group of independent specialists in disability. As such it is too soon to make final assessments of the reforms. We know it is essential that the assessment accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is considering. We will test the new assessment criteria fully before they are finalised, including considering the impact on people with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/2">No decisions have been taken on the delivery model for the new benefit. We recognise, however, the importance of providing adequate training and guidance for assessors and of ensuring that the application and assessment processes are appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. We have also accepted the offer made by the National Autistic Society when it met the Minister for Disabled People on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-21">21 January 2011</phrase> to work with us on the design of the new assessment, claim form and staff guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.319.3/1">We know it is essential for the assessment to capture the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is considering. I also know that both the Minister for Disabled People and departmental officials have met the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek its views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. We agree with many of the points raised in the National Autistic Society's recent report on DLA reform, <I>Who benefits?</I>, and we are looking closely at how these recommendations can be incorporated into its design. We recognise, for example, the importance of allowimg disabled people to bring a carer or advocate with them to assessments, where they wish to do so. We will continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.3/2">We are still considering the most appropriate delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have been taken on the detail of its operation, nor who would be responsible for undertaking the assessments. As part of this we are also considering how the recommendations from the recent review by Professor Harrington into the operation of the work capability assessment might be relevant to personal independence payment. These include recommendations around improving the awareness and capability of assessors regarding mental health issues and introducing mental, cognitive and intellectual champions into assessment centres to improve the assessment of these functions.</p>

	<p pid="a.321.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.5/2"><I>Letter from Stephen Penneck, Director General for ONS, to Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, dated April 2011</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.5/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions asking: (i) whether the wording of the census question on qualifications takes into account the fact that most 16 year-olds born between <phrase class="date" code="1994-09-01">1 September 1994</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1995-03-27">27 March 1995</phrase> have not yet taken most of their GCSE examinations (HL8256); and (ii) whether the results of the census question on qualifications will be adjusted to take account of the fact that most 16 year-olds born between <phrase class="date" code="1994-09-01">1 September 1994</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1995-03-27">27 March 1995</phrase> have not yet taken most of their GCSE examinations. (HL8257)</p>
	<p pid="a.321.5/4">Information is required on all academic and vocational qualifications to understand educational achievement and labour market participation across the population. It is used for government resource allocation and for evidence-based policy making, especially in relation to disadvantaged population groups, educationally deprived areas, and the promotion of equal opportunity. When combined with the questions on employment the information will show how skilled and educated the labour market is across the country, which enables the planning of training and adult education services.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.5/5">People of 16 and over are asked to complete these questions as ONS has to impose a cut-off at some point to avoid confusing respondents as to how to answer such questions on behalf of children, and because 16 years of age is recognised as the age that people could first enter the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.5/6">We recognise that collecting information in this way will include many 16 year-olds who have yet to sit exams for qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.5/7">We will be able to produce accurate statistics showing the number of 16 year-olds with GCSE qualifications and the proportion that this represents of those that have completed year 11 at school, in order to meet any specific user requirements, by combining the information gathered from the qualification question with other responses on the questionnaire.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.2/1">Improving the delivery of services across all sectors will be one of the key challenges for the new Government of Iraq. While progress has been made in a number of areas, additional capacity is required for effective delivery-particularly in power generation, education, healthcare, and safe and clean water. High level discussions with the new Government indicate these needs are understood.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/2">Central to this is the effective management of government resources to invest in the expansion of public services. To this end, we are supporting the Council of Representatives Finance Committee to scrutinise public expenditure. We are also providing support to the centre of government to help the Government of Iraq's efforts on policy development and delivery. Recently a memorandum of understanding was agreed between the Ministry of Finance and the British Council/British Universities Iraq Consortium to send 50 ministry staff to the UK for training as part of a larger ministry programme to develop its staff skill base.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/3">Working alongside the World Bank, the UK is helping the Government of Iraq to put in place reforms to make Iraq a better place to invest and do business, including via to public/private partnerships (PPP). The development of PPPs in Iraq will be important as a way of leveraging additional investment in public service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/4">Development of the oil infrastructure is crucial to improvement of service delivery as Iraq obtains 90 percent of its national expenditure from oil revenues. It is also key to the provision of electricity to the public and businesses, with the rationing of electricity currently necessary across Iraq. The UK and Iraq have set up a Joint Steering Group for Energy Sector Skills Development to create greater capacity in the Ministry of Oil, which will in turn allow the reform and revitalisation of the energy sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/5">Specifically on education services, the UK provides support to higher education institutions in Iraq through the Development Partnerships in Higher Education (DeIPHE) project. This improves the quality of teaching practice via partnerships with UK and other institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.5/3">&quot;I am extremely concerned at the escalating violence in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories over the past week. We have seen a surge in rockets and mortars launched at Israeli civilians from the Gaza strip. This is abhorrent. Three people have been injured, many more are living in fear. Six Palestinian civilians, including four children, have been killed as a result of Israeli actions in the Gaza strip. We have urged the Israeli Government to ensure everything is done to avoid further civilian casualties while calling for a complete end to attacks on Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/4">And we have seen the terrible sight-which we hoped belonged to the past-of a bomb at a bus station in Jerusalem. A British woman was killed and more than 30 injured. I condemn this attack in the strongest terms and call for those responsible to be held to account. Elsewhere, we have seen Israeli settlers opening fire on a Palestinian funeral procession, wounding two mourners. Also, another Palestinian was stabbed in an unprovoked attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/5">We condemn the extremists who are instigating this violence and who are deliberately attempting to wreck the chances of peace. We call on all sides to do all that they can to prevent further loss of innocent life, to bring the perpetrators to justice and to reduce current tensions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/6">We will continue to monitor the situation and raise our concerns with the Government of Israel.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.3/1">Defra's statutory nature conservation bodies (SNCBs)-the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and Natural England (NE)-have established four regional marine conservation zone (MCZ) projects (Balanced Seas, Finding Sanctuary, Irish Seas Conservation Zones and Net Gain) to identify potential MCZ sites. Each project has established stakeholder groups made up of a variety of key stakeholders in their regions to examine the evidence and put forward site recommendations and associated impact assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.3/2">The regional MCZ projects submitted their third draft reports of recommendations on site locations and conservation objectives to the independent Science Advisory Panel (SAP) at the end of February. The SAP is due to provide views on each of the project draft reports at the end of March. Achieving these milestones is an important step towards meeting the 2012 commitment to designate MCZs.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.3/3">The UK is leading the way on the protection of sharks domestically and in Europe, as well as internationally, through conservation and fisheries management bodies. All of the Government's work is guided by the strong national conservation plan that it has developed specifically for shark, skate and ray species.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.3/4">Due to their vulnerability, the Government have worked hard, and will continue to do so, to ensure that appropriate limits are set on the numbers of sharks that can be caught, wherever this catch takes place, and for total bans on catching endangered species.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.3/5">The Government negotiated successfully in Europe to see endangered shark species in UK waters protected, and are now carrying out detailed scientific research on these species to identify how to protect and manage them even more effectively in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.3/6">Furthermore, the Government have already taken the strong and proactive decision to ban UK vessels from removing fins from sharks at sea. All UK vessels now have to land sharks with fins naturally attached-a measure that will prevent shark finning. The Government want this to be the case for all vessels worldwide, and so are working hard to make sure EU legislation is amended accordingly, while continuing to seek international agreement on the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.338.5/1">Between 1948 and April 2010, state pension was paid in advance and only for full benefit weeks (seven days), from the first Monday on or after the date on which the person reached state pension age.

	<p pid="a.342.6/1">The EU, including in its capacity as chair of the Kimberley Process (KP) Working Group on Monitoring (WGM), was among the first to express both to the Democratic Republic of Congo Chair and wider KP participants, that the recent authorisation to trade Marange diamonds cannot be considered valid or applicable as it is outside the mandate of the chair and contrary to the core KP principle of consensual decision-making.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.6/2">The EU also expressed concerns about the uncertainty it creates for KP participants, the diamond industry and consumers, and urged the chair to clarify the situation as a matter of urgency. To this end, the EU has also contacted the chairs of the other KP working groups and is taking steps to organise an emergency meeting of the WGM to discuss the issue as a matter of urgency.</p>
