	<p pid="b.253.101/1">The UNECE Regulation 48 amendment was adopted in March 2006. Work on a public consultation document and regulatory impact assessment is underway and instructions about draft amendments to the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations are currently in hand. Statutory consultation, once issued, will be open for three months. The amending instrument will then need to be approved by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.101/2">The current timetable of work will ensure that, pending parliamentary approval, regulations are ready to enter into force from <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-10">10 October 2009</phrase>, the earliest date we are permitted to refuse to register heavy vehicles not fitted with reflective tape.</p>
