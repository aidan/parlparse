	<p pid="b.151.5/1">As I explained to the noble Lord in my previous Answer, service personnel aged under 18 years have their reckonable service taken from their 18th birthday. From that point they enjoy exactly the same rights of discharge as those who joined the services after their 18th birthday. Furthermore, and as detailed in my earlier Answer, service personnel aged under 18 years three months enjoy an additional right in that those who have passed their statutory six-month period for &quot;discharge as of right&quot; and have registered before reaching their 18th birthday &quot;clear unhappiness&quot; at their choice of career can request permission to leave the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.151.5/2">Individuals under 18 years of age who have registered clear unhappiness are allowed to leave; they are not denied from doing so. There will be circumstances when a final decision may be deferred. Every effort is made to ensure that individuals have fully considered their decision and they will usually be encouraged to stay.</p>
	<p pid="b.151.5/3">Guidance for commanding officers on granting unhappy under-18 service personnel permission to leave the Armed Forces is contained within Queen's Regulations (QR) and individual service publications. For example, all Army commanding officers have access to a handbook that gives instruction on the care of service personnel under 18 years of age which contains a section on &quot;the right to leave the Armed Forces&quot; which refers to the relevant QR paragraph.</p>

	<p pid="b.153.6/3">In the first instance, criminal records checks for employers in Northern Ireland are carried out by a specialist unit within the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Where applicants have a previous address in the Republic of Ireland, PSNI are able to contact the authorities there directly in order to secure access to the necessary criminal records.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.6/4">Where an applicant has an address outside the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland the Criminal Records Bureau offers an overseas advice service which provides details and guidance to employers and individuals on how to obtain a certificate of good conduct or a copy of a certificate of good conduct or a copy of a person's own criminal record from certain overseas destinations. This service is currently available through a fax-back facility. From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April 2006</phrase>, the information currently available from the fax-back service will transfer to the CRB website.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.6/5">My honourable friend the Member for Basildon and East Thurrock, in response to a previous Parliamentary Question from the honourable Member for North Down, asked the employing authorities (that is, the Education and Library Boards, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and voluntary grammar, Irish-medium, grant-maintained integrated and independent schools which employ their staff directly) to check their records and to inform her whether there is any person currently in employment in any capacity in a grant-aided school who is required t notify their details to the Police Service as a sex offender, or who has a history of sex offending. This process confirmed that there are three persons, none of them teaching staff, with a conviction for a sexual offence who are currently working in schools; none of these persons is on a sex offenders register as all the offences were committed over 15 years ago. In one case the offence was against a minor and involved a girl who was just under age; in the other two cases the offence was against an adult female. In each case the employing authority knew of the conviction through the pre-employment check and took professional advice. The advice was, in each case, that the person was not a risk to children, and so employment was offered. The employing authorities remain satisfied that these persons do not pose a risk to children. None of these offences was committed outside the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.6/6">Turning to the national context, the Government have agreed to the EU Council, Decision on exchange of criminal conviction information between EU jurisdictions. This will involve the establishment of a UK central authority to manage and process requests and data. The information received by way of this mechanism will improve the quality of employment checks in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.6/7">More widely, the CRB has been working in line with the recommendations of the Bichard inquiry further to improve access to the records of persons from overseas. Special projects have been established with countries from which significant numbers of employees migrate such as Australia and South Africa to agree arrangements for bilateral checks.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.6/8">Full details of the breadth of work in this area are provided in<i> Bichard Inquiry Recommendations: Second Progress Report</i>, presented to Parliament in November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.6/9">Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to highlight an important point. Criminal records disclosures should only form part of overall employment process. It is crucial that employers also carry out rigorous checking of other aspects of a person's history such as identity, qualifications and references.</p>

	<p pid="b.162.2/1">There is no entirely reliable assessment of the number of Iraqis killed or injured in this period. Estimates vary according to the methods used. We believe that the Iraqi authorities are best placed to provide such figures. The Iraqi Ministry of Health has released figures covering the period from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-05">5 April 2004</phrase>, when collation of statistics began, to <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>. According to these figures, 6,629 Iraqis were killed and 28,838 injured during that period. This figure includes all Iraqis, including civilians, Iraqi security forces and insurgents. The Iraqi Government have not yet published comprehensive figures for the period beyond April 2005. The <i>Iraq Body Count</i>, which relies on media reporting, currently estimates that at least 28,636 civilians have been killed since March 2003. But reliance on media reporting cannot give an entirely accurate portrayal of civilian casualties in Iraq.</p>

Recent research on the distribution of funding has stated that the allocation mechanisms of the Peace II programme have successfully targeted funds at disadvantaged areas.

	<p pid="b.169.2/1">Information on the amount spent by the National Health Service on prevention, identification and management of obesity is not held centrally. However, the National Audit Office report, <i>Tackling Obesity in England</i>, published in 2001, estimated that the direct cost to the NHS of treating obesity and its consequences in 1998 was &pound;480 million. As part of its inquiry into obesity, the Health Select Committee estimated that in 2002 the direct cost to the NHS was between &pound;990 million and &pound;1,225 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.174.0/1">The Extraordinary Session of the Transitional Federal Parliament in Baidoa was an important step forward in the Somali peace and reconciliation process. It was welcomed by the UN and the EU. A final assessment of the cost has not been completed, but a budget of the order of US $3.3 million, including for substantial work to upgrade administrative and meeting accommodation, has been envisaged.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.0/2">There are no plans to provide similar operational funds to the Somaliland Parliament, but the recent elections were largely funded by the international community including the UK. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also provided &pound;35,000 towards the costs of electoral observation missions. The Somaliland Parliament will also benefit from a substantial EU funded parliamentary support programme. The Speaker of the Somaliland Parliament has visited the UK to witness the opening of the Welsh Assembly and learn about our parliamentary practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.175.2/1">Khartoum state and the capital are host to around 4 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) from across Sudan. The IDP population has increased since the 1980s, in both camp and non-camp environments, and presents the Khartoum authorities with significant concerns for urban planning. In March 2004, the Government stepped up a process of demolitions and interruption of essential services as a way of moving IDPs to new sites. We have made clear that, while we acknowledge the right of the Sudanese authorities to replan their urban environment, the process must respect international human rights conventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.2/2">We have no reports of recent destruction of schools and medical centres in Greater Khartoum. The UK and international community have been working closely with the Government of Sudan to ensure that their treatment of IDPs is compliant with international human rights conventions. The UK has funded a number of projects in this regard, including providing an expert to work with the Khartoum authorities on settlement and replanning in Khartoum state. The majority of the interventions in Khartoum state under the UN's 2006 Workplan for Sudan will focus on providing essential services for IDPs. The UK is providing &pound;40 million towards this workplan.</p>

At the 2004 ILO session the government of Sudan reported that CEAWC had returned 728 people over the preceding year. International observers have been unable to accurately verify these figures. Since January 2006, UNICEF and the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) monitored the return of over 300 people through CEAWC, and will continue to work with CEAWC, particularly in relation to concerns about provisions for reintegrating those returned back into society.</p>

	<p pid="b.177.0/1">The Government do not offer any incentives to vehicle manufacturers to warrant their vehicles to run on fuels containing more than 5 per cent. biofuel. The Government are, however, encouraging the European Commission to amend the relevant fuel quality standards so as to allow higher percentages of biofuel to be blended into regular petrol and diesel. The Commission has confirmed in its recent biofuels strategy (available at <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/biomass/biofuel/com2006-34-en.pdf">http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/biomass/biofuel/com2006&ndash;34&ndash;en.pdf</a>) that it will review the current standards during 2006, with a view to increasing the 5 per cent. biofuel inclusion limit. Any adaptations or modifications to a vehicle are likely to have an impact on the vehicle's warranty. This is likely to be a factor which many people take into account in deciding on whether or not to convert their vehicles to run on liquefied petroleum gas. The Government does not, however, have any detailed information on the extent to which it has affected the market. Advice on the warranty implications of conversions is available from, and best provided by, vehicle manufacturers and the vehicle conversion industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.178.2/1">Although the Immigration and Nationality Directorate is not currently enforcing returns to Zimbabwe, voluntary returns, including by failed asylum seekers, continue as normal. The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal did not find that failed asylum seekers who returned voluntarily to Zimbabwe would be at risk and we therefore expect them to return voluntarily. Unsuccessful asylum seekers from Zimbabwe who appear to be destitute and who are unable to leave the United Kingdom immediately are eligible for support under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 if they meet the criteria set out in the Immigration and Asylum (Provision of Accommodation to failed Asylum Seekers) Regulations 2005. Those who have signed up for voluntary return with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) will normally satisfy the conditions for Section 4 support. It would not be right to permit failed asylum seekers to work as this would put them in a more favourable position than those still awaiting a decision on their claim who do not have permission to work.</p>
