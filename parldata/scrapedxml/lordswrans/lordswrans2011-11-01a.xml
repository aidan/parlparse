	<p pid="a.227.6/10">The number of cars that drove on Britain's roads is higher than these actual figures for three reasons:</p>
	<p pid="a.227.6/11">(a) A number of cars will have been licensed and used earlier in the year. These cars could have been exported, scrapped or had a statutory off road notification (SORN) made for them by <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-31">31 December</phrase>. In these cases they will not have been licensed at the end of the year; (b) A number of foreign cars will have visited Great Britain during the year. These will not be recorded on the DVLA database; and(c) A number of unlicensed cars will have been used during the year. The Department for Transport estimates that roughly 165,000 to 250,000 additional unlicensed vehicles in the private and light goods tax class (which includes all cars aside from those that were exempt from vehicle excise duty) were used each year on British roads in 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.6/12">The Department for Transport has estimated that about 2.8 per cent of the vehicles in the private and light goods tax class on the road in 2008 did not have a valid MoT certificate. This equates to about 610,000 vehicles. Estimates for 2009 and 2010 have not been made. It should be noted that many vehicles on the road do not require an MoT certificate, most notably cars under three years old.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.6/13">The department does not produce any statistics on the number of cars without valid insurance. The Roads Policy Operation V79 survey, carried out in March 2008 on behalf of Association of Chief Police Officers, estimated that 1.2 per cent of the vehicles stopped were without valid insurance. The survey did not produce a figure specifically for cars. In addition, most insurance policies make having a valid MoT certificate a requirement of the policy and could declare the policy invalid if the car is without a valid MoT certificate.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.5/2">there are a number of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence quality standards commissioned by the department that are either in place or are being developed for a range of conditions and pathways affecting older people including incontinence, nutrition support in adults, patient experience in adult National Health Service services, delirium, dementia, osteoarthritis and falls in a care setting;one of the eight high-impact actions developed for nursing, relates to keeping people nourished and getting better and aims to stop unintentional weight loss and dehydration in patients. This action is taken locally with initiatives such as red trays to identify patients who need help with eating and drinking and better management of charts. Since April 2010, it has been a requirement of a hospital's continuing registration with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), that service users are protected from the risks of dehydration and inadequate nutrition;within the NHS Operating Framework and the NHS Outcomes Framework, there are a number of indicators to support better care for older people. These include dementia care, hospital-acquired infections, emergency readmission rates, improving recovery from fragility fractures and helping older people to recover their independence after illness or injury; andthe department is also funding national audits of falls and bone health, dementia, continence and hip fractures.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.5/3">Local involvement networks in each local authority area are able to enter and view services to obtain the views and experiences of patients, service users and their families about their experiences of care and treatment at the time they are receiving it. Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, local HealthWatch organisations will continue this enter and view activity. This information can be shared with the CQC's compliance inspectors, which will help to focus the inspection on specific concerns and thereby help the CQC to hold local services to account. Local Healthwatch will also be the champion for public and patients, service users and carers in health and social care services. Healthwatch England will be able to use information from local Healthwatch, and elsewhere, to form a national picture of services.

We have also received reports from camp residents of loudspeakers operating within the camp. During a visit to the camp, embassy officials noted the presence of these loudspeakers.

	<p pid="a.245.0/1">A range of guidance has been issued to the police and prosecutors on administering out-of-court disposals to offenders, and this clearly sets out the types of offences for which each out-of-court disposal can be offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">Monitoring is the responsibility of the administering police force. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate published a joint inspection of the use of out-of-court disposals across police forces in June 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3">The use of out-of-court disposals and informal community resolutions across different police forces will depend on the profile of crime in those areas and the priorities of communities and local agencies. It is for the police and in some cases the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to decide in individual cases the appropriate response to a crime. National guidance on the use of out-of-court disposals provides a framework within which the police and CPS will take operational decisions using their own professional judgement.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/4">There is no national guidance on community resolutions, but each police force will have their own policies and training for officers on the use of these types of informal sanctions. Force policy on community resolutions is an operational matter and, therefore, the responsibility of the chief officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/5">Statistics on the use of out-of-court disposals are collected by police forces and are published as National Statistics by the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/6">Since April 2011, forces have been able to return data to the Home Office on the number of restorative justice and community resolution disposals they have administered on a voluntary basis. These are included within the annual National Statistics publication on detections and are published as part of the &quot;other detections&quot; category.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/7">The Home Office and Ministry of Justice made a commitment in July to provide justice outcome information alongside street-level crime data on Police.uk by May next year, which will include data on out-of-court disposals. This will make information on the outcomes of recorded crimes more transparent and meaningful to the public.</p>

Extensive discussions were also held with other government departments as part of the policy development and clearance process, which included discussions on systemic costs. Ultimately, costs to other departments will be driven by behavioural responses to the changes, and these are very difficult to predict with any real degree of accuracy.</p>
