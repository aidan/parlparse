	<p pid="b.35.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.35.1/2" qnum="HL2986">What is the evidence for the advice which recently appeared on the farmed animals page of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' website that during milking of dairy cows the case for wearing disposable latex or rubber gloves is indisputable particularly where contagious pathogens are the main source of contamination.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-04-17b.35.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="35"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70417w0001.htm#07041775000028">
	<p pid="b.35.2/1">That wearing rubber gloves and keeping them clean can help reduce bacterial contamination during milking has been our advice since the publication of our advisory booklet <I>Treatment and Prevention of Mastitis in Dairy Cows</I> in 1999 and on the Defra website as part of our advice on reducing mastitis in dairy cows since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/2">Bacteria, including the bacteria that cause mastitis, can be passed from cow to cow by stock-keepers during milking and it is demonstrably easier to ensure a high level of hand hygiene when wearing rubber gloves. This advice was originally submitted by ADAS, an agricultural consultancy with which Defra has an advisory contract, and is generally recognised, from practical experience, to be good milking parlour routine.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.5/1">The severity of the disease and the controls to monitor and restrict movement of horses could significantly affect the equine industry in the UK. Introduction of the disease could be either through the windborne carriage of infected midges from the near-European continent if disease were to be confirmed there, which is not the case at present, or through the illegal introduction of infected equines. It is a requirement that owners who suspect an equine of being affected with African horse sickness notify Animal Health (formerly the State Veterinary Service).</p>
	<p pid="b.35.5/2">European Union rules permit imports of horses only from countries or regions which are free from African horse sickness. Pre-export tests are required for all horses from free countries in Africa or the Middle East.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.5/3">Council Directive 92/35 provides for compulsory notification and the setting up of a protection zone of at least a 100-kilometre radius around an infected premises. This, together with a surveillance zone of at least a further 50 kilometres, would have to remain in force for at least 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.5/4">African horse sickness is included in The Specified Diseases (Notification and Slaughter) Order 1992 to implement the slaughter requirements of EU Council Directive 92/35/EEC, which lays down control rules and measures to combat African horse sickness.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.2/1">The wide-ranging research work on bluetongue and associated diseases is undertaken by Pirbright (in containment facilities), and some other research (not requiring containment) is carried out in a number of other facilities, such as universities. The total number of scientists engaged in this area of work is around 36. This figure can fluctuate a little with the allocation of part-time staff and changes in student and post-doctorate numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.2/2">The knowledge base on bluetongue and African horse sickness is predominantly centralised at Pirbright, and the laboratory co-operates internationally in respect of its work on this area. This is reflected by its status as a European Community reference laboratory for bluetongue and is the OIE reference laboratory both for bluetongue and African horse sickness. All research undertaken at Pirbright is published.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.6/1">The report is wide ranging. In so far as parents' experiences of combining work and care is concerned, the Government have an excellent track record in providing choice and flexibility to help parents balance their work and family responsibilities. We introduced the right to request flexible working for parents of young and disabled children in 2003. We have been monitoring the impact of this legislation and have recently extended it to carers of adults. The law has been a considerable success: almost 25 per cent of employees with dependent children under the age of six have requested flexible working in the past two years and four out of five requests are accepted.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.6/2">The report also highlights several issues under the term &quot;the benefits trap&quot;. We are aware of these concerns and there is pre-existing work in development as well as existing policy measures in places. For example, we are developing an information provision strategy to improve information provision for carers across all DWP services and channels, including DWP customer-facing staff at agencies (Jobcentre Plus, Disability and Carers Service and Pensions Service), leaflets, relevant marketing campaigns and helplines. This will aim to co-ordinate messages and information for carers about benefits, work options, training and pension planning.</p>

Primary care trusts will however need to demonstrate in the 2008 planning round that they have a clear strategy for the development of primary and community services, including ambitious goals for the shift of resources rooted in the White Paper vision. In the mean time, we are developing metrics that can be used to measure the shift of care closer to home, which includes the need to promote preventative interventions and health and well-being, with stronger local services and support to reduce the prevalence of physical and mental illness.</p>

It concluded that it is very likely that observed global warming over at least the past 50 years was predominantly caused by increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.

To ensure that biofuels are sourced sustainably, the Government are proposing to develop a carbon and sustainability scheme as part of the obligation.

	<p pid="b.47.2/1">Returning the National Health Service to overall financial balance has been a key priority in 2006-07. As part of the strategy to achieve this, strategic health authorities (SHAs) have top sliced resource allocations made to their primary care trusts (PCTs), thereby creating SHA reserves. The level of any contributions is based on the financial and service circumstances of individual organisations, and is always underpinned by the principle of fairness.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.2/2">Top-sliced resources are held in the SHA reserves on behalf of the NHS. The SHA can use these reserves to balance the overall financial position within its area&mdash;not by physically moving money around the system to bail out individual organisations, but by setting the resources against instances of overspending by trusts and PCTs at aggregate economy level.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.2/3">We have been clear that SHAs should maintain the integrity of the allocations system, with contributing PCTs being entitled to repayment of their contributions over a period which does not normally exceed the three-year allocation period. We have asked SHAs to make sure that, as far as possible, PCTs with the greatest health need are the first to be repaid. However, any repayment is dependent on affordability within the SHA economy, and is inextricably linked to the speed and stability of financial recovery in the NHS as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.0/1">The Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme shows potential for contributing to air quality monitoring and forecasting policies at various levels. The aspiration to make data (from ground and satellite networks) more readily available, efficiently acquired and fit for purpose is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/2">Current air quality monitoring at member state level is determined by a European directive that stipulates the use of certain technologies and standards which must be adhered to. This is usually delivered through ground-based sensor networks. Satellite data are not used as they cannot meet the required data quality criteria, but they could still be useful for giving greater insight into air quality issues, for instance, through quantifying diffuse or remote sources such as international shipping or ammonia emissions from agricultural land.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/3">Air quality forecasts are based on operational models used by the UK Met Office. In future, we expect to see greater use of assimilated satellite data to help enhance these models, particularly in terms of trans-boundary transport of pollutants. Currently, the use of satellite data is mainly restricted to research activities. The ESA Promote project demonstrates the potential for a host of air quality and atmospheric composition services to be delivered. Whether they can fully transition to operational status will depend on many factors, including the accuracy and reliability of data acquisition.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.2/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency does not have the legal authority to release information to foreign authorities seeking to enforce fines and penalties. We are aware that the European Commission is funding research to identify the steps that could be taken at a European level to implement a pan-EU approach to cross-border enforcement of traffic offences involving all member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.2/2">Further information is contained in the department's response in January to a Commission consultation paper <I>Respecting the Rules: Better Road Safety Enforcement in the European Union</I>. A copy of the response can be found at: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transport/roadsafety_library/consultations/enforcement_20061106/enforcement_united_kingdom.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/transport/roadsafety_library/consultations/enforcement_20061106/enforcement_united_kingdom.pdf</a>.</p>
