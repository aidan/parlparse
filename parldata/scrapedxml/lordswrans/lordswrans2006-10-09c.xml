The ARTF has inbuilt safeguards against the risk of corruption: it reimburses money only when there is a paper trail to demonstrate it has been spent in accordance with strict controls. A full-time external oversight agent monitors these claims. We also channel aid through projects to build government capacity, and we apply rigorous compliance checks on how these are managed in line with DfID best practice, applying strict procurement guidelines and undertaking rigorous monitoring.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.8/1">The Government have proposed that a Department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice be set up under the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Hajj, which has an operating budget of $6 million this year. However, the proposal has yet to be debated by the Afghan National Assembly, and no terms of reference have been agreed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.8/2">DfID provides around half of its programme (&pound;50 million in 2006-07) in a contribution to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). These resources allow the Afghan Government to establish their own priorities for reconstruction activities and build capacity by ensuring that the Government take the lead in implementation. Around 80 per cent of these resources are used for wages and salaries of government officials. In principle the Government could use DfID's resources to fund any expenditure that meets the eligibility criteria of the ARTF. These criteria ensure that all expenditures are contained in the government budget and consistent with Afghan law, do not include military spending, and follow financial management standards set by the World Bank. Aid has proven to be more effective where the Government have control of their own budget and resources, and given Afghanistan's dependence on foreign donors, this can only be done through instruments such as the ARTF.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.8/3">However, DfID's overall support to Afghanistan is governed by the 10-year development partnership arrangement signed by Tony Blair and President Karzai in January 2006, which commits Afghanistan to upholding human rights. Were we to believe that the Afghan Government were breaching this agreement through any of their actions, we would raise this politically at the highest level in Afghanistan. We also participate on the monitoring and review board for the Afghanistan Compact, which provides opportunities to address issues such as these.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.20/1">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. According to the executive summary of the report, which is now available on the UNODC's website (<a href="http://www.unodc.org">www.unodc.org</a>), overall cultivation of opium poppy in Afghanistan rose from 104,000 hectares in 2005 to 165,000 hectares in 2006. The report also provides a full breakdown of cultivation by province. This shows that the increase is due to a substantial increase in planting in Helmand and other southern provinces. This is worrying but reflects the very difficult security situation and limited law enforcement capability in the south. Elsewhere in areas where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved last year have been sustained and in some cases fallen. It is too early to speculate on cultivation levels for 2007. We will know more following the release of UNODC's rapid assessment survey in the spring. The noble Baroness may also wish to refer to separate UK-commissioned research into the drivers behind farmers' planting decisions which I will make available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.26/1">DfID supports many non-governmental organisations working on agricultural issues in Africa. These are usually subject to independent evaluation. Progress reports on much of DfID's support to NGOs are made available on the DfID website (<a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>). Most non-governmental organisations we support also synthesise their experience and share good practice widely.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.26/2">In 2005-06 DfID provided more than &pound;81 million of support through long-term strategic arrangements (Partnership Programme Agreements&mdash;PPAs) to 18 international non-governmental organisations. PPAs support a broad range of activities including agriculture. PPAs are reviewed annually and independent evaluations are planned for all of these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.26/3">DfID also undertook a wide range of studies on agriculture and poverty reduction, including on the role of development assistance, in preparation for the DfID policy paper <I>Growth and poverty reduction: the role of agriculture</I> released in December 2005. Copies of this have been laid in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.32/1">In general, there is no legal requirement for landowners to tell neighbours about most chemical use on land owned by the landowner themselves. There are two notable exceptions:</p>
	<p pid="c.1.32/2">when farmers and growers use sulphuric acid as a desiccant; andaerial spraying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.32/3">The landowner must tell their neighbours 24 hours before they begin their treatment with sulphuric acid and they must put up signs and notices about treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.32/4">For aerial spraying, the operator must tell people living within 25 metres of the boundary of the land to be treated, and the person in charge of any hospital, school or other institution with boundaries lying within 150 metres of the flight path, 24 hours before the treatment. Again, signs and notices have to be used.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.32/6">The latest code of practice for using plant protection products&mdash;a statutory code giving advice and guidance to all professional users&mdash;states that it is good practice to advise people who live or work around the area to be treated of the intention to apply chemicals, giving them information about the chemicals being used. It also explains that it is good management to consider extra measures such as leaving an untreated area next to the neighbouring property, putting up signs letting people know the pesticide being used and where they can get further information, and giving out information cards (if available) to those who want them.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.35/2">The accuracy of the information contained in the Land Register is underpinned by a state guarantee and in 2005-06 Land Registry processed 98.8 per cent of all registrations free of error.</p>

Registration is compulsory after certain specific events&mdash;for example, sale of land or death of an owner. Land Registry cannot otherwise compel registration but does have a strategy of working towards a comprehensive land register by persuading landowners of the benefits of voluntarily registering their holdings. During 2006-07, Land Registry aims to register a further 700,000 hectares of land through voluntary registration.</p>

We have put in place a range of short and long-term measures to ameliorate this situation. In the short term this includes: training and recruitment initiatives; financial retention and re-engagement incentives; flexibility in the rank employed in some posts; the mobilisation of Reservists; some contractorisation (where appropriate); and regular reviews of force levels required for each operation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.65/1">Although current avian influenza vaccines are able to reduce mortality, it is possible that some vaccinated birds would still be capable of becoming infected and transmitting avian influenza without displaying symptoms of the disease. This could increase the time taken to detect and eradicate the virus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.65/2">For this reason, the Chief Veterinary Officer's advice remains that we should not vaccinate poultry in advance of an avian influenza outbreak or as an immediate disease control response. High standards of biosecurity, separation of poultry from wild birds and careful surveillance for signs of disease are the most effective means of protection. However, we continue to keep our policy under close review in the light of scientific developments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.65/3">In view of current uncertainties in the nature and spread of the virus, we are securing access to a supply of 10 million doses of vaccine and we are developing a vaccination delivery plan with stakeholders as part of our contingency planning.</p>

As CSCI reported in <I>The State of Social Care in England 2004-05</I>, the data suggest that the quality of these services has been improving, both in terms of average performance and in the number of services meeting almost all of the national minimum standards. The pattern of improvement has continued in 2005-06. Details will be set out in CSCI's next State of Social Care report, due to be published later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.126/1">The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is funded by a combination of Government funding via grant-in-aid and regulatory fees from providers at levels set by Government. Fees for CSCI's work are set in March of each year, following a process of consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.126/2">CSCI is the independent inspectorate for all social care services in England. It is accountable to the Secretary of State for Health and is also required by law to report to Parliament annually. It registers, inspects and regulates social care providers in the private, local authority and voluntary sectors, all of which are required to pay fees for the services it provides. The fees reflect the work involved in registering and inspecting care establishments and contribute to providing for a safe and realistic level of inspection activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.126/3">It is the Government's policy to move to a position where the recurrent costs of providing regulation are fully recovered from service providers. The annual fee increases are part of this process. The Government believe it is right in principle for commissioners of services, providers and service users to meet the cost of regulation, because all benefit from regulation and the assurance that the regulatory system provides about the quality of services and the protection of vulnerable people. Providers of care can, of course, take CSCI's fees into account when negotiating with those who commission its services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.126/4">The information requested on the proportions of CSCI's income which were charged back to care providers is shown in the table. For 2006-07, fees cover about 50 per cent of the overall cost of CSCI's regulatory activity, which represents about 80 per cent of its work.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.132/1">The Red Consultancy was appointed through a competitive tender handled by the Central Office of Information (COI) through its purchasing framework agreements. There is, therefore, a contract between the Red Consultancy and the COI acting on behalf of the Home Office. The contract was awarded for the financial year 2004-05. It is reviewed each year and was renewed in 2005-06 and for 2006-07. The Red Consultancy received &pound;225,000 for the first year of the campaign, including all fees and expenses for a number of projects. In the second year of the campaign, it received &pound;265,000. This financial year, activity is planned up to the value of &pound;275,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.132/2">For those three years, Red Consultancy's task has been to increase understanding of community sentences as an effective form of punishment. The work also aims to engage communities and encourage them to nominate what sort of work offenders should do. So far, the campaign is reaching on average around 30 million people each year. At the end of each financial year, a full evaluation of activity is undertaken by the Home Office's Communication Directorate, as is the practice for all central marketing campaigns. Marketing evaluations are shared with senior officials andMinisters, but there is no legislative requirement to publish these or to place them in the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.150/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.150/2">Letter from the Director of Macroeconomics and Labour Market, Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-14">14 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.150/3">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question (HL7275) asking what is the estimated increase in the cost of living over the past one, three and five years for United Kingdom households with incomes in the lowest quintile. I am replying in her absence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.150/4">Information in the form requested is not readily available. Calculation of weights for households with incomes in the lowest quintile for the retail prices index (RPI) would require special calculations using data from the Office for National Statistics' expenditure and food survey, from which the RPI weights are derived. Specifically, the process would involve returning to each year's survey at the household level and removing all observations from respondents above the lowest quintile. The remaining responses would then need to be aggregated to national levels before embarking on the detailed process of producing RPI expenditure weights. The removal of such a large amount of the responses means that it is likely that a number of years would need to be averaged to provide an acceptable sample size. Special calculations would also be required to derive the weights for certain housing components whose weights are modelled (that is, mortgage interest payments and depreciation costs). Taken together, this means that the Question can be answered only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.150/5">Consumer prices index (CPI) weights are derived from whole economy estimates of household expenditure taken from the national accounts. The source data come from a variety of sources, including non-household surveys, and are therefore not amenable to the calculation of weights for households with incomes in the lowest quintile.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.165/1">The primary market for wheat and other crops is still the food market despite the recent increases in their use for biofuels. The availability and price of the feedstocks have played an important role in the development of the biofuel sector. The most rapid development of the bioethanol market has been in countries with large surplus production in crops that can be used to produce bioethanol. In the UK, biofuel production offers new markets for the UK cereals and oilseeds surpluses. However, in practice, it is likely that the UK sector will use a mixture of home-grown and imported crops, recycled waste vegetable oils and tallow, and imported biofuels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.165/2">In the short term, bioethanol production will mainly use cereals and other food crops as feedstock. The market, through the price mechanism, will guide the allocation of the crops to the different sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.165/3">Over the medium to long term, it is likely that second generation biofuels derived from cheaper and more abundant feedstocks, such as straw or waste products, will play an important role in meeting the increased ethanol demand. Rising prices for food crops would give additional impetus to the development of technologies for the production of biofuels based on alternative feedstocks.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.168/1">DfID is in the early stages of weighing up the arguments and evidence on how production of biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, could impact on food production and food aid. Overall, more evidence, including on the right balance between food and fuel production in different regions, is needed. We will continue to monitor the situation carefully.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.168/2">In 2005 production of fuel ethanol rose by 19 per cent, driven largely by rising oil prices. There is no evidence that this has so far affected the supply of food aid. Food shortage and famine are more related to poor distribution and a shortage of disposable income to buy food rather than agricultural production or provision of food aid.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.168/3">Expansion of the area under biofuel crops is likely to happen in countries with the right growing conditions and sufficient land. This could reduce the area of land devoted to food production. However some energy crops can be grown on degraded land too marginal for food crops; others can promote land restoration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.168/4">There are ways that the trade-offs between food and biofuel production can be managed. Increasing the productivity of both food and energy crops can promote economic growth and poverty reduction. Crops can be developed that yield much higher quantities of energy per unit of land or water, or that generate by-products that can be used for bioenergy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.168/5">DfID plans to support the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP), announced at the G8 in Gleneagles in 2005 and launched this year. This will promote collaboration between developed and developing countries. We will continue to support international efforts to increase food production, for example through the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, and to increase poor people's access to food.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.171/1">The amount of carbon emitted during production, and saved through substituting bioethanol for petrol, depends on the feedstock used, the way the crop is cultivated, the way it is processed, how that processor is powered, and the mode and mileage travelled by the feedstock and the bioethanol before it is used. The following table gives average figures for the net lifecycle reduction in carbon dioxide emissions for various feedstocks:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="c.1.201/1">The Government recognise that family breakdown is a serious matter and can be a major cause of deprivation or disadvantage. We have policies in place to help tackle the consequences. But while it can be a driver of other forms of deprivation, it is not a direct measure of deprivation in its own right. Family breakdown may have negative effects on family members but conversely it may have positive effects (such as if the relationship involved violence). Measuring the negative effects of family breakdown and expressing these at an area level is therefore not possible.</p>

Following an extensive round of sampling and testing of farmed and wild fish and other epidemiological investigations, we were able to announce a reduction in the size of the area under restriction on <phrase class="date" code="">10 August</phrase>. The immediate effect of this was to enable the majority of the 33 farms originally affected by the controls to resume normal trade in live fish. Throughout this period we worked closely with fish farmers and their representatives to minimise the impact of controls by allowing certain movements where scientific evidence suggested that it was safe to do so.</p>

Based on the power of the study to detect differences, some caution is necessary when interpreting the results, but within the limits imposed by the small number of subjects, this study found no evidence for any differences between the absorption of fluoride ingested in artificially fluoridated drinking water, and in drinking water in which the fluoride is present naturally, or between the absorption of fluoride from hard and soft waters, at fluoride concentrations close to 1 part per million&quot;. We also accept the conclusion reached in the paper published in the Journal of Dental research that: &quot;any differences in bioavailability of fluoride between drinking waters in which the fluoride is present naturally or added artificially, or the waters are hard or soft, are small compared with the large within-and between-subject variation in F absorption following ingestion of drinking waters with F concentrations close to 1 part per million&quot;.</p>

Nevertheless, we are aware that the presence of organochlorines (such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dioxin) and heavy metals (such as methylmercury) in whales have led to several Japanese and other international toxicologists voicing concerns about the health risks associated with eating contaminated whale meat.</p>

We believe that, in order to tackle forced marriage more effectively, we need to take forward the recommendations for non-legislative action made by respondents to the recent public consultation. We agree that training of professionals alone will not suffice, and will be following up the recommendations, favoured by the majority of respondents, for further awareness-raising campaigns and education as key tools in maximising the effect of existing laws.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.351/1">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary wrote on <phrase class="date" code="">19 July</phrase> to formally thank the monitor for her report which contains many constructive recommendations as to how UKvisas can improve its decision quality. UKvisas has already issued guidance to visa sections to implement the agreed recommendations. This was done in July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.351/2">Section 4 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 2006 removes the right of appeal from entry clearance applications under the points-based system. Implementation of the Act will be phased in line with the introduction of the points-based-system tiers. An administrative review will give applicants the opportunity to challenge the reasons given for refusal where they believe an error of fact has been made.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.351/3">Instructions were issued to entry clearance officers on objectively assessing student and visitor applications in March, August and November 2005. These detailed how applications should be considered objectively and that subjective assessments regarding accents were not appropriate. Further guidance regarding visit applications were issued following legal advice in July 2006. All the recommendations in the independent monitor's report at paragraph 73 were covered in these instructions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.351/4">Further instructions were issued in October 2005 advising visa sections, where there was more than one full-time entry clearance manager, to review the refusal notice before it was served. Training assessment has been overhauled to provide more transparent and focused feedback to delegates to address concerns with regard to overall and specific areas of performance including quality of decisions. In addition, a new programme of overseas refresher training has been launched for existing entry clearance staff&mdash;that includes the importance of objective assessments of applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.351/5">Entry clearance managers at visa sections overseas closely monitor workloads and seasonal variations in demand. UKvisas provides additional staffing on a seasonal basis in order to cope with additional demand. UKvisas also maintains a team of &quot;floaters&quot; who can be deployed overseas at fairly short notice in order to deal with unexpected spikes in demand.

	<p pid="c.1.354/2">Letter from the Director of Macroeconomics and Labour Market, Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-14">14 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.354/3">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question (HL7274) which asked what would have been the increase in the retail prices index and consumer prices index over the past one, three and five years using equal weights for the expenditure of each household (democratic weights) instead of weights proportional to the expenditure of each household (plutocratic weights). I am replying in her absence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.354/4">Information in the form requested is not readily available. Calculation of democratic weights for the retail prices index (RPI) would involve a considerable degree of manipulation of data from the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) expenditure and food survey, from which the RPI weights are derived. Specifically, the process would involve returning to the original survey data at household level (that is, each individual response). For each household, actual spending on every commodity would need to be converted into a proportion of the total expenditure incurred by that particular household. These proportions would need to be averaged across all households before using the resultant averages to produce RPI expenditure weights on a democratic basis. Special calculations would also be required to derive the weights for certain housing components whose weights are modelled (that is, mortgage interest payments and depreciation costs). This means that the question can be answered only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.354/5">However, previously unpublished research by ONS, which is summarised in the table below, gives some indication of the difference between the use of democratic and plutocratic weights in the RPI:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.1.354/8"> <td colspan="4">RPI percentage change over 12 months</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1.354/9"> <td></td> <td>Feb 1999</td> <td>Feb 2000</td> <td>Feb 2001</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1.354/10"> <td>Democratic weights</td> <td>2.5</td> <td>2.5</td> <td>2.7</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1.354/11"> <td>Plutocratic weights (actual RPI)</td> <td>2.1</td> <td>2.3</td> <td>2.7</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.1.354/14">Consumer prices index (CPI) weights are derived from whole economy estimates of household expenditure taken from the national accounts. The source data come from a variety of sources, including non-household surveys, and are therefore not amenable to the construction of democratic weights.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.357/4">There are two main measures of inflation produced by the Office for National Statistics, the consumer prices index (CPI) which forms the basis for the Government's inflation target and the retail prices index (RPI) whose many uses includes indexation of state benefits and pensions. The percentage change over 12 months in the annual average index in 2005 for the CPI is 2.1 per cent. The corresponding figure for the RPI is 2.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.357/5">The latest estimate of inflation in 2006 is for July when the rate of CPI inflation was 2.4 per cent and the rate of RPI inflation was 3.3 per cent.</p>

In a competitive market there is an argument for price and access discrimination which can benefit consumers as long as they are aware of what they are paying for and there are procedures in place allowing them to change service provider if they wish to quickly, easily and cheaply.</p>

There were, however, two pieces of British equipment found. One was a commercially available remote video camera for which no export licence was required. The other was a thermal imaging system that was exported under licence in 1999 for use in a domestic residence. Proper procedures were followed at the time, including making a careful risk assessment. This concluded there was no reason to suspect that the equipment would be used for anything other than its described purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.384/2">In other respects, we cannot give categorical details of items of UK origin used in the recent conflict. However, all applications for export licences to transfer arms and related weaponry to that region, as with all other regions, are assessed rigorously on a case by case basis against the consolidated criteria, taking full account of the prevailing circumstances at the time of application and other relevant announced government policies. Any application which fails to meet these criteria will be refused.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.414/1">We have considered very seriously the action needed to protect the pink sea fans, ross corals and sunset corals, and to protect other parts of Lyme Bay's important marine environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.414/2">We have worked closely over recent months with both English Nature and representatives of the fishing industry to reach a compromise on the areas of the bay to be closed. In the end, Ben Bradshaw determined that a zonal solution backed by independent scientific assessment and advice was the most proportionate way to provide the necessary protection for those areas of Lyme Bay of greatest nature conservation and marine biodiversity importance. It will also allow a valuable sustainable fishery (estimated value of up to &pound;3 million annually) to continue where it has done for many years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.414/3">The areas to be closed give over seven times the level of protection that was available in Lyme Bay last year and cover more than 90 per cent of the pink sea fan locations presently confirmed by English Nature and Devon Wildlife Trust surveys. Members of the South West Inshore Scallopers Association confirmed they would respect the closed areas from midnight on <phrase class="date" code="">24 August</phrase> and have in place a system for monitoring compliance. They also undertook to advise non-members of the agreement not to fish in these areas. At the same time we will be considering, with the Devon and Southern Sea Fisheries Committees, the most appropriate legislative vehicle to make this protection statutory.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.414/4">We will also be considering suggestions that we should exclude other forms of extractive fishing from the closed zones, in order to allow the biodiversity of Lyme Bay to receive maximum benefit and to allow scallops to benefit in the open areas. Potters, gill netters, pelagic trawlers and divers will be fully consulted as we develop our ideas.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.435/1">It is recognised that black and minority ethnic (BME) people remain under-represented in senior management. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 places a positive duty on public bodies, including the National Health Service, to promote race equality. It is therefore essential that steps are taken to ensure that NHS staffing is representative of the community it serves.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.435/2">NHS Employers has issued guidance to encourage the NHS to use the current opportunity of reorganisation to address this imbalance. The guidance includes a checklist designed to outline the recommended action that NHS employers should take to ensure that there is no direct or indirect discrimination against any particular individual or group through organisational change.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.435/3">In addition, several programmes of work underpin this Government's commitment to equality in employment in the NHS. The Positive Action project gives NHS organisations tools and good practice examples of how to redress workforce under-representation; the national NHS Black and Minority Ethnic Leadership Forum ensures a stronger voice for BME leaders in the NHS; and the Breaking Through programme aims to support the progression of BME staff into senior leadership roles. In addition, the 10-point leadership and race equality action plan, which was launched in February 2004, challenges all NHS leaders to systematically address race equality with respect to both patient care and staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.462/1">The implementation of the screening programmes for sickle cell and thalassaemia has raised the profile of the conditions and increased the demand for services with increased numbers of cases being identified. A range of work is in hand to support clinicians responsible for patients with thalassaemia and sickle cell and help to ensure that patients have access to the same quality of care, including neonates identified by the screening programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.462/2">A professional group led by the British Society for Haematology (on behalf of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology), and the UK Forum on Haemoglobin Disorders and supported by the Department of Health and the voluntary sector has developed national standards for the clinical care of children with sickle cell disease due for publication later this year. Standards for the clinical care of children and adults with thalassaemia in the UK were published in June 2005. The guidelines were sponsored by the UK Thalassaemia Society and endorsed by the department.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.462/3">A clinical network has now been established to ensure that the potential benefits of the screening programme are achieved and that the complications that require specialist care are managed in the right place with appropriate resources. Around 20 centres will provide comprehensive care, standardising and improving care in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.465/1">All health professionals have a duty to keep up to date in the field in which they practise. The relevant regulatory and professional bodies lay down requirements for this and failure to reach the necessary standard may call the practitioner's registration into question. The post-registration training needs of National Health Service professionals, including nurses, are decided by local NHS organisations against regulatory requirements, local NHS priorities, and through appraisal processes and training-needs analyses informed by local delivery plans and the needs of the service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.465/2">We believe that funding for training generally should be used to ensure that staff at all levels have the opportunity to access training opportunities. In this way some may progress through the skills escalator to professional training programmes. However, it is for each strategic health authority to decide its own priorities for investment and to focus training resources where they are most needed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.468/1">No estimate of the annual cost of inappropriate testing is available. However, the independent review of pathology services in England chaired by Lord Carter of Coles, in its report published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-02">2 August 2006</phrase>, copies of which are available in the Library, identified several possible factors which could lead to inappropriate testing. These included unnecessary repeat tests and the practice of defensive medicine. The independent review did not find robust evidence in this area but estimated that a figure of 25 per cent for tests carried out in primary care and repeated unnecessarily in secondary care following the patient's admission to hospital might be approximately right.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.468/2">The Department of Health has accepted the independent review's recommendation to set up a series of pilot projects in England to build a sound evidence base on which to take forward reform of National Health Service pathology services, including reduction of inappropriate testing.</p>

However, the level of long-term sickness remains a concern, and, following a recent review, the following steps have been taken to address the issue: revised policy and procedures for sickness absence implemented from July 2006; a new employee support programme, which includes occupational health, welfare and counselling facilities from April 2006; and a new performance management system implemented from April 2006 to improve objective setting, performance monitoring and personal development.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.543/1">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> (&quot;A day&quot;) tax limits applied to the pensions that could be paid by occupational pension schemes that were approved by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and from annuity contracts purchased by such pension schemes. Many pension schemes incorporated these tax limits into their rules and similarly many annuity contracts reflected the limits in their contract terms, but others simply relied upon the fact that such tax limits were imposed upon them by the tax rules.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.543/2">From A day these tax limits on pensions have been removed. This meant that some occupational pension schemes that did not have the previous tax limits specifically written into their rules potentially no longer had an upper ceiling on their pensions and faced unexpected increases in pension liabilities. The Registered Pension Schemes (Modification of Rules of Existing Schemes) Regulations 2006 (the &quot;modification regulations&quot;) continue to apply the previous pension limits to such schemes and to annuity contracts which were not in payment on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-05">5 April 2006</phrase>, from A day until <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2011</phrase> or such later time as HMRC may prescribe through regulations. The effect of this is to ensure that members continue to receive the same level of pension. During this period the scheme trustees or the annuity provider may, at any time, amend the rules of the pension scheme or the terms of the annuity contract so that the regulations cease to apply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.543/3">The modification regulations ensure that the A day changes do not unexpectedly increase some pension payments and ensure that some occupational schemes and annuity contracts continue to pay members the same level of pensions. Therefore it is not necessary to monitor the level of the restrictions set out in those regulations. The consequences for the revenue received by the Exchequer arising from the modification regulations will depend upon the extent to which pension schemes and annuity contracts choose to retain the old benefit limits rather than adopt the more generous limits available under the post-A day tax rules.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.558/1">The Government are determined to eradicate child trafficking and later this year will launch their UK Action Plan on Human Trafficking, which addresses the prevention of trafficking, law enforcement and prosecution of offenders and providing protection and assistance to victims. We set out our proposals during recent consultation with stakeholders and obtained more than 200 responses. We are currently considering these which will help inform our policy development on child trafficking.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-10-09c.1.561" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61009w0014.htm#0610054001149">
	<p pid="c.1.561/1">The total amount spent per year on operations targeted specifically at child trafficking since 2000 is not held centrally by the Government. However, Reflex, a multi-agency taskforce which co-ordinates the law enforcement response to human trafficking, is funded by the Home Office with &pound;20 million a year, up to 2008. Out of this budget, several operations have been mounted to counter human trafficking in which children have been identified.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.561/2">Operation Paladin, a multi-agency effort specifically aimed at identifying trafficked children, started at Heathrow airport in October 2005. Teams of specialist social workers, based at five ports and asylum screening units, working jointly with police and immigration officers, are helping to identify the particular needs of unaccompanied asylum seeking children who may have been trafficked and develop plans to safeguard their welfare.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.561/3">Reflex has also funded Operation Pentameter, launched in February 2006, the first national co-ordinated police effort aimed at tackling human trafficking for sexual exploitation. Eighty-four victims were rescued, 12 of whom were minors. From the Government's consultations on their UK Action Plan on Human Trafficking, ACPO's proposal of setting up a UK Human Trafficking Centre will succeed Operation Pentameter. The centre will provide a more co-ordinated approach across all police forces in its aim to combat human trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.561/4">Funding is also supporting the Serious Organisation Crime Agency (SOCA), which is bringing a renewed focus on improving intelligence and targeting those organised crime groups involved in trafficking humans. Its affiliate, the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP), is playing a vital role in preventing child abuse on the internet.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.561/5">The Government's plan to launch a UK Action Plan on Human Trafficking later this year will focus on the Government's key aims of preventing trafficking, enforcement and prosecution of offenders and providing assistance to victims.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.567/1">Safeguards have been established to counter the trafficking of children at our main ports of entry. Specially trained teams of immigration officers have been established at 22 ports to deal with all cases of unaccompanied children and arrangements for round-the-clock referral to police and local authority children's services, where that is necessary. Additionally, teams of social workers are being specially established at five ports and asylum screening units, principally to help identify the particular needs of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who may have been trafficked and to help develop plans to safeguard their welfare.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.567/2">Immigration staff now have specialist guidance to alert them to signs that may identify a child as being trafficked and to what steps to take. Steps have also been put in place to improve the recording and retention of data on children entering the country. It will include information about the person with whom a child will be travelling and, in cases in which the child is unaccompanied, their photograph and full details of the child's parent or guardian and sponsors in the UK will be recorded.</p>

Children who have been identified as having been trafficked and who are considered to be at risk are looked after by local authorities under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989. The arrangements for trafficked children, as for other children in need in the UK, are matters for local authorities to decide based on careful analysis of the risks, needs and circumstances facing that particular child.</p>

However, the women's prison population has more than doubled over the past 10 years, with one study suggesting that this is because the sentencing of women has become more severe (Hedderman, <I>Why are women being sentenced to custody?</I>, 2004).</p>
	<p pid="c.1.636/2">The Government have commissioned further work, which will provide better information on women and the judicial system, including the Courts Survey, which will examine key drivers behind sentencing decisions. The research will include analysis of how courts deal with female offenders, drawing any significant differences across groups. Preliminary findings are expected in summer 2007. The Government have also commissioned Baroness Jean Corston to look at the issues affecting women with particular vulnerabilities who are dealt with by the criminal justice system. Baroness Corston's report and recommendations are due in December 2006.</p>

Under Prison Service Order 4350 (Effective Regimes Interventions), the Prison Service is required to review all programmes to ensure that they are of the appropriate quality and effectiveness and offer value for money. A multidisciplinary panel, which included the National Offender Management Service Chaplaincy, reviewed the programme and identified a range of concerns. The most significant were the poor quality of the manuals, which did not demonstrate a structured and coherent programme, a lack of consistency and clarity about the primary aims of the programme, a lack of understanding and appropriate sensitivity to the diversity agenda of the Prison Service, and an absence of protocols for the management of the mentor system, making it unsafe. The area manager considered the recommendation from the panel and decided to discontinue the programme. Forty-two prisoners have undertaken the course. No formal evaluation on the impact on behaviour has been possible given the small numbers involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.645/1">Probation circular 16/2005, issued in March 2005, sets out the guidance that the National Probation Directorate has issued in respect of the arrangements for release of offenders on licence. A copy of the circular is available from the Library. An offender manager (probation officer) is required to supervise every offender released from prison on licence, in accordance with standard and additional licence conditions prescribed in a statutory instrument and in accordance with national standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.645/2">The circular also sets out the process to be followed when offenders are in breach of their licence conditions under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. All prisoners serving a custodial sentence are released on licence and subject to supervision of the probation service. Such prisoners are subject to six standard licence conditions which require him to place himself under the supervision of his supervising officer; keep in touch as instructed; if required receive visits where he is living; reside only where approved; not travel outside the United Kingdom without prior permission; and behave well and not do anything which would undermine the purpose of supervision on licence, which is to protect the public and to secure his successful reintegration into the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.645/3">In the event that any such licence conditions are breached, the offender is liable to be recalled to prison on the recommendation of the probation officer, to protect the public and prevent any further reoffending. In April 2005, revised national standards were issued, setting out the minimum requirements for offender managers supervising offenders released on licence from prison. The requirements cover the timing of the initial contact with offenders and of the production of sentence plans, together with the frequency of contact with offenders and the time limit for enforcement action for any breach of licence conditions, according to offenders' assessed risk of harm. Offenders assessed as high or very high risk of harm will be seen more frequently.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.696/1">Network Rail is already required to compensate train operators for disruption caused by its engineering operations. The company is also guaranteed extra income in the future if it accommodates traffic growth beyond a specified level. The Government's high level output specification will require Network Rail to deliver further capacity increases and, as part of its periodic review 2008, the Office of Rail Regulation is considering stronger incentives to encourage the company to meet additional growth in demand.</p>

They have since committed to take this forward in the development of a long-term strategy for the railways, drawing on Sir Rod Eddington's advice on the long-term impact of transport decisions on the UK's productivity, stability and growth.

CEOP does assist in the training of police officers overseas but the guilt or innocence of the suspects referred to in the articles is a matter for the courts in those countries. In addition, the FCO will inform CEOP of the arrest for serious crimes of British nationals abroad, including all sexual offences committed against children. Where the police here are aware that an individual has returned to the United Kingdom following a conviction or caution for a sexual offence overseas they are advised to apply for a notification order, which will make the returnee subject to the notification requirements of Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (commonly known as the sex offenders register).</p>

	<p pid="c.1.858/1">Since the implementation of the pollution prevention and control (PPC) regime in 2000, the Environment Agency has been charging for applications for permits and annually for compliance.

	<p pid="c.1.861/1">Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (referred to collectively as dioxins here) are a group of 210 closely related toxic chemicals that can be formed as by-products in some chemical processes and in various combustion processes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.861/2">The most recent available data on the emissions of dioxins to air are from 2003 and are available from the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory funded by Defra (<a href="http://www.naei.org.uk">www.naei.org.uk</a>). Estimated emissions of dioxins from municipal waste incineration made up less than 1 per cent of the UK's total emissions for that year, while residential combustion plants made up approximately 1.5 per cent. However, it should be noted that emission factors from open burning, bonfires and domestic combustion are known to be particularly uncertain.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.861/3">Measures that have already been taken to reduce dioxin emissions include controls on industrial processes such as incineration, on open agricultural burning and on emissions from vehicles. Such measures have led to substantial decreases in the levels of dioxins in the UK over the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.861/4">The UK is in the process of developing a UK dioxins action plan which will set out the current situation on dioxins and will identify priorities for future actions. The action plan will be based on the results of a public consultation carried out by Defra in 2002 on dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls in the UK environment (available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/dioxins/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/dioxins/index.htm</a>), and input from a dioxins strategy group which was established to inform its development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.861/5">The dioxins action plan will form a substantial part of the UK's national implementation plan for the Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants. This is a global treaty which aims to protect human health and the environment from exposure to certain substances and includes dioxins. The Government intend to go to public consultation on the UK national implementation plan later this year.</p>

Those Governments which currently authorise scientific whaling have so far refused to recognise that the right to undertake such whaling (as provided for in Article VIII of the IWC's parent treaty) should be restricted in any way by the introduction of the revised management scheme for the regulation of whaling. Lack of agreement on this front is one of the more significant obstacles to the progress of negotiations on the revised management scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.894/1">Vocational training, including in some cases training in construction skills, is provided in custodial establishments for young people. The training can lead to formal qualifications. Other vocational courses include gas fitting, motor mechanics and information technology. Construction skills training is also provided, as part of an intensive supervision and surveillance programme, to some young offenders serving a community sentence who would otherwise be at risk of going into custody. Whether training is provided to a young person in custody depends on a number of factors, including length of sentence and willingness and ability to undertake the training. We have no current plans for new establishments devoted mainly to teaching construction skills. The Youth Justice Board is in discussion with the Department for Education and Skills about how vocational training for young offenders, both in and out of custody, can be further developed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.897/1">We welcomed the UN Secretary-General's engagement on the Zimbabwe issue. He sought to help the Government of Zimbabwe in the reforms that the country desperately needs to arrest its deepening decline. However, President Mugabe blocked the initiative, and with it an opportunity to build bridges within Zimbabwe and with the international community. If Mr Mkapa can persuade President Mugabe to undertake the policy changes that Zimbabweans urgently need for a more stable and prosperous future, we will support his efforts in any way we can, as we would any international efforts aimed at achieving real progress in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.897/2">Zimbabwe is in a profound crisis. Inflation, even by official estimates, runs at over 1,000 per cent. The economy has shrunk by 40 per cent since 1999, exports by 50 per cent, and Zimbabwe now qualifies as a least developed country according to the UN's classification system. Formal unemployment has reached 80 per cent, and a quarter of the population is dependent on food aid, when once Zimbabwe was a major food exporter. An estimated 3,200 people die a week of AIDS-related causes. There are regular demonstrations in Harare and other cities, and daily infringements of the basic rights of Zimbabweans. Zimbabwe has been censured by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth and from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and subjected to critical scrutiny by UN envoys. I set out my concerns to the Zimbabwean ambassador when he called on me on July 24, and urged his Government to address these problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.897/3">It is clear that this is not, as the Government of Zimbabwe contend, a bilateral problem with the UK. It is, as the EU, US and many others in the international community have made clear, a problem between the Government of Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe's people, concerning governance. We support the specific policy recommendations made to Zimbabwe by the UN, IMF, World Bank, African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, and other international organisations. The UK only wishes to see a better future for Zimbabweans. It is for Zimbabweans to freely determine who should govern Zimbabwe&mdash;it is they who will then hold that Government to the governance standards that much of the rest of Africa is now working towards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.897/4">The Government of Zimbabwe have also blamed their economic woes on economic sanctions imposed by the EU. However, the EU has no economic sanctions against Zimbabwe. It has an arms sales ban and a travel ban, as well as an assets-freeze on 126 members of the regime. These measures have had no impact on the Zimbabwean economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.897/5">The international community is not responsible for Zimbabwe's current problems: the wide-scale destruction of housing and livelihoods during Operation Murambatsvina; the abandonment of the rule of law so vital to maintain investor confidence; the destruction of Zimbabwe's agricultural productivity; the assault on the independent media; and the trampling of basic human rights. Above all, it is not the international community that has caused millions of Zimbabweans to vote with their feet by leaving their mother country; they have left because of their Government's policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.897/6">The problem of Zimbabwe is between its Government and its people. The solution is a Government working for, not against, the people, pursuing policies that realise Zimbabwe's enormous economic and human potential, and giving Zimbabweans the rights that much of the rest of the world insists on. If Zimbabwe pursues this path, the UK will be at the forefront of international efforts to support it, in addition to the significant humanitarian assistance that we are already providing Zimbabweans. It is in that way that Zimbabwe can build real bridges between our countries.</p>
