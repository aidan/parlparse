That is because changes to the fees regime could not be effected through amendments to the guidance. Primary legislation would be required to widen the coverage of fees beyond recovering licensing authority costs for administration, enforcement and inspection. The Government have no plans to make such a change.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.5/1">The department is working to ensure that the regulations are produced as soon as possible. A revised timetable has been issued and the regulation and associated Code of Practice for Noticing of Works will be laid early in 2007, while the regulation for permits will be laid in mid-2007. The regulations are complex and this has taken longer than originally anticipated; it is important to ensure that these regulations and associated codes of practice are workable.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.8/1">In order to give effect to UN Security Council Resolution 1672 (2006) within the United Kingdom we are taking steps to update our legislation to reflect this new resolution. The Bank of England, acting as H M Treasury's agent for administering financial sanctions in the United Kingdom, has already publicised the United Nations' adoption of Security Council Resolution 1672 (2006). Until the UN travel ban is designated under UK legislation, it is given effect using administrative powers in the immigration rules to deny entry to the UK. The details of those subject to the restrictive travel measures have already been added to the appropriate UK databases, which will alert immigration officials in the UK and overseas should they seek entry to the UK.</p>
