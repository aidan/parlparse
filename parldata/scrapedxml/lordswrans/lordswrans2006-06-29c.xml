	<p pid="c.179.2/1">DfID is working with the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa, development banks and national Governments to ensure that design and implementation of infrastructure programmes follow best practice. The department has invested substantial funds in developing guidelines in infrastructure provision, road safety, use of local materials and private sector involvement. An example is DfID's support to the global Transport Knowledge Partnership (gTKP) between donors and developing country partners to support and promote improved access to existing knowledge on transport for developing countries. The aim is to empower decision-makers to invest in transport towards a more sustainable future and help achieve the millennium development goals. The initial focus is on roads and road transport, principally in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Further information on the gTKP can be obtained at <a href="http://www.gtkp.com">www.gtkp.com</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.2/2">Through gTKP and our membership of other institutions such as the Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP) we are working with other donors and development banks to strengthen transport programmes so they can deliver affordable and sustainable improvements to road infrastructure and transport in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

We address this through wider support to a range of road safety and transport initiatives. This includes our support to the Global Road Safety Partnership, which, among other activities, provides support to driver training and licensing programmes. DfID has also established a global Transport Knowledge Partnership, which will help develop sustainable and efficient transport in developing and transition countries. The partnership will disseminate good practice to transport practitioners and policymakers in these countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.181.5/2">The effects of variation in the stocks of species low in the food chain on other marine life are poorly understood. However, much of the variation in mortality and recruitment that occurs is believed to be determined by natural causes rather than by fishing.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.3/1">Rates of under-ascertainment vary considerably for different infectious diseases. These rates depend on a range of factors, including the severity and duration of symptoms and their precise nature. Diseases with non-specific symptoms that are resolved without the need for treatment or before a definitive diagnosis is achieved may go unreported.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/2">With regard to zoonotic diseases in animals, we would expect no under-ascertainment in livestock of exotic notifiable diseases, such as avian influenza, rabies or brucellosis, due to the severity of the illness that follows infection. We would expect very little under-ascertainment in livestock of endemic diseases, such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, because of ongoing surveillance. There is likely to be considerable under-ascertainment of other endemic diseases in animals.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/3">Toxoplasmosis is among the zoonotic diseases commonly under-ascertained in the United Kingdom because typical symptoms resemble a mild to moderate flu-like or glandular fever-like illness that usually resolves without treatment within a few weeks from first onset. Lyme disease is also likely to be under-ascertained because infection commonly results in either no symptoms or mild symptoms which resolve without the need for treatment.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.6/2">Several case control studies of sporadic cases of campylobacter carried out by different groups and in different countries have shown that, in children, the risk of campylobacter infection was increased in those who had contact with a puppy or kitten who had diarrhoea.</p>

	<p pid="c.186.2/1">Veterinary surveillance systems for pet cats and dogs have been enhanced through the Dog and Cat Travel and Risk Information (DACTARI) scheme, which looks at the risk of exotic diseases being imported into the UK through these animals. Existing controls, including rabies quarantine arrangements, provide information on exotic diseases imported via mammals, including some mammals destined for zoos, subjected to such controls. Part of the reappraisal of rabies import controls involves looking at the risk of exotic diseases in addition to those parasites for which we have current controls under the pet travel scheme.

	<p pid="c.196.0/1">AIDS is the biggest killer in Zimbabwe, causing an estimated 3,200 deaths per week. UNICEF estimates that every 20 minutes a child dies of AIDS. Three infants become infected with HIV every hour.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.0/2">DfID has provided considerable support to AIDS prevention activities in Zimbabwe for over a decade, including funding for condoms and behaviour change programmes, much of which has been implemented through NGOs. This has contributed to a significant drop in HIV prevalence, from 26 to 20.1 per cent. DfID also recently approved a &pound;25 million contribution to a UNICEF programme providing economic and social support to orphans and other vulnerable children in Zimbabwe, delivered through NGOs. This will include HIV prevention work with young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.0/3">In addition, DfID is working closely with the UN and other donors, including the EC, to expand the response to HIV and AIDS. Zimbabwe has one of the lowest levels of antiretroviral treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. The new programme, currently in design, aims to expand access to HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment for Zimbabweans, including for mothers and children who are infected. This should both reduce both the number of orphaned children and the appalling death toll of children. No funding will be provided directly to the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>
