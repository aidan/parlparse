PCTs will need to work together with local authorities to agree jointly on appropriate areas for social care investment and the outcomes expected from this investment.

	<p pid="a.283.0/1">Section 1(1) of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000 states that a person is to be regarded as living in fuel poverty if he is a member of a household living on a lower income in a home that cannot be kept warm at reasonable cost. Section 1(2) gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations specifying what is to be regarded as a lower income or a reasonable cost or the circumstances in which a home is to be regarded as being warm. That power has not been exercised, as the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy sets out the common definition of when a household is in fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/2">A fuel-poor household is one that cannot afford to keep adequately warm at reasonable cost. The Fuel Poverty Strategy sets out what was said to be the most widely accepted definition of a fuel-poor household, being one that needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on fuel to maintain a satisfactory heating regime (usually 21 degrees for the main living area and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms).</p>

Winter fuel payments are made to most people who have reached women's state pension age. Last winter (2009-10) 7,862,140 households in England received a winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/4">Winter fuel payments are included in the income component of the fuel poverty calculation. Where the fuel poverty ratio is defined as modelled fuel bills divided by income, income includes any winter fuel payments made to the household.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.3/1">The price of electricity, coal, gas and oil products is driven by their national and/or global demand and supply balance and by the relevant taxes levied by HM Treasury. It is the Government's aim to ensure that the UK markets for these products benefit from effective price signals which promote appropriate investment along the value chain and efficient consumptions signals. As with all aspects of our energy policy, security of supply, decarbonisation and affordability are key policy objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.3/2">In the long run, the Government recognise that the price of carbon consistent with meeting the UK's 2050 emissions reductions targets is higher than it is today. This does not mean that individual consumers will necessarily face higher energy bills, as the Government take action to support efficiency improvements and facilitate the introduction of new forms of low-carbon energy.</p>

Changes were subsequently made to the levels of the proposed tariff for resection of prostate by laser to reflect concerns that a day-case rate target of 90 per cent was overly ambitious for delivery in one year. A revised target of 30 per cent was therefore agreed and the draft 2011-12 tariff prices were increased accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.2/3">The 2011-12 tariff prices were published for &quot;road test&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-22">22 December 2010</phrase>, since when it has been brought to the department's attention that the published best practice tariff price for resection of prostate by laser contained a typographical error. The October 2010 sense check prices for this procedure had been inadvertently included, rather than the revised prices that were agreed for &quot;road test&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.6/1">The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils who are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 school census, pupil referral unit census and alternative provision census. Each pupil known to be eligible for FSM will attract &#163;430 of funding, which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting. The pupil premium will also be paid at the same level in respect of looked-after children. In addition to this a service, child premium at a lower level of &#163;200 per pupil will be allocated for pupils registered as service children on the January 2011 school census.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.6/2">The January 2010 school censuses allow an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In Manchester in January 2010, there were 23,365 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;10,046,950. In addition, there were 15 pupils known to be eligible for the service child premium, which would give rise to a premium of &#163;3,000. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed. The number of eligible pupils in 2011 could be higher or lower. Please note that suppressed figures have not been included in these totals.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.6/3" class="indent">Note</p>
	<p pid="a.291.6/4" class="indent">The above estimates include FSM-eligible pupils, in reception to year 11, or the appropriate age range if not following the national curriculum, as at the January 2010 school census, pupil referral unit census and the alternative provision census (ie those pupils funded through the dedicated schools grant via local authorities but educated in non-maintained special schools, further education establishments, etc) and those eligible for the looked-after child pupil premium. Pupil numbers are rounded to the nearest five.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.5/2">We have supported the development of a civil service in Southern Sudan in a number of ways. The UK is a key partner in the multi-donor Capacity Building Trust Fund (CBTF). Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, the CBTF helped to create the civil service and establish accountable local government through, for example, the development of a verified payroll for the Ministry of Education both at central and state level and training over 500 staff in financial and procurement management. Six years on and the CBTF recently enabled the registration of a certified examination centre for international accounting and procurement courses, where 104 Southern Sudanese officials sat for the first exams in December 2010. Another UK-funded project, support to effective and democratic governance in Southern Sudan, has trained 20,300 civil servants in the public service curriculum.</p>
