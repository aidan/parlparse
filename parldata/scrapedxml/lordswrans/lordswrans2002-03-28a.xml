	<p pid="a.74.0/1">Theoretically, sheep could have contacted BSE from infected animal feed and it could have spread from sheep to sheep despite the introduction of feed controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/2">To date, no cases of BSE have been found in the national sheep flock. However, the numbers tested are still relatively low because there is no validated, rapid method for differentiating between BSE and Scrapie. We have to use a number of different tests, including where possible bioassay in mice.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/3">Of course the Government have in place a comprehensive risk management strategy should the theoretical risk of BSE in sheep become a real one. This includes removal of specified risk material from the food chain for all animals over 12 months old, consistent with available risk assessment advice from the EU Scientific Steering Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.2/1">The recovery and recycling targets in Article 6(1) of the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste, 94/62/EC, are implemented in Great Britain by the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended).</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/2">In order to comply with the requirements in the directive, recovery and recycling targets for 2001 under the packaging regulations were 56 per cent for recovery and 18 per cent for material-specific recycling of packaging waste. Final outturn figures for 2001 are not yet available but data received to date suggest that, if all obligated parties met their 2001 obligations, these targets should be met. This would mean that the UK had recovered 4.6 million tonnes of packaging waste in 2001 ie. 50 per cent. We would expect to recycle some 45 per cent. We also anticipate that all materials will meet the 15 per cent material-specific target in the directive, with the possible exception of plastics.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/3">Only businesses handling more than 50 tonnes of packaging and with financial turnover of more than &pound;2 million in their most recently audited accounts are obligated under the regulations if they perform one or more of the following activities: manufacturing raw materials for packaging; converting materials into packaging; filling packaging; selling packaging to the final user; or importing packaging or packaging materials into the UK. Figures received so far for 2001 indicate that there were some 6,000 registrations under the packaging regulations, which, because one registration can cover more than one business (eg where there is a group registration), means that between 10,000 and 14,000 businesses were registered.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/2">The review will be conducted by a team attached to Defra's Corporate and Service Delivery Directorate General, working in consultation with other government departments with an interest. The review team will be advised by a steering group composed of a majority of non-departmental members.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/3">The terms of reference for the review are:</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/4" class="indent">&quot;To evaluate the effectiveness of the operation of Defra agencies, with regard to the departmental aim and objectives and their relationship with the department and the sectors they serve&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/5">The review is to be conducted in two parallel processes: for those executive agencies due for quinquennial review in 2002 (VLA, CSL, CEFAS), to conduct an evaluation of their performance since the date of the last review and to examine their relationship with core-Defra, other government departments (OGDs) and the devolved administrations (DAs); for the regulatory executive agencies (PSD and VMD), to take into account the conclusions of, and developments since, the completion of their quinquennial reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/6">In so doing, the review will: analyse the requirements of government, industry and society for core science facilities and key skills for the provision of R&amp;D, scientific support services, surveillance, policy and regulatory functions, advice and emergency response capability; analyse and identify the work required to support the core requirements, examine the likely trend of Defra and other public funders' requirements, including developments in horizon scanning and contingency planning; consider the possible options and evaluate the best models for delivery of the services and the organisation of the functions required, including policy advice and associated work; assess the implications for Defra, OGDs, the DAs and the agencies about the choice of those models; assess the implications for non-core activities; and assess the implications for commercial activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/7">The review team will consult customers, stakeholders, scientific opinion and other interests and will take into account relevant reviews and studies, in particular the SR2002 science and research cross-cutting review and Defra's prioritisation of science programmes exercise; the work on the development of science in Defra, including a new science and innovation strategy; and the Cabinet Office review of agency policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/8">In light of the findings of the consultation exercise, the review will examine the most appropriate freedoms, controls, financial regimes, governance arrangements and performance management to ensure the optimum delivery of a high quality service, providing good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/9">The review team will report with recommendations to Ministers through the management board by the end of October 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/10">Interested parties are invited to submit their views to the review team by <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-30">30 May 2002</phrase>. Details of how to contact them are contained in Defra's news release, issued today.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">Charges to cover the costs of local enforcing authorities in regulating processes which are subject to Part 1 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 were introduced in April 1991. Interim charges for processes which are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 were introduced in August 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2">With the approval of the Treasury, and following consultation with local authority associations and industry, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has made revised schemes for England in respect of the Environmental Protection Act, and England and Wales in respect of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act. The schemes specify the scale of fees and charges to take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/3">The fees and charges in both schemes have been increased by 1.8 per cent broadly in line with inflation. However, my department is writing to local authorities to advise them that if there is not much more widespread adoption of cost accounting practices for LAPC over the next six months, this increase may be rescinded at the next review of the charging schemes later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/4">The schemes will be laid before both Houses and copies placed in the Libraries.</p>
