<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-03-08a.141.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="141"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040308/text/40308w02.htm#40308w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.141.2/1">Within the recorded crime series, the combined offence of causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs is the only alcohol/intoxicating substance-related offence specifically listed. The most recently published figures on this offence are given in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/2">The British Crime Survey (BCS) estimates the level of alcohol-related violent crime using the question, &quot;As far as you know, at the time it happened was the person who did it under the influence of drink?&quot;. This question is asked of those who admitted being the victim of a violent offence in the previous 12 months. This question is asked every year. The last published figures in relation to this question were published in September 2003, and reported on questions asked in the 2000 BCS. This estimated that there were 1,246,000 incidents of alcohol-related violence in 1999 (Research Development Statistics, online report 35/03). More recent estimates have been published on the proportion of violence which is considered to be committed by someone under the influence of drink in 2001&ndash;02, which was 47 per cent (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 01/03).</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/3">In the BCS, all victims of violent crime are asked about the location of the incident. The options include, &quot;In/around pub/bar/night club/ working men's club&quot; and &quot;In/around dancehall/disco&quot;. This gives us a measure of the number and proportion of incidents committed in connection with licensed premises. The figures published from the 2000 BCS revealed that 19 per cent of all violence occurs in or around a pub, bar or club, which is an estimated 623,000 incidents per year (online report 35/03).</p>

	<p pid="a.142.2/1">Within the Armed Forces, the three Services currently have different systems of medical downgrading reflecting the different roles they perform in delivering military capability. Medical downgrading statistics include those who are ill and injured, but also include those Service women who are pregnant. In addition they include those who have long-term conditions but remain fit for the task they are expected to undertake. As of the quarter ending <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-01">1 October 2003</phrase>, centrally held figures show that 2,095 trained Royal Navy personnel were assessed as not fit for operational deployment. Within the Army, 2,945 trained personnel in other ranks were assessed as non-deployable but figures for Army officers are not available for this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/2">The total figure for the RAF of medically downgraded trained personnel, which includes those with either limited deployability or non-deployability, is 4,412. It is not currently possible to differentiate between those who would be deployed in a limited capacity and those who are completely non-deployable within the medically downgraded RAF personnel figures. However, there is a mechanism in place for RAF personnel to be individually assessed if there is an operational requirement. As these assessments are carried out on an individual basis, it is not possible to identify these people as a group.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/3">Work is under way to refine the way in which fitness for task is measured across the Armed Forces and future assessments of medically downgraded personnel will seek to differentiate those that are not fit for operational deployment.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.5/1">The Government have consulted publicly on a proposal to make simvastatin 1Omg available over the counter in pharmacies, to reduce the risk of a first major coronary event in people who are likely to be at a moderate risk of coronary heart disease. The Committee on Safety of Medicines will advise Ministers on the proposals in the light of the responses to consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/2">The proposal also includes a pharmacy protocol on the questions pharmacists would need to ask to ensure those at a higher risk and who need to be referred to their general practitioner can be identified and those at a lower risk can choose to purchase a statin.

	<p pid="a.145.5/1">In order to be eligible for compensation from the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), not only must the defined benefit or hybrid pension scheme be with insufficient assets to buy out the PPF level of benefits, but its sponsoring employer must also first be insolvent. So to that extent we did not need to take account of solvent employers in calculating the cost of the PPF.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.5/3">Where a sponsoring employer is solvent and its salary-related occupational scheme starts to wind up, regulations have been introduced so that the debt due from the employer is calculated on the basis that the scheme should be able to meet the full costs of winding up and the full benefits that scheme members have accrued and expect to receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.5/4">Under our proposals to replace the minimum funding requirement with scheme-specific funding arrangements, trustees and employers will be required to agree a strategy for funding the scheme's pension commitments and for correcting any underfunding. Where a sponsoring employer is unable to meet those funding requirements and becomes insolvent, the PPF will compensate the pension scheme members.</p>
