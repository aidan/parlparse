At this site Slough Borough Council as local highway authority working with Network Rail has been carrying out a programme of sign refurbishment. High visibility boards have been re-erected on the bridge. New signs showing mandatory height limits in imperial and metric units have been erected on the south approach. Gantry-mounted prohibitory signs in advance of the bridge have very recently been refurbished.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.2/1">The Retail Prices Index (and its derivatives) is an indicator of the utmost economic importance which is used for many different purposes including: inflation targeting; the uprating of pensions and social security benefits; wage bargaining; price-setting formulae applied by regulated industries; and the indexing of tax thresholds and allowances, Excise duty rates and index-linked gilts. In view of its unique importance, it is only right that, in line with long-standing arrangements, ultimate responsibility for the scope and definition of the RPI lies with the Chancellor. This means that on matters of scope and definition there is direct accountability to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/2">This position is mirrored in the governance of the leading national consumer price indices of a number of other European countries including Austria, Belgium and Sweden.</p>
