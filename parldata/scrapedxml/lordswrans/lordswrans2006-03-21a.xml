	<p pid="a.23.1/2" qnum="HL4550">What is the progress of the study being conducted by the Health and Safety Laboratory on mortality and cancer incidence in a large cohort of pesticide sprayers recruited from those qualifying through the scheme operated by the National Proficiency Test Council; and how many participants have been lost from the cohort since its inception.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-21a.23.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="23"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60321w01.htm#60321w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.23.2/1">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) established the Pesticide Users Study in 1996 to provide information on cancer and causes of death in professional users of agricultural pesticides and other plant protection products, and to provide a database of individuals who could help with other research into the safety of pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/2">The study aims to recruit as many volunteers as possible from those obtaining a certificate of proficiency in England and Wales in the professional use of these pesticides. Their details are submitted to the National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR), which notifies the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) about those who develop cancer or die. The type of cancer and cause of death are notified too. Forty-three per cent (66,000) of those awarded a certificate have volunteered to take part and 80 per cent. of them have been identified successfully by the NHSCR. Of these, 1,725 have developed a cancer and 1,542 have died of cancer or some other cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/3">The current focus of the study is on collecting information from participants about their past use of different pesticides, rather than on analysing the cancer incidence and cause of death data. In 2004 a rolling programme of surveys of their use of pesticides and of measures to mitigate exposure commenced. The Health and Safety Laboratory expects to complete this task by November 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.5/1">Neither the UK nor EU pesticides legislation deals with the importation of pesticides per se. But under Article 3 of Directive 91/414/EEC and Regulation 6 of the Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations 1997, for a pesticide to be stored, supplied, used, etc. in the UK, it must hold an approval here for those purposes. This requirement applies irrespective of whether the product concerned is manufactured in the UK or is imported there.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/2">The pesticide controls are enforced in the UK by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on farms and by the HSE and the appropriate local authority at the distributor and retailer level. All cases of alleged infringement of the regulations are followed up by the Pesticides Safety Directorate as the principal UK regulatory authority. With this in mind the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs currently has in hand two important cases concerning the illegal importation of pesticides, which will shortly be heard in the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/3">In addition, the Pesticides Safety Directorate is consulting the European Commission, and through it other member states, about improving and clarifying the guidelines on the import of pesticides.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">The secondary school curriculum sets out that schools must teach about the European Union in both citizenship and history. At key stage 3 (11&ndash;14 year olds), the citizenship curriculum provides that pupils are taught about the world as a global community, and the political, economic, environmental and social implications of this, and the role of the European Union, the Commonwealth and the United Nations. In history, pupils of this age are taught to identify trends both within and across different periods and links between local, British, European and world history, and about the history of Britain in its European and wider world context. At key stage 4, (14&ndash;16 year olds) the citizenship curriculum provides that pupils are taught about the United Kingdom's relations in Europe, including the European Union, and relations with the Commonwealth and the United Nations. The national curriculum is not made up of modules but programmes of study, which set out the legal requirements on what schools must cover at each key stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.0/1">Competition between venues for the execution of orders for financial instruments can foster innovation and lead to reductions in the cost of transactions and, ultimately, the cost of capital for issuers of financial instruments. The Government therefore welcome the provisions in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC) which seek to facilitate competition between venues for the execution of orders for financial instruments, including national stock exchanges.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/2">The facilitation of competition between execution venues also requires the removal of obstacles to efficient cross-border clearing and settlement in the EU. The Government welcome the focus that the European Commission has put on this issue, the co-operation between the Commission's internal market and competition directorates on the work, and the way in which the Commission has actively involved market participants in its deliberations.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.3/1">For our own purposes, the UK would have preferred to continue and strengthen existing non-legislative co-operation on flood management, and has argued the case for this over some years. However, a significant number of other member states view Community legislative underpinning as very helpful to their circumstances, particularly in relation to river basins that cross national boundaries, and all other member states can accept legislation. The European Commission published a draft directive on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January 2006</phrase> which is now under negotiation. We will seek to limit its scope to trans-boundary waters, which is where the particular problem requiring Community action has been identified, and to ensure that in any case its provisions are targeted, flexible, proportionate and workable.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.2/1">The Government have not yet received any formal representations from local authorities looking to introduce a selective licensing scheme as provided by Section 80 of the Housing Act 2004. These powers are expected to come into force in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">However, in December 2003, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister carried out an information-gathering exercise aimed at providing further understanding of the impact of the selective licensing proposals in the Housing Act on local authorities. As part of the exercise, local authorities were asked to provide information about their intention to apply selective licensing in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/3">The following 17 authorities indicated their intention to make use of the selective licensing powers in their areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/4" class="indent">London Borough of Barking and Dagenham</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/5" class="indent">Manchester City Council</p>

	<p pid="a.41.3/1">The local allocation of resources and budget management are matters for the chief constable and police authority, who will make decisions according to local plans and operational priorities. It is the Government's role to allocate funding to police force areas as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.3/2">North Wales Police Authority is receiving its fair share of available funding next year. It will receive &pound;73.7 million in general grants, an increase of 3.1 per cent. (&pound;2.2 million) over the comparable figure for 2005&ndash;06. This is in line with the broadly flat-rate increase of 3.1 per cent. for all forces in England and Wales. North Wales benefits from this decision. If the funding formula had been strictly applied it would have received &pound;7.2 million less. The bulk (&pound;5.6 million) of the extra &pound;7.2 million needed to bring it up to the funding floor has been provided by Home Office resources outside the general grant settlement. On top of general grant, North Wales will receive &pound;3.1 million in special formula grant, a consolidation of four specific grants that will enable the authority to operate more flexibly, and an estimated &pound;12.8 million in specific grants and capital provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.3/3">Following consultation and widespread support we have introduced for 2006&ndash;07 a single specific grant covering all counter-terrorism (CT) policing. This includes dedicated security post (DSP) funding that has been removed from the general grant. North Wales will receive &pound;3.7 million in DSP funding next year and will be able to bid for further CT funding from a &pound;64 million pot allocated to ACPO. The single CT specific grant has been taken forward with agreement from the chair of ACPO's Terrorism and Allied Matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.8/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recognised that guidance was required when the new digital technology first appeared and placed appropriate guidance and advice on its website about regular radiation dose constancy checks.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/2">This guidance is regularly updated, and MHRA and the Department of Health work closely with the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, which has produced recent, more detailed work regarding anatomical differences. This guidance is cross-referenced in a number of official documents to ensure healthcare staff are informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/3">The radiation dose required to produce a digital radiographic image is approximately the same as the film-based radiation dose. Digital radiography has an added advantage where, if the operator should misjudge slightly the size of the patient, the detector unit compensates for this and ultimately can save a repeat procedure, which means no extra radiation dose.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/4">All new direct digital radiography units are fitted with a device that directly measures the radiation dose per image; this can help to indicate any drift in radiation values.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.8/6">The local radiation protection adviser and medical physics expert will be involved in the commissioning process to ensure that image quality is optimised with the lowest possible radiation dose.

	<p pid="a.43.2/1">The exercise conducted in the Channel Tunnel in the early morning of January 15 was one of a series of such exercises, normally conducted about annually, to test the response of railway staff and the emergency services in Britain and France to major incidents in the tunnel resulting from accidents or terrorist acts. They are useful in ensuring that emergency procedures are regularly practised and identifying areas where those procedures could be refined.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/2">All volunteer participants had reached the surface within four and a half hours of the emergency being declared. The evacuation on this occasion took longer than might have been expected because the chosen scenario introduced a variety of new emergency procedures that needed to be thoroughly tested. The exercises also assumed that the triage of &quot;casualties&quot; takes place in the service tunnel, and all casualties are assessed and receive initial first aid in situ before being moved out, in an orderly fashion, to hospital. The service tunnel provides a safe refuge where passengers can congregate and be looked after until it is possible to remove them to the surface. The speed of the evacuation to the surface is therefore not necessarily an important parameter.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/3">Evaluation of the exercise by Eurotunnel, the emergency services and the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority is still under way.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.6/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question about what proposals they have to increase the provision of bus lanes in Belfast.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.6/4">I have been asked to reply as the issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.6/5">As you will be aware, the provision of quality bus corridors (QBCs) on all the main radial roads in Belfast is one of a number of initiatives identified in the Regional Transportation Strategy (RTS). These proposals, which include the provision of bus priority measures to improve bus journey times and reliability, improvements to the quality and frequency of bus services and the provision of high-quality shelters and passenger information, are intended to make travel by bus an attractive alternative to the private car.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.6/6">The Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-30">30 November 2004</phrase>, is a &quot;daughter&quot; document to the RTS. It sets out the detailed transportation proposals for the greater Belfast area up to 2015 and expands the detail of the proposed RTS initiatives, including the introduction of QBCs on 14 of Belfast's arterial routes and on two orbital routes.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.6/7">We are working with Translink to deliver an agreed QBC programme that will be implemented, in stages, over the next five years. While it is not possible to quantify exactly the number or extent of further bus priority measures until the necessary traffic modelling, costing and appraisal work has been completed, you may be aware that Roads Service has already provided 65 separate bus lanes (totalling approximately 29 kilometres in length) in Belfast. During 2006&ndash;07, we propose to introduce a further six kilometres of bus lanes on the motorway hard shoulders and on the Shankill Road.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.6/8">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">The Commission has not yet made a proposal to mandate the use of headlamps during daylight hours. The Government oppose such compulsory use, except where required by poor visibility. While improved vehicle conspicuity is desirable, compulsory daytime headlamps might adversely affect the relative daytime visibility of pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, motorcyclists currently enhance their daytime conspicuity, on a voluntary basis, by using dipped-beam headlamps. If all vehicles were illuminated this advantage might be reduced or disappear. Constant headlamp use by all vehicles would also increase fuel costs and CO2 pollution. Dedicated low-wattage daytime running lights (DRLs) rather than headlamps might meet some of these concerns but we would still oppose compulsory use.</p>
