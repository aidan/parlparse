Following diagnosis, these teams provide advice and information on the range of services and support available through the statutory and voluntary sectors. The outcome of the review of mental health and learning disability will inform future provision for children with autism.</p>

Bilaterals between the lead departments and agencies North and South are under way. The work will be overseen by a steering group comprising senior officials and business representatives.

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">The secondary school curriculum sets out that schools must teach about the European Union in both citizenship and history. At key stage 3 (11&ndash;14 year olds), the citizenship curriculum provides that pupils are taught about the world as a global community, and the political, economic, environmental and social implications of this, and the role of the European Union, the Commonwealth and the United Nations. In history, pupils of this age are taught to identify trends both within and across different periods and links between local, British, European and world history, and about the history of Britain in its European and wider world context. At key stage 4, (14&ndash;16 year olds) the citizenship curriculum provides that pupils are taught about the United Kingdom's relations in Europe, including the European Union, and relations with the Commonwealth and the United Nations. The national curriculum is not made up of modules but programmes of study, which set out the legal requirements on what schools must cover at each key stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.0/1">Competition between venues for the execution of orders for financial instruments can foster innovation and lead to reductions in the cost of transactions and, ultimately, the cost of capital for issuers of financial instruments. The Government therefore welcome the provisions in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC) which seek to facilitate competition between venues for the execution of orders for financial instruments, including national stock exchanges.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/2">The facilitation of competition between execution venues also requires the removal of obstacles to efficient cross-border clearing and settlement in the EU. The Government welcome the focus that the European Commission has put on this issue, the co-operation between the Commission's internal market and competition directorates on the work, and the way in which the Commission has actively involved market participants in its deliberations.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.5/1">Section 56 of the Housing Act provides for local authorities to make designations for additional licensing schemes to extend houses in multiple occupation (HMO) licensing beyond the scope of mandatory licensing to smaller properties in their area. However, before making such designations, authorities are required to consult with those likely to be affected by the designation and take account of any representations received.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.5/2">The Government have no statutory powers to issue guidance to local authorities about undertaking consultations for additional licensing schemes under the licensing provisions in the Housing Act 2004. However, a number of statutory instruments have recently been laid before Parliament and published, and these will help define the framework within which additional licensing schemes will operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.5/3">The Government also provided funding for the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA), to help with the delivery of training programmes for local authorities. These programmes have encouraged local authorities to create good working relationships with landlords. The IDeA also facilitated some regional joint events for local authority staff and landlords, which attracted more than 600 delegates and involved input from a range of private landlord organisations. The events also provided an opportunity for the two groups to talk constructively about approaches to licensing, including the consultation process for additional licensing.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.5/4">A dedicated website has also been set up at <a href="http://www.propertylicence.gov.uk">www.propertylicence.gov.uk</a> to provide advice to local authorities, landlords and tenants on licensing issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.3/1">The local allocation of resources and budget management are matters for the chief constable and police authority, who will make decisions according to local plans and operational priorities. It is the Government's role to allocate funding to police force areas as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.3/2">North Wales Police Authority is receiving its fair share of available funding next year. It will receive &pound;73.7 million in general grants, an increase of 3.1 per cent.

North Wales benefits from this decision. If the funding formula had been strictly applied it would have received &pound;7.2 million less. The bulk (&pound;5.6 million) of the extra &pound;7.2 million needed to bring it up to the funding floor has been provided by Home Office resources outside the general grant settlement. On top of general grant, North Wales will receive &pound;3.1 million in special formula grant, a consolidation of four specific grants that will enable the authority to operate more flexibly, and an estimated &pound;12.8 million in specific grants and capital provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.3/3">Following consultation and widespread support we have introduced for 2006&ndash;07 a single specific grant covering all counter-terrorism (CT) policing. This includes dedicated security post (DSP) funding that has been removed from the general grant. North Wales will receive &pound;3.7 million in DSP funding next year and will be able to bid for further CT funding from a &pound;64 million pot allocated to ACPO. The single CT specific grant has been taken forward with agreement from the chair of ACPO's Terrorism and Allied Matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.8/2">This guidance is regularly updated, and MHRA and the Department of Health work closely with the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, which has produced recent, more detailed work regarding anatomical differences. This guidance is cross-referenced in a number of official documents to ensure healthcare staff are informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/3">The radiation dose required to produce a digital radiographic image is approximately the same as the film-based radiation dose. Digital radiography has an added advantage where, if the operator should misjudge slightly the size of the patient, the detector unit compensates for this and ultimately can save a repeat procedure, which means no extra radiation dose.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/4">All new direct digital radiography units are fitted with a device that directly measures the radiation dose per image; this can help to indicate any drift in radiation values.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/5">It is down to individual purchasers at each hospital rather than the Government to make their own enquiries about the dose implications of their radiological purchases.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/6">The local radiation protection adviser and medical physics expert will be involved in the commissioning process to ensure that image quality is optimised with the lowest possible radiation dose. Comprehensive advice is available from professional organisations such as the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine and the multi-disciplinary body the British Institute of Radiology.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.0/1">The contribution from the General Lighthouse Fund (GLF) to the provision of navigational aids in the Republic of Ireland should not change as a consequence of the 10 per cent. cut in the level of UK light dues announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March</phrase>. The contribution, estimated at &pound;7.4 million for 2005&ndash;06, is, however, expected to rise to around &pound;8 million in 2006&ndash;07. This increase reflects the construction costs of the combined head office and depot facility in Dun Laoghaire for the Commissioners of Irish Lights, after allowing for the estimated proceeds from the sale of the existing building in Dublin, expected to be returned to the GLF during 2006&ndash;07. The Irish Government will contribute 35 per cent. towards the cost of the project. The resultant net cost to the GLF is expected to be &pound;4.7 million, generating estimated running cost savings of &pound;1.4 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">The Commission has not yet made a proposal to mandate the use of headlamps during daylight hours. The Government oppose such compulsory use, except where required by poor visibility. While improved vehicle conspicuity is desirable, compulsory daytime headlamps might adversely affect the relative daytime visibility of pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, motorcyclists currently enhance their daytime conspicuity, on a voluntary basis, by using dipped-beam headlamps. If all vehicles were illuminated this advantage might be reduced or disappear. Constant headlamp use by all vehicles would also increase fuel costs and CO2 pollution. Dedicated low-wattage daytime running lights (DRLs) rather than headlamps might meet some of these concerns but we would still oppose compulsory use.</p>
