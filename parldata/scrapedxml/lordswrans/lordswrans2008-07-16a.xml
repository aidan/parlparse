	<p pid="a.151.2/1">Following concerns raised by ex-servicemen's organisations with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Bridget Prentice MP, that they had not been consulted appropriately in relation to the proposed move of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal to a new, unified tribunal structure, the Minister suggested that it would be useful for them to discuss the move with the senior president of tribunals, Lord Justice Carnwath.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">Previous research undertaken by the Central Science Laboratory and Oxford University has shown that the only wild mammalian species which act as reservoirs of bovine tuberculosis, and thus are a risk to cattle, are badgers and some species of deer. Other species may be infected with TB but are end hosts (ie do not transmit the disease further).</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/2">Quantitative risk assessments commissioned by Defra demonstrate that the risk of cattle infection from deer is only likely to be significant if the prevalence of TB infection in deer is high. The indication from research is that the prevalence of TB infection in deer is not high and is estimated to be generally less than 5 per cent. The ecology and behaviour of wild deer makes it unlikely that they would have any close direct contact with cattle.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/3">Defra has commissioned a wild deer density and disease prevalence study to ensure that our evidence base is robust enough to allow the department to take decisions on possible future disease control measures for wild deer.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/4">Previous research has shown that there was a rise in hedgehog populations in areas in which badgers were culled in the randomised badger culling trial. There is no current research identifying links between badgers, the loss of hedgehogs and dwindling bee populations.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.6/1">We have been advised by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) that the scientific consensus formed was largely based on an extensive review of published literature on the scientific context and biological issues surrounding the creation of human-animal embryos for research, including nuclear reprogramming, the interaction of the nuclear and mitochondrial genome and the mixing of human and animal mitochondria.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/2">The literature review also analysed alternative avenues of research and alternative sources of stem cells. In addition, the HFEA consulted a small number of stakeholders on specific scientific questions concerned with human-animal embryos. Responses were gathered from the HFEA's Scientific and Clinical Advances Group, the HFEA Horizon Scanning Panel and external stakeholders including the British Fertility Society, Human Genetics Alert and the Motor Neurone Disease Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/3">No research has been published specifically on the potential of cytoplasmic hybrids to develop if implanted in a woman. This is because cytoplasmic hybrids cannot be transferred into a woman, as this activity is prohibited by the Reproductive Cloning Act 2001. The HFEA therefore did not consider any specific studies on this as part of their consultation. However, the HFEA did consider published literature on the development of cytoplasmic hybrid embryos in vitro and on the interaction between mitochondria and nuclear DNA. This included:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/4">Illmensee K, Levanduski M &amp; Zavos P (2006) &quot;Evaluation of the embryonic preimplantation potential of human adult somatic cells via an embryo interspecies bioassay using bovine oocytes&quot;. <I>Fertility and Sterility</I> 85(Suppl 1): 1248-60;Chen Y et al.

	<p pid="a.153.6/5">No published data on the potential of embryos cultured on feeder cells beyond 14 days were considered. This is because embryos are not permitted to be cultured in vitro beyond 14 days. This issue was therefore not considered to be relevant to the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.8/1">Following the development of a national strategy to enhance the prosecution of extremist radicalisers, led by the former Attorney-General, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) issued guidance on the prosecution of offences relating to violent extremism. The prosecution guidance was first issued in July 2007 and is kept under review. The guidance is available on the CPS website. The strategy was also underpinned by new working arrangements for the police and the CPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.8/2">The Government have published detailed guidance to support those working to deliver all aspects of the strategy of preventing violent extremism, <I>The Prevent Strategy: A Guide for Local Partners in England</I> (May 2008. Ref: 288324). It acknowledges that action by the police and the CPS through the courts is an important part of the prevent strategy.</p>

The UN committees that consider petitions are not courts, and they cannot award damages, or produce a legal ruling on the meaning of the law. In 2004, we acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. One of our reasons for doing so was to enable us to consider, on a more empirical basis, the merits of the right of individual petition. We are currently reviewing the United Kingdom's experience under the optional protocol.</p>
