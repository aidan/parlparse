An estimated 12,000 police will provide security for the registration process. 500 police have already received election training and have been deployed to support voter registration teams. 40 trainers from 20 provinces have completed their Train-the-Trainer programme, and the trainers from the remaining provinces will start their training next week.

Last year the UK gave over &pound;2.5 million to support the development of a new national police force in Afghanistan; we are still finalising our plans for assistance to the police this year.

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">There are three ways by which an individual can be disqualified from working with children:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2" class="indent">By being made subject to a disqualification order imposed on certain offenders at conviction under Part 2 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/3" class="indent">By being made subject of a direction under Section 142 of the Education Act 2002 by the Secretary of State on grounds of being unsuitable to work with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/4" class="indent">By being included on the list of persons considered to be unsuitable to work with children that is maintained under Section 1 of the Protection of Children Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/5">Parents do not fall into any of these three categories solely because their children have been placed on the child protection register. Those whose children have been placed on the child protection register are not automatically precluded from working with children as a consequence of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/6">In addition the Disqualification from Caring for Children Regulations 2002 preclude a parent of a child with respect to whom a care order has been made from being a private foster parent, unless that person has disclosed that fact to the local authority and that authority gives its consent. Such a person cannot be employed in a children's home without the local authority's consent. We are currently reviewing the legislation and regulations in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the National Statistician, Len Cook, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-12">12 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions about the availability of labour market data for ethnic minority and non-British groups (HL2617, HL2618).</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/4">The availability of these statistics reduced after the longstanding joint arrangements between the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) ceased in 2003. The very important analyses have always been prepared after the main labour market statistical summaries. Since 2003, these main summaries have demanded more attention and this has led to delays in publishing the ethnic minority studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/5">Annual Local Area Labour Force Survey data for 2002&ndash;03 were published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-28">28 April 2004</phrase>, accompanied by an ONS News Release. ONS is preparing further analyses for later publication. These will include analyses at both national and local level for ethnic minorities, non-British and overseas born groups. I intend that this will meet the existing needs that we know of in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/6">The ONS has been in contact with the Commission for Racial Equality and will discuss with it the possible content of some of the detailed tables and analyses that will subsequently be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/7">In the meantime, users can continue to request more detailed analyses from the ONS's LFS Data Service. I recognise that this service has been hard pressed to respond quickly, and the delays last month of three weeks reflect this.</p>

It is not being applied to the self-employed in other member states. It does not apply to private individuals.</p>
