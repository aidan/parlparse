	<p pid="a.50.2/1">The war in Sudan has made impossible the provision of support for a development programme in Sudan over the past decade. Large amounts of development assistance has been provided for humanitarian relief, the bulk of which has been spent on air costs. Sudan is a highly indebted poor country and over 500 million dollars of development funding will become available from the international community when there is peace. This is creating an incentive for the warring parties to reach a comprehensive agreement. We reinforce this message to the Government of Sudan and the SPLM at every opportunity and point out that a track record of pro-poor reform will also generate considerable debt relief. Until there is a peace agreement, we will continue to support life-saving humanitarian work and peacebuilding activities, such as personnel to monitor the ceasefire in the Nuba mountains, support for the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development Secretariat who chair the peace talks, and support for anti-slavery work. We will also continue to support peace activities through civil society groups, an important part of the wider peace process, through our embassy peacebuilding fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.5/1">The new Turkish Government have announced a large number of reforms, political and economic. Some may require amendment of the constitution, others new legislation, and yet others better regulation and implementation by the authorities. All of these, in so far as they help meet the Copenhagen political criteria, bring closer the day when Turkey will be able to open accession negotiations with the EU. As a strong supporter of Turkey's EU candidature, the British Government welcome them all. But we also admire the Turkish Government's assertion that they want these reforms for their citizens, in any case, regardless of their impact on Turkey's EU candidature.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">(a) The UK welcomes the Turkish clearance of a reported 10,638 landmines from various border regions by the end of 2001. Turkey has signed several protocols on landmine clearance with neighbours, including Bulgaria and Georgia, and has stated that it has not laid anti-personnel mines on Turkish territory since December 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">(b) The UK encourages Turkey and other nations to accede to the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel landmines and the Convention on Conventional Weapons Amended Protocol II that regulates the use of other types of landmines. The UK Government lobbied Turkey in January 1999, as part of a global exercise in support of the Ottawa Convention. Since then, Turkey has supported the UN resolution calling for universal accession to the convention. The Turkish Parliament has taken steps to do so itself; the Turkish parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee approved the principle of accession to the Ottawa Convention on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-09">9 May 2002</phrase>. We expect Turkey to do so soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">(c) The situation on Kurdish names is evolving. The Appeal Court ruled in 2000 that parents could register their children with Kurdish names. Some parents doing so were challenged but the courts found in favour of the parents. The new government in Turkey have shown, by existing and planned legislation and by their heavy emphasis on human rights, that they intend to abolish such restrictions on individual liberties.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.5/1">The Government have decided to extend to citizens of the new EU member states, from their accession on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, the full rights to work in the UK as enjoyed by existing EU citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/2">Under the terms of the Accession Treaty, the new EU citizens will automatically have full free movement rights for all purposes other than work. But it is up to each member state to decide whether to extend working rights from accession. Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Greece have already stated their intention to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/3">We have made this decision because it is in the UK's interest. It will attract workers we need in key sectors. It will ensure they can work without restrictions and not be a burden on the public purse. It forms part of our managed migration agenda. It makes sense financially, as we can focus resources on the real immigration problems, rather than trying to stop EU citizens enjoying normal EU rights; and it makes sense for UK citizens. Already thousands work in the future member states under work permit systems. They and others will have full rights to work in the new member states, free of controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/4">The decision has been taken after careful analysis of successive independent studies which show that there is unlikely to be a large influx of workers to the UK after accession. Forthcoming research commissioned by the Home Office also suggests that the numbers that will migrate to the UK after accession will not be significant. This confirms the experience of Spanish and Portuguese accession when there were no major influxes. Indeed, the evidence is that emigrant workers return to their countries after they have joined the EU, thanks to the increased stability and prosperity which EU membership brings.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/5">We will provide safeguards. These will allow us to reintroduce restrictions in the event of an unexpected threat to a region or sector in our labour markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/6">This is the right thing to do. The citizens of the new member states should enjoy the same rights as British, French, German and other citizens within the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/7">Enlargement will ensure stability on our continent: the EU was founded to anchor peace and stability in Europe; enlargement is spreading that stability across our continent. It will provide a boost to our prosperity, as have all previous enlargements. Enlargement will improve our environment and security as we will be able to work together to tackle such problems as pollution, drug trafficking and international crime within the enlarged Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/8">The UK has been a champion of enlargement from the start. We look forward to the conclulsion of negotiations with 10 candidate countries this week in Copenhagen, and to welcoming them as equal citizens in the EU in 2004.</p>

	Biological Weapons Convention: 5th Review Conference

	<p pid="a.53.1/2" qnum="HL570">What was the outcome of the 5th Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-12-12a.53.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo021212/text/21212w02.htm#21212w02_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.53.2/1">There was a successful outcome to the recent 5th Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva. The agreement that was reached there on a set of practical measures will now be the focus for active consideration by the international community. It was of crucial importance that there should be unanimous agreement on the way ahead in meeting the pervasive threat from biological warfare, particularly in light of the growing menace of international terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">The Green Paper on the threat from biological weapons, which was laid before the House in April this year, set out a range of practical measures that could be adopted for dealing with this issue. The Government were particularly glad to see that a number of proposals in that paper have been incorporated into the international programme of work that has been agreed for the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">The first round of meetings in 2003 will see discussion of penal legislation to bolster the prohibitions of the convention and also of stricter regulations on the handling of dangerous pathogens. In 2004 states parties will study ways of better responding to and investigating cases of alleged use of biological weapons, and suspicious outbreaks of disease. There will also be an examination of ways to strengthen the world-wide surveillance of disease as it affects humans, animals and plants. Finally, in 2005 there will be discussion, and we hope adoption, of a code of conduct for scientists working in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/4">Her Majesty's Government believe it was vital that agreement on this programme should be reached by consensus among all states parties to the Biological Weapons Convention. It was for this reason that we conducted extensive consultations throughout 2002 to try and establish a basis for compromise. Those efforts clearly bore fruit.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/5">The seriousness and immediacy with which all countries view the BW threat is evident from this outcome. The programme of work won unanimous approval from the United States, our EU partners and other Western countries as well as Russia, China and members of the Non-Aligned Movement. This broad support is vital and will help to ensure that the international community brings its full authority to promoting and taking effective action on the potential dangers posed by the proliferation of biological weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/6">The United Kingdom has played a leading role in the search for ways of reinforcing the Biological Weapons Conference. So this positive outcome to the review conference is all the more welcome. We will remain fully committed to seeing practical results emerge from this process which will help to address an ever present threat both to international stability and the well being of humankind.</p>

NASS has a range of accommodation ranging from full board hostels to self-contained flats and houses. NASS also uses houses in multiple occupation (HMOs).

	<p pid="a.57.8/2">Up to and including November 2002, the period for which most recent figures are available, approximately 46 per cent of personnel offered immunisation against anthrax had accepted. Thus far, immunisation against anthrax has been targeted at a small number of personnel in the most readily deployable units. Of the total strength of the Armed Forces, excluding reserves, approximately 2.5 per cent have been immunised against anthrax. No serious adverse reactions have been reported.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.8/3">The United Kingdom anthrax vaccine is manufactured by the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research to UK regulatory standards. It is licensed and independent medical advice confirms that it is safe and effective. It has been used for many years by both the Armed Forces and civilian occupations such as laboratory workers and veterinarians. There is no evidence to suggest that any have suffered any long-term ill health as result.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.8/4">Earlier this year we announced a decision to expand the programme so that ultimately all service personnel, including reserves, and those essential civilians who are likely to deploy on operations are routinely offered immunisation against anthrax. I refer the noble Lord to the Answer I gave on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-13">13 June 2002</phrase>, (WA47) to the noble Lord, Lord Christopher. As personnel are immunised against anthrax routinely and in advance, there should be no need to administer the anthrax vaccine alongside any other vaccines or protective measures. If service personnel due to deploy are not up to date with their immunisations, as with any medical treatment, the offer of immunisation would take full account of any other treatment or medication an individual might be receiving at the same time.

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">The Government have decided to roll forward unchanged the maximum price scheme for generic medicines used in National Health Service primary care. This follows consultation with stakeholders that concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-29">29 November 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">The scheme was introduced in August 2000 as a result of price increases in the generics market that started in 1999. It was rolled forward in October 2001. The scheme has restored stability in the generics market and the NHS has saved some &pound;330 million annually as a result. The continuation of it will ensure that this stability continues and that the expenditure savings are maintained.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/1">The tax incentives available to donors of charitable gifts are the same for all charities, including universities, museums and galleries and theatre companies that are registered as charities. There is a range of tax reliefs both for companies and for individuals on donations through the payroll, Gift Aid, and reliefs on gifts of shares. These tax reliefs are in some ways even more generous than those available in the United States. For example, in the UK a donor could completely extinguish his or her tax liability in one year through tax relief on gifts to charity, whereas in the US there is an annual limit. The tax reliefs in the UK are, however, less well known among donors. In order to tackle this the Government work in partnership with the charitable sector, for example through their support of the Giving Campaign in its work to ensure donors are aware of the tax reliefs available to them. The Chancellor keeps all aspects of the tax system under review.</p>
