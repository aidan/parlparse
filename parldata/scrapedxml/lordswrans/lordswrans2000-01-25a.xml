	<p pid="a.184.2/1">IACS rules have always allowed farmers in the United Kingdom to use the full field areas which are shown on Ordnance Survey maps as the basis of their claims under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) provided that their fields are fully utilised. If this condition is not fulfilled, then only that part of the total area which is actually cropped can be claimed. The use of total field areas is of considerable benefit to our farmers but it can only be justified if the extent of uncropped areas around field margins, including the area occupied by any hedges which may be present, is kept within reasonable limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/2">AAPS applicants have recently been notified about new guidance from the European Commission about the maximum width of field margins that is consistent with the use of full Ordnance Survey areas in aid applications. We recognise the concern that the application of the rules could in some circumstances have an adverse effect on the width of field boundaries and their biodiversity. We have, therefore, also urged applicants to seek advice about minimising the environmental impact of any action they may need to take in order to comply with the new guidance.</p>

We have already taken a number of steps for labelling ingredients derived from genetically modified crops and for labelling the quantities of key ingredients.

We will also be considering different ways of making information available, including the use of modern technology, and whether new approaches are called for to deal with internet shopping. We are funding consumer research into these questions. We shall be holding open meetings and inviting consumers to write or e-mail us with their views.</p>

The priority now is to ensure rapid deployment of civilian police and other civilian staff. The UK has deployed 14 civilian police and four military observers to the territory. In addition, a UN-World Bank donor meeting held in Tokyo last December received pledges of US$ 520 million for East Timor's reconstruction, development and humanitarian needs over the next three years.

The full year cost of the package has been estimated at &pound;68 million. This honours the commitment he gave to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-13">13 July 1998</phrase> to monitor the new student support arrangements introduced after the Dearing Report. It also builds on the findings of the review of access funds and hardship loans carried out last autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">The system of student support is working well: full-time entrants to higher education have increased by nearly 5,000 this year and more money is now going into universities and colleges. The system is fair and equitable to students, families, and the taxpayer. But our review highlighted the specific financial concerns of older students, notably the costs of childcare, especially for lone parents, school meals, and travel. The review also found that mature students, in particular, need guarantees of financial support if they are to undertake and complete courses of higher education. These new measures target extra help at full-time mature students, disadvantaged young people and parents on low incomes with children in higher education.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">In 2000-01, &pound;17 million will be set aside for non-repayable access funds bursaries for mature students of up to &pound;1,000 per student, according to need, available at the start of the academic year. Further support, depending on circumstances, will also be available from a hardship fund of &pound;57 million for students who run into financial difficulties during the course. Hardship loans will remain available to mature students but they will no longer have to take out a hardship loan before receiving support from the hardship fund. We will additionally provide an income-assessed grant to meet the cost of school meals for students with dependent children aged 4 to 16. We have also decided to ease substantially the income assessment for mature students, who will now be able to have &pound;7,500 of their income disregarded without losing entitlement to student support, instead of a minimum of &pound;820.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/4">In 2001-02, three further measures will be introduced to widen access and tackle hardship. We will raise the parental contribution threshold from &pound;17,370 (at 1999-2000 rates) to &pound;20,000, which will mean that around 50,000 more families on modest incomes will no longer have to contribute towards their children's higher education. We shall also review the other contribution thresholds. Up to &pound;10 million will be available for non-repayable bursaries through access funds of up to &pound;1,000 for young students from disadvantaged backgrounds, building on schemes already developing at a number of universities. Both these measures will help students from families on low incomes with no history of entry to higher education. We will provide further help for mature students by introducing a means-tested childcare grant, based on the actual costs of childcare of up to &pound;100 a week per child, for those with dependent children, which will be fully disregarded by the Department of Social Security for benefits purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/5">Where necessary, we will make amendments to the Education (Student Support) Regulations 1999 and the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1999 to give effect to these changes for 2000-01. Amendments to regulations to give effect to the changes for 2001-02 will also be made in due course. Changes to the guidance on the use of the access and hardship funds will be given to the Higher Education Funding Council for England, and individual higher education institutions, shortly.</p>
