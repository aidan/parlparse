<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-15a.117.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="117"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015w01.htm#31015w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.117.5/1">The Government are firmly committed to maintaining effective immigration controls while at the same time ensuring that genuine passengers are able to pass through our ports with the least possible inconvenience.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/2">The number of people arriving at UK airports who are found to be inadmissible is unacceptably high. Certain nationals, who are required to hold a valid visa to enter the UK, may transit this country for up to 24 hours without a visa. This provides a relatively easy and inexpensive way for those who are intent on circumventing our immigration controls to do so. We have already introduced measures to tackle this problem with the introduction of a direct airside transit visa requirement for 16 nationalities on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-24">24 June</phrase>. We now need to take further action and have identified six nationalities (Angola, Bangladesh, Cameroon, India, Lebanon and Pakistan) as posing a particular problem. Therefore from 00.01 hours on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-16">Thursday 16 October</phrase> nationals of those six countries wishing to transit the UK will require a visa to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/3">To avoid undue hardship for those who had already made their travel plans, we have agreed to operate a grace period. Until 23.59 hours on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-20">Monday 20 October</phrase> any transit passenger who bought their ticket on or before <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-15">15 October</phrase> will not be refused entry solely on the basis of not holding a valid transit visa. Also, any person on the return leg of a journey they commenced before <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-16">16 October</phrase> and who passed through the UK on the outward leg of their journey will be allowed to transit the UK without a visa until 23.59 on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-12">12 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/4">In parallel with those measures we are introducing changes that will allow certain groups of low risk passenger who would normally require a transit visa to be exempt from such a requirement if they are in possession of specific documents. This will include those who are in possession of a valid US or Canadian visa or certain types of residence permits, long-stay visas for entry to an EEA state, or the EU common format residence permit.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/5">We have also decided to remove the requirement for nationals of Croatia, Libya and Slovakia to hold a visa when transiting the UK for up to 24 hours. Finally, holders of diplomatic or service passports issued by the People's Republic of China, and holders of diplomatic or official passports issued by India will also be exempt from the requirement to hold a visa when transiting the UK for up to 24 hours.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/1">The first stage of the quinquennial review (QQR) of the Oil and Pipelines Agency (OPA), an executive non-departmental public body (NDPB), has been completed. The review focused on the OPA and its role as managing agent of the Government Pipeline and Storage System (GPSS).</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/2">The stage 1 report found general satisfaction in the performance of the OPA since its inception and that customers both military and commercial were generally content with its stewardship of the GPSS. The report also established that there is a continuing need for the GPSS and hence for it to be managed. Having established this need, the review concluded that the OPA was best placed to discharge this role and, after examining a range of alternative status options for the OPA, considered that it should continue to operate as a NDPB for the present time.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/3">The review also concluded that there were a number of improvements that should be taken forward into stage 2 of the review, the most significant of which are:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/4" class="indent">developing the OPA's management and business plans;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/5" class="indent">revising the managing agency agreement between the Secretary of State for Defence and the OPA;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/6" class="indent">revising arrangements for corporate governance; and</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/7" class="indent">reviewing the OPA support structure and communications.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/8">We have given my endorsement to the report's recommendations and stage 2 is now underway with the aim of completing this work by the end of 2003. A copy of the executive summary of the QQR Stage 1 report has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.3/1">Camelid keeping in the UK is a niche market and most are kept as pets or hobby animals. The Government see no need at present to require these animals to be formally identified or registered given their relatively small numbers. Movement controls only become necessary during a disease outbreak and the Government have the necessary powers to implement identification and movement controls at such times. In addition, the high value of camelids means that their owners tend to keep their own very good records relating to each animal.</p>

The police handle any accident scene in accordance with their road death investigation manual. This does not require a declaration of a scene of crime, but requires that incidents be treated as such until the cause of the accident is determined. This ensures that the scene is kept sterile and preserves it in order to capture and record evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.6/1">The Strategic Rail Authority's Specification of Network Outputs strategy proposes that, in order to achieve better value for money, maintenance and renewal should be commensurate with the requirements of differently used lines. The strategy views the network in terms of two high-level groups, with the first prioritised for expenditure. The two groups are: (i) primary/London and south-east commuter/main secondary; and (ii) other secondary/rural/freight only. The Cumbrian coast line is classed as an &quot;other secondary&quot; route.
