	<p pid="a.167.8/1">DfID is working closely with the international financial institutions and other multilateral and bilateral bodies to quantify the potential gains to developing countries of international and domestic trade liberalisation. Although estimates vary across studies, on balance evidence suggests that developing countries benefit from increased trade openness in the same proportion as richer countries. Furthermore, a reduction of a country's own trade barriers tends to bring real benefits to its consumers, including poor consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.8/2">None the less, while the reforms may lead to aggregate gains in a country's economic welfare, they inevitably create losers. As well as undertaking studies on the effects of trade reform on livelihoods and food security of the poor segments of the population in developing countries, DfID is working with a number of developing country partners and through the multilateral system to link the trade agenda within countries' own development strategies. We are also supporting the EU's sustainability impact assessments, which aim to gauge the potential economic, social and environmental impacts of the WTO negotiations on affected sectors in both the EU and developing countries. The intention is to ensure that liberalisation is accompanied by other policies to help maximize the economic opportunities for all and mitigate adverse impacts on poor households.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.2/1">The rate of the motor mileage allowance was originally set in 1984, when the House decided that it should be set on a single basis for all types of vehicle, with a reduced rate payable above 20,000 miles. The rate was, until 1994, uprated by reference to the RAC table of running costs; since then it has been uprated in line with the retail price index (RPI). The rate of the bicycle allowance was first set in 1998 on the basis of a recommendation by the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRP). It has been uprated annually since then in line with the RPI.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">As Members of the House are reimbursed on the basis of actual expenses incurred, and are not, in any event, employees, the maximum approved mileage allowance payment for employees does not apply to them, although I understand that the SSRB's recommendation in 1998 reflected then current Inland Revenue advice on the level of allowance allowable for tax purposes to employees using bicycles on official business.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.5/1">We are today placing the report of the review of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/2">The Act came into force two years ago on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-14">14 December 2001</phrase>. The outrages committed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> meant that we faced a new and unprecedented threat. The nature of this threat has been further underlined by the terrorist outrages since then notably in Bali, Singapore, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and most recently Istanbul.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/3">The legislation introduced unique&mdash;although not unprecedented&mdash;powers. It was therefore right that a number of safeguards were put in place including an independent review committee made up of Privy Counsellors. This was established under the chairmanship of Lord Newton of Braintree. We gave an undertaking that the Committee's report would be laid before Parliament and that both Houses would be able to debate the contents of their report. We are fulfilling the first part of that commitment today by presenting the report to the House at the earliest opportunity and look forward to debating the matters raised in the New Year.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/4">We are grateful to my noble friend Lord Newton and his committee members for the work that has gone into this report and to all those who have contributed to the committee's review. Their role as Privy Counsellors has enabled them to take evidence from a wide range of individuals and organisations including security and intelligence agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/5">At its heart, the Act focuses on ensuring that there are effective powers in place for dealing with international terrorism. These powers complement those already in place under the Terrorism Act 2000. They were, and are, necessary as a direct response to the public state of emergency existing within the United Kingdom following the events of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>. The judgment of the Court of Appeal upheld this when considering the appeal against the derogation from Article 5 of the ECHR which was necessary before the key Part 4 powers in the Act could be implemented. Other powers in the Act were needed to tackle crime and especially crimes which are closely associated with terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/6">As the House would expect given the nature of the legislation, the committee makes a large number of detailed recommendations which we are now in the process of considering carefully. We will also want to consider the report alongside that of my noble friend Lord Carlile (the independent review of the Terrorism Act 2000 and Part 4 of the ATCS Act) and the work of the ISC.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/7">Some few of the committee's conclusions can be implemented straightforwardly and quickly. For example, the committee's point on statistics relating to the number of individuals detained under Part 4 powers is well made&mdash;and we will ensure that these and the figures on terrorist arrests, which are already in the public domain, are placed on the terrorism website.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/8">We are also indicating to the House that we are willing to look very positively at many of committee's other recommendations. For example, we welcome the committee's recommendation that powers need to be enhanced to tackle identity theft, a crime that the Government have already identified as requiring urgent attention. We also welcome the Committee's support for strengthening measures to tackle terrorist finance. We will be publishing proposals shortly on strengthening our ability to deal effectively with all forms of organised crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/9">Whilst we will, of course, look carefully at what the committee has said in relation to the detention powers in Part 4 of the Act, we are not convinced that the current threat leaves us with any option but to continue to use these powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/10">Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 introduced exceptional powers to counter the risks to the United Kingdom posed by terrorist activity of the kind that led to the events of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase>. We have limited the use of the powers to the terrorist threat posed by Al-Qaeda and the network of terrorist groups associated with it. The nature of that threat means that it is right to target those powers at foreign nationals. Because of that the specific powers we introduced are only used when an individual cannot be prosecuted and cannot be removed from the UK because of our international obligations, particularly Article 3 of the ECHR. None the less all of those detained are entitled to leave the United Kingdom at any time they choose&mdash;if a country is prepared to have them and countenance their presence&mdash;as two of those certified have already done.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/11">These were not powers we assumed lightly and we have only done so because of the nature of the threat that exists to the United Kingdom. We have never pretended that they are ideal, but we firmly believe that they are currently the best and most workable way to address the particular problems we face. Our first responsibility is to protect the public and we believe that we would be failing to do so if the Part 4 powers were removed from the armoury of measures available to protect the United Kingdom from specific terrorist threats. Ten of the detainees have already had their cases reviewed by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission&mdash;where they of course have the right to full legal representation&mdash;and in each case my judgment in certifying them has been upheld. We fail to see how the public would be adequately protected from those whom SIAC has confirmed are international terrorists by electronic tagging as the committee has recommended. This is true not least because communication and organisation are as crucial here as custodial protection in a physical sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/12">The committee conclude very firmly that terrorists are criminals&mdash;a view which we wholeheartedly support. We therefore do not accept that as a matter of principle we should separate counter-terrorism legislation from mainstream criminal legislation. Terrorism does not fit neatly into such boundaries as has been acknowledged in both the original debate on the Act and the findings of the ISC.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/13">The committee has used the provisions in Section 123 to specify that the whole of the Act be considered when we come to debate its renewal. We will, of course, provide the House with the opportunity to do that. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 has improved our ability to fight crime and terrorism and the scope and therefore title of the Act reflects that. We accept that our primary duty is the security and protection of citizens of the United Kingdom and that this measure is a key element in achieving that. We look forward to a sensible and informed debate so that we can continue to build on this foundation while recognising the need for appropriate safeguards.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">I am pleased to announce the publication of the government response to the Joint Committee on the draft Corruption Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/2">The draft Corruption Bill, which was published for pre-legislative scrutiny on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-24">24 March 2003</phrase>, was based on proposals from the Law Commission, which were widely welcomed in consultations carried out both by the Law Commission and by the Government. It aims to consolidate and clarify the criminal law on corruption which currently consists of a patchwork of common and statute law, with the latter dating back to 1889.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/3">The Government are grateful for the attention given to this draft Bill by the Joint Committee within demanding deadlines. The response which we are publishing today sets out our reactions to their comments. A revised Bill will be introduced when parliamentary time permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/4">The proposed legislation forms part of our commitment to modernise and consolidate the criminal law and should be seen in the context of a multi-faceted strategy to combat corruption. The elements of this strategy were set out in a statement made in another place. Progress has been made since then, not only on domestic law but also as regards the international law on corruption. In particular on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">9 December</phrase> the UK ratified the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and signed the UN Convention Against Corruption.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.2/4">We have asked Sir Michael Bichard, Rector of The London Institute and a former Permanent Secretary at the Department for Education and Employment, to lead an independent inquiry with the following terms of reference:</p>

In particular, to assess the effectiveness of the relevant intelligence-based record keeping, the vetting practices in those forces since 1995 and information sharing with other agencies. Report to me on matters of local and national relevance and to make recommendations as appropriate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/6">Sir Michael shares with us the view that what is needed here is an independent inquiry which gets quickly to the issues without putting the families and other parties through the stress which something long and drawn out could entail. He will expect full co-operation from all the parties. If he reports to us that this is unforthcoming we will not hesitate to use powers under Section 49 of the Police Act 1996 which will allow the inquiry to summon and question witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/7">Additionally, we have asked Sir Keith Povey, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, to look at an inquiry that the Metropolitan Police conducted into the police investigation and then to work with Cambridgeshire Constabulary to implement the recommendations made. We will also want him to look at any lessons that could be learned by other forces facing a similar investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/8">We will consider what further action may be appropriate when we have all the answers to the questions we have asked.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/9">Also the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, has informed us that North East Lincolnshire Area Child Protection Committee will be commissioning a Serious Case Review under the Government's guidance Working Together to Safegaurd Children.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/10">The aim of such a review would be to:</p>

	<p pid="a.175.2/2">This amended contract, which covers the design and construction of the first three boats, is designed to reduce risk while incentivising the company to improve its performance in delivering the programme. It also covers a number of project management improvements and oversight.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/3">Considerable progress has already been made in introducing these improvements and the MoD will be looking to the company to build on this as we jointly restore confidence in the programme. In February, we announced that the ISD for the first of class would be delayed. The company is now formally working to deliver &quot;HMS Astute&quot; in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.2/1">Armed Forces recruitment and retention is one of the Government's highest priorities and our aim is to maintain excellent levels of retention through policies that genuinely reflect the priorities of our people and their families. The &quot;Learning Forces&quot; initiative is one of a number of initiatives introduced in recent years to improve both the recruitment and retention of Service personnel. &quot;Learning Forces&quot; is an expansion of educational and vocational training opportunities for Service personnel, including accreditation of Service training and civilian qualifications and learning credits. Taken together these have been effective although it is not possible to isolate the contribution made by any one individual measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/2">We believe that the initiative has contributed to a steady year-on-year progression in recruitment. In 2000&ndash;01 the Armed Forces achieved 90 per cent of the recruiting target and in 2001&ndash;02 the figure was 95 per cent. Furthermore, financial year 2002&ndash;03 was an excellent recruiting year. The number of new recruits was 26,220, and comfortably exceeded the target.</p>

The assumption is that all pensioners who have made National Insurance contributions have a nine-year National Insurance contribution record, and are only just under the 25 per cent eligibility requirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.0/1">In 1997 Carillion was awarded the contract for the Dartford and Gravesham National Health Service Trust private finance initiative project, now known as the Darent Valley Hospital. They invested &pound;4.1 million in the project company established to carry out the contract. In November 2003 Carillion announced that it had sold its share of the investment in the Darent Valley Hospital PFI scheme for &pound;5.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/2">In March 2003 the original loan taken out by the project company to finance the contract was replaced by a different loan&mdash;this resulted in a refinancing gain shared between the project company and the NHS trust.

There is no upper age limit for entering medical school. In 1999, after a period of consultation, the Council of Heads of Medical Schools (CHMS) produced a set of guiding principles for the admission of medical students. The Department of Health welcomed these principles, which CHMS commends to medical schools to ensure good practice in equal opportunities throughout all the United Kingdom's medical schools.

	<p pid="a.188.8/1">The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Mr Douglas Alexander) published yesterday the Government's response to the Fourth Report of the Public Administration Select Committee, Government by Appointment: Opening Up the Patronage State.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/2">We are grateful for the committee's comprehensive and helpful report. We have considered the report in detail and undertaken in-depth consultation. The Government accept the majority of the committee's recommendations and is already implementing some of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/3">The key features of the Government's response are:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/4" class="indent">Undertaking a review of public bodies sponsored by central government&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/5" class="indent">The Government agree with the committee that the variety and complexity of public bodies supports the need for a review of their definition and scope.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/6" class="indent">Ensuring that information about non-departmental public bodies is in the public domain&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/7" class="indent">The Government support the need for details of public bodies within the remit of central government to be in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/8" class="indent">The Commissioner for Public Appointments&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/9" class="indent">The Government agree with the committee that the Commissioner is central to the integrity and good practice of public appointments. The Government will examine the Public Appointments Order in Council to see whether it needs to be strengthened in order that the independence of the commissioner is assured. They will also update the schedule to the Order providing a definitive list of appointments regulated by the commissioner. The Government do not agree with the recommendation that the commissioner should be made solely responsible for appointing independent assessors, but will explore further with the commissioner how current arrangements operate to ensure that they are as robust as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/10" class="indent">Diversity&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/11" class="indent">The Government accept a number of recommendations designed to encourage and improve diversity in public appointments including developing and piloting shadowing, mentoring and board development schemes for groups that are currently under-represented on boards of public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/12" class="indent">Public Appointments Commission&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.8/13" class="indent">The Government believe that it would be immensely difficult for a single body to cope with the diverse range of non-departmental public bodies and maintains that individual departments should continue to be responsible for appointments they sponsor. The Government recognise the value of having central teams in departments to advise on public appointments and work with sponsor teams. They also recognise that the NHS Appointments Commission is working well and some departments could benefit from using its services. The Government will be exploring this further.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.0/1">It is still too early to make an estimate of the total military expenditure in Iraq. However, the Ministry of Defence has drawn down &pound;1 billion in last year's spring Supplementary Estimate from the &pound;3 billion set aside to cover the cost of operations in Iraq. The Chancellor in his pre-Budget Report Statement confirmed that &pound;2 billion has been carried forward into the Special Reserve for 2003&ndash;04 and in addition prudently set aside a further &pound;800 million over two years; &pound;500 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;300 million in 2004&ndash;05 for our international commitments in Iraq and the war against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">At the Madrid Donor's Conference in October the International Development Secretary, Hilary Benn, announced the Government's pledge of &pound;544 million to support the reconstruction of Iraq over the three years from 2003. Of this, &pound;296 million will be for the next two financial years, including bilateral funds and the UK's share of the proposed EU contribution to Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.3/2">The national speed limit of 70 mph applies on the M6 toll, with the exception of the two main toll plazas and their approaches, which have a permanent limit of 50 mph. For safety reasons, the toll plaza approaches are currently subject to temporary 30 mph limits while drivers become familiar with the new tolling arrangements. All wide-load lanes at the toll plazas are subject to a permanent 30 mph limit.</p>
