	<p pid="a.203.8/1">The Armed Forces Pay Review Body has made recommendations on the pay of medical and dental officers in the Armed Forces. Consistent with the awards recommended by the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body, and to maintain comparability with the salary scales of NHS doctors, the Review Body recommends that all medical and dental officers should receive a general 3.3 per cent increase in basic pay. The Review Body also recommends a number of additions to the pay scales for consultants and general medical practitioners to reflect additional payments already agreed for comparators in the NHS. In addition, Service medical and dental officers receive the same rate of X-factor as combatants, which increased by 1 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.2/1">Council Regulation 2792/1999 allows member states to use funds from the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) to grant compensation to fishermen and owners of vessels for the temporary cessation of activities, including circumstances in which a plan is introduced for the recovery of resources threatened with exhaustion. Member states have to set out in their programmes of aid, which must be approved by the Commission, those measures allowed by the regulation which they will implement. The majority of any such funding would have to be funded by the UK taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">No provision currently exists and the Government have not included this kind of compensation in the programme which has been submitted to the Commission. Compensation could not be justified for conservation measures made necessary because of a serious decline of cod stocks to which the fishing industry may have contributed by overfishing. It is hoped that the emergency measures being taken to promote stock recovery in the Irish Sea will in the longer term help to protect the livelihoods of those fishermen affected by the current prohibitions. No other country affected by this temporary closure has made compensation available.</p>
