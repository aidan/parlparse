The majority of these probes are carried out using automated processes and tools by hackers of very limited experience. These probes are obvious and are easily handled. However some probes are carried out by experts and are less obvious. Although probes are not in themselves illegal, those by experts can be the precursor to more serious attacks and therefore raise greater concern.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-04-09a.138.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="138"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010409/text/10409w02.htm#10409w02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.138.0/1">The information to which the noble Lord refers was collected as part of the lengthy and detailed consultation process that preceded the drafting of our legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">The Canadian federal freedom of information legislation was enacted in June 1982 and came into force in July 1983. The New Zealand Official Information Act was enacted in December 1982 and came into force in July 1983. The Irish Act was signed into law in April 1997. It was applied to central government and certain other bodies in April 1998 and applied to local authorities and health boards in October 1998. Since then, they have been rolling out freedom of information on an incremental but sustained basis. They plan to bring in unversities and the third level education sector in October of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">The Irish freedom of information legislation will eventually have roughly the same scope as the United Kingdom Act, though it is not, of course, retrospective in nature. Due to the size of its scope, they have found that it is necessary to roll it out in a gradual manner, with bodies such as the police not yet brought within the scope of their Act. It is likely that their implementation period will be longer than the five-year limit on the face of the United Kingdom Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/4">The Canadians and the New Zealanders were able to implement their Acts over a shorter timescale because of the smaller scope of their legislation. The Canadian Act applies only to information held by government departments and most government agencies, roughly 150 bodies, while the New Zealand legislation applies only to central government.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/5">In contrast, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will apply to over 50,000 bodies across the whole of the public sector. It will apply to local government, the police and general practitioners, for example, in the same way as it applies to central government departments. As a result, a considerable amount of work is required, in particular on the part of the Information Commissioner in the shape of approving publication schemes in order to ensure that the Act is implemented in the best way possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">Nationality is a factor, although not the only factor, in deciding whether a case is suitable for consideration at Oakington, as the country of origin has a bearing on the likely complexity of the claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/2">The nationalities currently considered potentially suitable for Oakington are; Albania, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, China, Ivory Coast (temporarily suspended), Czech Republic, Estonia, Ghana, Hungary, India, Iraq, Kenya, Latvia, Lithuania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Tanzania. Ukraine, Uganda, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Zimbabwe. Operational constraints--for example, the availability of interpreters--limit the range of nationalities that can in practice be dealt with at Oakington at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/3">Applicants from these countries may be referred to Oakington where it appears that their application can be decided quickly, including those which may be certified as manifestly unfounded, and there are no other circumstances which would make their claim unsuitable for Oakington.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.3/1">In advising on the appointment of Lords of Appeal it has always been my policy, and that of my predecessors, that these appointments must be made on merit. However, this in no way prejudices my commitment to securing equality of opportunity, with a view to promoting a greater diversity across the whole of the judiciary, including at the very highest levels, such as the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/2">It is the general practice to appoint as Lords of Appeal those serving as judges in the Supreme Court (or the Scottish and Northern Irish equivalents) and in that context there has been an encouraging increase in the number of senior women judges appointed in recent years; for example, there are now 11 women judges in the High Court and above, and five out of the 12 senior appointments made in 1999-2000 were of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/3">The measures I am taking, and the growing number of women in the legal profession, should ensure a continuing improvement in numbers. I will build on the initiatives I have already taken with a view to progessive increases in the number of women judges at all levels as the pool of suitable candidates at the requisite senior level in the profession grows.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.6/1">Accurate diagnosis is key to the detection of clusters of illness. A diagnosis is made on the basis of eliciting and interpreting symptoms and physical signs and analysing investigation results. It is regarded as best medical practice to record these findings. The Gulf Veteran's Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP), which is for serving and ex-service Gulf veterans and certain civilians, records all these data in case notes. The data were analysed and the GVMAP published its clinical findings in 1996 and 1999. These findings are broadly comparable with the published findings of similar large US clinical programmes which assess the health of Gulf veterans. Not only have these programmes shown that there is a lack of a unique illness affecting Gulf veterans but the resultant case mix has not, so far as the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is aware, drawn any comment that it is unusual.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.6/2">However, it is important to note that GVMAP patients are self-selected and their health experience may not represent that of those who deployed to the Gulf. Therefore, its clinical findings cannot be used to determine prevalence of illness among the whole Gulf veteran population.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.6/3">War pensions can be claimed only once service personnel leave the Armed Forces and are awarded for service-related disablement or death, not in respect of symptoms. The War Pensions Agency (WPA) does not have readily available data on symptoms alone but can provide data on medical conditions as reported by those who have claimed a war pension. It is possible that Gulf veterans may be ill as a consequence of their service in the Gulf but have not claimed a war pension. For these reasons, and limitations imposed by the Data Protection Act 1998, comparison of data sets on symptoms may not be overly informative. However, last year officials in the MoD's Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit were tasked to explore with the WPA whether GVMAP and WPA data could be aggregated to provide a more complete view of the incidence of symptoms among Gulf veterans. This work is ongoing. I will write to the noble Countess when I am in a position to do so and place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">The Manual of Military Law, Part III (MML Pt III) was first published in 1958. MML Pt III is an academic legal text, a reference document for lawyers and a detailed, if dated, commentary on the rules of war. In practice, the incorporation of legal requirement in rules of engagement, courses on international law at all levels at appropriate times and cards setting out main war crimes issued to servicemen going into combat are all more relevant to servicemen than MML Pt III. As such, MML Pt III is only one way in which the law of armed conflict is disseminated in the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/2">There are no plans to reprint MML Pt III in its current form but it has not been withdrawn from circulation. Copies are still held at unit and formation level and further copies may be requested from the Central Services Establishment, Llangennech.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/3">MML Pt III is being completely rewritten as a Joint Service Publication (JSP 383) and will therefore cover the law of armed conflict applicable to land, sea and air operations.

	<p pid="a.147.0/1">It is primarily for industry to take forward initiatives in the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and in national standards bodies such as the British Standards Institution. CEN is currently developing a European sizing designation system for clothing and this work enjoys the strong support of UK manufacturing and retailing interests. There are currently no prospects for developing a European sizing designation system for footwear.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/2">The Government welcome such initiatives where they increase the competitiveness of the UK manufacturing and service sectors. Indeed, the DTI is currently providing a &pound;1.4 million grant under the Foresight LINK Award scheme to a consortium of 28 partners (including four universities and a number of UK high street retailers and mail order companies) to develop three-dimensional body scanning technology in clothing retail and manufacturing.</p>

The Learning and Skills Act (2000) gives a statutory footing to our recently published sex and relationship education guidance and requires that young people learn about the nature of marriage and its importance for family life and the bringing up of children. The guidance also states that secondary schools should give young people a clear understanding of the arguments for delaying sexual activity and resisting pressure to have sex.</p>

However, from recent data collected by the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (CILT), 26 cross-party MPs have signed up to learn a modern foreign language as part of the European Year of Languages marketing event at the House of Commons last month. They will be learning languages ranging from French, Italian, Spanish and German to Greek, Albanian and Mandarin Chinese</p>

	<p pid="a.149.2/1">The Department of Health advises that the risk of human infection with foot and mouth disease is extremely slight as the disease crosses the species barrier with difficulty. The department provided advice concerning the low level of risks to human health to all directors of public health for cascade to doctors on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-28">28 February</phrase>. Advice to doctors was provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) in its weekly Communicable Disease Review (CDR) issued on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March</phrase>. Doctors were advised that in the unlikely event of a suspected human case occurring in association with the current outbreak they should contact the CDSC duty doctor, who would direct them towards expert advice on management and diagnosis. The appropriate 24-hour telephone number was given in the advice. This advice is also available on the PHLS website. The department's advice to NHS Direct also included advice on human health risks and included the links to the PHLS website for patient management information and the MAFF website.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/2">More detailed advice was provided to all consultants in communicable disease (CDDC) by way of question and answer briefing. General practitioners would normally consult with their local CCDC in the event of a case of an unusual zoonotic disease in the community. The PHLS advice was prepared in consultation with the Chief Veterinary Officer's representatives so that the State Veterinary Service was aware of the advice to be followed. The PHLS has a memorandum of understanding with the Veterinary Laboratories Agency regarding co-operation on surveillance and diagnosis of zoonotic diseases and the handling of diagnostic samples for confirmation of human disease has been agreed between the two agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.4/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.4/2" qnum="HL1651">Further to the Written Answer by Baroness Hollis of Heigham on 29 March (WA 58) on the uprating of national insurance retirement pensions for United Kingdom pensioners residing in Cyprus, Jamaica, Malta and Mauritius, what are the reasons why these four Commonwealth countries should be so favoured while the rest of the Commonwealth, including countries where large numbers of United Kingdom pensioners have retired, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, are excluded from uprating.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-04-09a.152.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100298" speakername="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" colon=":" colnum="152"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010409/text/10409w05.htm#10409w05_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.152.5/1">The United Kingdom's bilateral social security agreements with Cyprus, Jamaica, Malta and Mauritius provide for UK state pensions to be uprated in those countries. However, their main purpose is to provide some co-ordination between social security schemes for workers moving between the two countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.5/2">For many years, partly due to the significant cost of uprating retirement pensions paid abroad, the UK has entered few new social security agreements allowing for pension increases. Of those mentioned here, the most recent, with Mauritius, first came into force in 1981.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/2" qnum="HL1397">What is their response to the recommendations by the Confederation of British Industry in its tourism manifesto Targeting Tourism: the agenda for change that the Government should (a) increase the financial resources available to the British Tourist Authority, not only through grant-in-aid but also through matched funding; (b) provide sufficient resources to enable the English Tourism Council to adopt a stronger and more central leadership role for English tourism; (c) address the distorting effects of National Lottery funding and other capital funding boosts; and (d) avoid automatic uprating of the national minimum wage.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-04-09a.153.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100399" speakername="Lord McIntosh of Haringey" colon=":" colnum="153"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010409/text/10409w05.htm#10409w05_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.153.2/1">(a) Following the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), the Government provided the British Tourist Authority (BTA) with an extra &pound;5 million grant-in-aid over the three years from 1999-00 to 2001-02. Moreover, last year, as a result of the Chancellor's SR2000 spending review, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport announced his intention to continue BTA funding at the present higher level for the period from 2001-02 to 2003-04 (although &pound;1.5 million per year of the allocation, for promoting London as a gateway to Britian, will now be channelled through the GLA with effect from 2001-2002). In addition, the BTA has refocused a further &pound;5 million per year towards directly market-facing activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2">The BTA has a key role to play in delivering the Government's Tourism Strategy Tomorrow's Tourism and the boost in the authority's promotional resources since 1999-2000 is a recognition for the importance and effectiveness of its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/3">(b) The English Tourism Council was given additional resources in CSR 2000 and has responded magnificantly to the problems the industry is facing during the foot and mouth outbreak.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4">(c) Lottery funding is distributed on the basis of an assessment of need which the Government require lottery distributors to set out in strategic plans. Capital projects should therefore complement existing attractions rather than compete with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/5">Lottery funding is distributed for projects which promote the public good and are not intended primarily for private gain. It is time-limited and applicants for capital funding must present a business plan beyond the period of the grant incorporating provision for associated running and maintenance costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/6">(d) The Government have periodically asked the independent Low Pay Commission to monitor and evaluate the impact of the national minimum wage and to consider whether there is a case to increase the minimum wage rates and, if so, to what level, taking account of the likely impact on the economy. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-05">5 March</phrase> the Government accepted the commission's latest recommendation to raise the main rate to &pound;4.10 per hour from <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase>.</p>
