	<p pid="a.107.2/1">Latest reports from the UN estimate that at least 250,000 people have fled Cote d'Ivoire to neighbouring countries such as Ghana, Mali and Burkina Faso, and another 600,000 are internally displaced. The renewed conflict in Liberia has caused many Liberians and Sierra Leonean refugees to cross into Sierra Leone and Guinea. In response to the crisis in Cote d'Ivoire, the Department for International Development has provided around &pound;1 million to humanitarian operations through ICRC and the NGO Merlin as well as 2,000 tents, 30,000 blankets and 200 rolls of plastic sheeting to boost UNHCR's regional stockpile in Accra. There is a risk that there could be a rapid deterioration in the situation affecting large numbers of people, and we are therefore continuing to monitor developments closely in consultation with international agencies, including the UN. We are also working closely with others in the international community to support regional efforts to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. In this context, the UK Government have provided &pound;2 million to support deployment of the Ghanaian contingent of the ECOWAS peace-keeping force.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.0/1">It has at all times been the intention that, in terms of data protection, security and other aspects, the arrangements for processing data should entail no material increase to the risk of misuse of data. Consequently, before agreement was given for any data to be processed in India, the site was visited by senior officials from the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), who were fully satisfied that this was the case. The main CRB contract (signed in August 2000) requires that the CRB's private sector partner, Capita, and any sub-contractor of Capita, must comply with the Data Protection Act 1998; and that Capita may not enter into a sub-contracting arrangement without the permission of the CRB. The agreement between Capita and Hays Commercial Services Ltd, the sub-contractor undertaking this work on the Indian sub-continent, makes it clear that the provisions of English law apply. This was clarified in January this year by a variation of the original terms in order to make explicit Hays's obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">This arrangement has proved highly effective in enabling large numbers of paper application forms to be processed with timely, efficient and accurate data capture and eliminating backlogs from this critical stage of the CRB process.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">Non-EU countries are free to determine their own employment laws, having regard as necessary to obligations which would flow from membership of organisations such as the International Labour Organisation. I understand that the conditions and benefits offered by Hays are considered among the most attractive in the region, and that the salaries are well above the local average and in the upper quartile for the industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.5/1">LASHG was an unfair funding mechanism that did not allocate funds to areas of greatest need, consistently underspent nationally and gave unfair advantage to debt-free local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/2">As part of the measures outlined in Sustainable Communities: building for the future, we have decided to abolish LASHG to allow a more strategic use of resources. The change is to take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/3">We understand the concerns that have been raised over the timing of this change and recognise the difficulties this is causing for the planning of schemes coming forward over the next few months. However, it would be indefensible to retain the current arrangements at a time when there are pressing housing priorities that are not getting sufficient funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/4">We are also clear that there should be no hiatus in housing investment. We are therefore putting in place transitional arrangements to cover schemes that could have gone ahead in 2003&ndash;04 if we had continued with a &pound;500 million provision for LASHG.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/5">The transitional arrangements will be as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/6" class="indent">for debt-free authorities, provision will be increased from &pound;175 million to &pound;275 million; the money will be allocated by the Housing Corporation direct to the RSL;</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/7" class="indent">for with-debt authorities, revenue support of up to &pound;11 million will be provided to compensate them for the loss of investment income (at an interest rate of 4 per cent) they would have expected on repayments from the Housing Corporation for schemes supported by their own resources; this will fund up to a further &pound;275 million of investment in 2003&ndash;04; this money will be paid through a special grant under Section 88b of the Local Government Finance Act 1988.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/8">These arrangements will cover schemes which will have already started by <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>. We are also extending the deadline for submitting bids for new schemes to the Housing Corporation for three months to <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase> provided that schemes have planning permission, are approvable and are programmed to draw down the start-on-site tranche of grant by the end of January 2004. We do however need to ensure that the funding limits are not exceeded. If the total claims submitted by <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June</phrase> exceed the money available, the Housing Corporation will prioritise schemes with the government offices in terms of their contribution to the regional housing priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/9">Transitional funding will therefore support investment in housing of up to &pound;550 million. This is an increase of &pound;50 million on the provision for LASHG in 2002&ndash;03 and is higher than in any previous year. It is fully in line with the measures we have set out in the Sustainable Communities Plan to increase substantially the resources made available for delivering sustainable communities for everyone.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">All service personnel are routinely offered a range of vaccinations to protect against disease. These include public health vaccinations and vaccinations for those in special occupational risk groups. Vaccinations are also offered to service personnel deploying to areas with specific health hazards and to protect personnel against the effects of biological weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/2">In accordance with NHS guidelines, a number of public health vaccinations may be administered at the same time, some in combination. This is not unusual. However, by offering public health vaccinations to service personnel on recruitment, with boosters at appropriate intervals thereafter, the need to administer several vaccinations or boosters immediately before a deployment can be avoided. Nevertheless, boosters or additional vaccinations may be unavoidable at the time of a deployment or in an emergency. This is the case for anyone travelling overseas at short notice. In such circumstances, full account is taken of any other treatment or medication that an individual might be receiving at the time. This is balanced against the risk of contracting the disease during deployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/3">There is no requirement for service personnel who are offered a vaccination to sign any waivers or disclaimers. All vaccinations are administered on a voluntary basis. As part of individuals giving their informed consent to receive a vaccination, they are advised of the consequences of their refusal and of any possible side-effects of the vaccine. Units may, if required, maintain administrative records of which personnel have received the necessary briefings or need to be re-offered boosters. None of these records constitutes a legal waiver or disclaimer.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.0/1">The defence research community has been subject to major change in recent years. The public private partnership arrangements for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, which led to the formation of QinetiQ, and the establishment within the Ministry of Defence of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, coupled with a move towards increased competition in contracting for defence research, have required a major change in the management of the defence research programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/2">A review of science and technology in defence, commissioned in 2000 by the Ministry of Defence's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Keith O'Nions, recommended the establishment of a new research management organisation to meet these challenges. This new organisation, called the Research Acquisition Organisation (RAO), comprising up to 80 technical and support staff, will be responsible for formulating a coherent research programme, drawing together the many requirements from across the Ministry of Defence, determining optimum procurement strategies and placing appropriate contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/3">The majority of staff working in this organisation are currently located in two Ministry of Defence buildings in Central London (Northumberland Avenue), although some research directors work from other defence sites across the country. This is clearly a sub-optimal solution if the organisation is to function at maximum effectiveness. Recruiting new staff has also been hampered by the lack of sufficient accommodation at a single site. There is therefore a strong business case for collocating all staff in the organisation in one location.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/4">Following an extensive review, the existing Ministry of Defence site at Shrivenham has been identified as the most suitable to collocate the RAO, both from a cost-effectiveness perspective but also driven by the requirement for the new organisation effectively to interface with its many customers. Close contact with the Defence Academy at Shrivenham will also be of mutual benefit. Consultation with the trade unions on this proposal has now been concluded and no concerns were raised. Ministers have therefore agreed that the move to Shrivenham should take place and it is our aim to commence the move by September this year and that full collocation will be completed by March 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.3/1">The UK online annual report 2002 contained the most recent assessment that the Government have made. This assessment was that at end August 2002 we were fourth in the G7 for competitiveness. The metrics used were developed with the broadband stakeholder group and include indicators of price, choice and the regulatory environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/2">The assessment of competition in a market is a complex judgment. But by many measures, the UK is among the most competitive broadband markets in the world. As David Edmonds said, there are over 100 service providers using BT's wholesale products to provide services to consumers. In doing so, they face fierce competition from the cable companies. As a result, BT faces much more competition than incumbent operators in other major markets. Whereas BT's share of the retail broadband market is just over 20 per cent, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Telecom Italia have 90 per cent, 80 per cent and 75 per cent of the German, French and Italian retail markets respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/3">In terms of price, Oftel's latest benchmarking report (December 2002) showed that prices for residential customers in the UK were similar to prices in the US and Germany and cheaper than in France. Only in Sweden were prices lower than in the UK. For basic business services, the UK was cheaper than all the other countries considered.</p>

Around 2,800 patients were receiving treatment at the start of 2002. We do not have information about numbers waiting to be assessed. We do not hold precise details about the way in which primary care trusts are implementing the scheme, but strategic health authorities have been asked to ensure that they have robust arrangements in place to meet their statutory responsibilities.</p>
