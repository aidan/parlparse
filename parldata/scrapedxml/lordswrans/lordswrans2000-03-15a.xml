In many cases Ministers already make public the reasons for their decisions on merger cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.8/2">However, the Government do not anticipate publishing advice from officials to Ministers on mergers. Disclosure might prejudice the free and frank provision of advice, as well as the free and frank discussion of it within government. Such advice is exempt from disclosure under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, and the Freedom of Information Bill proposes similar protection.</p>

Council Decision 2000/177/CFSP introduced, with immediate effect, a revised and expanded list of FRY citizens (representing an increase to a total of 794 names) against whom the EU visa ban applies, and Common Position 2000/176/CFSP suspended the EU flight ban on the FRY for a period of six months. The suspension of the flight ban will come into effect when the necessary amendments have been made to the relevant Council regulations. In parallel, we are working with our partners to tighten up the implementation of financial sanctions targeted against the regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.8/2">Further to the Written Answer given by my honourable Friend the Member for Manchester Central--the then Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs--on <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-13">13 July 1999</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 141-142), the Government have decided to introduce a case by case approach to consideration of export licence applications for dual use goods to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo and Montenegro. There are humanitarian developmental and commercial reasons for doing so and it brings us into line with the practice of our major partners. Reconstruction in Kosovo is crucial to the province's development and the UK contribution to Kosovo could potentially be hindered without a change in practice. Applications will be considered consistent with the national export licensing criteria announced in July 1997 and those in the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. We will not approve any dual use goods licence applications which could benefit the armed forces, internal security forces or similar entities of the authorities in Belgrade.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.5/1">The National Beds Inquiry, published for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-10">10 February</phrase>, considered a number of issues relating to hospital beds including occupancy. It found that the downward trend in beds mainly reflects the reduction in average length of stay, the growing importance of day case treatments, and also the rise in the average level of bed occupancy. Its bed projections assume that occupancy rates will remain at current levels--that is about 84 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/2">The Government's Emergency Services Action Team report in 1997 included analyses showing that in acute hospitals average bed occupancy rates over 85 per cent are associated with rapidly growing problems in handling emergency admissions.

	<p pid="a.214.8/1">The Inland Revenue examines a proportion of tax returns every year to ensure that individual and corporate taxpayers pay the correct amount of tax. Most of the returns that are examined in detail are selected after a risk assessment, which identifies those cases where errors are most likely, and where the amount at stake is greatest. Tax inspectors are trained to discover evasion, avoidance and technical errors by establishing the full facts and applying the correct interpretation of tax law. As part of this process they will, where appropriate, make enquiries about claims for expenditure on business sponsorship, including sponsorship of government activity.</p>
