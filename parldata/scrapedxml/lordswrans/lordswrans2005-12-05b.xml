	<p pid="b.73.1/2" qnum="HL2524">Further to the publication of <i>Breast cancer: an environmental disease&mdash;the case for primary prevention</i> by the United Kingdom Working Group on the Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer, what powers the Health Protection Agency has to prioritise the primary prevention of disease and to reduce the exposure of the population to toxic substances.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-05b.73.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="73"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51205w01.htm#51205w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.73.2/1">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has an advisory and not a regulatory role with respect to control of chemicals to which the public may be exposed. It is the role of other government departments and agencies to enforce regulations to reduce the exposure of the population to toxic substances. These regulatory powers reside with the Health and Safety Executive for occupational safety, the Department of Trade and Industry regarding safety from consumer products used in the home etc, and the Environment Agency regarding environmental exposure from various sources. However, the advisory role of the HPA means that if it did have concerns it could influence the department/agency with the policy lead.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/2">There are many recognized risk factors for breast cancer. Some of the most clearly established are reproductive, and other known risk factors are age, ethnic group, family history of the disease, history of benign breast disease, socio-economic status, use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy; also, in postmenopausal women, obesity. In addition, the Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) made a statement in 2004, showing that alcohol consumption can cause breast cancer (<a href="http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/coc/alco04.htm">www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/coc/alco04.htm</a>). The COC has also looked in detail on a number of occasions at the evidence to support the hypothesis that breast cancer is causally related to persistent organochlorine pesticides. They have consistently concluded that there the evidence does not support a causal association.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/3">The view of the Chemical Hazards and Poisons Division of the HPA is that there is no evidence to support the view that exposure to specific chemicals is a cause of breast cancer. Thus, the agency would not argue a case for any prioritization in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.0/1">Article 4(1) of the delegation order places consultation requirements on the designated body, the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy (the POBA), to consult in respect of regulations which it makes under the powers in the order. Article 4(2) provides that these requirements do not apply where the POBA considers that the delay involved in complying with them would be prejudicial to the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.0/2">However, it is expected that reliance on the provision in Article 4(2) of the order would rarely, if ever, occur. The requirements in respect of consultation are in line with those set out in the Cabinet Office <i>Better Regulation Code of Practice on Consultation</i> (publication ref: 270621/0805/D5), which also provides for circumstances when full consultation may not be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.0/3">In addition, the Financial Reporting Council (of which the POBA is part) has committed to the Better Regulation Task Force principles that require regulators to be proportionate, targeted, consistent, transparent and accountable.</p>

	<p pid="b.77.6/1">The Investors in People (IIP) standard has been a major UK success story since its introduction in 1991. It is a business development tool which sets out a level of good practice for the training and development of people in order to achieve business goals and improve performance. Its expansion is a key element of the Government's Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.6/2">The department funds Investors in People UK (IiP UK) through grant in aid as a non-departmental public body (NDPB). The department also funds the Learning and Skills Council to provide local services in the support of the take up of the Investors in People standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.6/3">The department maintains the integrity of the standard by requiring IiP UK to maintain, review and develop it to ensure its continued relevance within the wider area of workforce development to all organisations in all sectors. IiP UK's vision is to strengthen the UK economy by improving the way in which organisations manage and develop their people, leading to business improvement and better public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.6/4">IiP UK is currently engaged in a fundamental review of the standard and its route to market. This relies currently on a number of intermediaries and is considered too complex, particularly for the collection of reliable management information. Ministers and officials are working closely with IiP UK to help locate the standard more firmly within the Skills Strategy and to explore options for repositioning the standard, including through partnership working with UK Skills and with sector skills councils.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.2/1">The department does not have a separate budget line for IiP activity. IiP forms part of wider workforce development activities. The budgets for these activities reside with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The LSC has advised that for the financial year 2004-05 it has spent approximately &pound;38 million to support IiP activity locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.2/2">Additionally the department funded Investors in People UK &pound;5.2 million directly in 2004&ndash;05 to protect the integrity of the standard.

	<p pid="b.79.0/1">On the basis of the information provided by Investors in People UK, data are not held on the numbers of head teachers who have been involved in the Investors in People scheme. However, in the past five years the total number of schools in England and Wales that have been involved in the Investors in People scheme is 13,819, approximately 50.6 per cent of all schools in England and Wales.

Information on the gross expenditure on mental illness elements of the National Health Service Hospital and Community Health Services budget in each of the past 20 years is shown in the table. This information does not include expenditure on people with mental health problems seen solely in primary care. Information on the estimated cost of poverty-related mental illness to the NHS is not held centrally by the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/2">Information on the amount spent by the NHS on treating conditions for which obesity is a contributory factor is not held centrally. However, the National Audit Office report, <i>Tackling Obesity in England</i>, published in 2001, estimated that the direct cost to the NHS of treating obesity and its consequences in 1998 was &pound;480 million. As part of its inquiry into obesity, the Health Select Committee estimated that in 2002 the direct cost to the NHS was between &pound;990 million and &pound;1,225 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.5/1">This information is not available centrally. Primary care trusts and the prisons in their locality jointly assess mental health need and commission services accordingly. The assessment that prisoners receive on reception will identify those at risk of having a significant mental illness. For those so identified, or who present later with mental health needs, follow up will include primary mental health care or assessment and intervention by the specialist mental health in-reach team. Across the National Health Service in England, 360 mental health in-reach staff are now in post and providing services to 102 prisons. This exceeds the NHS Plan commitment for 300 such staff to be in post by the end of 2004. The care programme approach aims to help to ensure continuity of care upon release. In 2003, 721 prisoners whose mental illness was too severe were transferred to hospital. Work is ongoing to improve this process so that prisoners can be transferred more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.5/2">There is good information about the prevalence of mental disorder in the prison population because in 1997 the Office for National Statistics undertook a survey of mental ill health in the prison population in England and Wales. This survey indicated that 90 per cent of prisoners have at least one mental health disorder.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.3/1">Since the Trident nuclear deterrent became operational in 1994 and 2004&ndash;05, annual expenditure for capital and running costs, including the costs for the Atomic Weapons Establishment, has ranged between three and four percent of the annual defence budget. Comparable information on the costs of the UK's nuclear deterrent before 1994 is not available centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate effort.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.5/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/2" qnum="HL2362">Why neither of their agencies, Connexions or Jobcentre Plus, supports Wheels to Work schemes in Devon and Cornwall, given the role of those schemes in enabling the agencies to meet their targets.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.6/1">Connexions Cornwall and Devon do support the Wheels to Work scheme through providing referrals for young people to the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.6/2">Funding for the voluntary sector is the responsibility of each individual Connexions Partnership and for them to judge priorities against the needs of their local area. Connexions Cornwall and Devon have taken decisions about their engagement with the voluntary sector and this has helped them to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in the number of young people not in education, employment or training during the period November 2002 to November 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.6/3">Jobcentre Plus has also supported Wheels to Work schemes in Cornwall. Jobcentre Plus were able to provide substantial funding (&pound;34,100) to the Wheels to Work scheme in West Cornwall, in its initial stages, for the financial year 2004&ndash;05. This was funded through the Transport Projects Fund, which is a national fund accessible only to action teams. To date the project has supported 130 people; 49 referrals to the project have come via Jobcentre Plus offices or European Social Fund (ESF) providers. Of these referrals, 61 have gone into employment and 17 are attending training courses at various colleges in west Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.6/4">In Devon, Jobcentre Plus has provision under the District Manager's Discretion Fund to consider funding for local projects. Wheels to Work schemes could be considered under this fund, but Jobcentre Plus has not received any such requests for funding, either from local offices or from the Wheels to Work schemes themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.88.1/2" qnum="HL2396">Further to the Written Answer by the Baroness Scotland of Asthal on 15 November (<i>WA 143&ndash;44</i>), whether Mr Peter Boatman, employed as a consultant by the Youth Justice Board, is also the Director of Operations of Pro-tect Systems, established in 2000 to act as the sole United Kingdom distributor for all Taser International products.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.2/1">I understand that he is. The Youth Justice Board retained Mr Boatman's services because he is a recognised expert on restraint techniques. He and his fellow consultant Mr Tony Bleetman, a consultant surgeon, had earlier provided advice to the police inquiry into the death of Gareth Myatt.</p>
