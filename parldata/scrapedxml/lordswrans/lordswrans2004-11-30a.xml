	Uganda: Humanitarian Situation in North

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">DfID is intensely concerned about the humanitarian impact of the conflict in northern Uganda. Approximately 1.6 million people have been displaced and 63 per cent of the population live below the national poverty line. While progress against poverty reduction is being made elsewhere in Uganda, development activities in the north have stalled because of insecurity.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">Since December 2002, the UK has provided &pound;15 million of humanitarian assistance for the region. This has been channelled mainly through UN agencies and NGOs focused on food provision and basic service delivery. DfID has recently allocated a further &pound;2.6 million. The plight of local children is a particular challenge, as child abduction remains the rebel Lord's Resistance Army's (LRA) principal recruitment method. DfID is working with a range of organisations focused on caring for children, including those who are rescued or escape from the LRA. UK officials based in Kampala regularly visit the north to monitor the situation and assess if there is more we can do. DfID is also working closely with other donor partners to improve co-ordination and the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance provided by the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/3">Ultimately, the situation will only improve significantly once the conflict ends. The UK is working hard to bring about sustainable peace in the north. DfID has emphasised the importance of dialogue in finding a peaceful solution. This message is regularly conveyed to the Ugandan administration at the highest levels, through UK Ministers and by the British High Commissioner in Kampala. In addition, DfID is providing practical support including the funding of a local radio station whose programmes focus on promoting peace and fostering reconciliation and is also supporting efforts to establish dialogue between the LRA and the Ugandan Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.2/1">DfID regularly receives representations on the humanitarian situation in northern Uganda from a range of sources including the UN, Ugandan and international NGOs, the UK Parliament and individuals. DfID has developed a humanitarian strategy and a major humanitarian assistance programme. Since December 2002, DfID has provided &pound;15 million of humanitarian assistance, channelled mainly through UN agencies and NGOs focused on food provision and basic service delivery. DfID has recently allocated a further &pound;2.6 million.</p>
