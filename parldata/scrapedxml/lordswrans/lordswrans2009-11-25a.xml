	<p pid="a.1.5/1">The Government announced their wireless radio spectrum modernisation programme as part of their Digital Britain report. One of the key elements was making the spectrum released through Digital Switchover available for next generation mobile services. The Government intend to apply coverage conditions to licences issued using this spectrum, which will contribute to maximising the reach of these services. The Government are currently consulting on the proposals in the spectrum modernisation programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">The Government are also undertaking studies looking at the coexistence of white space devices within the digital TV environment, which would utilise spare television spectrum more efficiently.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.2/1">In the St Andrews Agreement the Government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and to work with the incoming Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language. Subsequently, in the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, a duty was placed on the Northern Ireland Executive to adopt a strategy to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language. This strategy is still in preparation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">In addition, the Government published two consultation papers, in December 2006 and March 2007, setting out its proposed approach to an Irish Language Act. However, at the point of devolution in May 2007 responsibility for the Irish language, and for taking forward any legislation in this area, passed to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

Although not the focus of the research, the findings may also be applicable to sighted road users, including those travelling in the direction of traffic.</p>
