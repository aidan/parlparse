	<p pid="a.29.2/1">In December 2005 the European Council adopted a strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition. The EU's priorities include agreeing common international guidelines for SALW transfer controls, stronger regulation of brokering activities, stricter stockpile management and the destruction of surplus SALW. Since 2003, the EU has allocated &euro;88 million for action undertaken by affected countries in Africa, south-east Asia and south-eastern Europe to deal with the excessive and destabilising accumulation of small arms and light weapons. This amount is in addition to member states' contributions and is drawn from the non-proliferation project line of the common foreign and security policy budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.3/1">There are no specific regulations that govern the sale, supply, or purchase of DNA sequences. The potential chemical hazards associated with the sequence itself would be covered by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended). If DNA sequences were to be used to create a biological agent, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 (as amended) are likely to apply. These provide for a high level of protection for human health and the environment (including animal and plant health). In addition, the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO), administered by Defra, regulates possession of nucleic acid derived from any animal pathogen specified under SAPO. In all cases the relevant containment and operating requirements laid down by HSE/Defra would need to be met.</p>

The Government do not believe that it is necessary to require suppliers of DNA sequences to be licensed or for them to screen customers or check the intended use of the sequences. But we will continue to monitor the situation as the relevant technologies develop.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.2/1">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), the independent expert body that advises Government on drug misuse issues, has recently recommended that the Government reclassify methylamphetamine from a class B drug to a class A drug. During its deliberations the council closely considered the international experience, including that of the USA. Prior to making the recommendation, the ACMD monitored and considered related articles on the methylamphetamine situation in the United States and elsewhere. The ACMD has also been in close liaison with agencies including ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) and Her Majesties Revenue and Customs (HMRC), who have direct links with equivalent authorities in the United States in relation to methylamphetamine.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.5/1">The Government have carried out no specific assessment on the need for other European Union (EU) member states to develop new nuclear power plants. However, we are aware of the energy policies of other member states, including their views on new nuclear build, through our regular direct contacts at EU level and bilateral meetings, through the regular reporting of our embassies to central government and through other information co-ordinated by the European Commission. Of course, each member state has different energy requirements, dependent on the natural resources available to them and the forms of energy they choose to use.</p>

The annualised costs to UK industry have been estimated to be between &pound;91 and &pound;170 million over the next 10 years. Delaying implementation would mean that equipment placed on the UK market would not have incurred their proportion of these costs but any equipment exported to other EU member states would have had to comply to be lawfully placed on the market in those countries. It would not have been economically feasible for companies placing goods on the EU market to run two manufacturing lines.</p>
