	<p pid="a.136.8/1">The preliminary advice from the Committee on Toxicity (COT) on the paraoxonase 1 research carried out in the United Kingdom was that individuals who metabolise organophosphates (OPs) most quickly are more likely to report ill health. This is the reverse of the tested hypothesis.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.8/2">As a part of the preliminary advice, COT stated that there would be a need to review all the available research in order to advise on the current state of knowledge regarding OPs. Accordingly, the review is in progression and will include all work from across the scientific community, including that carried out in the USA. Completion of the review is not anticipated before late 2009. The final advice from COT on paraoxonase and the other aspects of the possible link between OPs and human health will become available once COT has considered all the evidence.</p>

The marker residue for calculating whether residues detected have breached the maximum residue limit, as laid down in Annexe I of Council regulation 2377/90, is the parent compound (diazinon).

	<p pid="a.137.8/1">Responsibility for the preparation of the literature review on organophosphates and drafting of papers for consideration by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) rests with the Health Protection Agency side of the COT secretariat working with the DH Toxicology Unit. This will be done using existing resources and there are no additional funds available. The literature searches have been started. The secretariat is also liaising with VIVID and the PSD regarding published literature identified by these organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.8/2">COT has requested that a systematic review of all the published data should be carried out, including those published prior to the previous report of 1999. This is to ensure comprehensive coverage of the literature. It is anticipated that several hundred papers will need to be obtained and assessed. Summaries will need to be prepared and submitted to COT. This is likely to take until autumn 2008. Also, the government research work that is expected to be completed near the end of 2008 will need to be considered. The secretariat will draft an outline statement in the light of the committee's discussion and will have to respond to queries from members. A complex topic of this size will need to be considered by the committee over several meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.8/3">The work will be carried out as expediently as possible, consistent with the need for comprehensive coverage of the data and adequate consideration by committee members. It is unlikely that this work will be completed before the end of 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.7/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.143.7/2" qnum="HL3305">What assessment they have made of Turkey's compliance with its obligations to the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe during the years in which the Islamic political parties Welfare and Virtue and the secular parties HEP, DEP and HADEP were dissolved, and with regard to the present threat to dissolve the Democratic Society Party.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">The Government monitor the human rights situation in Turkey closely. It is for the Council of Europe (CoE) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to provide a formal assessment of Turkey's compliance with CoE and OSCE obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/2">The European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) is the leading European authority on constitutional assistance. The Commission's guidelines on prohibition and dissolution of political parties make it clear that closure of political parties can only be justified when parties advocate the use of violence or use violence as a political means to overthrow the democratic constitutional order.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/3">The UK also expects Turkey to implement the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in full and to reform the law on political parties in line with the standards established by the court, as set out in successive European Commission annual progress reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.3/1">Women have a crucial role to play in delivering sustainable peace and security in conflict areas. The UK was a driving force behind the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security in 2000. Our National Action Plan for UNSCR 1325 commits to work to increase the number of women at senior decision-making levels in conflict resolution and peace-building in UK and international institutions and civil society. In October 2007 the UK supported a UN Security Council presidential statement which urged the UN &quot;to enhance the role of women in decision-making with regard to all peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/2">We also encourage the implementation of these principles in specific conflicts. For example, we supported language in UNSCR 1812 (April 2008) mandating the UN peacekeeping mission in Sudan. This encouraged the mission to emphasise &quot;the role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building&quot;. The UK supports programmes to promote the involvement of women in conflict resolution. For example, last year we started funding a &pound;3.2 million programme with the UN Development Fund for Women to support women's engagement in peace-building and reduction of gender violence in conflict and post-conflict countries, including Afghanistan, Liberia, Rwanda and Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/3">The UK places the protection of civilians, including children, at the centre of its humanitarian action. We support the UN Children's Fund with &pound;4 million per year, to lead, co-ordinate and strengthen the capacity of the humanitarian system in specific areas, including child protection. In addition, the UK is providing &pound;1.3 million (2006-11) to Save the Children-UK, to develop and train a stand-by roster of 46 emergency child protection officers, able to deploy rapidly to respond to the protection needs of children affected by conflict or natural disasters. Civil society organisations applying to the Department for International Development's Civil Society Challenge Fund, and the Governance and Transparency Fund to work with children, are also required to have a written child protection policy. The UK will continue to encourage the participation of women in efforts to prevent and resolve conflict, and afford a high priority to the protection of children in our programmes for relief and reconstruction.</p>
