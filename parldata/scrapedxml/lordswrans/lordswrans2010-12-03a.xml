The legislation allows the driver to continue driving while they await receipt of the new licence.</p>

This will inform the driver that they have 28 days to accept the penalty and surrender their driving licence for endorsement. If the driver does not accept the fixed penalty or surrender their licence, the case will be prosecuted through the courts. The court will instruct the driver to surrender their licence to the court in advance or bring it with them to the hearing.

	<p pid="a.496.0/3">As Director General of the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question to Her Majesty's Government asking for the latest estimate of the current percentage of gross domestic product represented by the National Debt (HL4636).</p>
	<p pid="a.496.0/4">The Office for National Statistics and HM Treasury jointly publish estimates of Public Sector Net Debt (PSND) and Public Sector Net Debt excluding the temporary effects of financial interventions (PSND ex) in the Public Sector Finances Statistical Bulletin. PSND is calculated from financial balance sheets that are measured at nominal value so as to reflect the debt that will have to be repaid when gilts or other debt instruments mature. Assets are also recorded at nominal values. PSND is calculated as the difference between liabilities and liquid assets (currency, deposits, and short term securities).</p>
	<p pid="a.496.0/5">At end October 2010 PSND was estimated at &#163;955.0 billion, equivalent to 64.5 per cent of gross domestic product, while PSND ex was estimated as &#163;845.8 billion, equivalent to 57.1 per cent of GDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.0/6">An alternative measure of national debt is gross general government debt, which is reported to the European Commission, as required under the Maastricht Treaty. This differs from PSND insofar as it excludes the debts of public corporations and is a gross measure ie. liquid assets are not subtracted from liabilities to arrive at this measure. The most recently published estimate is that general government debt at end March 2010 was &#163;1000.4 billion, equivalent to 71.3 per cent of GDP.</p>

As these are recent developments we expect to see continuous improvement throughout the NHS in reducing the risk of avoidable death and disability from VTE. The 90 per cent National Commissioning for Quality and Innovation goal is rightly ambitious and we know that NHS acute service providers are putting enormous efforts into VTE prevention activities and most will be aiming to achieve the 90 per cent VTE risk assessment goal during January to March 2011.</p>

Most post-arrival services are provided by partner NGOs, who work closely with the participating local authorities. National figures relating to the employment of individuals entering the UK under the Gateway programme are not collected. We receive quarterly reports from participating NGOs which show that a very small proportion (10 per cent) of those resettled gain paid employment in the first year, although a number (25 per cent) undertake voluntary work. UKBA does not secure employment on behalf of resettled refugees. They are signposted to mainstream services and have the same opportunities as any other UK resident.

	<p pid="a.505.3/1">We have not made an assessment of the use of computer technology to promote children's reading skills. It is for individual schools to determine the extent to which they make use of technology in teaching early reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.3/2">There are a number of phonics products on the market which make use of technology to support early reading. As long as a product adheres to the revised core criteria recently published by the department, schools are free to choose which one they use.</p>
