Regular software patching and updating will help defend against the latest threats. A government Internet Explorer user, operating on government systems, such as the GSi (Government Secure Intranet), will benefit from additional security measures, unlikely to be available to the average home computer user.

We continue to wish President Yar Adua well for a speedy recovery. However it remains important that Nigerian authorities continue to focus on the job of government in the meantime. We are, meanwhile, very concerned about the recent violence and loss of life in Jos. Our High Commission in Abuja has made clear to the Nigerian federal and state authorities the need for those responsible to be held to account.</p>

Stephen Bosworth's visit to Pyongyang was a useful first step towards North Korea resuming the six-party talks. There was a common understanding on the need to resume the six-party talks and implementing the 2005 Joint Statement on denuclearising the Korean Peninsula. The next step is to get North Korea to agree a date for a return to the six-party talks.</p>

	<p pid="a.374.5/1">The performance of joint integrated units (JIU) across Sudan has been variable. We continue to seek to improve JIU performance by working with UN Mission in Sudan and the Assessment and Evaluation Commission Sudan, to encourage continued JIU deployment and the development of their security capacity in all areas mandated by the comprehensive peace agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.5/2">The UK continues to provide bilateral funds to support the JIUs in terms of essential life support. The Government of National Unity remain responsible for provision of JIU equipment and pay. The UK, along with international donors has set up a UN trust fund for JIU support.</p>

	<p pid="a.374.8/1">Margaret Street and Abingdon Street were included in the 2008 modification to the boundary of the Westminster World Heritage Site. This measure created a more cohesive and identifiable boundary for the World Heritage Site, bringing together two key components of the Site, Westminster Palace and Westminster Abbey; and fulfilled one of the objectives of the 2007 Westminster World Heritage Site Management Plan.</p>
