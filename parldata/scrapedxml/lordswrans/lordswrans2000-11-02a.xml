	<p pid="a.110.2/1">Under the Police Pensions Regulations an officer may be retired on the grounds of permanent disablement if he or she is unable to perform the &quot;ordinary duties of a male or female member of the force&quot;. The term &quot;ordinary duties&quot; is not defined further. In practice, forces have tended to adopt a flexible approach and have normally considered whether an officer is able to carry out sufficient of the duties for the rank concerned to make retention operationally justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/2">This approach has, however, been called into question by a determination of the Court of Appeal this year that a police officer's &quot;ordinary duties&quot; should be interpreted to include operational duties. This interpretation may result in more officers being certified to be permanently disabled from performing the ordinary duties of a police officer. Under the regulations it is, however, a matter for the police authority to decide whether or not the officer should be retired on health grounds. If there is a sufficient range of duties that the officer is capable of undertaking, there is no requirement for the police authority to set a date for retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/3">There are, however, clear grounds for amending the current regulations so that it is put beyond doubt that a police officer is not permanently disabled if able to perform a sufficient range of the duties expected of his or her rank. We will be consulting the police service about the precise terms of revised regulations shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.5/1">It is left to individual Electoral Registration Officers to decide on the best and most efficient way of conducting their annual canvass of electors. It is an offence under paragraph 29 of the Representation of the People Regulations 1986 to fail to complete, or to complete falsely, an electoral registration form. The overall rate of registration remains high, at over 95 per cent nationally. I understand that the Electoral Registration Officer in Lambeth considers that the inclusion of an energy efficiency survey form in each of the last three years has not affected the rate of voter registration.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.5/1">It is the Home Office's practice to treat letters of request for assistance in criminal matters from foreign governments confidentially, as communications between two states. We are normally therefore unable to confirm or deny that we have received a request.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.5/3">Our response was to consider the request in the context of the requirements of the UK legislation governing mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, in this case the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Designated Countries and Territories) Order 1991, as amended. We have asked for further information from the Nigerian Government, and it is this information which we are now awaiting. To proceed without having established all the relevant facts could render the Secretary of State liable to legal challenge through a judicial review.</p>

In addition, the centres secured funding of &pound;257,130 for direct expenditure on projects. The centres manage projects to promote and support the development of democratic institutions and the rule of law and society in Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Activities last year included organisation of the UK team of OSCE observers to the Russian Duma elections, hosting a human rights seminar in Minsk, co-hosting a conference on the Russian economy and organising visits and lectures.</p>

The review's main recommendation was that the FCO's grant-in-aid should be spent on the project work of the centres and that membership activities should become self-financing. The centres have begun to implement this recommendation.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.3/1">Policy proposals on disclosure of information about major transactions by the Post Office have been developed and implemented in the light of experience with Post Office acquisitions, including German Parcel. As I made clear during the passage of the Postal Services Bill, Ministers considered and agreed a number of specific provisions on disclosure that will be incorporated in the company's Memorandum and Articles. The aim of these provisions is to give effect to the White Paper commitment that the Post Office be transparent in its operations and accounting and demonstrate that it is competing fairly with its competitors. As I explained during debate on the noble Baroness' amendments, the requirements are analogous to those of the Stock Exchange.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/2">Officials informed NAO of the policy on disclosure requirements adopted by Ministers. The NAO reflected this in its German Parcel report in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/3" class="indent">&quot;The Department has told us that it accepts our argument that there is a case for the Post Office and other similar public sector bodies to accept analogous rules to those of the Stock Exchange.&quot; (p. 44, paragraph 3.12)</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/4">When, during Third Reading of the Postal Services Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-11">11 July</phrase>, I spoke of ministerial agreement and authorisation, I had in mind that Ministers decide policy, as indeed they decided the policy on disclosure requirements which is being incorporated in the Memorandum and Articles and which is referred to in the NAO report.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-12">12 October</phrase> I was explaining the procedures relating to NAO audit reports and that responsibility for commenting on the accuracy and completeness of the facts as presented by the NAO rests with the Departmental Accounting Officer.</p>
