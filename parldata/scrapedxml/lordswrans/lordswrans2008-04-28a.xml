	<p pid="a.4.8/1">The Government are keen to encourage good-quality renewable energy applications in order to meet the twin challenges of responding to climate change and ensuring security of supply. Reflecting this, our new planning policy statement (PPS) on climate change expects planning authorities in England to provide a framework that promotes and encourages renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/2">The PPS advises that applicants are not expected to demonstrate the overall need for renewable energy because new renewable energy projects offer crucial national benefits. Planning authorities are asked not to question the energy justification provided by the applicant for why a proposal must be sited in a particular location as this involves considerations of technical and commercial feasibility which are for the developer concerned. Planning authorities should address the environmental, social and economic impacts that arise from the proposed location of a renewable energy project.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-02">2 April 2008</phrase>, the Royal Mint publicly announced a redesign of all UK coinage from the 1 pence to the &pound;1 coin by a British designer. This was following a public competition, which was launched in August 2005 and closed in November 2005. The competition received a record response with over 4,000 entries. Many of the current set of reverses were first introduced in April 1968. The last time that a set of reverses has lasted so long was in Queen Victoria's reign, when some coins displayed the same reverse for 50 years before being redesigned in 1887. The new designs take a traditional theme and treat it in an innovative and contemporary manner. The new coins will circulate alongside the almost 28 billion currently circulating coins, including more than 800 million 50 pence coins depicting Britannia.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/34" class="indent">1. Estimates for net costs have been rounded to the nearest &pound;5 million. Estimates for potential gainers have been rounded to the nearest 5,000. Totals may not sum due to rounding.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/36" class="indent">3. Estimates assume that people buy additional class 3 national insurance contributions in whole years, even if less than 52 weeks of additional contributions are required to achieve a qualifying year.

	<p pid="a.6.2/37" class="indent">4. Estimates assume that the option to buy extra years is available to everybody with a national insurance record and can be used to fill any deficient year between 1975 and state pension age provided that there is not a valid married women's reduced election in force for the year in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/38" class="indent">5. Estimates are for costs of increased category A pension net of any resulting reduction in entitlement to category B pension derived from a spouse's or former spouse's contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.0/1">No guidance has been issued to the Metropolitan Police Service or other police forces concerning meeting target proportions of ethnic groups under stop-and-search rules. In order to reduce the trend in disproportionality of stops within ethnic groups, the National Policing Improvement Agency, in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers, has produced practice advice on stop and search. This includes advice on stop-and-search procedures as well as a bespoke piece of guidance issued this year relating to stops and searches carried out under Section 44 of Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.3/1">The marginal cost of civil servants' time used to calculate the disproportionate threshold (DCT) for answering Written Parliamentary Questions (PQs) is based on a one-month sample of all Written Questions answered by those departments with the highest volume of Questions. The detailed calculations, which are carried out quinquennially, are based on actual staff time and actual average staff costs for the Civil Service grades answering the Questions in the sampled departments. The DCT is, therefore, based on an aggregate of the sample results, not on a predetermined grade or salary, and so it is not possible to provide a cost per hour.</p>
