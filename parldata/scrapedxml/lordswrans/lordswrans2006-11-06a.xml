The reduction has affected the provision of non-R&amp;D scientific services in support of sustainable agriculture.

	<p pid="a.86.5/1">The Gangmasters Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations 2006 (the exclusions regulations) fine tune the scope of the gangmasters' licensing arrangements by specifying the circumstances where a person does not need to obtain a gangmasters' licence. These include the supply of workers to work in the retail, wholesale and catering sectors, the supply of workers to undertake a limited range of agricultural activities, and the supply of workers to process and package non-food items which contain an agricultural ingredient.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/2">I can confirm that no specific provision has been made to exclude from the licensing requirement an agricultural contractor who supplies relief milkers. Paragraph 8 of the schedule to the exclusions regulations does make provision for the exclusion of a service provider who uses a worker to provide a machinery service to a farmer. However, to qualify for this exclusion, the worker used must operate machinery owned or hired by the service provider. In the case of a relief milking service, it is unlikely that the service provider would qualify for an exemption as in most cases the milking machinery will be owned or leased by the farmer and not by the service provider.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/3">It is possible that an agency supplying relief milkers may qualify for exclusion from the licensing requirements through the provisions relating tothe supply of specialist agricultural workers at paragraph 13 of the exclusions regulations. However, to qualify for this exemption, the worker supplied by the agency is required to hold a level 2 National or Scottish National Vocational Qualification which is relevant to the work in question. Furthermore, the worker must be supplied by the agency for employment by the farmer, and on the day the supply of the relief milker is made, the agency cannot supply any other workers to that farmer.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/4">Defra will be reviewing the operation of the Gangmaster Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations 2006 one year after the introduction of licensing. We will ensure that the industry is fully consulted when the review is undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.3/1">About 550,000 tonnes of direct mail are sent out every year (approximately 2 per cent of the household waste stream). The Direct Mail Association (DMA), which represents about 900 members involved in the direct mail and promotions industry, signed an agreement with Government in July 2003 to raise recycling levels to 30 percent by the end of 2005,55 per cent by the end of 2009 and 70 per cent by the end of 2013. The DMA has also pledged to help cut down on waste by improving the targeting of direct mail campaigns and by publicising services such as the Mail Preference Service, which enables people to stop direct mail being sent to them. Further information on the service is available at <a href="http://www.mpsonline.org.uk">www.mpsonline.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/2">Registrations with the MPS have increased by145 per cent since this agreement was signed and this has contributed to a 5.6 per cent reduction in the amount of direct mail produced per annum. The DMA is also currently working on developing a more comprehensive opt-out scheme for unaddressed mail as part of the voluntary agreement and hopes to implement this service in the near future. Apart from increasing the recycling rate of direct mail, the DMA has committed to reducing the environmental impact of direct mail in several other ways. For example, it has agreed to increase the use of recycled paper in direct mail and to avoid using materials such as certain adhesives which contaminate the recycling process.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/3">There have been no estimates of whether volumes of direct mail will increase as a result of Royal Mail's decision to remove the limit on the amount of junk mail that can be delivered through its service. It should be noted that this is a decision by Royal Mail and there are a number of other postal operators that deliver direct mail which do not set any limits on how much direct mail can be delivered. However, members of the public can contact the Royal Mail in orderto opt out of receiving unsolicited or unaddressed letters and leaflets delivered by them by e-mailing optout@royalmail.com.</p>

We will continue to urge the Maoists to demonstrate their democratic credentials by a commitment to arms separation and decommissioning. An effective arms management arrangement that can be monitored by the UN should be a precondition to free, fair and inclusive elections to a constituent assembly. The peace process cannot be successful unless the Maoists enter the constituent assembly as a peaceful democratic party.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.2/2">England: Information on pupils eligible for free school meals is collected at pupil level in England. Pupils should be recorded as eligible only if a claim for free school meals has been made by them or on their behalf by parents and either (a) the relevant authority has confirmed their eligibility and a free school meal is currently being provided for them, or (b) the school or the local authority have seen the necessary documentation (for example, an income support award notice) that supports their eligibility, and the administration of the free meal is to follow as a matter of process.

	<p pid="a.93.2/3">Scotland: Information on the number of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals in schools in Scotland is derived from the school meal survey made by local authorities to the Scottish Executive in March each year. Pupils are recorded as eligible if they are registered for free school meals, or if the authority knows from other sources that the pupil would be eligible. There will also be others who would be eligible about which authorities are unaware.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/4">Wales: Information on pupils eligible for free school meals is collected at pupil level in Wales. Eligibility depends on receipt (by parent or pupil) of income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. Pupils should be recorded as eligible only if they have claimed free school meals and (a) the relevant authority has confirmed their eligibility, or (b) final confirmation of eligibility is still awaited but the school has seen documents that strongly indicate eligibility (for example an income support order book) and on the basis of those has commenced provision of free meals.

	<p pid="a.93.2/6">on transfer from another school, where written confirmation has been received from the previous school that the pupil has a current free meal entitlement; orwhere the school already holds confirmation of current entitlement to free meals in respect of a sibling of the pupil.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.8/1">The British Council has owned and managed the pavilion on behalf of Britain since 1938. In 2006, it cost &pound;230,000 to fund the British Pavilion at the Venice architecture biennale.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.8/2">The Venice biennale of architecture is the world's most important discussion platform for contemporary architecture and urban design and is a highly effective way of showcasing the best of UK architecture. This is reflected in the growing numbers of visitors and international media coverage received. In 2004, 115,000 people visited the architecture biennale&mdash;an increase of 11 per cent on the previous event in 2002. We expect this will rise to 140,000 people in 2006.</p>
