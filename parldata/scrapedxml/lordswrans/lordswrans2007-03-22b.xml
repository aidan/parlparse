	<p pid="b.213.2/1">Agricultural vehicles are not within the scope of the MoT testing scheme because they are generally not used on the road very much by comparison with other classes of vehicle, so the risks they represent to other road users are also comparatively lower. The additional road safety benefits resulting from their inclusion would be likely to be outweighed by the costs&mdash;both the test itself and the inconvenience to all by requiring such vehicles to travel to testing stations.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.8/2">Letter from Karen Dunnell, National Statistician, to Lord Greaves, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-22">22 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.8/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Question asking whether the next census will include questions on ethnicity and proficiency in languages, including proficiency in English. (HL2666).</p>
	<p pid="b.213.8/4">It is not possible to confirm what questions and response categories are to be included in the 2011 census until the consultation and testing programme is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010. It is apparent that demands for information from the census are greater than are likely to be able to be accommodated, and difficult trade-offs will need to be made. A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals, including the wording of any questions about ethnicity and language proficiency, is scheduled to be published in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.8/5">You might like to know that, as part of the preparations for the 2011 census, ONS will be conducting a census test in May this year in areas within five local authorities in England and Wales. The questionnaire which will be used in the test was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase> and can be found on the National Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/censustestquestionnaire">www.statistics.gov.uk/censustestquestionnaire</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.8/6">The test questionnaire includes a question on ethnicity and a new question asking about proficiency in a number of languages. Some prior small-scale testing of the language question has, however, identified some problems and the quality of the information collected may be unacceptable. Analysis of the results of the main 2007 test and of further small-scale testing and consideration of other priorities for questions will inform the decision as to whether or not any information on languages will be collected in the 2011 census.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.8/7">We are conducting a further consultation exercise on user needs for information on ethnicity, national identity, language and religion from the 2011 census in England and Wales. This focuses in particular on assessing public acceptability of the descriptions of the ethnic categories. The relevant documents are available on the National Statistics website. This consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> (see <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_155.asp">www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_155.asp</a>).</p>

We are signatories to the relevant international protocols, including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we are in the process of ratifying, and continue to press countries that have not yet signed it to do so. Countries in south-east Asia, such as Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, have made significant efforts to improve prosecution rates for sex tourists. The UK has recently assisted these countries in their efforts through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Global Opportunities Fund drugs and crime programme. The UK has been especially active in funding areas of police capacity-building to investigate and act on cases of sexual exploitation, the training of judges in handling child witnesses in court and raising awareness of sexual exploitation.</p>

In considering the appropriate time commitment for the future chair we reviewed the needs of the body and the role in conjunction with English Heritage, including the commissioners, and have agreed that 90 days a year is appropriate. This does not represent a downgrading of the role but reflects the fact that English Heritage's modernisation programme has been completed and a greater time commitment will no longer be necessary. The remuneration level for the new chair has been set at &pound;45,000 per annum, representing a small pro-rata increase. We recognise the importance of the role of the chairman of English Heritage and we are making every effort to identify a suitable successor to build on the excellent work of Sir Neil Cossons.</p>

From April 2007 it is therefore intended to withdraw the sale of new CD-ROM and microfiche copies of the GRO index, and the RON index data for new registrations will be made available free of charge at the Family Records Centre in London from July 2007. The DoVE index date will start to be made available online, from early 2008, greatly increasing the number of people who have access to this information.

	<p pid="b.213.44/4">Estimates of regional economic growth, as measured by gross value added (GVA), are only produced at current prices and do not allow for changes in prices over time (inflation) or differences in regional price levels (purchasing power). They do not, therefore, show growth in real or volume terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.44/5">The Office for National Statistics publishes regional gross value added using official statistical geographies known as nomenclature of units for territorial statistics (NUTS)<sup>1</sup>. The NUTS classification corresponds to administrative boundaries of some, but not all, cities of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.44/6">Table 1 shows annual growth for 2003 and 2004 in GVA per capita for each NUTS2 area of the UK. Table 2 shows annual percentage changes in GVA per capita for each NUTS3 area. The latest available estimates are for 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.44/7">The full range of published regional GVA estimates is available on the ONS website: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14650">www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14650</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.44/8" class="indent">1. The Nomenclature of units for territorial statistics (NUTS) provides a single uniform breakdown for the production of regional statistics for the European Union. There are three levels of NUTS in the UK. These are:</p>

The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.56/1">Under our proposed pension reforms, more people will receive a more generous state pension, providing a solid foundation for private saving. The proportion of pensioners entitled to housing benefit is, therefore, expected to be reduced over time. Housing benefit will continue to provide important targeted support for those who would otherwise struggle to be in decent accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/2">This would be true of any pension system. Under a flat-rate universal pension, set at the level of the guarantee credit and uprated by earnings, around 12 per cent of elderly benefit units would still be entitled to housing benefit in 2050.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/3">Entitlement projections are shown in the table below. Long-term projections of entitlement to housing benefit such as these are subject to inevitable uncertainty, including future patterns of owner occupation, household formation and private saving. In particular, the assumptions behind the projections do not include potential increases in private saving due to the proposed policy of auto-enrolment into occupational pensions or personal accounts.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.56/16">The projections are estimated by a different method from that used to obtain pension credit entitlement figures. The latter are taken from the DWP's dynamic microsimulation model Pensim2, which is particularly well suited to long-term projections of entitlement to income-related benefits. However, Pensim2 cannot currently be used to forecast entitlement to housing benefit. Entitlement to housing benefit has been derived using the policy simulation model, a robust but less complex model. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting these projections alongside those for pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/17"><I>Notes:</I></p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/18">1. These projections assume that housing benefit policies as they stand at 2007-08, the end of the current planning period, continue indefinitely.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/19">2. The projections also take into account the reforms to the state pension system proposed in the Pensions Bill, which will affect pensioner housing benefit entitlement: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; and measures to improve coverage of state pensions described in the Pensions Bill introduced from 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/20">3. Estimates do not take into account the potential increases in private saving due to auto-enrolment or personal accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/21">4. Entitlement to housing benefit is as a result of being in rented accommodation and either having qualifying income below the relevant threshold or being &quot;passported&quot; as a result of entitlement to another benefit. In the case of pensioners, the guarantee element of pension credit offers automatic entitlement to housing benefit. Currently, around 84 per cent to 87 per cent of the elderly housing benefit-entitled population are also entitled to some element of pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/22">5. Elderly cases are defined as single people over female state-pension age or couples where at least one partner is over female state-pension age.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/23">6. Estimates cover all elderly cases in the private household population in Great Britain. The data source is the Family Resources Survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/24">7. Entitlement figures are calibrated against caseloads in 2004-05 using the National Statistics publication <I>Income Related Benefits&mdash;Estimates of Take-Up in 2004-2005</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.56/25">8. Estimates of the numbers entitled are given as ranges in order to account for possible biases in estimates from data that are less than perfect. They also take account of the effects of sampling variation. It is assumed that the size of this range remains constant in future years relative to the changing proportion of eligible elderly households.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.71/1">The African Union (AU) understands the operational constraints on the capacity of the AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS). It was at the forefront of international calls for the UN to play a more active role in peacekeeping in Darfur, which led to UN Security Council Resolution 1591. The UN is working with the AU to deploy a heavy support package, which will include logistics and other support functions and a full hybrid UN/AU force, which we want to be fully funded through the UN. Rwandan troops are a key troop contributor to AMIS and they are doing an excellent job. We want them to remain and become a key contributor to the AU/UN hybrid force.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.71/2">The UK is one of the largest bilateral donors to AMIS, and is funding troop payments for AMIS through the AU. More broadly, we are working actively with other partners in trying to improve the AU's long-term planning and operational management capacity.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.74/1">The UN Human Rights Council (HRC) mission to Sudan issued a damning report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-12">12 March</phrase>, confirming what we already knew about the grave human rights situation in Darfur. The Organisation of Islamic Conference, and some Asian states, said that the council should not discuss the report on procedural grounds because the mission had not gone to Sudan. In statements to the council, my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, and the UK Permanent Representative to the HRC have called on it to take effective action on Darfur and not become mired in procedural debates. We do not accept that the mission report is not valid, as the mission failed to go to Sudan. The Government of Sudan reneged on their commitment to co-operate with the mission and refused to grant visas to all members of the mission, so, rightly, none of the members went. The report is based on the assessments of UN humanitarian agencies, the African Union in Addis Ababa and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in eastern Chad. All of these organisations, which have large numbers of staff operating in Darfur and eastern Chad, continue to report an appalling human rights and humanitarian situation there. We will continue to press the HRC-to take forward the recommendations in the report.</p>
