The reform of sex offences in England and Wales is being undertaken following a review of the law in that jurisdiction. As that review did not include Northern Ireland within its scope, substantive reform of the body of law on sex offences in Northern Ireland will not be carried out until a review, and appropriate consultation, has taken place. The issue of gender specific offences will form part of that review and reform. In the meantime, consideration is being given to ways of addressing issues concerning offences which target only homosexual activity.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-03-17a.2.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="2"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030317/text/30317w01.htm#30317w01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.2.5/1">Authority to use force against Iraq exists from the combined effect of Resolutions 678, 687 and 1441. All of these resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter which allows the use of force for the express purpose of restoring international peace and security:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/2" class="indent">1. In Resolution 678, the Security Council authorised force against Iraq, to eject it from Kuwait and to restore peace and security in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/3" class="indent">2. In Resolution 687, which set out the ceasefire conditions after Operation Desert Storm, the Security Council imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction in order to restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 687 suspended but did not terminate the authority to use force under Resolution 678.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/4" class="indent">3. A material breach of Resolution 687 revives the authority to use force under Resolution 678.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/5" class="indent">4. In Resolution 1441, the Security Council determined that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of Resolution 687, because it has not fully complied with its obligations to disarm under that resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/6" class="indent">5. The Security Council in Resolution 1441 gave Iraq &quot;a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations&quot; and warned Iraq of the &quot;serious consequences&quot; if it did not.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/7" class="indent">6. The Security Council also decided in Resolution 1441 that, if Iraq failed at any time to comply with and co-operate fully in the implementation of Resolution 1441, that would constitute a further material breach.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/8" class="indent">7. It is plain that Iraq has failed so to comply and therefore Iraq was at the time of Resolution 1441 and continues to be in material breach.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/9" class="indent">8. Thus, the authority to use force under Resolution 678 has revived and so continues today.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/10" class="indent">9. Resolution 1441 would in terms have provided that a further decision of the Security Council to sanction force was required if that had been intended. Thus, all that Resolution 1441 requires is reporting to and discussion by the Security Council of Iraq's failures, but not an express further decision to authorise force.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/11">I have lodged a copy of this Answer, together with Resolutions 678, 687 and 1441 in the Libraries of both Houses and the Vote Office of the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.0/1">These issues are dealt with by the Government's National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC), set up to help protect the UK's critical national infrastructure from electronic attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/2">NISCC has a 24/7 response capability and issues both warnings and best practice advice (for example, encouraging the protection of systems by regularly updating anti-virus software and by the application of fixes for known vulnerabilities).</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/3">Where NISCC discovers or is informed about a vulnerability, it will work with vendors and others to develop mitigating actions. It is especially careful about disclosing its knowledge about vulnerabilities before effective protective measures can be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/4">During the morning that &quot;Slammer&quot; spread, NISCC's rapid response team carried out a technical analysis, consulted with national and international partners, and issued a number of prompt alerts. No warning could have been fast enough to prevent some infection from a worm that spread world-wide in 10 minutes. This infection did however exploit a known vulnerability which NISCC had warned about some months earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/5">NISCC alerts, and other information, are e-mailed to government and CNI partners, but are also posted on its website for the benefit of all. NISCC has an outreach programme with the critical national infrastructure, is involved in government information security issues, and actively supports the formation of information sharing groups which can help raise awareness and improve appropriate levels of protection. clean jenny</p>

However, since this date the unit has noted a marked increase in the number of calls, reports and enquiries from business and industry. In some cases, the contact has been to enquire how the new charter works; in others, it has been to report an incident or occurrence. The unit believed that a high proportion of these reports would not have been lodged had it not been for the charter.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">The confidentiality charter assists in developing the environment in which businesses can safely report suspicious hi-tech activity and attacks against computer systems without concern that this will cause interruption to their business. The charter, in contributing to a greater understanding of the range and amount of hi-tech crime which is being committed, will enable law enforcement and the Government to take effective action to deal with this threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">The role of NHTCU in receiving reports of virus attacks is in addition to that of the unified incident reporting and alert scheme (UNIRAS) which receives reports of significant electronic attack incidents, threats, new vulnerabilities and countermeasures from its customer base and other commercial, government and international sources. jenny</p>
