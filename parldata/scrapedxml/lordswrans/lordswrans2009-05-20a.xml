	<p pid="a.309.8/16" class="indent">Alcohol-related admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/17" class="indent">The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions. Figures for under-16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under-16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol - that is, those with an attributable fraction of one.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/18" class="indent">The ICD-10 codes used to answer this PQ are K70, K73 and K74, which are the codes for liver disease that is wholly or partially attributable to alcohol. K70 has an attributable fraction of one, K73 and K74 have an overall attributable fraction of 0.73 for males and 0.50 for females.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/19" class="indent">Number of patients who had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/20" class="indent">These figures represent the number of patients where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.</p>

	<p pid="a.309.8/22" class="indent">Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/23" class="indent">Primary diagnosis</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/24" class="indent">The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 200203) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/25" class="indent">Secondary diagnosis</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/26" class="indent">As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/27" class="indent">Data quality</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/28" class="indent">Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/29" class="indent">Assessing growth through time</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/30" class="indent">HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/31" class="indent">Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.8/32" class="indent">Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.330.2/1">West London Mental Health Trust has not been offered foundation trust equivalent status. A foundation trust equivalent organisation will be a National Health Service trust responsible for delivering high secure services which has been assessed as meeting the same standards as a foundation trust. It will be an equivalent organisation rather than a foundation trust because the trust provides high secure services, over which Ministers will retain oversight and powers of direction. The provision of high secure services legally prevents these organisations from becoming actual foundation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.2/2">Before any trust can be granted this status, the trust will need to be approved by its strategic health authority to proceed to a rigorous assessment process. If it is then assessed as meeting the standards, a recommendation for approval will be made by an assessment panel to the Secretary of State for Health, who will make the final decision on whether it can become a foundation trust equivalent.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.2/1">As currently drafted, the European Commission's proposal for a regulation on bus and coach passenger rights would apply to all regular services. Member states would be able to exempt urban, suburban and regional transport covered by public service contracts if such contracts provide a comparable level of passenger rights to that required in the proposed regulation. As the majority of services in the UK are not provided under public service contracts, the exemption would be discriminatory and of limited use. Negotiations are currently ongoing and it is too early to say whether the final proposal will include local bus services.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/2">The Government's consultation paper on the proposal included an initial impact assessment. The Department for Transport is currently revising this assessment in light of the consultation responses, but the cost of the regulation, which would be directly applicable, will very much depend on its final scope.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.5/1">It is a commercial matter for each individual transport operator as to whether they wish to transport pets to the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. If they do wish to carry pets under the scheme, they have to meet certain obligations to ensure the animals meet all UK entry rules on arrival in this country. If Eurostar wishes to carry pets other than assistance dogs, which it has carried under the scheme for a number of years, it can contact Animal Health to discuss and agree a service level agreement which would enable it to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.344.3/1">The reconstruction of northern Uganda is a key priority of the Government of Uganda. Parliamentary Under-secretary of State Ivan Lewis visited Uganda in February and underlined our concern to President Museveni of the need for urgent progress on the implementation of the three-year, US$600 million peace recovery and development plan (PRDP). Specifically, that the Government of Uganda must make real their commitment to fund 30 per cent of the total PRDP costs. Our understanding is that funds will begin to flow at the start of the Ugandan financial year in July 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.3/2">While we attach no specific conditions relating to the north as part of our overall development programme to Uganda, we will continue to press donor partners and other international organisations to urgently prioritise recovery and longer term development in the north and to ensure that the PRDP is fully funded.</p>
