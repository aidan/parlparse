The UK's search and rescue helicopter capability is not deployed to conduct this role. UK search and rescue helicopters are provided by the Ministry of Defence, in conjunction with the DfT; this capability ensures that the most timely and effective response is available to assist and recover service personnel and civilians in hazardous situations within the UK search and rescue region.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/1">The performance of the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test under GB field conditions is continuously monitored using a number of TB epidemiological parameters. Quoted sensitivity and specificity ranges for diagnostic tests are established from research studies and published in the scientific literature.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/2">For bovine TB, the most sensitive tests for diagnosis of infection depend on the identification of the immune response mounted by an animal in response to being exposed to the causative organism, as detected through tuberculin skin testing or gamma interferon blood testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/3">Historically, between 30 and 40 per cent. of SICCT test reactors have demonstrable evidence of infection when slaughtered.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/4">The primary purpose of post mortem and bacteriological culture of test reactors is not to establish the presence or absence of disease, but rather to identify the severity and strain of infection&mdash;this is useful for epidemiological purposes and supports subsequent disease control efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">TB skin test reactors that fail to disclose disease in the slaughterhouse or laboratory should not be considered as being uninfected. In essence, post mortem examination and microbiological culture are not the gold standards for diagnosis of <i>M. bovis</i> infections as both methods are less sensitive than immunological tests such as the SICCT test. Moreover, these tests are used in different cattle populations. The SICCT is primarily used as a screening test for cattle showing no clinical signs of disease, whereas post mortem and culture are used as tests on a subpopulation of cattle selected on the basis of positive results to a screening test. The different nature of these populations will affect the performance of any tests used on them. A direct comparison of the performance of tests that ignores these differences in populations is, therefore, not valid.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.3/1">Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods may be beneficial in speeding up culture confirmation of <i>M. bovis</i> in post mortem cattle samples. However, research to date has shown PCR to be inferior in terms of sensitivity, specificity and overall reliability when compared to conventional culture of tissues taken from cattle reacting to the tuberculin skin test.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/2">This is reflected in current European Union TB legislation, which recognises only the intradermal tuberculin test and ancillary gamma-interferon blood tests as approved methods for the diagnosis of TB in live cattle. Nevertheless, Defra continues to support the development of PCR assays for more rapid routine identification in the laboratory of <i>M. bovis</i> from tissues taken from skin test reactors.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.5/1">I assume that the Question concerns ministerial directions. These are given when a Minister directs an accounting officer, usually in writing, to proceed in accordance with his or her policy decision even though the accounting officer has formally notified the Minister of an objection to the Minister's proposed course of action because of concerns about propriety, regularity or value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.5/2">Departments are required to notify the Treasury when a direction has been issued and to send relevant papers to the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) without delay. It is then a matter for the C&amp;AG to decide what action he wants to take and whether to refer the matter to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman.</p>

The most recent 2005-06 report includes for the first time, the numbers of offences linked to the breach of non-molestation orders. These reports are available on the PSNI website at <a href="http://www.psni.police.uk">www.psni.police.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/3">In 2005-06 the PSNI attended 23,059 domestic-related incidents. Of these 10,768 were recorded as crimes; the clearance rate was 77.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/4">Non-molestation or occupancy orders are not offences in their own right. However, breach of such an order is an offence, though it is not possible in such instances to identify solely those which relate to domestic violence. In 2003, the most up-to-date information currently available, there were 239 persons convicted for breach of a non-molestation order and 39 convicted for breach of an occupation order.</p>

Section 1 contains a number of safeguards relating to this offence. For the offence to be committed, it requires a person who publishes a statement to intend it to be understood as encouraging others to commit terrorist acts or to be reckless as to whether it will be understood in that way; it requires that the statement is likely to be understood by people to whom it is directed as encouragement to them to carry out acts of terrorism; and it requires that what is being glorified is capable of being emulated in current circumstances. Prosecutions are a matter for the police and the prosecuting authorities and much depends on the specific circumstances of each case.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.0/1">(a) The Government have undertaken to issue a full public consultation on the issue of prisoners' voting rights in response to this judgment. It is premature to consider whether legislative amendment is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/2">(b) The Government have taken a series of administrative measures to give effect to this judgment, including arrangements to identify and monitor prisoners who may be at risk of suicide or self-harm. None of these required amendments to primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/3">(c) The Housing Act 2004 enables judges to suspend eviction orders against residents on local authority Gypsy and Traveller sites for periods of up to 12 months at a time, bringing the situation in line with tenants of local authority housing. The Government are currently considering whether any further primary legislation is required to implement this judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/4">(d) The European Court of Human Rights did not find in this case that any provision of United Kingdom legislation was incompatible with the convention rights. However, the Government have been working to develop a package of special procedures to assist defendants with limited cognitive function to participate effectively in their trials. The majority of these procedures will be contained in a new practice direction, although some primary legislation may be necessary as parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/5">(e) &amp; (j) The Government are currently considering appropriate amendments to the Mental Health Act and Mental Capacity Act. Human rights considerations will of course be taken fully into account, including the impact of these judgments.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/6">(f), (g), (h) &amp; (i) The Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988 was amended by the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1999. A review of police and criminal evidence legislation and codes of practice in Northern Ireland has been completed and is currently the subject of public consultation. Until these are implemented, administrative guidance issued to the Chief Constable and by the Attorney-General to prosecutors will continue to apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/7">(k) The position in relation to this case is as set out in the Answer given by my noble friend Lord Adonis on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April 2006</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>WA 2</i>).</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/8">(l) Given that the European Court of Human Rights did not find that the legislation involved was itself incompatible in this case, the Government do not believe that a remedial order is necessary. Instead, an action plan to ensure that staff are better equipped to handle information requests such as in this case has been developed and is being implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">Societies are not registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 2002 but under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965. The majority of registered societies established under the 1965 Act are unregulated, unless they are set up to provide regulated services, such as housing under the Housing Act 1996 or financial services under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. In that case, the appropriate regulatory authority may set the governance requirements; otherwise, the society's internal rules will determine their governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/2">No single body has regulatory responsibility for all industrial and provident societies (IPSs). IPS charities are currently not regulated but will be regulated by the Charities Commission when the Charities Bill is enacted. Community development finance institutions (CDFIs) are not regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), but their trade association, the Community Development Finance Association (CDFA), has proposed publishing a code of practice as an alternative to regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.0/19" class="italic">Prisoner Releases under the Good Friday agreement/Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/20">The Good Friday agreement was supported by over 70 per cent. of the Northern Ireland population and is believed to offer the best hope for a fair and peaceful future. It contained many difficult compromises not least that relating to the early release of prisoners. This element has been particularly difficult for victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/21">As part of the agreement a programme for the accelerated release of prisoners was established by both Governments. This included prisoners convicted of scheduled (terrorist-type) offences in Northern Ireland and transferred prisoners&mdash;those sentenced outside Northern Ireland but convicted of similar offences. Prisoners affiliated to organisations which had not established or were not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire did not and still do not benefit from the arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/22">The Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 which gave effect to the prisoners section of the agreement came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-28">28 July 1998</phrase>. This established independent sentence review commissioners (SRC) to consider applications from individual prisoners. To date (<phrase class="date" code="2006-05-08">8 May 2006</phrase>) 448 prisoners have been granted early release by the commissioners; 157 of them were life sentence prisoners. Of the 448 prisoners released, 194 were affiliated to loyalist organisations, 242 were republican and 12 had no particular affiliation.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/23">Important safeguards were built into the Sentences Act. Those released under the Act were released on licence conditional on them not supporting a specified organisation; not becoming involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism; and, in the case of a life sentence prisoner, not becoming a danger to the public. The Secretary of State may suspend a licence and a licensee be returned to prison if he/she is believed to have, or is likely to have, broken all or any of his/her licence conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/24">Of those released to date 16 have been found to be in breach of the terms of their licences and have had their licences suspended. Thirteen of these were loyalists and three were republicans.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/25">Although the vast majority of prisoners who were eligible have now been released, it is possible that, in the future, individuals who are convicted of scheduled offences committed before the date of the Good Friday agreement may be eligible to apply for early release under the Sentences Act.</p>

One of these planned contacts should be at their home once per month as well as one unannounced home visit per month.
