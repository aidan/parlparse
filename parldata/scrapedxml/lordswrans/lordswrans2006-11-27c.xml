	<p pid="c.26.0/1">The Government support carbon capture and storage in sub-seabed geological formations as a means of avoiding dangerous climate change and of showing leadership to emerging economies by applying this technology. The compatibility of carbon dioxide storage with international law has long been unclear. Therefore, the Government were a co-sponsor of an Australian proposal to amend the protocol to the London convention to clearly permit the storage of carbon dioxide streams in sub-seabed geological formations. This amendment was passed at the first meeting of protocol parties, held jointly with the 28th meeting of contracting parties to the London convention from <phrase class="date" code="">28 October</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase>, and will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-10">10 February 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.0/2">The applicability of the provisions of the OSPAR convention to carbon dioxide storage in the sub-seabed are complex, and depend primarily on the route taken to the storage formation. The UK supports amendment of the convention to clearly permit storage in the sub-seabed for all likely routes and, along with many contracting parties, is seeking to achieve amendment of the convention at its next commission meeting in June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.0/3">The oil and gas fields and aquifers in the UK sector of the North Sea are estimated to have large storage potential (~20,000-260,000Mt CO2). A number of projects for implementation of carbon capture and storage technologies in the North Sea, in conjunction with an enhanced oil recovery project, are now being brought forward by industry.</p>

This is a ring-fenced DfES grant provided to local authorities to fund educational provision in all types of setting, including private, voluntary and independent settings offering free early education. Funding for under-fives is not identified separately within the DSG. The DSG guaranteed unit of funding (for each full-time equivalent pupil aged three to 15) should not be seen as the level of funding for each pupil but as a mechanism for distributing the total quantum of DSG to local authorities.</p>

Following the consultation, we made clear our recognition that not all providers would be able to extend their provision to 38 weeks and that, at the relevant local authority's discretion, they could be funded for the provision they actually delivered. All local authorities received additional funding to support the extension to the free entitlement. As a result, we concluded, there should not be a substantive regulatory impact.

	<p pid="c.31.0/1">In the past six months, ministerial colleagues have held a number of meetings with representatives of private, voluntary and independent childcare providers. These meetings have been opportunities to celebrate the progress that we are making together towards the delivery of our 10-year childcare strategy commitments and to discuss issues of concern. Ministers and officials have also received a range of correspondence from providers, including on the code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/2">Some private sector providers have suggested that the funding they receive from local authorities to fund delivery of the free entitlement does not cover their costs, and expressed concern that, in their view, the code of practice prevents, for the first time, the charging of top-up fees for hours covered by the free entitlement. In responding, Ministers have been clear that local authorities have discretion over their use of funding from the dedicated schools grant, including the rates at which they fund early education in all types of setting. They are encouraged to fund early years provision equitably across settings in accordance with local circumstances. Ministers have also emphasised that the position on top-up fees has not changed and that previous iterations of the code of practice have made this clear. The Government remain committed to a universal free early learning entitlement that benefits all children regardless of their parents' income or ability to pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/3">We conducted a full public consultation on the 2006 code of practice, to which 585 responses were received, the majority from private providers.

None expressed concern about the requirement to ensure that the entitlement is entirely free at the point of delivery.</p>

	<p pid="c.33.3/1">The Inland Revenue (now HM Revenue and Customs) and the Department for Transport carried out a post-implementation review of the tonnage tax in 2004. This showed that, since the introduction of the tax, the deadweight tonnage of ships on the UK register had increased nearly threefold. It also showed that around 12,500 seafarers were employed on the ships in tonnage tax, officers and ratings numbering more than 6,000 each. Approximately 39 per cent of these seafarers were UK nationals.</p>
	<p pid="c.33.3/2">The introduction of the tonnage tax has had a positive influence on the climate for British shipping, but its effect on the employment levels of British seafarers is not easily measurable. The Government are continuing to look at ways to increase employment opportunities for UK seafarers, while maintaining the competitiveness of the UK shipping industry.</p>
