	<p pid="a.52.8/2">The increase would be spread across the UK budget 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13. This is due to the one-year lag in the UK abatement (the 2011 abatement will be paid by 2012).</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/3">The UK Government were very concerned about this proposed increase. The Prime Minister therefore led efforts to build an alliance among member states before and at last week's European Council, to block any increase above that already agreed by Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/4">As a result, 13 Heads of Government issued a joint letter on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-29">29 October</phrase>, stating that a 6 percent budget increase is &quot;especially unacceptable at a time when we are having to take difficult decisions at national level to control public expenditure&quot;; and that those Heads of Government &quot;are clear that they cannot accept&quot; any more than the Council's proposed increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/5">This means that, either Council and the European Parliament will have to agree to this level of increase; or no agreement will be reached, in which case the 2010 budget will be rolled over into 2011 unless and until a final budget for 2011 can be agreed.</p>

However the Government will introduce a Bill to Parliament later this year to put into place a &quot;referendum lock&quot;. This will apply to any future treaty which involves a transfer of competence or power from the UK to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/2">This Government firmly believe that UK membership of the EU is in our national interest. Over the next five years we intend vigorously to champion the interests of the UK and play an active role in the EU. We believe that the EU needs to change and that the EU can do things better. We are confident in Britain's ability to move the EU in the right direction. The Government are clear in their objective to improve the democratic accountability of the EU and ensure that the British public are engaged and active participants in the UK's future within Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.3/1">The Government's intention for health and social care is to create a system that achieves better outcomes and delivers truly personalised services focused around individuals and not organisations. Partnership working across the National Health Service and local government is critical to delivering this vision. We think it important that current flexibilities that support integrated working are made applicable and strengthened where possible within the reformed system.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/2">The spending review settlement represents an excellent opportunity to support integration between social care and health services at the local level. In order to support social care, the NHS will transfer some funding from the health capital budget to health revenue, to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will be up to &#163;1 billion in 2014-15 and will help to improve joint working between health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/3">This &#163;1 billion includes up to &#163;300 million per annum for reablement to help to avoid demand on social care, while the remainder will be used to support other social care services, which benefit health. Investment in social care will both improve people's outcomes and benefit the NHS. By ensuring that people remain independent, we can support them to be active in their communities, while at the same time reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and speeding discharge after a crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/4">Further details about this support will be published alongside the 2011-12 NHS operating framework.</p>
