	<p pid="b.117.2/1">The coalition allies are not in Afghanistan to take direct action against the drugs trade and they do not have a role in interdicting opiates or eradicating opium poppies in the fields. That is a job for the Afghan Government. The coalition allies are in Afghanistan to contribute to the broader counter-narcotics effort by providing a secure environment in which the rule of law can be applied, reconstruction can take place and legal rural livelihoods can be developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.2/2">Governor-led eradication has been conducted in 15 provinces. Reports indicate that significantly more eradication has been delivered to date than last year. At this early stage, the likely level of eradication actually delivered should amount to more than 12,500 hectare, compared to 5,103 hectare in 2005. Allowing a yield of 40 kilograms of opium per hectare, 12,500 hectare amounts to 500 tonnes of opium.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.2/3">The Government of Afghanistan's national drug control strategy (NDCS) is not an eradication-led strategy. It focuses on four key priorities&mdash;targeting traffickers, strengthening livelihoods, reducing demand and developing institutions. While the NDCS recognises that there is a role for eradication, it makes it clear that eradication should be ground-based and targeted where there is access to legal livelihoods.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.5/1">The commission comprises independent members and party-political members. The independent members were appointed through open competition, conducted in accordance with the code of practice of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.

It was reappointed in 2003 and the members have recently had their terms extended until the end of the year. The commission was established as an advisory, non-departmental public body, on a non-statutory basis. Its remit is to make recommendations for non-party political peerages to Her Majesty the Queen, via the Prime Minister. It also vets, for propriety, all recommendations for party-political peerages and all names added to the honours lists by the Prime Minister.</p>

The child's interest will be fully considered by the relevant authority having statutory child protection powers, such as the police or local authority, which will act quickly to secure the immediate safety of the child.

	<p pid="b.132.0/1">The Government's priority for reducing drink-drive fatalities is through a combination of effective law enforcement, maintaining a very tough penalties regime and continuing investment in high-profile national publicity campaigns to discourage drink driving.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.0/2">To this end, we have given the police new powers to carry out evidential roadside breath testing, subject to type approval of appropriate equipment. This will be supported by a number of other measures in the Road Safety Bill, subject to parliamentary approval, which are designed to deter drink-driving and reduce reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.0/3">These include enabling powers to require serious, including repeat, offenders to retake the driving test at the end of their period of disqualification; to improve the operation of the drink-drive rehabilitation scheme; to close certain loopholes in the law relating to high-risk offenders; and to establish a statutory alcohol ignition interlock programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.0/4">We will also be working closely with police forces this summer in a new nationwide anti-drink-driving publicity and enforcement campaign to coincide with the football world cup.</p>

	<p pid="b.132.3/2">When a Commission recommendation on the maximum permitted blood alcohol content (BAC) for drivers of motorised vehicles was issued in January 2001, the United Kingdom made it clear that it would not adopt a 50 milligram limit, and the Commission acknowledged this position.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.3/3">We have accepted European proposals for the use of speed limiters on heavy vehicles for high-speed roads, but there are no current proposals at European level for speed limiters on passenger cars or light goods vehicles of 3.5 tonnes maximum gross weight or less.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.3/1">All the UK's aid partnerships are based on a shared commitment to reducing poverty, tackling corruption and respecting human rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.3/2">Our assessment of these criteria in December 2005 identified a number of concerns, especially about the establishment of a level playing field for Uganda's elections. These concerns led to the decision to cut our poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) in 2005&ndash;06 by &pound;20 million (from &pound;50 million to &pound;30 million). We reallocated &pound;15 million of these resources to northern Uganda because of the need to do more there to address the humanitarian problems caused by the conflict. The remaining &pound;5 million was withheld until after the elections. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development will take a decision on whether to disburse this &pound;5 million in the light of his recent visit to Uganda.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.6/1">Uganda has recorded a major achievement in reducing HIV prevalence from 18 per cent in 1992 to 6.4 per cent in 2005. Donors have made a major contribution to this success. The UK has provided support through our HIV/AIDS umbrella programme through which we have committed &pound;7.2 million over the past four years for a range of programmes, including major assistance to civil society organisations to help to deliver education, treatment and care services. We have also supported the Government's efforts through our poverty reduction budget support.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.6/2">However, prevalence has stopped falling in the past five years, in part because people are now able to live longer with HIV, but more importantly because the number of new infections has stopped falling and over the past two years has once again started to rise. The number of new adult HIV infections is estimated to have risen from 88,400 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.6/3">DfID plans a major new HIV/AIDS programme, which will provide a further &pound;9 million over the next three years. This will build on the support we have already provided and, in particular, will address the issues associated with the increase in the number of new infections. It will seek to strengthen HIV prevention by addressing the gaps in coverage of programmes that are aiming to change sexual behaviour, as well as improving access to condoms and other proven means of prevention.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.2/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) has a civil society programme in Uganda, which provides support for human rights and development non-governmental organisations (NGOs). A detailed breakdown is available only for the past two years. Grants of &pound;517,000 in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;655,000 in 2005&ndash;06 were made available. DfID also provides funding to NGOs under its HIV/AIDS programme in Uganda. These amounted to &pound;1.459 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;2.009 million in 2005&ndash;06. We are providing more detailed information, which we will send to the noble Lord and place in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.2/2">DfID, along with other donors, has also provided &pound;1.5 million to a basket fund that has supported the democratisation process and human rights in Uganda. This fund was used predominantly to help the Electoral Commission with the 2006 elections. &pound;671,000 was also set aside for a national civic education programme managed by the Uganda Human Rights Commission. A further &pound;146,000 was provided to a coalition of NGOs who monitored the democratisation process (including media freedom and freedom of assembly). &pound;81,000 from the basket was used to enable an NGO coalition to petition the courts for a ruling on the constitutionality of Uganda's death penalty and its consistency with Uganda's obligations under the international conventions to which it is party.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.2/3">Between 2003 and 2006, our High Commission spent &pound;480,045 in Kampala's small grants scheme on community-based development projects. We are providing more information on that, which we will send to the noble Lord and place in the Library of the House. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also provided &pound;63,484 to the International Republican Institute from 2004&ndash;06 to fund a project to build professionalism in political parties.</p>
