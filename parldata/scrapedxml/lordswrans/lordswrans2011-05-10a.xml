	<p pid="a.182.6/1">There has been no assessment by the UK of the actual decisions of these countries to adopt re-export control measures, but the UK has actively engaged in discussions with our international partners on the subject of re-export controls in the appropriate international fora. Discussions on arms export controls take place between EU member states in the Council Working Group on Conventional Arms and between participating states in the Wassenaar arrangement. The information we have received from EU partners-including France and Germany-on their re-export controls only serves to confirm the Government's view that there are very real problems with the enforcement of such controls that are common to all states that seek to operate them. These problems stem principally from the fact that breaches of re-export provisions occur outside the legal jurisdiction of the exporting state and the avenues for effective legal remedy are limited or non-existent.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.6/2">The Government therefore have not considered it necessary to conduct any additional consultations with international partners on this subject and remain convinced that fully examining the risk of diversion of arms before deciding whether or not to grant an export licence, coupled with the negotiation and implementation of a robust and effective arms trade treaty, is the most effective way to address the issue of re-export.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.2/1">Protecting vulnerable women and children is a priority for this Government. It is essential that we continue to take a strong lead on this issue, demonstrating nationally the priority it merits locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/2">In challenging times we are freeing local authorities to focus on essential frontline services, and to invest in early intervention and prevention in order to produce long-term savings and better results for those who are most vulnerable. This work includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/3">the early intervention grant, which provides funding for early intervention and preventive services for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in society, will be un-ring-fenced and worth more than &#163;2.2 billion per annum;commitments made as part of the government action plan supporting our strategy to end violence against women and girls, which includes providing over &#163;28 million of stable Home Office funding for specialist services to support victims of domestic and sexual abuse and piloting new domestic violence protection notices (DVPNs) and orders (DVPOs), which will provide new powers for the police, allowing them to step in and protect the victim when they are at their most vulnerable;secured investment of &#163;6.5 billion for the Supporting People programme over the next four years under which approximately 1 million vulnerable people are supported at any one time; and a review by the Department of Health of the legal framework for the provision of services to people who need social care services, through its work with the Law Commission; this includes clarifying the local authority duty to safeguard vulnerable adults.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.0/1">The Sojourner project was set up to support applicants who apply for settlement under paragraph 289A of the Immigration Rules on victims of domestic violence. The provisions of Rule 289A apply only to those who were admitted or given an extension of stay in the UK as the spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner or same sex partner of a person present and settled in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/2">Persons who are in the UK as the partner of a person present and settled have entered the UK with a view to settlement. Their ability to continue their route to settlement depends solely on the continuation of their relationship with that person. If that relationship becomes abusive, the applicant may be pressured to remain in that relationship as a result of their immigration status. It is for this reason that applicants who are in the UK on the basis of a relationship are offered an alternative route to settlement if they are a victim of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/3">Persons who are in the UK on other routes are not relying directly on their relationship for their immigration status, and have not entered the UK with a specific view to settlement. Therefore it would not be appropriate to grant settlement under the domestic violence rule in these cases. However, it is open to such individuals to make an application for settlement outside the rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.3/1">Students who applied for entry clearance or leave to remain under tier four on or after <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-05">5 October 2009</phrase> are subject to a condition tying them to their sponsoring education institution. Students subject to this condition who wish to change institution are required to make an application to the UK Border Agency to vary the condition of their leave, that is, to allow them to study at another sponsor.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-23">23 July 2010</phrase>, students who wish to move to a new tier four sponsor have been permitted to commence study at the new sponsor institution when it has highly trusted sponsor status and where the student has submitted an application to the UK Border Agency to vary their leave, before they have received a decision on their application. This amendment means that a student can commence study promptly at the highly trusted sponsor institution without breaching the condition of their leave, should the course commence before they have received a decision on their application.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.3/4">Specific information on how many such changes were made in the past six months is not held centrally in the format required and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
