	<p pid="a.35.2/2">The framework decision is intended to create a system enabling faster procedures for the surrender of a fugitive as between EU member states. Protection for the individual is provided in the domestic incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into the requesting state's criminal justice system, rather than before the courts in the United Kingdom. This is the principle of mutual recognition, on the basis of which we would similarly expect our European Union partners to return those whom we want to bring before our courts to stand trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/3">The framework decision as currently drafted provides for non-execution of a European arrest warrant where its subject has already been acquitted or convicted of the same offence or in relation to an offence committed below the age of criminal responsibility in the member state from where surrender is sought.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.5/1">The Prison Service and National Probation Service (NPS) are committed to improving the employment and employability of offenders.

The Prison Service has a target of doubling the number of prisoners getting jobs on release by April 2004 and is investing &pound;30 million in a custody to work programme to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/2">A key element is improving the basic skills of offenders. The Prison Service has stringent targets to improve the educational and vocational qualifications of offenders with 18,000 completions of level 2 basic and key skills awards in 2001&ndash;02. The NPS has targets of 6,000 completions of level 2 basic skills awards in 2002&ndash;03 and 12,000 completions in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/3">The Prison Service and NPS are working together to develop strategies which will address resettlement issues and strengthen joint working partnerships. A NPS employment pathfinder is being developed to pilot the effectiveness of tools and inter-agency arrangements for assessing offenders' employment needs and managing interventions accordingly. In addition, a joint Prison and Probation Service resettlement pathfinder has been established to tackle practical resettlement issues such as finding and retaining appropriate employment and making sure this work develops seamlessly from custody to the community.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/15">The above crime prevention costs address all types of crime against retailers, not just those given above.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/16">Levels of expenditure on crime prevention matters by retailers are essentially a private matter for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/17">We have, however, established the Retail Crime Reduction Action Team which operates across sector boundaries to reduce retail crime and develop intervention strategies aimed at preventing the occurrence of retail crime. It has produced a detailed guide on how to go about setting up and operating a local retail crime reduction partnership, and continues to assist with the development of these. There are now some 250 such partnerships covering major shopping centres in England and Wales. The team also supports the Safer Shopping Award which recognises the achievement of good overall security standards in shopping centres and gives active support to the work of Crime Concern in developing primary action groups aimed at deflecting young people from becoming involved in thefts from shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/18">We are also providing funding of &pound;15 million over three years for a project to improve security of small retailers in the most deprived areas throughout England and Wales, with &pound;3 million to be spent this financial year and &pound;6 million for each of the years 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04. The money will be used to help retailers to enhance security of their premises by installing additional locks or toughened glass, or may be used to make improvements to their immediate environment. We are currently working with local communities to identify specific sites which can most benefit from the scheme.</p>

These applications represent around 50 per cent of the business of the UK Passport Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/2">Various checks on the acceptability of a countersignatory are undertaken on all such applications through the passport issuing process. Some checks are automatic; others are undertaken at the discretion of passport examiners. These checks include formal checks on the countersignatory's credentials. Because they are part of the wider examination process these particular checks are not separately recorded.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.3/1">The Extradition Act 1989 provides that extradition may be refused if the fugitive stands accused or convicted of an offence for which he could be or has been sentenced to death. This discretion must be interpreted in the light of the wording of the Sixth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights which outlaws the application of the death penalty and to which the United Kingdom is a signatory. This Government will therefore refuse to extradite persons to any jurisdiction where the offence for which they could be or have been tried carries the death penalty unless sufficient assurances are provided by a requesting state that the death penalty will not be imposed or, if imposed, will not be carried out.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/1">We are publishing the strategy today. Copies have been placed in the Vote Office and the Library and sent to the members of the Standing Committee currently considering the Proceeds of Crime Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/2">The Asset Recovery Strategy is the first United Kingdom-wide initiative of its kind, in which the law enforcement, prosecution and relevant government bodies have joined together to commit themselves to making financial investigation and asset recovery a higher priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/3">The strategy's aims are: to make greater use of the investigation of criminal assets in the fight against crime; to recover money that has been made from crime or which is intended for use in crime; to prevent criminals and their associates from laundering the proceeds of criminal conduct and to detect and penalise such laundering where it occurs; and to use the proceeds recovered for the benefit of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/4">The strategy sets out our objectives for meeting the challenging financial investigation target of recovering &pound;60 million in confiscation and forfeiture receipts during the 2004&ndash;05 financial year. Hitting this target would achieve the Government's commitment of doubling amounts recovered from drug traffickers and other major criminals by 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/5">It is not acceptable that people should enjoy the proceeds of criminal activity and live a life of luxury when it is built on the misery of victims or activities which damage or exploit society.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/6">The strategy we are publishing today sets out how we propose to push forward recovering criminal assets with partners both inside and outside government. Alongside the Proceeds of Crime Bill, the strategy will help take the profit out of crime and dismantle and disrupt criminal enterprises.</p>

However, the UK does have a requirement to replace, towards the end of the next decade, the strike capability currently provided by the Tornado GR4 aircraft. This programme is known as the future offensive air system. While no decisions have yet been taken, we are currently looking at a potential mix of systems to deliver precision strike capability, including long-range cruise missiles, uninhabited air combat vehicles and manned aircraft. As part of this work the potential of large military and converted civil aircraft, such as the Airbus A340, to act as launch platforms for long-range conventional air launched cruise missiles is being considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.2/11">The increases will be partly offset by an allocation of &pound;22,000,000 from the criminal justice system reserve, an allocation of &pound;250,000 from the Civil Service Modernisation Fund, a transfer of &pound;105,000 from the Home Office, an allocation of &pound;300,000 from the Capital Modernisation Fund, the drawn-down of &pound;1,750,000 of the Attorney-General's departments capital departmental unallocated provision and the surrender of &pound;99,000 of the Attorney-General's departments capital end year flexibility of &pound;4,406,000 as set out in Table 6 of the Public Expenditure 2000&ndash;01 Outturn White Paper Cm 5243 published July 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.2/12">The remainder of the expenditure will be charged to the reserve and will not, therefore, add to the planned total of public expenditure.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-11-28a.45.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="45"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo011128/text/11128w03.htm#11128w03_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.45.2/1">It is not possible to provide a meaningful answer in the form requested by the noble Baroness. At the height of the foot and mouth outbreak some 5,000 staff, including casual staff and those from other government departments, were employed in dealing with it. (This figure excludes personnel from the Armed Forces.) The numbers and composition of this workforce varied greatly over the months of the outbreak and cannot be readily broken down to identify the total contribution by staff who would otherwise have been engaged, wholly or partly, in environmental regulatory work. The development and implementation of the environmental regulatory framework involves input from a large number of divisions across DEFRA, as well as some of its associated non-departmental public bodies, and it would be disproportionately expensive to estimate working hours lost to this during the foot and mouth outbreak. Such an estimate to be meaningful would have to include, as well as staff movements, re-prioritising of work due to the demands of foot and mouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">An assessment of the impact of foot and mouth disease on the progress of the department's environmental regulation work would also need to include the effects of the outbreak upon the farming industry. The preoccupation of the industry itself with fighting the disease and the effects on the viability of some farm businesses meant that it would have been both insensitive and unproductive to continue consulting the industry on all environmental proposals in the pipeline and work was accordingly slowed down.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.2/1">Each government department is responsible for its own purchasing decisions but they are required to obtain value for money for all procurements. This is usually obtained through open competition. Where the value of the contract exceeds certain thresholds, government purchasing procedures are regulated by statutory instruments that implement EC public procurement directives. These regulations ensure that public contracting authorities are transparent about their requirements and do not discriminate unfairly against suppliers of any nationality when selecting those to be invited to tender. Therefore, British woodland owners and timber-processors should have the opportunity to quote for relevant UK and foreign government contracts.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.8/1">Since publishing the Rural White Paper on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-28">28 November 2000</phrase>, we have taken decisive steps in delivering the plans we set out to develop and maintain a living, working, protected and vibrant countryside. We have provided substantial extra funding to boost basic local services such as rural schools, policing, local post offices, childcare and rural transport. To help local services we have extended mandatory 50 per cent rate relief to include sole village public houses, petrol stations and village food shops. We are helping to rejuvenate over 100 market towns by funding projects to stimulate thriving rural economies. Earlier this month we published plans to improve the quality and effectiveness of town and parish councils as part of our commitment to give rural communities a stronger voice. And we have just published the first draft maps for the new rights of access for walkers.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/2">Although alleviating the devastating effects of foot and mouth disease dominated our work for many months, a great deal has been accomplished. But there is still a lot more to be done. The creation of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is bringing a new focus and drive to the Government's policies for rural England. Together with partners, we are working to deliver a better future for all those who live, work in and visit the countryside. We will be publishing a full progress report in December. Our key achievements include:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/3" class="indent">increased funding for rural schools, including the &pound;80 million per year (2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04) Small Schools Fund to help resource sharing, administrative support and adoption of new technology;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/4" class="indent">an additional &pound;15 million in 2000&ndash;01 and &pound;30 million in 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 to tackle the extra cost of policing in rural areas; also the launch of the on-line Rural Crime Toolkit, drawing on examples of good practice in rural policing;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/5" class="indent">a new &pound;2 million fund, now open to applications, to support community-driven projects to refurbish and improve rural sub-post offices&mdash;one part of the Goverment's commitment to maintain a national post office network;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/6" class="indent">help to establish 8,728 new childcare places in the rural counties of Cornwall, Devon, Durham and Lincolnshire in 2000&ndash;01;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/7" class="indent">increased investment in wider health and social services, which is expected to be of particular benefit to people in rural areas&mdash;for example, the programme to establish 100 new primary care one-stop or mobile units, as well as 5,000 intermediate care beds, many in local facilities such as cottage hospitals by 2004. The NHS Direct service, now running throughout England, also offers a major benefit to people living in more remote and rural areas;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/8" class="indent">&pound;62 million to improve rural bus services in 2001&ndash;02, with a total of &pound;239 million allocated over the next three years for new and improved rural travel services;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/9" class="indent">the Housing Corporation exceeded its target of approving 800 affordable homes in rural settlements last year by more than 200 (1,003 approvals), and has increased its target for this year to 1,100 rising to 1,600 by 2003&ndash;04;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/10" class="indent">new Countryside Agency grant schemes in operation: &pound;15 million community service grants fund to help safeguard or re-establish basic village facilities; &pound;15 million parish transport fund for small-scale, locally generated transport solutions; and &pound;5 million parish plans fund to help around 1,000 communities prepare their own village or town plans;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/11" class="indent">new legislation, in force from August, extending 50 per cent mandatory rate relief to village food shops and new small-scale, non-agricultural enterprises on farms. This is additional to extending 50 per cent relief to sole village pubs and petrol stations in April;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/12" class="indent">selection of over 100 towns to benefit from a &pound;100 million market towns regeneration programme, to which the Government have allocated &pound;37 million. Changes have also been made to planning policy guidance on transport (PPG13) to emphasise the role of market towns as hubs for jobs and services;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/13" class="indent">changes made to planning policy guidance on the countryside (PPG7) giving stronger support to farm diversification and clarifying guidance on best and most versatile (BMV) land;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/14" class="indent">publication of a consultation paper on quality parish and town councils, seeking views on plans to give councils an enhanced role for their communities; and</p>
	<p pid="a.46.8/15" class="indent">publication of the Countryside Agency's Policy Maker's Checklist in April, to assist government and their agencies Xrural-proof&quot; policies, now part of the Cabinet Office's rapid policy makers' checklist.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.2/1">The United Kingdom is supplied by two manufacturers of MMR vaccine and by one supplier of rubella vaccine. The cost to the Department of Health of purchasing MMR and rubella vaccines is commercially confidential. However, the list price of a single dose of MMR vaccine is &pound;6.23 for that manufactured by SmithKline Beecham and &pound;9.22 for that manufactured by Aventis Pasteur. The list price for rubella vaccine, manufactured by SmithKline Beecham, is &pound;2.53 per vial. Children are recommended to receive two doses of MMR vaccine. Rubella vaccine is recommended for non-immune women. No licensed single component mumps or measles vaccines are manufactured for or marketed in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/2">Seperate measles, mumps and rubella vaccines in place of MMR have never been recommended by the Government's independent expert advisory committees on immunisation. As a result, no estimates have been made of the cost of giving separate vaccines. Cost is not an issue in decisions over MMR immunisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/1">All regional development agencies (RDAs) are essential partners in implementing the Government's economic and regeneration policy for regional development. As such, they are increasingly involved in promoting the tourism industry. Recent draft RDA corporate planning guidance requires them to liaise with regional tourist boards (RTBs) and co-operate in the production of regional tourism strategies. This co-ordination will ensure that tourism represents a vital, growing element of the regional economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">The nature of RDA support is broad. For example, during the foot and mouth outbreak RDAs have provided assistance to rural businesses, including tourism, through a government funded &pound;74 million recovery fund.

	<p pid="a.56.0/1">The way in which the exceptions made by the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Bill to Parts II to IV of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 will be construed is a matter for the courts. The Government can give no assurance that alters that fact. Nonetheless the points raised by the noble Lord are important ones and bear examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/2">The Government's view is that the selection of candidates falls outside the scope of the Equal Treatment Directive. Our view is that being a Member of Parliament is not an occupation that falls within the scope of the directive. Furthermore, we take the view that the directive does not apply to the electoral process: selection for election is not comparable to normal selection for employment. The principle of proportionality in this respect would not therefore be relevant.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/3">Political parties are, of course, free to take their own legal advice on the point. As with any legislation, particularly where no specific measures are imposed, it is not for the Government to give guarantees that acts done under the legislation are lawful. Ultimately it is for the courts to decide.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/4">It is not clear that the European Convention on Human Rights is engaged. The Government have, however, borne in mind when proceeding with this legislation that the convention could apply and that it might do so because Article 14, along with Article 3 of the First Protocol, is engaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/5">Assuming that the ECHR is engaged, although the Government do not accept that political parties are public authorities for the purposes of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, it is accepted that there is an argument that the convention has horizontal effect, so that the Bill would be interpreted in accordance with convention rights as between private parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/6">Assuming that the convention does have this effect, it will be necessary for any measure adopted by a particular political party to be proportionate in ECHR terms. The Bill is permissive. How a political party will use it is a matter for that party: it is about choice and flexibility. It is inevitable that parties will have to take their own legal advice about whether, and, if so, to what extent, the principle of proportionality applies. This is no different from any other case of permissive, non-prescriptive legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/7">Whether a particular measure chosen by a party is proportionate will ultimately be a matter for the courts to decide and, to the extent that the ECHR may be engaged, we would expect the courts to follow any human rights jurisprudence on proportionality.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/8">As the noble Lord is aware, CEDAW (which relates only to discrimination against women) and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights give rise to international obligations for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/9">The Government regard those obligations with the utmost seriousness. It is clear, however, that international obligations do not become part of domestic law unless incorporated into it. Such international obligations do not in the Government's view give individuals a source of rights and obligations that can be enforced directly before the UK courts. In some instances the courts will construe legislation with the presumption in mind that it should be interpreted compatibly with international obligations, but this is the case only where the legislation is ambiguous. To the extent that these treaties would require the exceptions made by the Bill to be read and given effect in accordance with the principle of proportionality, our view is that it is unlikely that they will add anything further to any other considerations of proportionality.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.5/1">The Mandelkern Group has met five times since March 2001 and at its last meeting on 12-<phrase class="date" code="">13 November</phrase> adopted its final report. This report was presented by the group's chairman, M. Dieudonne Mandelkern, to the Internal Market, Consumer and Tourism Council on <phrase class="date" code="">26 November</phrase> and has been sent to the Presidents of the European Commission, European Parliament and Council of Ministers. I have placed a copy of the report in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/2">The report represents a significant achievement. For the first time, representatives of all 15 member states have signed up to a document setting out in detail the actions that need to be undertaken in order to improve Europe's regulatory environment. It contains a number of concrete, practical recommendations and an action plan with realistic timings. In particular, the action plan asks the Commission to: establish a new, comprehensive impact assessment system, covering all Commission regulatory proposals, by June 2002; establish a central web-based consultation register for all EU consultations by June 2002; adopt a standard minimum 16-week consultation period from March 2002; spearhead a 40 per cent reduction in the volume of Community acts by June 2004, arising from a concerted codification of European legislation by the Institutions; launch a new targeted simplification programme by June 2002 of existing European legislation in all areas; and create throughout the Commission a centrally supported, effective network for better regulation by June 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/3">The Government fully support the Mandelkern Group's report and will be working closely with other member states and the institutions of the EU to seek acceptance and timely implementation of its main recommendations.</p>
