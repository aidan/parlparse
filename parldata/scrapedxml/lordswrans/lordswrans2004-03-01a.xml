	Higher Education: Disabled Students

	<p pid="a.81.4/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.81.4/2" qnum="HL1415">What progress they have made to improve access to higher education for disabled students since the National Audit Office's finding in 2002 that an 18-year-old with a disability or other health problem has a 40 per cent chance of access compared with other students; and what impact they expect their new proposals for higher education funding will have in improving that figure.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-03-01a.81.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="81"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040301/text/40301w01.htm#40301w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.81.5/1">The Government are keen to ensure that students with disabilities receive the best support possible so that they are able to study alongside their fellow students on an equal basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/2">HESA figures for 2001&ndash;02 suggest the proportion of higher education students with self-declared disabilities has grown from 4.6 per cent in 1996&ndash;97 to 6 per cent in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/3">The disabled students' allowances (DSAs) are available to students with disabilities attending or undertaking courses of higher education, who by reason of their disability, incur additional expenditure as a result of their attendance on the course. DSAs are paid in addition to the existing standard support package.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/4">The extension of DSAs to part-time undergraduates and full and part-time postgraduates in 2000&ndash;01, including Open University students, has enabled more students with disabilities to enter higher education. An additional 3,235 DSAs were awarded in 2003&ndash;04 compared to the previous year. Recently, the department has reviewed the administration of the DSA scheme and engaged with representatives from the sector so that disabled students are able to access the scheme more quickly and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/5">We have done much to increase awareness of the financial assistance available to disabled students. The booklet Bridging the Gap: a guide to the Disabled Students' Allowance (DSAs) in Higher Education is specifically for disabled students, with over 180,000 copies available in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/6">The introduction of the new student finance arrangements will assist disabled students in the same way as non-disabled students, in that they will not pay fees up front, and loans will be written off after 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/7">&quot;Aimhigher&quot; aims to increase participation in higher education from under-represented groups. The planning guidance for the new integrated Aimhigher programme, which starts in August 2004, lists disabled students as an under-represented group for whom local partnerships should seek to widen access.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/8">Extra funding has been granted to universities to improve support and facilities for disabled students. Institutions receive HEFCE funding to recruit and support students with disabilities. A total of &pound;10 million is allocated in this way in 2003&ndash;04 within the funding for widening access and improving retention.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/9">Additionally HEFCE is providing &pound;117 million to improve provision for students with special needs, in line with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, and its extension in the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. Funding is available between April 2004 and March 2006 to improve the physical and IT infrastructure for students with disabilities. For example these may include signage for visually impaired, flashing fire alarms and hearing loops, wider doors, ramps, lifts and special IT or other equipment.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.2/1">As at September 2002, 19 per cent of qualified nurses employed in the National Health Service were aged 50 and over. This is in line with the expected age profile of the workforce. Information is not collected centrally on when nurses intend to retire.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">Extending the participation of older staff is a key part of our strategy to meet our workforce targets. The Department of Health is promoting flexible retirement through the Improving Working Lives initiative to encourage nurses to consider alternatives to retiring, such as reducing their commitment or taking on new roles.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">The latest complete information on attrition from nurse training courses relates to the 1997&ndash;98 cohort and was 20 per cent. The Human Resource Performance Framework published in October 2000 sets a target of 13 per cent attrition for students entering nurse training in 2000&ndash;01. Workforce development confederations are working with higher education institutions to ensure that this target is achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.5/1">Ofcom has no direct duties or powers to receive or act on complaints about images of child abuse or other pornographic images shown on the Internet. However, Ofcom has responsibility for approving the industry code for premium rate services, which is administered and enforced by the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS). Ofcom also has the power to enforce breaches of the approved code by imposing fines or ultimately suspending the right to provide services.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/2">The Government believe that co- and self-regulation are more appropriate than statutory regulation of content specific to the Internet. We support the role of the Internet Watch Foundation, which was established by the Internet industry in consultation with the Government. The Internet Watch Foundation works in partnership with Internet service providers, telecommunications companies, mobile operators, software providers, police and Government, to minimise the availability of illegal Internet content, particularly child abuse images. Its Internet hotline deals with reports of potentially illegal Internet content, such as websites, newsgroups and online groups that contain images of child abuse anywhere in the world; adult material that potentially breaches the Obscene Publications Act in the UK; and criminally racist material in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/3">One measure of the success of this self-regulatory approach is that less than 2 per cent of the illegal content reported to the IWF relates to material hosted in the UK.</p>
