	<p pid="a.1.2/1">The findings of the evaluation of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) will be published shortly. The Home Office's comprehensive guidance on ASBOs, issued jointly with the Youth Justice Board and the Association of Chief Police Officers, is being updated and will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">It has been produced following consultation with expert practitioners and key organisations. Practitioners can also access information provided by the TOGETHER campaign in the form of a website, an extensive range of leaflets and a telephone action line offering advice on all aspects of anti-social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">The legislation allows for the terms of an ASBO to be varied or for the order itself to be discharged if circumstances warrant it. It is worth noting that every order is made by a court of law sitting in public and that the court has considered both that the statutory conditions for making the order were fulfilled and that the prohibitions were necessary for the protection of victims, witnesses and the wider community. None the less, we monitor ASBOs and their use on an ongoing basis and adjust policy in response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">We will continue to build on that and extend existing ASBO legislation as appropriate; for example, we recently announced that we would seek to put on a statutory footing the existing good practice, as set out in our comprehensive guidance, that juveniles' ASBOs should be reviewed after one year.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.8/1">I can reassure the noble Lord that no such warning was given. The Ministry of Defence press office returned a call from the lawyer to discuss in principle whether her client, who had been injured in Iraq, could appear on a television programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.8/2">The press office advised that there were two issues of which the lawyer should be aware: first, the policy that all serving service personnel must seek approval from their chain of command before engaging with the media and, secondly, our policy that service personnel undergoing medical treatment must receive consent from their doctor in advance because, in certain circumstances, there could be adverse consequences for their recovery, for example by reliving traumatic experiences in an interview.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.8/3">The explanation of this policy, which is designed to protect patients from media intrusion where it could impact adversely on their recovery, appears to have been completely misconstrued by the lawyer as a threat that there would be consequences for her client's treatment if he spoke to the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.8/4">These facts were explained in full and in advance to the journalist responsible for the &quot;Dispatches&quot; documentary but did not find their way into either the programme or the pre-publicity newspaper reports that preceded it.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.0/24">Decisions on the commissioning of complementary and alternative therapies, including homoeopathy, on the NHS are a matter for primary care trusts and local NHS service providers. The Government consider that decision-making on individual clinical interventions, whether conventional, or complementary or alternative treatments, is a local matter. There are, therefore, no centrally held records of NHS referrals for homoeopathic treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.0/1">The decision not to renew the Department of Health's national contract for distribution of the <i>Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin</i> was informed by our policy to devolve as much responsibility as possible to the National Health Service and to look very critically at central spending. It is our policy that central spending should be kept to an absolute minimum to maximise the resources available for the NHS to manage at local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/2">The decision also took account of the availability of other sources of medicines information. They include the British National Formulary; National Prescribing Centre information and advice, which include coverage of new medicines; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guidance; the wealth of information available through the National Library for Health; and various academic and professional journals. NHS prescribers also have access to advice from the network of local drugs and therapeutics committees and prescribing advisers.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.2/1">Information on where an individual is serving a custodial sentence is not routinely recorded on the police national computer (PNC). When the Home Office, the police service or other authorised parties wish to obtain the current location of a prisoner, they apply to the prisoner location service (PLS), operated by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). Information on the PLS is updated on a 24-hourly basis. The PLS currently deals with 160,000 enquiries per year, 100,000 of which come from the police.</p>
