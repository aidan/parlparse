	<p pid="a.182.6/1">The Commissioner for Children and Young People for Northern Ireland is a non-departmental public body and the commissioner (Nigel Williams) has written to the noble Lord in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.182.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mr Williams to Lord Maginnis</p>
	<p pid="a.182.6/3">I have been asked to provide you with information requested in the above Parliamentary Question.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.6/4">Two general concerns were raised with the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People regarding possible child prostitution involving children's homes in the Sperrin Lakeland and Foyle Trust. The Commissioner took steps to ensure that these concerns were raised with the Trust, the Health and Social Services Board and the PSNI.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.6/5">The Commissioner wrote to every Children's Home in Northern Ireland to identify that the Sexual Offences Act &quot;Risk of Sexual Harm Order&quot; was a new legal resource to tackle this problem and to offer help and support if there was a problem with child prostitution. The Commissioner has also proposed multi-agency training about the use of Risk of Sexual Harm Orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.6/6">In the Armagh and Dungannon area we were told about the possible prostitution of an individual young person who is being looked after by the local Trust. Although it was alleged that there was evidence of child prostitution that evidence was not passed to us, the Trust or the PSNI. To address the specific concerns raised about the individual, the Commissioner appointed an independent social worker to investigate the young person's care by the Trust. There has been no suggestion that the young person is currently being abused in this way and the report concluded that the care plans were both adequate and effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.6/7">The Commissioner has written to all the Area Child Protection Committees drawing their attention to the issue and suggesting multi-agency training to raise awareness and develop ways to tackle the problem. There has been a positive response to this which is currently being following up.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.6/8">The abuse of young people in care by those who target them for sexual exploitation is an issue the Commissioner takes very seriously. The Commissioner has raised the profile of this issue in the media and continues to work in partnership with the Trusts, the PSNI and other voluntary children's bodies to find ways to promote this serious issue.</p>

However that figure will only be a representation of the actual stocks and is likely to fluctuate due to fishing practices and demand.

Taken together, these sources of consumption may bring the overall figure to around 760 GWh.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.2/1">The most recent estimate by the Government's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) is that taken together consumer electronics, home computing equipment, domestic cooking equipment and office equipment in the UK consumed approximately 580&ndash;600 GWh per month while in standby mode.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/2">We are also aware that there is further energy consumption from white goods such as washing machines and dishwashers which are switched on awaiting use or after they have completed their wash cycles; consumer electronic equipment using external power supplies (e.g. domestic portable telephones) that continue to consume energy when plugged in but not in use; and domestic personal computer equipment where the stand-by facilities are not properly enabled. Taken together, these sources of consumption may bring the overall figure to around 760 GWh per month.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/3">In order to try to tackle this problem the Market Transformation Programme (<a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the &quot;on&quot; and the stand-by power consumption of household appliances through the adoption of design improvements, voluntary codes of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets. This approach has been fairly successful in respect of televisions: an EU-wide voluntary agreement will mean that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK now consume around 1 watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&ndash;8 watts consumed by older models. This agreement is currently being extended to cover other consumer electronics.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/4">A similar agreement for external power supplies aims to encourage new power supplies consuming around half a watt in stand-by mode compared to the present average of just over 2 watts.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/5">The recently agreed Framework Directive for the Eco-design of Energy Using Products (EUP),which is expected to come into force later this year will provide a streamlined and effective route for setting EU-wide environmental requirements for traded goods. EUP requires the Commission and member states to treat the issue of standby energy consumption as a priority area for consideration. The UK will work proactively with the Commission and other member states to influence and speed the delivery of measures under EUP</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/6">In addition, the Government's initiative on sustainable procurement, announced in the autumn of 2003, includes a requirement for government departments which purchase computers and televisions to specify low stand by power requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.3/1">The Government take very seriously the need to respect Iraq's cultural heritage. As United Nations Security Council resolution 1546 (June 2004) stressed, all parties need to respect and protect Iraq's archaeological, historical, cultural, and religious heritage. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials are in regular contact with the Iraqi Ministry of Culture. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, (Tessa Jowell), spoke with the former Iraqi Minister of Culture on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January</phrase> and is kept closely informed of key cultural issues in Iraq.</p>

The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will give careful consideration to any further proposals designed to help the cultural reconstruction of Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-12">12 June</phrase> the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) ruled that in the case of Ocalan Vs Turkey the general conditions in which the applicant was being detained at Imrali Prison did not constitute inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the ECHR, and consequently there was no violation of Article 3. The Council of Europe's Commission for Prevention of Torture (CPT) visited Ocalan on Imrali in February 2003 to assess his prison conditions and their report was published along with the Turkish Government's response in February 2004. We have discussed the CPT report and Turkey's response with the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Embassy staff discuss Mr Ocalan's situation with his lawyers as developments arise. We do not intend to ask the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture to re-examine his prison conditions and report at this time.</p>
