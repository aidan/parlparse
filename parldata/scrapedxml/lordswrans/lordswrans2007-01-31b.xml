	<p pid="b.47.2/1">There are currently no plans to update this figure. The Cabinet Office's interim analytical report involved detailed analysis which would not be practical or useful to replicate on an annual basis.

The Government are committed to reviewing the alcohol harm reduction strategy in 2007.</p>

For this reason we think that it is right to retain the reservation as presently worded. The retention of the reservation, however, does not mean that vulnerable children do not have the protection of the UK's own laws. We are satisfied that asylum-seeking children in the UK receive adequate care, protection and support. In addition, domestic legislation also provides protection under the Human Rights Act and the Children Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.26/1">We have not made such an assessment. The economic situation of ordinary Turkish Cypriots has improved significantly over the past five years. However, as the World Bank report on north Cyprus recognises, the economy of north Cyprus remains underdeveloped, with only very limited opportunities to trade with the outside world. This lack of legitimate economic outlets encourages an unhealthy focus on uncontrolled construction, much of it on Greek Cypriot property, and closer integration with the Turkish economy. We therefore support the German presidency's efforts with all concerned to enable preferential trade between north Cyprus and the EU. This will facilitate a settlement by promoting convergence of living standards on the island and by bringing the Turkish Cypriots closer to the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.35/1">The Government expect more than 160,000 households to access home ownership through private or public shared equity schemes by 2010&mdash;doubling original plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.35/2">There are currently three shared equity ownership products:</p>
	<p pid="b.47.35/3">Open Market HomeBuy&mdash;allows the purchaser to choose a home on the open market, which they purchase with the help of an equity loan, alongside a conventional mortgage. Half of the equity loan is provided by their mortgage provider and half by Government. Both equity loans are free from all charges for the first five years;New Build HomeBuy (including the first time buyers initiative)&mdash;helps the purchaser to buy a share in a new build property, while paying rent on the unowned share; andSocial HomeBuy&mdash;enabling local authority and housing association tenants to buy a share in the property in which they currently live, starting at 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.35/4">New Build and Open Market HomeBuy are open to social tenants, those on housing waiting lists, key workers, and other first time buyers identified as priorities by regional housing boards (RHBs).</p>
	<p pid="b.47.35/5">Since October 2006, four mortgage lenders (Halifax, Nationwide and Yorkshire Building Societies and Advantage) have jointly funded equity loans for Open Market HomeBuy. This will enable government funding to help twice as many households.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.80/1">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) does not hold central records of the number of trafficked children given leave to remain in the United Kingdom (UK) and who have been repatriated/removed on reaching the age of 18.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.80/2">However the UK operates a system whereby each case is considered on its own individual merits, and it is recognised that some individuals who may have experienced exploitation at the hands of traffickers will need time to recover and reflect on their position and this is why IND will only take a decision to pursue the repatriation of an individual where it is deemed appropriate to do so. In reaching such a decision consideration will be given to our obligations under the immigration laws and European Convention on Human Rights and the unique circumstances of each case including any outstanding applications or appeals.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.83/1">The IMPACT programme has engaged regularly with potential providers of systems for sharing information between police forces and with partner agencies. This includes firms that have provided intelligence systems. The programme is currently in competitive dialogue under the EU procurement procedures with six suppliers which have been shortlisted for hosting and supporting the IMPACT CRISP solution. The programme plans to hold informal discussions with a selection of potential suppliers of the police national database (PND) in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.83/2">In consultation with a wide range of serving police officers, the programme has been developing a comprehensive, business-led requirements specification for the PND and plans, subject to approval of the project business case, to tender for suppliers under the EU procurement rules. The procurement process will identify the supplier capable of providing best value for money in delivering the PND. The programme is currently reviewing the scope for delivering the PND services incrementally and according to prioritisation criteria in order to deliver functionality as early as possible. The forthcoming engagements with suppliers will allow us to review budget estimates and procurement timescales. We are not aware of any systems currently in operation which would meet the full functional specifications of the PND. However, the specification for the PND will take full account of the need to re-use existing products and services to the greatest extent, consistent with meeting the specification and delivering value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.83/3">The British Transport Police is a member of the joint operational authority established by the IMPACT programme to bring together police forces and other relevant agencies outside the police service in England and Wales, which have an interest in the programme. By the end of March this year the British Transport Police will have access to the IMPACT Nominal Index (INI), giving it access to the names index of 44 million police records provided by the INI and contributing some 800,000 items of data from its own systems. This will assist both the BTP and UK police forces in their work to protect vulnerable children and in investigating serious crime.</p>

In the 2005 sustainable development strategy, the Government stated their ambitious goal to be among the leaders in the EU on sustainable procurement by 2009. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister launched new targets in June 2006 for sustainable operations on the government estate. These include reducing carbon emissions from road vehicles used for government administrative operations by 15 per cent by 2010-11, relative to 2005-06 levels.</p>

These agreements set industry targets without regard to the type of car produced but, in so far as they are stretching targets, they encourage the sale of small cars at the expense of larger ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.143/2">The European Commission is undertaking a review of what might replace these agreements when they expire. The figure of 120g/km average of CO2 per car by 2012 is given in the voluntary agreements as a potential future target. However, we do not yet know whether the forthcoming communication will reconfirm this figure or how it will propose reaching it. We cannot at this stage assess any impacts on the market for vehicles.</p>
