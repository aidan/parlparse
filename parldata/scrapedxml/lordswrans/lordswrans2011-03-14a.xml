	<p pid="a.5.6/1">Revisions to the EU Electronic Communications Framework, including the Universal Services Directive (USD), provide for member states to empower national regulatory authorities (Office of Communications [Ofcom] in the UK) to specify, where appropriate, requirements to ensure that disabled end-users:</p>
	<p pid="a.5.6/2">have access to electronic communications services equivalent to that enjoyed by the majority of end-users; andbenefit from the choice of undertakings and services available to the majority of end-users.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.6/4">In order to fully implement these new provisions, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is proposing to make changes to Section 51 of the Communications Act 2003 to clarify Ofcom's power to impose a general condition in relation to equivalence. This will be in addition to the existing powers Ofcom has under general conditions of entitlement (GC 15) and the Universal Service Order 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.6/5">In addition DCMS continues to analyse responses to the recent government public consultation on proposals to implement the revised framework, including the new Article 23a of the USD, detailed above.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.6/6">At the same time Ofcom is undertaking a review of relay services which support disabled end users in their use of electronic communications. The objective of this review is to assess whether current arrangements for the provision of relay services is adequate in delivering equivalence to voice telephony for hearing and speech-impaired end-users (including British Sign Language users) and, if they are not, to consider proportionate solutions. The formal public consultation element of this review will be launched later this spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.6/7">DCMS's proposed changes to the Communications Act 2003 will enable Ofcom, following the outcome of its review, to mandate the changes it deems appropriate and necessary to ensure that disabled end-users have access to the equivalence and choice required by the revisions to framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.2/1">The UK trade deficit with the rest of the EU in goods and services was worth about &#163;37 billion in 2005, &#163;30 billion in 2006, &#163;35 billion in 2007, &#163;29 billion in 2008 and &#163;27 billion in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/2">To our knowledge, there is no quantifiable estimate on the impact on jobs of the trade deficit between the UK and the rest of the EU.

Both exports and imports are vital to the competitiveness of the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/3">Open markets allow British companies to access cheap and competitive inputs. This is crucial in reducing their costs, upholding their competitiveness and therefore the level of employment when competing both on domestic and foreign markets. Moreover, the pressure of competition from domestic and foreign competitors is a crucial incentive for the efficient use of resources, innovation and investment. These are in turn key drivers of the competitiveness of British firms. On top of benefits for British companies, consumers in the United Kingdom benefit from greater choice and lowering prices. This additional purchase power translates in turn into more consumption of other goods and services produced in the UK, with a positive effect on jobs.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.0/1">The Government greatly value the service all 1990-91 Gulf veterans have given to our country, particularly as we reach the 20th anniversary of the liberation of Kuwait. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the UK service personnel who died as a result of active service during Gulf operations at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/2">The Government recognise that some Gulf veterans are ill and that in some cases this may be due, in some part, to their time in the Gulf. In such cases compensation is available in the form of a war pension, and appropriate medical care is provided by the NHS. As at <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September 2010</phrase>, some 4,790 Gulf veterans were in receipt of an ongoing war pension.</p>

The MAP is available to veterans who have deployed on operations since 1982, and offers comprehensive physical and mental health assessments for veterans who feel that their ill-health may be linked to military service.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.3/1">The UK's bilateral work in Haiti focuses only on humanitarian assistance and disaster risk reduction. We contribute to reconstruction and rehabilitation in Haiti through our share of European Union programmes, as well as through multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and United Nations. These agencies monitor and report on the impact and effectiveness of their programmes, and we use our position on their boards of directors to ensure that the priorities they set help those who need it most. We have been concerned by the pace of implementation since the earthquake, but this is now increasing. For example, the World Bank's disbursement rate in Haiti is considerably higher than in the rest of the world. We continue to encourage the delivery of pledged aid as quickly as possible, but recognise that Haiti remains a difficult environment in which to deliver aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/2">A persistent problem of aid effectiveness in Haiti has been poor aid co-ordination among the many different agencies. The multilaterals supported by the UK work closely with the Government of Haiti and its Interim Commission for Haiti Reconstruction. Lessons are being learned about improving co-ordination, and we will continue to push for greater co-ordination efforts in future. The UK supports the proposed establishment of a Joint Evaluation Support Office in Haiti to share lessons between programmes. To date, the post-earthquake emergency response has been subject to a joint evaluation, but reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes have not.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">When considering earnings towards the minimum salary requirement for tier 2 (intra-company transfer) applications, the UK Border Agency will take account of basic pay excluding overtime and cost of living allowances, but not expenses such as those to cover travel between the source country and the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/3">Sponsors of tier 2 migrants, like all UK employers, must fully comply with national minimum wage legislation and expenses and allowances, other than accommodation allowances up to a specified level, will not normally count towards salary for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/2">The Bill is not expected to have any practical impact on the General Lighthouse Fund because where the general lighthouse authorities take action they should be able to reclaim all the associated costs from the ship owner who has unlimited liability.</p>
