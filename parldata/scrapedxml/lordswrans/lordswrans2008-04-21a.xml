The UK believes that thorough study of the complex technical and legal implications is required and therefore does not consider the issue ready for detailed discussion at the second review conference. But we are willing to examine, with other states party to the convention, the options for taking forward work after the conference, if it appears that consensus on how to move forward seems achievable, and if a suitable mechanism and scope for discussions can be decided.</p>

The UNDP will be conducting a needs assessment mission in the CHT, and the European Community for Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) is doing so in Mizoram, north-eastern India. These assessments will provide the UK Government, as well as donor partners, a basis to consider the scale of the problem and the needs identified. We will then be able to evaluate how best the international community can respond to this crisis, in consultation with both the Governments of Bangladesh and India. Under an agreement with the Government of India, UN agencies and other donors cannot respond to a humanitarian emergency unless formally requested to do so by the Union Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/2" qnum="HL3059">What steps they are taking to address the concerns of retired miners, their widows and families in the British Coal litigation seeking redress against their former solicitors, in the light of the reports of the Legal Services Ombudsman in the case of Enoch Walker recommending that the Legal Complaints Service should re-investigate all complaints arising out of the British Coal litigation which had been rejected either for being out of time or because family members did not have locus standi; and whether the ensuing conduct of the Legal Complaints Service was appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.2/1">Reports by the ombudsman on individual cases are confidential to the parties concerned. It would not be appropriate for the Government to have knowledge of or to comment on individual cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/2">The legal profession is independent and as such complaints about solicitors are a matter for the Law Society rather than the Government. However, the Government believe it is important that miners who complain to the Law Society under the coal health compensation schemes get the level of service and compensation they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/3">It is our understanding that the Legal Complaints Service has received 3,383 complaints to date, of which 2,538 have been closed. This has resulted in excess of &pound;700,000 being recovered for former miners or their relatives. The Government are also pleased to note that, following a request from the LSCC, the Law Society's 08-09 plan includes a target related to the handling of miners' cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/4">Both the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will continue to work with the LCS, the LSCC, the Legal Services Ombudsman (LSO), coalfield MPs and other bodies, to ensure that all claimants under the coal health scheme understand their rights to redress through the LCS where deductions have been made wrongfully from their compensation awards.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/5">The Government have legislated in the Legal Services Act 2007 to create an independent Office for Legal Complaints, which will remove complaints handling from the legal professional bodies.</p>

We aim to announce our response as soon as we have analysed all the options.</p>

However, increasing the exchange between countries of information on sex offenders is one of our key public protection aims. In November 2006, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Republic of Ireland on the exchange of information on sex offenders and are hoping to develop similar arrangements with other states. We have raised the issue of exchanging information on sex offenders in EU discussions and are exploring other opportunities to engage in discussions on this issue with other states.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.5/1">Since the publication of the Polkinghorne Guidelines in 1989 (amended 1995), new statutory frameworks have been put in place to regulate fertility treatment and embryo research and to regulate the use of tissue for research.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.5/2">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 regulates fertility treatments, involving the creation of embryos outside the body, for example in vitro fertilisation (IVF), and the use of donated gametes (sperm and eggs) and embryos, and the use of human embryos in research.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.5/3">The Human Tissue Act 2004 regulates the removal, storage, use and disposal of relevant material for scheduled purposes including research. Relevant material is defined as any material consisting of or including human cells with the exception of gametes, embryos outside the human body and hair and nail from a living person.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.5/4">The Human Tissue Authority has published a code of practice on consent for the use of human tissue for certain purposes including research. The code recognises the sensitivity surrounding the use of foetal tissue for research and says that best practice is to obtain fully informed consent for the use of foetal tissue in research or for other purposes specified in the Human Tissue Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.5/5">Both fertility treatment and embryo research require a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). While the majority of research involves the use of embryos donated by patients who no longer wish to use them in their own treatment, the processes of treatment and research are kept separate. The HFEA's code of practice provides guidance to clinics and research centres about the proper conduct of licensed activities.</p>

Studies in the 1970s demonstrated that on a collagen surface the inner cell mass retains its 3D structure while on plastic it becomes completely flat. It was concluded that the retention of a 3D structure is key to its continuing to develop normally and form a recognisable embryo in vitro.</p>

Band D licence holders are the smallest businesses licensed by the GLA, with turnovers of less than &pound;1 million in the sectors regulated by the authority. Keeping band D licence fee levels unchanged represents a saving in real terms for more than 72 per cent of licence holders. To meet its cost recovery target, the GLA has had to increases fee levels for licence holders in bands A to C.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.0/1">The ongoing Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme is jointly funded by government and industry.

The report can be found on the MTHR website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk/">www.mthr.org.uk/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">MTHR studies found no epidemiological association between short-term mobile telephone use (less than 10 years) and cancers of the brain and nervous system. The report noted that the situation for longer exposure times is less clear and recommended work to assess whether exposure to mobile telephone radiofrequencies in the longer term increases the risk of developing brain and nervous system tumours. A cohort study to investigate a wide range of potential effects including brain cancer is under way at Imperial College, London.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.5/1">There are no provisions in either the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 or the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill that explicitly require that the identity of a clinic at which women are known to have been at risk from life-threatening complications should not be publicly disclosed. However, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has informed the department that it would regard the release of information that could lead to the identification of individual patients as contrary to the confidentiality provisions in Section 33(2)(a) of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.5/2">In 2003 the HFEA introduced an incident alert reporting system. Taking an approach where the name of a clinic reporting an incident is not made public, the HFEA has worked with clinics to encourage greater reporting, particularly of lower risk incidents or those that are &quot;near misses&quot;. This is to ensure that lessons learnt from such events can be circulated to other clinics, so avoiding a repeat elsewhere in the sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.5/1">The UK Government remain concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the number of people who have been displaced from their homes. We have seen the International Organisation for Migration's (IOM) recent assessment that more than 5.1 million people are now displaced, of whom 2.7 million are displaced inside Iraq. The IOM also estimates that more than 75 per cent of internally displaced people do not have access to government food rations, nearly 20 per cent do not have access to clean water and 33 per cent cannot obtain the medicines they require. However, it remains difficult to obtain accurate data on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, and the figures quoted by humanitarian agencies vary. For example, UNHCR has recently reported that the total number of displaced Iraqis is around 4.4 million, of which 2.4 million are displaced inside Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.5/2">Despite uncertainty about exact numbers, it is clear there are humanitarian needs in Iraq that have to be addressed. The Department for International Development is committed to playing its part and is working closely with the IOM, as well as UN agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, to ensure urgent needs are met. In March this year, DfID announced a further &pound;15 million in humanitarian assistance for vulnerable Iraqis, including a &pound;1.5 million contribution to the IOM. This money will support humanitarian operations, including efforts to fill the gaps in the Government's food distribution system, repair water and sanitation structures, and rehabilitate and strengthen health services and facilities. This latest package of support takes DfID's total humanitarian contributions for Iraq to &pound;147 million since 2003.</p>

By registering with UNHCR, refugees obtain improved legal protection in countries that have not signed up to the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention. UNHCR is continuously increasing its outreach efforts to register more Iraqis in countries such as Jordan and Syria. UNHCR also provides food and financial assistance to prevent destitution among the refugees. Other protection measures include UNHCR support to safe houses for victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable women and children in Syria.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.0/1">In 2003, Iraq's 140 major water treatment facilities were operating at about 35 per cent of their design capacity (3 billion litres a day) due to inadequate maintenance, lack of plant operators, power shortages and looting. The international donor community, including the UK, US, World Bank and Japanese, are helping improve the efficiency and reliability of existing treatment facilities and the US has constructed several new facilities, especially in the south where water quality is particularly poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/2">The Department for International Development has committed more than &pound;100 million to infrastructure regeneration projects in Iraq. By May, we will have improved access to water for 1 million people. We have replaced 200 kilometres of water mains, repaired over 5,000 leaks, cleared out 7,000 septic tanks and cleared more than 40 kilometres of drains. We have refurbished a reverse osmosis unit in Basra to supply potable water to about 500,000 people. We have also improved water supply to 60,000 people in al-Amtahiyah, and constructed a water training centre in Basra to increase the skills of Iraqi engineers in water treatment and leakage repair. Finally, we have provided technical advice for a major sewage installation in al-Amarah, providing up to half the city's population with access to a piped system and replacing open sewage channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/3">The US has rehabilitated the Sweet Water Canal system, repairing breaches, cleaning and repairing the main water storage and settling reservoir and refurbishing 14 water treatment plants around Basra city. The UK Royal Engineers have completed a project, funded by DfID, to install low lift pumps to provide a secondary source of domestic water supply to the 2 million population of Basra.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/4">The two World Bank emergency water and sanitation projects in Iraq are being funded through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI)&mdash;a multilateral mechanism made up of two trust funds, one managed by the United Nations and the other by the World Bank. Donors have pledged more than $1.77 billion for reconstruction projects through the IRFFI, of which DfID made a contribution of $127 million in 2004.</p>

Improving the availability and quality of occupational health services are key elements in the strategy's work programme. As an issue that closely affects both departments, ministerial responsibility for the strategy rests jointly with the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health. Ivan Lewis, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, and I lead this work, reporting to our respective Secretaries of State, who have both made clear the importance they place on ensuring that 2008 marks a step change in the way we approach the health of the working age population.</p>

In order to accelerate the deployment of hand-held devices in the police service, the Home Office has made a total of &pound;50 million available, spread over the next three years.

	<p pid="a.264.0/1">Local councils and health trusts are responsible for ensuring that the needs of service users and patients are properly assessed and that those needs are met. To safeguard service users and patients, local councils and the National Health Service are required by law to have formal complaints procedures and to help and assist service users and patients who may wish to make use of them. In the event that anyone is not satisfied with the way their complaint has been dealt with, they are entitled to ask the Local Government Ombudsman to investigate complaints against local councils and the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman to investigate complaints against the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.0/3">The <I>Injustice in Residential Care</I> report, which deals with the failures of Buckinghamshire County Council and the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Mental Health Partnership Trust to provide adequate services to a service user with severe learning disabilities, is the result of the first collaborative investigation between the Local Government Ombudsman and Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman under the new arrangements. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/4">It is important to note that the findings in the report, unacceptable as they are, were focused on the failure by a single council and mental health trust to deliver quality services to an individual service user. We expect the local authority (LA) and the trust to revise their policies to ensure no reoccurrence of these events. It is the responsibility of all LAs and health trusts to identify the required resources from the funding the Government provide, to ensure that they are delivering appropriate services.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.2/1">Since 1997, the Government have introduced a number of financial incentives to encourage eco-friendly behaviour, including reduced VAT rates for the professional installation of energy-saving materials and microgeneration technologies, and the landlords energy saving allowances to encourage private landlords to improve energy efficiency of their properties. Individuals can also take action within their own homes that both reduces their impact on the environment and provides financial benefits by reducing their energy bills. The Government have recently launched the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT), which obliges energy suppliers to install energy efficiency measures and promote reductions in carbon emissions for households. Under the CERT scheme, many energy companies offer free and discounted loft and cavity wall insulation. Further to this, the 2006 Pre-Budget Report announced a stamp duty land tax relief for new zero-carbon homes, and Budget 2008 announced that this incentive would be extended to new flats. Budget 2008 also provided further incentives to choose eco-friendly transportation by announcing significant reform of vehicle excise duty. In addition, the Government have provided funding to support eco-friendly lifestyle, for instance through the low carbon building programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.3/1">The universal service obligation placed on BT by the independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), means that there are special tariff schemes offered to vulnerable customers by the company. Currently these are the light user scheme and In Contact Plus, which are not affected by additional payment charges. The effect on pensioners and people on low incomes of BT's new pricing structure for customers should be mitigated by customers who are eligible moving to the special tariff schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/2">A new special tariff service, BT Basic, to replace the current schemes will be available from mid-2008, offering a low-cost home phone service to those on low incomes and pensioners who are in receipt of certain government benefits. BT Basic will not include an extra charge for consumers who do not pay by direct debit and, in contrast to previous social telephony products, will be available to consumers who have pre-pay mobile phones and/or broadband services.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/3">Ofcom has examined any regulatory concerns about communications providers' additional charges and a report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February 2008</phrase>. Ofcom is currently consulting on introducing new guidance for communications providers who levy additional charges on consumers such as for not paying bills by direct debits. This will spell out Ofcom's view of the law and what providers have to do to meet their obligations under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 to ensure that additional charges are fair and transparent. Once the guidance has been finalised, Ofcom is proposing to give providers three months to comply. Ofcom will then start an enforcement programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/4">Ofcom has used its powers to regulate BT and other providers of communications services for the purpose of consumer protection and to have regard to the needs of pensioners and people on low incomes. Referring the BT pricing structure to the Office of Fair Trading is unnecessary.</p>

The new 73 per cent target for 2009 and 74 per cent for 2010 will also contribute to meeting the ambitions outlined in the 2007 Waste Strategy for England and realise the most efficient CO2 emission savings.</p>

The majority of leakage is comprised of dripping and seeping joints rather than large visible leaks in the street and would therefore require wholesale mains replacement to reduce. A reduction in leakage of this scale would be prohibitively expensive and require a high level of resources that are not available in this timescale.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/3">The leakage targets quoted in Future Water are based on companies performing at their economic level of leakage (where the costs of reducing leakage are balanced against the value of the water saved), and reducing leakage below this level would result in higher bills for customers.
