	<p pid="a.170.5/1">In modernising the National Health Service, we aim to create a patient-centred health service that achieves outcomes that are among the best in the world. The Bill contains the legislative changes necessary to best support this aim; every aspect of the Bill is designed to improve the quality of the care that patients receive, the efficiency of the services that provide them and the accountability of services to their populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.5/2">Patients and the public will be put at the heart of the NHS, giving them more control over their care and a greater say in decisions about health services. Patient choice will stimulate improvements in the quality of health services and improve patient satisfaction with the care that they receive. The Bill supports this by creating HealthWatch at a local and a national level to ensure the patient's voice is no longer lost in the system. The new NHS Commissioning Board will also have a legal duty to promote patient choice in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.5/3">The NHS will focus on what matters most to patients-high-quality care, not narrow process measures, which have damaged patient care. A relentless drive to improve outcomes, supported by a new NHS outcomes framework, will enable health services to deliver better care for patients. The Bill supports this by placing a duty of continuous quality improvement (defined in terms of clinical effectiveness, safety and patient experience) on the Secretary of State, the NHS Commissioning Board and commissioning consortia. In addition, the Bill provides that the Care Quality Commission and Monitor in its new role as economic regulator will ensure safe and robust health services by monitoring, reviewing and reporting on quality and financial issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.5/4">Providers and professionals will be empowered to innovate and drive up the quality of patient care, freeing them from bureaucratic control and making services more directly accountable to patients and communities. The Bill supports this by creating a coherent framework for the NHS that stops political interference in day-to-day decisions and improves accountability by conferring functions directly on the organisations responsible for exercising them. The Secretary of State will retain only those controls necessary to discharge core functions and, instead, transparent institutions-with roles and responsibilities clearly defined in legislation for the first time-will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">When any employee co-operatives or mutuals are going to be awarded the opportunity to supply services to a contracting authority, the arrangement is likely to be viewed as a public contract for services and so will be captured by EU procurement rules unless the specific circumstances mean that the arrangement falls outside the rules or a general exemption applies.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2">There is no specific exemption for social enterprises or employee mutuals, so each procurement involving a &quot;spin out&quot; must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Circumstances where the rules might not apply to employee mutuals could include where there is no market for the services-eg where the services are very specialised and have always previously been carried out by public authorities-or where the mutual remains &quot;in house&quot; for an initial period. Possible exemptions include:</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/3">the award of service concessions;the award of service contracts to joint ventures where the private sector involvement has already been competed; andcircumstances where a mutual that is also a contracting authority has been granted an exclusive right to provide a particular service.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/4">Social enterprises and mutuals are subject to European Union competition rules if they are undertakings for the purposes of those rules. Whether or not social enterprises and mutuals are undertakings will depend on the circumstances and in particular on whether they are engaged in economic activity, offering goods or services on a given market. The EU treaty prohibits anti-competitive agreements, concerted practices or abuses of a dominant position by undertakings that affect trade between member states. Anti-competitive practices are also prohibited by the Competition Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/5">NHS guidance addresses the application of EU and UK procurement law to the procurement of NHS-funded health services and reflects the overarching principles that procurement must be transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory, with equality of treatment for different types of provider and providers from different EU member states. This guidance applies in the same way to the award of new contracts irrespective of whether the provider is an NHS body, social enterprise or other public, private or voluntary sector organisation. The proposals outlined in the Health and Social Care Bill (<phrase class="date" code="2011-01-19">19 January 2011</phrase>) would build on this approach by establishing concurrent powers for Monitor, as economic regulator, to enforce competition law within the health sector in England where this is needed to address conduct that restricts competition against the patient and public interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.2/1">The Government's commitment to deliver up to &#163;20 billion of efficiency improvements will require National Health Service organisations to work together to ensure that patients are not unnecessarily admitted to hospital-for example, through better management of patients with long-term conditions in, or closer to, their own homes. This will be reinforced by the proposed modernisation plans, since by aligning general practitioners' (GPs') clinical decisions with the financial consequences of those decisions there will be a strong incentive to prevent avoidable, expensive emergency admissions to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">In addition to reducing avoidable admissions, there is also scope for further increasing day case rates and reducing lengths of stay for patients who are admitted to hospital. This is a key way in which hospitals can meet the 4 per cent efficiency requirement that is incorporated in the tariff prices that they will receive in 2011-12. It is also supported by the extension of best practice tariffs, which base hospital payments on best and most efficient clinical practice, rather than simply average costs incurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/3">However, hospitals must also ensure that patients are not discharged from hospital inappropriately quickly and, for that reason, from April 2011 hospitals will receive no payment for patients readmitted within 30 days of a previous elective admission.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/4">The avoidance of unnecessary hospital admissions and enabling patients to return home quicker when they are admitted will also be supported by the additional investment to support social care-rising to &#163;2 billion per year by 2014-15-announced in the spending review. This includes funding for reablement, which has shown significant benefits in helping people to regain independence after a crisis and in cutting emergency readmissions to hospital.</p>

Commissioning by general practitioners (GPs) will further strengthen the relationship between patients and the NHS.

	<p pid="a.177.2/15">In 1995, performance data were not matched to any parental socioeconomic information. Therefore, a comparison is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/16">The main reason for the decline in the number of pupils entered for nine or more GCSEs is the increased availability and take-up of equivalent qualifications. If equivalent qualifications are included, a greater proportion of pupils entered nine or more GCSEs or equivalent qualifications in 2010 (83 per cent) than entered for nine or more GCSEs when equivalent qualifications were not counted in 1995 (63 per cent). In 2004, non-academic qualifications were first treated as equivalents to GCSEs for performance tables purposes and included in the calculation of performance indicators.</p>
