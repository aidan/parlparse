This allows for a continuation of the current practice, in line with the Security Council's Rules of Procedure, whereby the presidency can speak at open meetings of the Council. Under the new treaty, the European Foreign Minister, not the presidency, would represent the Union where non-members of the Council are permitted to speak and when the Union has defined a common position on the subject of the meeting.

SEESAC is an asset available not only for south-east Europe but for all organisations conducting SALW initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.3/1">Members of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) met on 9-<phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase> in London. Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States took part in the meeting. The London meeting built on the firm foundations laid during earlier meetings in Madrid, Brisbane and Paris.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/2">The PSI aims to expand capabilities to conduct maritime, aviation and land interdiction operations in order to help counter the threat of WMD proliferation. At the Paris meeting, PSI participants agreed a statement of interdiction principles, outlining the aims and scope of the initiative, and making clear that all action will be in accordance with international law. Following its publication, we have been drawing governments' attention to, and eliciting support for, the statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/3">At the London meeting, we analysed the responses to date. So far the results have been very good: over 50 countries have already expressed support for the PSI. We hope to build on this over the coming weeks and months. WMD proliferation is a global threat: we need to encourage a global response.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/4">The London meeting also agreed a short statement on the focus of the PSI efforts. This makes clear that the initiative does not target any particular country&mdash;there are no blacklists&mdash;but aims to impede and stop trafficking of WMD, their delivery systems and related materials by any state or non-state actor engaged in or supporting WMD proliferation programmes, at any time and in any place.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/5">The PSI is a global initiative with an inclusive mission. It is an activity, not an organisation. Successful interdiction of trafficking in WMD, their delivery systems and related materials requires the widest possible co-operation between states. It was agreed at the London meeting that participation in the PSI should be open to any state or international body that accepts the Paris statement of interdiction principles and makes an effective contribution. Participation will vary with the activity taking place, and the contribution participants could provide. Some countries have particular experience, assets or expertise relevant to all PSI activities; other countries or organisations could be expected to contribute according to their particular capabilities. I hope that we can therefore ensure as wide participation in the initiative as practically possible, including&mdash;where appropriate&mdash;contributions from the EU and NATO.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/6">The London meeting also developed further a series of interdiction training exercises, which will be taken forward over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/7">In short, we have agreed the broad direction of the PSI. We now have to work to fill in the detail. In doing so, we are keen for the PSI to be an open and transparent process. As such, the chairman's summary was agreed as a public document, and is available on the FCO website at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/internationalsecurity">www.fco.gov.uk/internationalsecurity</a>, under the heading &quot;Counter-Proliferation&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">17 June</phrase> we announced the introduction of UK residence permits and in parallel to this the introduction of an entry clearance requirement for all persons who want to stay in the UK for more than six months. The entry clearance requirement is being gradually phased in over a two-year period. The first phase will require nationals of 10 specified countries to obtain entry clearance from <phrase class="date" code="">13 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/2">We have now decided to expand further the scope of the entry clearance requirement in order to streamline procedures for work permit holders. With effect from <phrase class="date" code="">13 November</phrase> all work permit holders and training and work experience scheme (TWES) permit holders who wish to stay in the UK for more than six months should obtain entry clearance before travelling. This will enable these permit holders to be granted their full period of stay in the UK, as stated on their work permit, before they arrive here, saving them from needing to make a further application for stay shortly after arrival.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/3">There will be a grace period for work permit and TWES permit holders until 23.59 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-13">13 January 2004</phrase> to ensure that those who are not aware of these new arrangements are not unduly inconvenienced on arrival in the UK. During this grace period, if a work permit holder arrives in the UK without entry clearance, and would qualify for entry except for the absence of the necessary entry clearance, they will be admitted for a period of six months. During that time they will be able to apply for an extension of stay for a period up to the length of their work permit. This application will not require an accompanying second work permit application to be made by the UK employer.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.2/1">We have today announced new legislative proposals for asylum reform. We are writing to a number of key stakeholders outlining these proposals and inviting comments. Copies of this letter will be placed in the Library and on the IND and DCA websites. The major proposals include: reform of the immigration and asylum appeals system into a single tier of appeal with restricted access to the higher courts; measures to tackle the problem of asylum seekers deliberately destroying or disposing of their documents to make unfounded claims; provisions removing NASS support from families whose claim for asylum has been rejected and enhancing the effectiveness of the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/2">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 has enabled us to make significant progress in reforming the UK's nationality, immigration and asylum systems. In the asylum system this has meant that the number of people claiming asylum has halved, removals are at record levels and the number of claims awaiting an initial decision is at the lowest for a decade. The Government determined that there should be a balanced approach in asylum and immigration policy so that we bear down on those who would seek to enter the UK illegally and who make unfounded asylum claims, while ensuring effective help for refugees who need our protection. Our policy on asylum has to be seen in the wider context of managed migration, through which we are opening up routes for people to enter the UK legally. That is why we are committed to continue reform, as necessary, of the asylum system to ensure that those in need of protection are identified quickly and those who try to exploit the system are prevented from doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/3">We believe that these reforms should be in place as a matter of urgency and will introduce legislation to enact the measures as soon as parliamentary time allows. We are therefore urgently seeking comments from interested parties on the proposals. We would welcome views on the proposals by <phrase class="date" code="">17 November</phrase>.</p>

The non-statutory national framework for personal, social and health education (PSHE), which provides for personal finance education to be taught throughout key stages 1 to 4, allows teachers the flexibility to cover the wide range of topics as set out in the department's Financial Capability through Personal Financial Education guidance for schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.6/1">The Government have a target for at least 3 million pensioner households to be in receipt of pension credit by 2006 (75 per cent of eligible pensioner households). However, we want all those eligible for pension credit to take up their entitlement. That is why we have designed the application process to be straightforward. All pensioners need do is telephone the pension credit application line, where details of their application will be taken. Calls are free apart from some mobiles. The application form is then sent to the customer to check, sign and return.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.6/2">The Pension Service is writing to every pensioner household to tell them about pension credit and to help them decide whether to apply. To support this process we are running a major TV and press advertising campaign. Specific advertising has been targeted at harder to reach groups such as carers and ethnic minorities. These include adverts on black and ethnic minority radio and TV stations, and in ethnic newspapers and magazines. Our local service is working closely with local partners such as Age Concern and Help the Aged to help ensure eligible pensioners take up their entitlement to pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.6/3">All those who apply before October 2004, if they are entitled, will receive payment as though they had claimed at the very start, or to the first day they could have qualified if this is later.</p>

We understand from the police that incidents are reported on a daily basis to them, and we believe that the number of incidents reported may be much smaller than the number of illegal events taking place. Ministers have received many complaints about threats, intimidation and violence associated with illegal hare coursing and a number of police forces have developed strategies to curb the impact of this activity on local communities. The Hunting Bill contains powers to enable the police to intervene effectively in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.11/1">None. The Tobacco Task Force was established in 1997 to advise and support governing bodies affected by the ban on tobacco sponsorship. It was never intended that the task force should become involved in commercial contractual negotiations between sport and possible sponsors. The task force last met in October 1999. My right honourable friend the Minister for Sport wrote to its members in May 2002 to suggest that it be reconvened. He stands ready to offer advice and support to affected sports.</p>
