It is essential that puppies are wormed when they are about two weeks old and then treated at regular intervals until they are at least six months old. Products should be used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and veterinary advice should always be sought before worming puppies or if the owner has any doubt as to the timing, dosage or selection of the appropriate product.</p>

However, in all cases payments are made in full regardless of whether the payment takes place before or after the end of the EU regulatory payment window. Where payments are made after the end of that window, EU funding remains available up to a level equating to 4 per cent of the value of payments made before the end of window. Once that 4 per cent &quot;pot&quot; is exhausted, EU funding may still be available, albeit at reduced levels, depending on how many months after the end of the window the payments are made.</p>

The Identity and Passport Service supports the police, whose responsibility the management of these offenders is, by recording the names of registered sex offenders who have failed to register their current address or other details and for whom an arrest warrant has been issued. At present the IPS has a record of the names of 95 individuals assessed by the Serious and Organised Crime Agency as being high risk offenders.</p>

The police can and do inform their counterparts in the destination country of an offender's intention to travel, where appropriate. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 allows police to seek a court order to prevent a registered sex offender who has offended against children from travelling if there is evidence that he would pose a significant risk of sexual harm by doing so.</p>

	<p pid="b.119.29/1">There are four strands to DfID's work on market-based approaches for the provision of ecosystem services. The first concerns improving the supply of information on emerging markets and payments for ecosystem services. This is done through support to the ecosystems marketplace, a not-for-profit organisation, which provides timely information and guidance, such as that recently published on <I>Voluntary Carbon Markets: A </I><I>b</I><I>usiness </I><I>g</I><I>uide to </I><I>w</I><I>hat </I><I>t</I><I>hey </I><I>a</I><I>re and </I><I>h</I><I>ow </I><I>t</I><I>hey </I><I>w</I><I>ork</I>. Information on the ecosystems marketplace can be found at <a href="http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/index.php">http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/index.php</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.29/2">The second strand of work concerns markets for watershed services. A major piece of work led by the International Institute of Environment and Development (IIED), and funded by DfID, has recently concluded. It has provided the main sources of evidence available on this subject, and has made major contributions to policy development and capacity building in the Caribbean, China, Bolivia, India, Indonesia and South Africa. Details of this work can be found at <a href="http://www.iied.org/NR/forestry/projects/water.html">http://www.iied.org/NR/forestry/projects/water.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.29/3">The third strand relates to the clean development mechanism (CDM). The CDM was established under the Kyoto Protocol as the main market-based instrument for transferring carbon finance and technology to developing countries in support of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. DfID is working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the African Development Bank, to fulfil the commitments under the Nairobi framework for expanding CDM investment in Africa and other less developed countries. We are working to increase the emphasis in these countries on the potential role of carbon finance in supporting sustainable development and access to energy. DfID is also working with academics and the private sector on analysis for developing the CDM further, post-2012 and the end of the current commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, shifting it from a project-based instrument to funding programmes generating emissions reductions in countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.29/4">The final strand of work relates to collaborative research between DfID, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) into how to achieve sustainably managed ecosystems. This work is at the final planning stage. Four regional situation analyses are in progress for the Andes and the Amazon basin, the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Northern India and neighbouring countries, and China.</p>

	<p pid="b.119.41/1">Stem cell research shows great promise for understanding the basic development of different cell types. There have been a number of encouraging preclinical studies and clinical trials with adult and embryonic stem cells. This research is at a very early stage but it does show considerable promise for new therapies. This may include using them to replace damaged or diseased tissue. The studies may also provide the basis for studying diseases if specific cells lines are created. Stem cells may also provide better tests to test research drugs for signs of toxicity, reducing animal studies and improving the safety of drug trials.</p>

The data collected by the department centrally do not identify the average value of a unit of dental activity in each primary care trust (PCT).

	<p pid="b.119.113/1">We recognise that health and safety standards are often poor or non-existent in the artisan and small-scale mining (ASM) sector. The Department for International Development has directly and indirectly supported a number of initiatives to promote health, safety and the environment (HSE) in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.113/2">DfID supports the World Bank-hosted communities and small-scale mining (CASM) initiative. This includes promoting the health and safety of those employed in small-scale mining. For example, CASM has supported training on good mining and processing practices including health and safety in Ghana, Tanzania, Mali, and Zambia.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.113/3">CASM is also supporting the work of several agencies investigating the feasibility of certification schemes, for gold and other metal and mineral resources, that amongst other things, aims to give recognition for the adoption of HSE standards by ASM associations.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.113/4">DfID has directly supported work with ASM communities in Ghana and Tanzania. This included HSE to communicate aspects of occupational and community health and safety directly to ASM communities in their own languages.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.113/5">Together with the United Nations environment programme, the International Council on Mining and Metals and the UN Commission on Trade and Development, DfID supports a website that selects and communicates good practice in mining, including HSE standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.113/6">DfID has been involved with the Global Mercury Project (GMP), which is co-ordinated by the United Nations International Development Organisation (UNIDO). Since 2002 this has demonstrated ways to reduce the use of mercury in gold processing in six countries including Brazil, Sudan, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. This project has introduced environmental and health assessments, alternative gold-processing technologies, training and capacity-building in government and mining communities, and has reduced the hazards posed by mercury use.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.113/7">The EU mercury abatement project, initiated in Ghana in 2005, has developed a new direct smelting method (with no mercury), which has significantly reduced the use of mercury in some ASM areas and is now being demonstrated throughout Ghana.</p>

	<p pid="b.119.116/1">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that the Palestinian Authority (PA) had a fiscal deficit of almost $1 billion in 2006. This was mainly because Israel withheld Palestinian revenues after Hamas won the Palestinian elections in January 2005. Other reasons were a decline in domestic tax revenues as the economy contracted and unsustainable increases in the PA's wage bill in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.116/2">The UK and other members of the international community suspended direct aid to the PA after the formation of the Hamas Government in March 2006, when that Government failed to meet the quartet principles. However, this was offset by increased funding through other channels such as the temporary international mechanism (TIM).</p>
	<p pid="b.119.116/3">The Palestinian Finance Minister, Salam Fayyad, estimates a financial gap of $1.6 billion for 2007. The UK is keen to resume direct funding to the PA as soon as the quartet principles are met, and continues to call on the Israeli Government to release the withheld customs revenues.</p>

The Treasury approves RPA's yearly pay remit and &quot;exceeded&quot; bonuses are then paid as part of the subsequent annual pay award.</p>

Following the Government's decision in response to the SSRB findings, the Cabinet Office sets out the framework within which departments may make pay and bonus awards to SCS staff.

	<p pid="b.119.164/1">The Environment Agency is undertaking a review of abstraction licences that may impact on the integrity of Natura 2000 sites; this work should be completed in 2008. Similar work is being undertaken on abstraction licences that may be damaging sites of special scientific interest in England. The number of abstraction licences that will need to be amended or revoked to meet obligations for Natura 2000 sites and sites of special scientific interest will become clear when this work has been completed.</p>
