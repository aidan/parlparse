Inevitably, this results in some over-flight of built up areas by flights servicing UK airports.

	<p pid="a.106.9/1">Appointments to the Privy Council are made by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Recommendations are made on the basis that the individual concerned is involved in affairs of state or has a close and confidential relationship with the Crown. In practice, this means those who have obtained high office or senior positions in the executive, legislative or the judicial branches of the state either in this country or in one of the countries of which the Queen is head of state. It follows therefore, that most new privy counsellors are serving Ministers, senior parliamentarians or judges. By virtue of the office held, it is not considered necessary to hold details of privy counsellors' qualifications separately. Similarly, there is no independent scrutiny of Privy Council appointees. The only members of the Privy Council who play any active part in the policy work of the council or attend meetings are those who are serving government Ministers. Like all senior parliamentarians, they are directly accountable to Parliament for all their actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.9/2">The only privy counsellor to have resigned from the council during the past 30 years is Jonathan Aitken, who resigned in June 1997 following his abandoned libel action against the<I> Guardian</I> newspaper and Granada Television. The enforced removal of a privy counsellor from membership of the Privy Council has not occurred since 1921, when Sir Edgar Speyer was struck off for collaborating with the Germans during the First World War. Enforced removal would be a matter for the sovereign, acting on the advice of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.9/3">A list of privy counsellors appointed since May 2007 will be deposited in the Library of the House. A full list of all privy counsellors is available on the Privy Council website at <a href="http://www.pco.gov.uk/output/Page76.asp">www.pco.gov.uk/output/Page76.asp</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.8/1">The EU New Car CO2 regulation, adopted in April 2009, sets sales-weighted, fleet average CO2 targets for car manufacturers at the EU level. The regulation requires manufacturers failing to meet their targets to pay an excess emissions premium, which is designed financially to incentivise compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.8/2">Although not directly targeted at meeting the EU targets, the Government are taking a range of actions to support car makers, consumers and other parties in making the transition to a lower-emitting future, which will help the targets to be met. In February 2009 the Government launched the &pound;2.3 billion automotive assistance programme, with the development of green technologies to reduce CO2 emissions as one eligibility criterion. We have made &pound;140 million available for research, development and demonstration of new lower-emitting technologies and vehicles, through the Technology Strategy Board's low carbon vehicle innovation platform.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.8/3">The Government will shortly announce details of how the &pound;230 million consumer incentive to reduce the up-front cost of purchasing an electric or plug-in hybrid will operate. Consumers are also encouraged to purchase low-emitting vehicles through the taxation system, notably through the structures of VED, company car tax and enhanced capital allowances.</p>
