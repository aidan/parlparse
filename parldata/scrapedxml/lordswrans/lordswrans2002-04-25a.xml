	<p pid="a.47.0/2">It is not part of the board's role, nor is it intended to be, to advise individual departments on the management of their assets. Consequently, the issue of the Privy Council silver collection was not discussed by the board.</p>

The manual does not define antiques because those, which are not encompassed by the definition of a heritage asset, are accounted for in the same way as fixed assets generally. The manual is available in the Library of the House and on the Internet.</p>

These orders will include at least one affirmative resolution order. This timetable is subject to the directive being adopted during the summer/early autumn. If there are significant delays in Europe&mdash;which we do not expect&mdash;then there is a possibility that legislation would be delayed. If this delay was significant, the Government would look again at the strategy of dovetailing regulation of LTCI with implementation of the directive.</p>

The emphasis given to maintaining physical fitness and the different healthcare arrangements provided for Armed Forces personnel during their career are additional examples of why such a comparison can be misleading. It is for these reasons that an era comparison group of UK service personnel was identified with whom the health of Gulf veterans is compared by the Ministry of Defence.

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">In national parks, proposals to install telecommunications masts are for the national park authorities to determine in the first instance, taking account of local planning policies and national planning policy guidance. Current planning guidance on telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 8 (revised) (PPG8). Advice on development in national parks is given in PPG7&mdash;The Countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">Protection from visual intrusion and the implications for subsequent network development will be important considerations in determining applications for telecommunications development. The Government are particularly concerned to ensure that the special landscapes and scenic beauty for which national parks have been designated are adequately protected. They are also concerned to ensure the economic and social well-being of the communities in national parks, in which the provision of modern telecommunications has a potentially vital role to play. Telecommunications development in national parks should be sensitively designed and sited and should blend into the landscape as far as possible. The developer must also demonstrate that there are no suitable alternative locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">The mobile phone industry has pledged to provide local planning authorities with annual roll-out plans for each authority's area. We strongly encourage the use of pre-rollout discussions based upon these plans and collaboration between the operators and authorities as a means of overcoming potential technical and environmental constraints, particularly in national parks and other designated areas. These discussions should also provide an early opportunity to explore possible alternative approaches, particularly the opportunities for mast and site sharing and also in terms of the location and alternative design of the apparatus.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.5/1">Most congestion is caused by the delays vehicles impose on each other when using the network at the same time or by temporary reductions in road capacity, for example from road works or accidents. Measures in the 10-year plan are aimed at improving capacity on the most congested parts of the network and at encouraging users away from them. Improvements to selected parts of the road network will improve traffic flows.</p>

In addition, the new regime introduces a sheep national envelope which can be used to provide extra support to sheep producers and to encourage environmentally sustainable farming practices. Member states may increase the size of their national envelope by reducing sheep annual premium payments by up to 1 euro per eligible animal. Using these provisions, the Government could increase or reduce the basic rate of the sheep annual premium by up to 1 euro (approximately 62p).

	<p pid="a.59.5/3">It is generally accepted by United Kingdom clinicians that recombinant and plasma derived clotting factors are equally effective in treating clotting disorders. In guidelines produced by the United Kingdom Haemophilia Doctors Organisation, comparisons between the two types of product revolve around their relative safety, bearing in mind that no medicinal product can ever be completely free from risk. An advantage of recombinant products, where they are entirely free of human albumin, is that they eliminate the risk from blood borne viruses and the theoretical risk from vCJD. However, plasma derived clotting factors are tightly regulated by European and United States authorities to minimise the risk of viral transmission. This is achieved by the screening of donor blood and the anti-viral measures taken during manufacture. By ceasing to use UK plasma in the manufacture of blood products, the Government have already taken steps to reduce the unknown risks from vCJD.</p>
