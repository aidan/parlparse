There are currently 13 chaplains deployed to Afghanistan as well as a number of mental health professionals, all of whom can provide advice as required. If a commander becomes aware that there is specific marital issue the unit rear party can be advised in order to assist the family at home. In particularly serious cases, commanders have the discretion to grant compassionate leave to send a service person home in order to assist in resolving marital difficulties, but any such decision has to be balanced against operational imperatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.6/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/2"><I>Letter from Jil Matheson, National Statistician, to Lord Laird, dated October 2009.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/3">Further to my predecessor's letter to you of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-14">14 July</phrase>, as the new National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary questions asking i) why providing options for Christian denominations in the 2011 Census would not enable comparability with the 2001 Census figures; ii) what duties in relation to religious affiliation need to be fulfilled by public authorities under the Race Relations Act 1976; iii) what are the extra Welsh religious categories that would be required were there a question on Christian denominations; iv) whether religions other than Christianity have difficulty with their single question; and v) what form of equality monitoring and service planning users of Census statistics undertake in relation to Christians and Buddhists. (HL5953)</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/4">i) An expanded religion question would be likely to affect comparability with the 2001 Census data due to the different way that the question may be interpreted and answered. Testing of a religion question with expanded Christian denominations showed that some people thought of the new question in terms of religious practice rather than religious affiliation (which is the concept we are trying to measure) because of the specific tick-boxes for denominations, and there was evidence that some people chose 'No religion' when they would otherwise have picked 'Christian'.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/5">In addition, if detailed Christian options were provided the lack of space on the questionnaire would require a double-banked format of the question where tick-boxes were listed side by side in two columns rather than in a longer list. Such questions are normally avoided where possible because the tick-boxes on the right, in this case the Christian denominations, frequently get missed by respondents. However, encouraging respondents to notice the Christian breakdown boxes could have the unintended effect of drawing respondents' attention away from the remaining religion tick-boxes and making them less visible. This could lead to incomplete and incorrect data and a possible undercount for the remaining religions.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/6">These and other concerns about including an expanded religion question are set out in an information paper which details the religion question development which led to the final recommendations for the 2011 Census. This is available on the website:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/7"><a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations-for-2011/index.html">http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations-for-2011/index.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/8">ii) Respondents to the Office for National Statistics 2007 consultation on user requirements for information on ethnicity, identity, language and religion from the 2011 Census emphasised the use of religion data to enable better understanding of the social and economic position of different religious and ethnic groups, and to help to identify cases of social exclusion. This information would be used to inform policy development and monitoring and enable public bodies to meet their statutory obligations under the Race Relations Act and other equality legislation. The Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000) (the Act) gives public authorities a general duty to promote race equality. The duty means that, in everything they do, public authorities should aim to:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/9">eliminate unlawful racial discrimination;promote equality of opportunity; andpromote good relations between people of different racial groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/10">The Act gives public authorities a general duty to monitor policy and service delivery for different ethnic groups. Definitions of what constitutes an &quot;ethnic group&quot; are subject to much discussion. This is because membership of any ethnic group is something that is subjectively meaningful to the person concerned, and can be based upon a combination of categories such as country of birth, nationality, language, skin colour, national/geographical origin, racial group and religion.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/11">Although the ethnic group question was designed to capture information relevant to the Race Relations Act including colour and ethnic and national origins other concepts or groups relevant to this Act and other pieces of legislation may be captured more easily with other questions creating a suite of ethnicity questions including country of birth, citizenship, national identity, religion and language. For this reason, when prioritising groups for inclusion as new categories in the ethnic group question we considered whether one or more other Census questions provided similar information to an ethnic group tick-box, (in which case there would be less need to include this tick-box in the ethnic group question).</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/12">For some ethnic minorities, religion is one of the important defining characteristics and for this reason a question on religion was first included on the 2001 Census. Since the 2001 Census a number of laws to protect religious freedom have been passed, including the freedom to have no religion or belief. The Employment Equality (Religion and Belief) Act 2003 places a duty on all local authorities to monitor employment practices and to address the needs of religious groups. Other laws include the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 and the Equality Act 2006. One of the main needs for religion data expressed by users was to assist legal obligations to prevent discrimination and promote equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/13">iii) The different Christian categories which would be required in Wales were there an expanded religion question have not been ascertained from Census users. However they are likely to include non-conformist chapels such as Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists and Methodists since, in Wales, their memberships are higher than those of the Anglican or Catholic Churches.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/14">iv) Some Census users expressed a requirement for information that would break down the Muslim category but there is no evidence of difficulty with a single category for religions other than Christianity.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.6/15">v) It is not possible to comment on what form of equality monitoring and service planning that users of Census statistics may undertake in relation to Christian and Buddhists&mdash;respondents to our consultations generally articulated their need for religion data in general rather than with reference to specific groups.

Ministers have apologised to the House for those past issues. Subsequent improvement in RPA's performance has been evidenced by the significant speeding up of SPS payments to farmers. The successful negotiation and implementation of the new EU scheme rules arising from the CAP health check last year also signifies an increased capacity to manage change. But, as highlighted in the NAO report, costs are still too high and work to recover overpayments has been proved more difficult than anticipated. Those are some of the drivers for the current review of the RPA that the department announced in September which will seek to identify where the agency may be able to make further improvements and efficiencies in its activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.5/1">One of the key objectives of the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Women Councillors' Taskforce programme was to ensure that a diverse range of delegates from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and communities were able to participate and attend the outreach awareness raising events. Overall 53 per cent of people who attended the BAME outreach events provided details about their ethnic background. Of those that responded, 4 per cent reported being from the &quot;other ethnic group&quot;, and of these, two respondents (0.4 per cent) reported being from the Gypsy and Traveller community. We have no information on the ethnic background of the remainder of people who were at these events and did not complete a feedback form (47 per cent of attendees).</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/2">The outreach events were promoted widely and included engagement with the Department for Communities and Local Government as well as organisations and networks with links to the Gypsy and Traveller community such as Voice 4 Change and the Travellers Advocacy Service. Two women from the Gypsy and Traveller community who attended the Leicester outreach event were also invited to participate in the follow up evaluation which took place on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-10">Thursday 10 September 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.5/3">On two occasions the Government Equalities Office also approached a speaker from the Gypsy and Traveller community to speak at the outreach events, but she was unable to participate.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.9/1">In October 2004, in response to an increase in tuberculosis (TB), the Chief Medical Officer published an action plan, &quot;Stopping Tuberculosis in England&quot;, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library. Work is underway to implement the 10 actions considered essential to bring TB under control.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.9/2">The plan outlined four measures of success:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.9/3">a progressive decline in rates of TB in population groups born in England. Data from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) indicate that while rates in these groups have not decreased, they have remained stable at four per 100,000 population between 2002-07 (latest data);a reduction in the incidence of disease among people who entered the country and became resident here within the previous five years. TB data collected by the HPA report only rates of TB among non-United Kingdom born people, and those rates for the years 2002-07 have been 88, 92, 96, 102, 94 and 87 per 100,000 population. The department did not expect an immediate decline in rates because of improved TB detection following implementation of the TB action plan; no more than 7 per cent of new cases resistant to the anti-TB drug isoniazid and two per cent multidrug resistant. HPA data show 6.8 per cent of cases were resistant to isoniazid, and 1.2 per cent were multidrug resistant; anda reduction in the number of human cases of bovine TB in people under age of 35 years born in the UK. HPA data from 2002-07 show the numbers of case per year in England as 17, 15, 14, 24, 26, and 23, with the peak in 2005-06 due to an unusual cluster outbreak in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.9/4">The strategy to effective TB control is awareness and early detection and completion of treatment, and key actions taken by the department to provide the National Health Service with the tools to improve services include: local awareness raising through funding to TB Alert; the TB Toolkit for commissioners; the Find and Treat pilot in London to actively find cases among hard to reach groups; the provision of free TB drugs for all patients and a more targeted Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin vaccination programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">No. The prison population has no direct impact on case management. Nor does it impact on whether an offender should be found guilty or not guilty, which is the matter for the jury.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">However, the Criminal Procedure Rules provide a framework for managing criminal cases. Within that framework the management of individual cases is a matter for the judiciary taking account of custody time limits set by the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. Listing guidance laid down by the judiciary highlights the importance of minimising time spent on remand by those waiting trial or sentence.</p>
