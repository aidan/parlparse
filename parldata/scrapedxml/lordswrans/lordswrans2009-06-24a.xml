	<p pid="a.277.5/1"><I>World Class Apprenticeships: Unlocking Talent, Building Skills for All</I>, published in January 2008, assessed the distribution of the benefits of apprenticeships among the black and minority ethnic (BME) population, disabled people and women. This assessment found that not everyone benefited equally from the opportunities offered by apprenticeships: the 2005 apprenticeships pay survey found a 40 per cent average pay differential between male and female apprentices and found that BME young people were underrepresented in the programme. Through <I>W</I><I>orld</I><I> C</I><I>lass </I><I>A</I><I>pprenticeship</I><I>s</I>, the Government committed to addressing these inequalities and outlined specific measures that would be taken to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.5/2">In 2008, the Learning and Skills Council commissioned research by BMG Research, using a survey of apprentices, into the benefits of completing an apprenticeship. This research concluded that apprenticeships do not particularly nor generally fail any major group of apprentices who complete the programme, but showed a clear gender bias in participation in sectors where this would be expected from the labour force in general. While the apprenticeship experience appears a little more positive for BME apprentices in terms of motivation and confidence, BME apprentices are less likely to have employed status and more likely to have returned to learning. The results of this research were published in February 2009, and a copy of the report will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.5/3">The National Apprenticeship Service has commissioned research by the Institute of Employment Studies to help shape this pilot work. This will determine the most severe areas of under-representation and what lessons can be learnt from existing projects aiming to address inequality. The final research report is due to be published at the end of June 2009, after which providers will be invited to take part in a number of pilots to help address inequality in apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.2/1">The UK has one of the most robust arms export licensing regimes in the world. All export licence applications, including any for Sri Lanka, are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria (which incorporates the EU Code of Conduct). Assessments of applications take account of all available information at the time of the application, including information about the situation in the receiving country, the capability and stated end use of the goods, and the past behaviour of the end user. Licences will not be issued if the proposed exports would be inconsistent with any of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. In particular, a licence will not be issued if there is a clear risk that the goods would be used for internal repression, would provoke or prolong armed conflict or would aggravate existing tensions within the recipient country. Consequently, the UK has fully observed the code of conduct for all destinations, including Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/2">Individual EU member states are responsible for observing the code of conduct. I am unable to comment on the actions of other member states in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/3">The Government continue to be very concerned by the internal situation in Sri Lanka, both in terms of the recent conflict and the human rights situation, which is inextricably linked to it. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely. All export licence applications for military and dual use equipment will continue to be rigorously scrutinised on a case by case basis and a licence will not be issued if to do so would be inconsistent with the consolidated criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is currently carrying out an internal review of the work capability assessment, introduced in October 2008. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the new assessment is accurately identifying those individuals who are incapable of work related activity, those who are currently unfit for work but would benefit from support and an eventual return to work, and those that, despite their condition, are fit to continue work at that time. It is also considering how the assessment might be modified to account for an individual's adaptation to their condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/2">A copy of the terms of reference for the review has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/3">This review is chaired by officials in the department and involves representatives from the fields of physical disability, mental function, disability assessment and occupational health, as well as representatives of disability groups and employers. This includes participation from representatives of:</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/4">Atos Healthcare;Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development;Citizens Advice Bureau;Disability Benefits Consortium;Disability Employment Advisory Council;Mencap;Mind;National Autistic Society;Neurological Disability and Rehab Medicine;Occupational Medicine;Occupational Psychiatry;Parkinson's Disease Society;Royal College of Psychiatrists;RNIB;RNID;RSI Action;Social Security Advisory Committee; andTribunal Service</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/5">There are no practicing occupational therapists taking part in the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/6">As a result of the review, the department will produce recommendations to Ministers on possible enhancements to the work capability assessment. If changes are made to account for adaptation, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of people considered able to look for a range of jobs straight away and thus be eligible for jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/7">We plan to finish the review in the summer, and its findings and proposals will be reported shortly afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/8">The department is also committed to an annual independent review of the work capability assessment. This statutory and ongoing requirement&mdash;set out in the Welfare Reform Act 2007&mdash;is focused specifically on the operation of the assessment against Sections 8 and 9 of the Act; that is the assessments of limited capability for work and limited capability for work related activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/9">The internal review is a one-off technical evaluation of the criteria involved in assessing entitlement to ESA. It is normal that the department evaluates new policy initiatives in this way. The independent review is an ongoing annual requirement to allow parliamentary scrutiny of the effectiveness of the policy in meeting its stated aims. While the reviews will inevitably cover some of the same ground, the nature of review activity may be different.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.0/1">The criterion for awarding senior civil servants (SCS) with performance related pay awards is set by the Prime Minister following independent advice from the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB). The level of payments takes into account a number of factors including individual performance against agreed priority business objectives and targets. Performance-related pay awards reward and provide incentives for in-year delivery of key results. Over the three years of SR 04 the Home Office met all its PSA objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/2">For the 2007-08 reporting year, 127 SCS staff in the Home Office and its agencies received a non-consolidated performance pay awards; the total amount spent on these bonuses was &pound;1,246,000. Bonuses were awarded to 75 per cent of Home Office SCS staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/3">For the 2006-07 reporting year, 158 SCS staff in the Home Office and its agencies (including SCS staff who moved as part of the machinery of government change to Ministry of Justice) received a non-consolidated performance pay awards; the total amount spent on these bonuses was &pound;1,513,209. Bonuses were awarded to 62.5 per cent of Home Office SCS staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/4">Breakdowns of non-consolidated performance pay awards by pay band and award type are given in the attached tables.</p>

The Electoral Commission has issued guidance on the procedure which local returning officers should follow for recounts. This includes advising local returning officers to consult the regional returning officer if a recount is required. There is no statutory provision for recounts to take place at regional levels. Under the terms of Section 5 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the Electoral Commission must prepare and publish a report on the administration of European parliamentary elections in the UK.

	<p pid="a.292.5/1">The Government have no plans to cut prison medical services. We have invested &pound;201.4 million for 2009-10. This has been supplemented by the National Offender Management Service which has invested &pound;7.6 million year to date. Together these allocations form the baseline for offender healthcare funding. As with wider PCT allocations, these funds are subject to local commissioning and service provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.5/2">For 2010-11 the department plans to invest &pound;206.8 million, which represents a 2.7 per cent uplift on the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.5/3">Work is currently underway to ensure the department's investment in offender health is mainstreamed to form part of PCT baseline allocations from 2011 onwards.</p>

There are also no current plans to reduce prison education programmes in future years.</p>
