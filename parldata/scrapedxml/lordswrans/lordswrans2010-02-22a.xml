	<p pid="a.169.2/1">The integrity of the operational honours system is paramount and British gallantry medals are highly respected. While honours are considered on a case-by-case basis and awarded according to individual merit, commanders are guided by a flexible quota system based on the number of people deployed on each mission and the intensity of combat. Gallantry awards recognise the bravest of the brave and are only given in extraordinary circumstances, therefore, their numbers will be limited. These decisions are outside of ministerial remit, but I understand there are no plans to change the current system.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.2/1">I agree that the extraordinary cost of armed conflict in Africa severely hampers development. This is why HMG have steadily increased, over the past decade, the amount of their budget allocated to resolving and preventing conflict in Africa. The Department for International Development's (DfID's) 2009 White Paper, <I>Eliminating World Poverty: Building our Common Future</I>, set building peaceful states and societies as one of its key objectives. The White Paper pledges to allocate at least 50 per cent of its new bilateral funding to fragile countries and those affected by conflict and triple its direct project funding for security and justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/2">Conflicts in Africa can only be managed and resolved in a sustainable manner by people and institutions on the continent, so HMG continue their support for African conflict prevention and resolution capability. HMG also seek an international treaty to regulate the arms trade, one of the key elements in reducing the flow of small arms in Africa. The UK has played a lead role internationally in arguing for an arms trade treaty (ATT). We are committed to working for a strong and transparent ATT over the next two years. We very much welcome the UN's approval of the ATT resolution which, for the first time, sets a clear timetable for negotiation of a treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October 2008</phrase> the FSA announced that the UK branch of Landsbanki was in default for the purposes of the FSCS. The Chancellor announced that all retail depositors with the UK branch of Landsbanki would receive their money in full. In taking this action the Government had several objectives including maintaining financial stability and the interests of taxpayer protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2">In November 2008 the FSCS began the payout of compensation to UK depositors, which consisted of three elements:</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/3">(i) under the EC Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive, deposits up to &#163;16,872, which should be paid by the Icelandic Dpeositors and Investors Guarantee Fund (DIGF);(ii) FSCS eligible deposits above &#163;16,872 and below &#163;50,000 paid by the FSCS; and(iii) balances above &#163;50,000 paid by HMT.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/4">In total, around &#163;4.5 billion has been paid. It is estimated that this includes &#163;2.35 billion that the UK Government paid out to depositors on behalf of the DIGF, &#163;1.4 billion paid out by the FSCS for deposits above &#8364;20,887 and below &#163;50,000, and &#163;800 million paid out by the UK Government in respect of deposits above &#163;50,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/5">On payout to a depositor, the claim of that depositor against Landsbanki is transferred to the FSCS. However, HMT has a contractual right to recover from the FSCS recoveries referable to the HMT portion (that is, payments to deposits above &#163;50,000). The rights that relate to the depositors' claims of no more than &#163;16,872 will be transferred to the DIGF. However, any such transfer will only take effect upon the coming into force of the &quot;Icesave Refinancing Loan Agreement&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/6">Information provided by the Resolution Committee for Landsbanki indicates that the FSCS and HM Treasury will make significant recoveries of the compensation paid to depositors through the winding up of Landsbanki.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/7">In relation to the compensation paid out on behalf of the DIGF, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-05">5 June 2009</phrase>, the UK Government reached agreement with the Icelandic authorities on a process to ensure the UK is refunded. The terms of the loan arrangements are set out in my letter to the House of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-13">13 January</phrase> (<I>WA154</I>). They include a state guarantee which, under Icelandic law, must be authorised by the Icelandic Parliament in order to take effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/8">A Bill was passed in August to this effect but with a number of conditions introduced by the Icelandic Parliament. Following further negotiations, the loan agreement was amended to take account of these conditions. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-30">30 December</phrase>, the Parliament in Iceland endorsed the loan arrangement and agreed a state guarantee. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-05">5 January 2010</phrase> the Icelandic President announced that he would not sign the Bill that the Parliament had approved, and instead proposed a referendum. A referendum has been scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-06">6 March 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/9">The UK Government have received assurances from the Icelandic Government that they remain committed to meeting their obligations and intend to repay the loan in full.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.2/1">Child benefit and child tax credit is intended to help families in the UK. Generally, therefore, it is not payable in respect of children resident outside the UK. However, under EC co-ordinating regulations on social security for migrant workers and their families, which the UK has administered since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973, a European economic area (EEA) national working in one member state can claim family benefits (child tax credit together with child benefit) in that member state in respect of members of their family resident in other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">All claims for family benefits are subject to a wide range of checks throughout the life of each claim.

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">The powers of examination contained in Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000 are an important tool in countering terrorism. Terrorists often need to travel across borders to plan, prepare and initiate their acts and these powers are essential in helping to identify those individuals. The powers within Schedule 7 allow officers to take biometric material in order to determine if someone is, or has been, involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/2">Nationally, from the introduction of the Terrorism Act up to <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December 2009</phrase>, fingerprints and DNA samples have been taken under Schedule 7 on approximately 1,200 occasions. I am advised that there have been three individuals who are known to have applied for the samples to be destroyed under the exceptional case procedure. However, as applications are made to individual forces, it is possible that some cases have not been reported centrally. Of these three individuals, two sets of samples have been destroyed and the third case is still under consideration. These cases have taken between six and 12 months to complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/3">ECHR 1581, and following pubic consultation in May 2009, the Government laid the Crime and Security Bill before Parliament. It contains provisions that would establish a clear statutory framework for the retention, destruction and use of biometric material, including DNA samples, DNA profiles and fingerprints. They strike a proper balance between protecting the pubic from the threat posed by terrorism and other threats to national security and upholding individuals' rights and liberties.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/4">Furthermore, the powers contained in Schedule 7 are kept under scrutiny by the noble Lord Carlile of Berriew, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. He has regularly reviewed and made recommendations as to the use of these powers but has consistently found the powers to be necessary and proportionate.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.2/1">There are no figures held centrally on the number of CCTV cameras in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">CCTV is most effective when used alongside other measures. CCTV can assist in the detection of crime in public places, provide evidential material in identifying offenders and help in bringing them to justice. A recent report by the Campbell Crime and Justice Group: (<a href="http://db.c2admin.org/doc-pdf/Welsh_CCTV_review.pdf">http://db.c2admin.org/doc-pdf/Welsh_CCTV_review.pdf</a>) which includes UK membership and whose review was part-funded by the Home Office, included the observation that CCTV is more effective in reducing crime in the UK than in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/3">The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) and Cheshire Constabulary are conducting a qualitative analysis of recorded crime data and case files in Cheshire to determine the value of CCTV to investigations carried out in that police force area. This work will be used to assist in further consideration of the criteria that should be applied in other areas of England and Wales by police, local authorities and others in assessing the contribution of CCTV to crime detection, crime reduction and public confidence.</p>

While RDAs take account of community cohesion issues, RDAs do not record expenditure according to community cohesion as a category of corporate spending.

The analysis carried out for the report did not split violence against the person offences into those with or without injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.5/4">The estimate of 23 per cent relates to an estimated effect in the first year of operation of the NCRS. No similar estimate was made for subsequent years as changes continued to be bedded in. However, the Audit Commission undertook substantial audit work on crime recording in the years following NCRS introduction up until 2006-07, this indicating a generally increasing level of NCRS compliance across forces. Furthermore, it is known that some forces had taken steps to make their recording of crime more victim-oriented prior to the formal introduction of NCRS.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/1">The visa letter is a paper document given by the Tier 4 sponsor to the student. A Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) is a virtual document, similar to a database record. Sponsors complete an IT-based process that results in the assignment of a unique reference number. A CAS, which replaces the visa letter, cannot be forged and cannot be tampered with. This is a security feature to further reduce the potential for abuse of Tier 4. As all students require a passport to apply for leave under Tier 4, either overseas or in the UK, it is not unreasonable for this information to be entered on the CAS.

	<p pid="a.215.2/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised that it has a record of two individuals approaching the previous chief executive with a public interest disclosure. These individuals were not members of HFEA staff and, therefore, were not covered by the document referred to in my Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-08">8 February</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-02-08.81"><I>Official Report</I>, col. WA 81-2</phrase>). One approach followed an HFEA inspection and resulted in the individual meeting with members of the HFEA Executive. The outcome was an unannounced inspection and subsequent consideration by a HFEA licence committee. The other disclosure was anonymous, so it was not possible to pursue in the same way. The HFEA has also advised that it is unable to provide any information regarding disclosures which may have been made to all other chief executives since 1991.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.2/2">The HFEA has advised that of the five cases of misconduct mentioned in my Written Answer, four were unauthorised absence and one was misuse of email. One person was charged with misconduct in each of these cases. One case resulted in an oral warning, two cases resulted in the individual leaving the employment of the HFEA and in the two remaining cases, where the individuals involved appealed the findings of the misconduct inquiries, their appeal was upheld. Those concerned were employed for periods ranging from five months to three years and six months. The HFEA is of the view that it is not appropriate to provide further detail on these cases, due to the risk of identification of those involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.2/3">The HFEA has advised that providing information on the number and nature of licence conditions or other sanctions, requested by the noble Lord, would involve scrutinising every licence issued since 1991 and cross-referring to licence committee minutes, inspection reports, incident reports and press cuttings.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.2/1">The UK tax system differentiates between listed and unlisted shares for tax purposes. One of the qualifying conditions for the eligibility of shares for ISA tax relief is that they must be listed on a recognised stock exchange.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/2">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) now generally uses the term &quot;admitted to trading on an EU Regulated Market under Title III of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)&quot;, to determine which securities would meet the HMRC definition of &quot;listed&quot;. AIM is not an EU regulated market under Title III of MiFID, and so shares traded on it do not meet that definition.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/3">No estimate is currently available for the cost to the Exchequer of permitting AIM shares to be eligible for ISA tax relief, given the wider considerations noted below.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/4">To enable AIM-listed shares to be included within an ISA, the Government have to amend the ISA regulations. In doing so, the Government would have to consider the risk to ISA investors of allowing not only shares held on AIM, but potentially all other secondary markets worldwide, to be eligible for ISA tax relief. The Government would also have to review the wider tax reliefs currently available to AIM-listed shares, which would mean reconsidering advantageous treatment for AIM shares around inheritance tax, and access to the enterprise investment scheme (EIS) and venture capital trusts (VCT).</p>

	<p pid="a.222.9/2">Around one-third of Gaza's power needs are provided by Gaza's electricity plant. The restrictions on fuel supply means that the plant does not run at full capacity, leading to power cuts of four to five hours a day for several days each week. NGO and UN partners have noted the impact of power shortages on the fragile public health situation in Gaza. In health facilities, increased disruptions to the power supply mean that important medical procedures need to be put on hold; they also result in greater wear and tear on hard-pressed back-up generators. Water supplies are irregular as pumps do not work during power outages, and the capacity of the waste water system to deal with sewage is affected leading to overflows and discharge of raw and partially treated sewage into the sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.9/3">Cooking gas is used for both the preparation of food and heating. In the last two months the amount of cooking gas imported into Gaza has varied between 24 per cent and 42 per cent of the pre-blockade levels. NGOs have highlighted this shortfall as a significant humanitarian concern, particularly during winter. Periodic consignments of petrol and non-industrial diesel are allowed into Gaza for UN Relief and Works Agency use, but supplies for the open market thorough the crossings have been sporadic. The bulk of Gaza's diesel and petrol needs are met by supplies brought through tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.6/1">A decision on whether to establish a Marine Protected Area the British Indian Ocean Territory has not yet been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.6/2">The use of the facility on Diego Garcia is governed by a series of Exchange of Notes between the UK and US and imposes treaty obligations on both parties. Because of these treaty obligations, we have been discussing the possible creation of a marine protected area with the US. Neither we nor the US would want the creation of a marine protected area to have any impact on the operational capability of the base on Diego Garcia. For this reason, and as has been set out in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office public consultation document, it may be necessary to consider the exclusion of Diego Garcia and its three-mile territorial waters from any marine protected area.</p>

An approach based on one international and one country of origin language does not relate to any formal proposal currently being discussed in the EU and has not been assessed by the government.

	<p pid="a.246.5/1">There is no explicit reference to learning advocates in the prison officer role. The majority of education delivered in prisons in England and Wales is delivered by trained teachers though there are a number of officer instructors who work and supervise prisoners in workshops. Prison officers have a number of tasks to fill which will change depending on their existing role. But a key component of the vast majority of an officer's role will involve interacting, supporting and encouraging prisoners. Part of this process will be to encourage and motivate those prisoners who will benefit from education.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.8/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) assumed responsibility for the planning and funding of learning and skills delivery in public sector prisons and young offenders' institutions (YOIs) in England, in August 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.8/2">Last year, the LSC extended an invitation to tender (ITT) as part of a procurement process for learning and skills provision in YOIs and adult prisons; these contracts commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-01">1 August 2009</phrase> as part of a new five-year contracting round.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.8/3">From September 2010 the contracts will transfer to the host local authorities (LA) (the LA area within which the YOI is based). In assuming their new responsibilities the host LAs will inherit an agreed bed price funding methodology for YOIs. The bed price is based on a national education cost per custodial place. The bed price requires the education provider to deliver a minimum of 15 hours of learning and skills per young person, per week. The funds will be voted by the Government to LAs through the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA).</p>
	<p pid="a.246.8/4">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) recently funded a project at HMYOI Wetherby which trained prison officers to provide a similar function to learning and support assistants. The officers are active participants in the classroom, offering one-to-one support and assisting with group work. A second YJB-funded project at HMYOI Feltham trained prison officers to give them the skills to deliver sessions from an accredited life skills course. The officers deliver sessions on independent living, including budgeting and cooking, as well as writing a CV and preparing for job interviews.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.2/1">Regulatory bodies created by statute are answerable to Ministers for the exercise of their statutory functions and, ultimately, to Parliament either indirectly through Ministers or directly through scrutiny by relevant committees of Parliament, such as the Public Account Committee, departmental select committees of the House of Commons, and cross-cutting (thematic) committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/2">The National Audit Office can also audit the accounts of regulatory bodies and report on their procedures and practices. Bodies created by statute will be obliged to lay accounts and reports before Parliament each year. Further, government departments, Ministers and statutory regulators listed in the schedule to the Parliamentary Commissioners Act 1967 are answerable to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in relation to complaints about their activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/3">Executive agencies, which are not creatures of statute, will normally account to Ministers, who in turn will answer to Parliament for the actions of their agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.256.6/1">The most recent estimates of tax avoidance are set out in the HMRC publications Measuring the Tax Gap 2009 and Protecting Tax Revenues 2009. These estimate that total avoidance accounted for around 17.5 per cent of the UK net tax gap of &#163;40 billion in the latest year for which figures are available. Separate estimates are not available for avoidance relating to disclosed schemes undertaken by companies or individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/2">The disclosure regime provides vital intelligence on avoidance, which helps the Government to act swiftly to close down schemes where necessary. Since 2004 the Government have legislated to close down over &#163;12 billion in avoidance opportunities using intelligence provided by the regime. At the 2009 Pre-Budget Report the Government announced consultation on a package of measures to further strengthen the disclosure rules, including the introduction of enhanced penalties, a requirement for promoters to provide lists of their clients, and amendments and additions to the &quot;hallmarks&quot; which describe disclosable schemes. These will help ensure that the disclosure regime keeps pace with the market and continues to be effective in protecting tax revenues against artificial tax avoidance schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.0/1">In accordance with the Immigration Rules (paragraph 320(3)), all visa applicants are required to produce a valid national passport or other document satisfactorily establishing their identity and nationality. These checks need to be carried out by the Entry Clearance Officer prior to fixing a vignette sticker into the passport, when a visa is granted. If the passport has to be handed back during the decision phase, and the applicant then recalled when the decision is made, this will complicate the process and could cause delays, and inconvenience, to applicants.</p>
