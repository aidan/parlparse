These discussions carried forward the fruitful co-operation between Italy, Denmark, Sweden and UK which was a feature of the 1999 Agenda 2000 negotiations on the CAP. The Dutch Minister participated in the meeting for the first time in an observer capacity. Given the challenges of EU enlargement and the WTO trade negotiations to the future of the CAP, the participating Ministers agreed a programme of collective work on reform of the CAP, and decided to meet in a similar format in the course of next year. A copy of the framework document agreed upon at the Capri meeting has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.2/1">As part of the Modernising Government programme, my department is now beginning a formal review of the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards (UKROFS), which is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Ministry. UKROFS exercises regulatory and supervisory responsibilities in relation to organic farming across the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/2">The first stage of the review is expected to cover the following issues: (a) The effectiveness of the present arrangements for discharging the national &quot;competent authority&quot; functions prescribed by Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91 for regulating organic farming taking full account of:</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/3" class="indent">Government objectives for modernising public services, particularly the need for continuous improvement and better value for money;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/4" class="indent">Government policy on the regulation of farming, in particular the Strategy for Agriculture, and any parallel policy statements prepared by the devolved administrations;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/5" class="indent">the likely growth in the size and number of businesses in the organic farming-sector;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/6" class="indent">the fact that responsibility for agriculture is now devolved to the administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales; and</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/7" class="indent">the absence of a clear legal base for UKROFS.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/8">(b) The continuing need for the discretionary functions currently exercised by UKROFS, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/9" class="indent">setting standards for organic produce, either where there are no EU standards or by supplementing EU standards;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/10" class="indent">directly certifying producers who do not wish to register with the private sector certification bodies; and</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/11" class="indent">advising Ministers on organic sector issues, including commissioning R&amp;D.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/12">Because UKROFS is a UK body, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly will be closely involved in the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/13">We expect to take decisions on the outcome of the first stage of the review before Easter 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/14">Full details of the review, including advice on how to contribute, are being placed in the Library and on my department's website.</p>

As at <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-09">9 October 2000</phrase> there was no equipment in the repair process at Sennybridge that had exceeded the agreed turn-round time. The ABRO output Key Target in financial year 1999-2000, for the service provided to Land Command and to which the Sennybridge workshop contributes, is &quot;to complete 95 per cent of District Load tasks within the priorities agreed with the customer.&quot; During that year Sennybridge achieved 98.9 per cent of tasks within the agreed turn-round times; a performance verified by internal audit.

	<p pid="a.99.5/1">The Data Protection Act 1998 came into force in March this year. The Act implements the European Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, and on the free movement of such data. It also gives effect to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the 1989 case Gaskin v the United Kingdom concerning the right of access to social work records. At the same time guidance on the working of the Act was issued to social services departments by the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/2">Local authorities were warned of the Act's pending implementation in 1998 and formally advised to act in the meantime as if the Act were already in force so as to give data subjects access, where possible, to personal information held about them in social services files.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/3">Under the Act, responsibility for the release of personal information held by social services departments continues to rest with local authorities.

	<p pid="a.106.5/1">The introduction of an independent element into future investigations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 has been considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/2">It has been concluded that the appointment of a small independent scrutiny team, drawn from the Animal Procedures Committee, and reporting directly to the Secretary of State would be the best and most practicable means of providing assurance that any future inspectorate investigations have been carried out with the necessary objectivity and thoroughness. The Government are grateful to the committee for agreeing to undertake this role following an approach to them in June 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.11/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary attended this Council meeting. The main matters dealt with at the meeting were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/2">The list of A points was agreed in full, including the three items outstanding from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council held on <phrase class="date" code="">28 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/3">Draft framework decision on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/4">There was a broad political orientation subject to certain parliamentary reserves and the European Parliament opinion to a common minimum maximum penalty of four years and that all Member States should be obliged to lift reserves in respect of tax offences to the 1990 Council of Europe money laundering convention's provisions on confiscation of assets. The Council also agreed a declaration to the effect that minimum maximum penalties would be considered on a case by case basis for future instruments.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/5">Draft convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, with particular reference to the fight against organised crime, the laundering of the proceeds of crime and financial crime:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/6">There was broad agreement, on the basis of a Presidency discussion document, to the principle that legal assistance should not be refused solely on the grounds that an investigation concerned a tax offence or involved the lifting of bank secrecy. A number of Member States considered that such measures should be subject to judicial control; others also raised the practical difficulties involved in supplying lists of bank accounts in the absence of a central register. The Commission acknowledged that Member States would have flexibility in how they chose to abolish grounds of refusal founded in bank secrecy or tax matters; they should nonetheless aim to establish efficient systems for providing assistance in such matters. Work on the convention would continue at expert level on the basis of the discussion document.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/7">Presentation of the conclusions of the seminar from 13-<phrase class="date" code="">15 September</phrase> on the laundering of the proceeds of organised crime in Europe:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/8">The Presidency presented the conclusions. There was no discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/9">Proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community mechanism for the co-ordination of civil protection in the event of emergencies--presentation by the Commission:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/10">The Presidency and the Commission presented their respective proposals. Two Member States welcomed the call for an assessment of respective national capabilities with a view to greater co-ordination between existing national structures. Others argued for a European Civil Protection Agency and a third for more European Union-financed training.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/11">Other items:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/12">I proposed a greater operational role for the Chief Police Officer's Task Force and proposed using a Council decision to place this work on a more formal footing. The Presidency concluded that the Council should return to this as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/13">One Member State registered the need for Justice Ministers to have greater involvement in discussions concerning Organization de Lutte anti-Fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/14">Finally, the Council adopted conclusions regarding the ETA murder the previous night in Spain.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/15">On the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>, the Justice and Home Affairs Council met jointly with the Ecofin Council. I represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.11/16">Following a debate on strategy towards more effective co-operation in the financial sector, law enforcement and judicial co-operation, the Council adopted conclusions, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.</p>
