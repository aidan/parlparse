	<p pid="a.79.5/3">In response to the financial crisis the Basel Committee agreed reforms to strengthen the capital requirements for the trading book and re-securitisations. These reforms are to be implemented no later than the end of 2011. The Basel Committee is currently working on the package of reforms known as Basel III, which the G20 aims to have in place by the end of 2012. The Government strongly support the work of the Basel Committee.</p>

Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/22" class="indent">2. To provide a geographic breakdown, in most cases the postcode of the actual location of the job is used to allocate the vacancy to a local area.

These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.</p>
