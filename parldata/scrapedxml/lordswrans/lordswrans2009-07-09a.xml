	<p pid="a.161.2/1">UK forces, along with 41 other contributing nations, participate in the North Atlantic Treat Organisation's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan at the invitation of the democratically elected Afghan Government and at the request of the UN. The objective of the international community's involvement in Afghanistan is to establish the right security environment in which accountable and effective institutions can develop and Afghan-led reconstruction and development can be established. Gaining and securing the confidence of the Afghan population is critical to achieving our objectives. The newly appointed commander of ISAF, General Stanley McChrystal, is currently conducting a review of ISAF operations. We await its recommendations. We welcome General McChrystal's recent statements emphasising ISAF's determination to protect the Afghan population from the insurgents and to seek to minimise the effect of ISAF operations on the population. The UK will continue to support ISAF and the Government of Afghanistan in their efforts to do this. ISAF and the wider international community working in Afghanistan, including the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, will continue to work closely with the Government of Afghanistan and the Afghan National Security Forces in pursuit of their objectives on behalf of the people of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.2/1">It has been the policy of successive Governments not to implement changes to pensions and similar benefits retrospectively. This policy has been applied across the public sector in the United Kingdom, not just to Gurkha veterans. To do so now would not only be counter to this policy but would also lead to potential claims from other groups in public sector schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/2">The Gurkha pension scheme pays pensions earlier than the Armed Forces pension scheme. This is because Gurkhas are unlikely to work again in Nepal unlike their British counterparts, in the UK. For example, a Gurkha rifleman or corporal with 15 years (approximately 85 per cent of those receiving GPS payments) can claim an immediate pension (from age 33) whereas equivalent service under the AFPS would not attract pension payments until age 60.

	<p pid="a.172.5/1">The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) has been running a substantial programme of support to encourage the use of information technology as a teaching resource in initial teacher training. The standards for teachers, including the standards that trainee teachers have to meet to gain qualified teacher status (QTS), make specific references to ICT. To gain QTS a teacher must know how to use ICT to support their teaching and wider professional activities and be able to design opportunities for learners to develop their ICT skills. All trainee teachers have to pass skills tests in numeracy, literacy and ICT as a prerequisite of gaining QTS.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/2">Over the past six years nearly &pound;20 million has been made available to ensure that the new teachers leaving teacher training have the necessary skills to use ICT effectively in their teaching and in their professional development.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/3">Initially, the funding was targeted at laptops for trainee teachers. Funding has also been provided for interactive whiteboards for teacher training establishments to mirror the substantial government investment in interactive whiteboards for schools. Funding and support was also directed to areas such as video capture and analysis. Several projects involving handheld technologies have been supported to test out the value of these in teacher training.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/4">A number of alternative methods of video conferencing between teacher training institutions and schools have been tested. Several regional seminars run by the TDA jointly with the Government supported Janet Videoconferencing Service to provide advice to teacher trainers.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/5">With support from the British Educational Suppliers Association and working in partnership with the IT in Teacher Education group there is now in place a special software licence for teacher trainers that recognises the particular nature of teacher training and allows a reduced cost for educational software. The TDA also has an agreement with eight major educational software companies that some of their software can be made available to teacher trainers at no cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/6">The TDA is currently funding more than 100 small e-portfolio and research projects with teacher trainers. The Teacher Training Resource Bank has been established by the TDA to provide internet access for teacher training providers and trainees to the research and evidence base informing teacher education.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/7">The TDA has provided support for teacher training in e-safety and helped develop support for trainee teachers in this area. A suite of e-safety materials are available to support e-safety with children including information and advice for parents. This material is being supplemented by an e-safety module, commissioned by the TDA, as part of the European Pedagogical ICT Certificate for teachers.</p>
