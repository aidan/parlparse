This is because the sample size available for UK cities apart from London is too small to produce relative low income estimates.

Personal independence payment will support disabled people to lead full, active and independent lives and the assessment will consider their ability to carry out a range of key day-to-day activities. We are still developing the assessment and the detailed criteria will be in regulations. We are, however, clear that the assessment should look at people as individuals, rather than labelling them as part of a group, such as those with a particular health condition or impairment. That is why the assessment is being designed to consider an individual's personal circumstances and the support they need. We are, therefore, unable to predict the outcome of the assessment on individuals and whether any of the people living in poverty will have their incomes reduced as a result.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-17">17 February 2011</phrase> the Government announced that we will be implementing Section 202 of the Equality Act 2010 to amend the Civil Partnership Act 2004 by removing the ban on civil partnership registrations being held on religious premises. This will allow those religious organisations that wish to do so to host civil partnership registrations on their premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/2">This is the first step in our work in this area.

	<p pid="a.404.0/3">However, parents do not need to be married to each other to obtain parental responsibility; in cases where a child's parents are not married to each other, the mother will have parental responsibility but the father may acquire it either by jointly registering the birth with the mother, through an agreement with the mother, or as the result of a court order.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.3/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister visited Egypt on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-21">21 February 2011</phrase>. In his meetings with Field Marshal Tantawi, the Head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and former Prime Minister Shafiq, he focused on the need for Egypt to seize this opportunity to make a genuine transition from military to civilian democratic rule. He welcomed the statements from the military leadership that they intend to bring about this transition. But he also urged the interim Government to make progress towards democracy, including by setting a clear timetable for free and fair elections, to convince the people that the process was genuine and irreversible. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister also met members of the opposition in Egypt.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.6/1">Older people in England can already receive residential care if they need it. Local council social services departments are responsible for assessing the social care needs of their populations. Should a person be assessed as being in need of residential care and provided they meet their local council's eligibility criteria, the council has a responsibility, subject to the person's resources, to provide or arrange such care.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.6/2">In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging fiscal climate, the Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This will mean that, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, there will be enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.6/3">We are informed by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) that, as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September 2010</phrase>-the latest available figures-there were 18,075 care and nursing homes in England, with 460,823 places.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.6/4">The CQC does not collect occupancy information. However, the independent health and social care analysts Laing and Buisson reported that, in 2010, the national occupancy rate in homes stood at around 89 per cent, which equates to some 50,000 vacant places.</p>

	<p pid="a.418.3/1">Looked-after children, with some limited exceptions, have top priority in any school admission oversubscription criteria and schools cannot therefore refuse to admit them.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/2">Outside the normal admission round local authorities are able, if necessary, to direct the admission authority of a maintained school to admit a child they look after, even where the school is full. A local authority can ask an academy to admit a looked-after child. Where the academy refuses to admit the child the local authority can ask the Secretary of State to consider whether to direct the academy.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/3">There will sometimes be good reasons why looked-after children need to be placed away from their communities although in most cases children benefit from being placed close to home. From <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase> local authorities will be required to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that there is sufficient accommodation within their local authority area to meet the needs of the children under their care.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/4">In addition, the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010 and accompanying statutory guidance require that a placement is the most appropriate available, that it meets the child's needs identified in his or her care plan and that the independent reviewing officer reviewing the child's case has had an opportunity to discuss the proposed arrangements before any final decision has been made. This includes where the child should go to school or obtain his or her education. The discussion should in most circumstances take place after the child has visited the proposed education setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/5">Where a local authority makes an out-of-authority placement it should work closely with all relevant bodies, including the local authority where the child will be living, to ensure that the child's identified needs can be met effectively.</p>
