In reaching his decision one of the factors which weighed most heavily with him was the lack of consistency in the effect of the relevant Immigration Rule. My right honourable friend also considered the likely effect of cancellation of the fight on those who had already bought tickets and smaller enterprises and individuals who were probably least able to bear any losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/2">My right honourable friend weighed these factors against the nature and seriousness of Mr Tyson's convictions and he decided on balance that the exceptional circumstances of this case were such that Mr Tyson should be granted entry solely for the purpose of participating in a sporting event. This decision was entirely in accordance with the Immigration Act 1971 and the Immigration Rules, which provide a residual discretion to allow entry in exceptional cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.5/1">The greater use of task forces encourages wider debate of the issues concerned: it ensures that Ministers may receive advice from beyond the confines of Whitehall or special interest groups. It ensures that issues are aired and decisions are taken on a more informed basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.5/2">This does not conflict with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Bill. Freedom of information is about opening up government and about making information more available. Nothing in the Freedom of Information Bill prevents any information from being released. The Freedom of Information Bill does indeed contain an exemption for the formulation of government policy, but it is acknowledged that government must have the space to evaluate policy options and that premature disclosure of this kind of information could hamper the effective conduct of government. Freedom of information regimes in other countries provide similar protection for this kind of information. In addition, while an exemption may place information outside the general right of access that the Bill provides, there is nevertheless a duty placed on authorities to consider exercising their discretion to release such information in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.5/3">The Bill also contains a specific provision regarding the desirability of communicating factual information which has been used to provide an informed background to decision-taking and, although disclosure decisions must be made on a case by case basis, it may well be that reports of task forces would fall into this category.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.8/2">As I made clear in that letter, the use by farmers of field areas from Ordnance Survey (OS) maps in their aid claims remains perfectly acceptable, provided the fields concerned are fully utilised for the purpose of the aid scheme under which the farmer's claim is being made. This has been the case since the start of the integrated administration and control system (IACS) in 1993 and there are no plans to change it.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.8/3">The full OS area of a field may include parts which are taken up by features such as ponds or footpaths. These uncultivated areas are not eligible for aid and must be subtracted from the claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.8/4">The Commission has proposed that, from 2003, EU member states must maintain their IACS databases in a spatial form with the use of a geographical information system (GIS). Although there are some aspects of the Commission proposal which the Government would like to see amended, they recognise that the use of a GIS offers real benefits to farmers and to administrators. These benefits were also recognised by the IACS and inspections working group set up as part of the Review of Regulatory Burdens. The group also supported the Ministry's plans to use OS digital mapping as the foundation of its IACS database. The ability of farmers to claim the full OS areas of their fields, where appropriate, would not be affected by the introduction of a GIS.</p>
