	<p pid="c.113.5/1">The Prime Minister called in his speech to the European Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-23">23 June</phrase> for a fundamental review of the whole EU budget. That review should include how we capitalise on the progress made in reforming the common agricultural policy (CAP) over recent years. The UK Government believe, for example, that more can be done to cut the cost of the CAP and to ensure that it fosters an agricultural sector that is more competitive, sustainable and innovative in responding to challenges such as globalisation and climate change. We have not tabled detailed reform proposals. What we have asked for is a proper debate on the future of the EU budget, including the CAP, and we have seen public contributions from politicians, political commentators, economists and of course farmers across Europe. As presidency we have also held formal consultations with each of the member states, as well as Romania and Bulgaria, in order to ensure that we understand their views and concerns on the EU budget for 2007&ndash;13, including the future of European agricultural policy and the possibility of a review of EU spending. The UK presidency continues to work to establish whether agreement can be reached in December on the 2007&ndash;13 budget. We have also made good progress towards an agreement to reform the CAP sugar regime.</p>

	<p pid="c.114.2/3">An important element of a sustainable community is its sense of place. Listed properties clearly play a part in creating a sense of place and it is important that they are given sufficient consideration by local planning authorities when planning for the development of a local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.2/4">The document <i>Sustainable communities: Building for the future</i> is a national programme of action setting out how the Government intend to achieve sustainable communities for all. It recognises that there are many elements that make up a sustainable community and seeks to focus minds on the fusion of these elements into a cohesive whole, creating sustainable communities where people want to live.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.2/5">Listed property status gives a building statutory protection against unauthorised demolition, alteration and extension. Listing is the start of a process, rather than an end in itself, flagging the significance of an asset so that its future management can enhance its contribution to local, regional and national life.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.2/6">In this context, all of the listed properties in Essex are affected by the Sustainable Communities Plan and have an important role to play in the creation of truly sustainable communities, in which people want to live.</p>

	<p pid="c.118.6/1">In the past six months 2 per cent. (three return flights) of all Royal Air Force (RAF) passenger flights into and out of Basra airport have been cancelled and 9 per cent. (13 return flights) have been delayed in excess of 24 hours. The total number of return flights flown over this period was 138. In the event of prolonged delays every realistic course of action will be considered in order to minimise disruption to personnel both deploying to and returning from Iraq. This includes the use of alternative RAF aircraft, which may be diverted from other tasking, other coalition military aircraft or a chartered solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.6/2">Civil carriers can in some instances take longer to arrange than the use of substitute military airlift. This is due to the requirements of European regulations for competition before a carrier can be selected, and the subsequent time required to obtain the necessary diplomatic and flight clearances.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.6/3">Kuwait is one of a number of airports that can be considered as an alternative point of arrival or departure; however, the Ministry of Defence would aim to use military airbases where the RAF already had personnel and support deployed. While military facilities remain our preferred solution, this does not preclude the use of civil airports as and when the situation dictates.</p>

	<p pid="c.119.5/1">The national curriculum is intended to be suitable for all young people, whatever their academic ability. In 2004 we made changes to the 14-19 curriculum which give schools greater flexibility in catering to the needs of less academic pupils. We have also asked the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to undertake a review of the key stage 3 curriculum to allow schools more flexibility to meet students' individual needs and strengths. Several programmes which offer employment-related courses are already in place, such as the Increased Flexibility Programme and the Young Apprenticeship scheme. In addition to these, the recent <i>14-19 Education and Skills</i> paper details proposals for specialised diplomas, which have a clear vocational bearing, and a programme for 14-16 year-olds at risk of disaffection and disengagement, which will have a strong work-focus.</p>

We have stressed the importance of AU personnel (observers and force protection) following DPKO minimum requirements about peacekeepers and HIV/AIDS prevention.</p>
