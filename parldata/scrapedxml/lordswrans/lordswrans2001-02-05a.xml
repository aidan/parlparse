Given the freedom of movement in the EU, British passport holders are free to settle in Ireland at any time. The consular section at the embassy does not hold a register of the British passport holders in the country; given the freedom of movement between EU countries such a register would in any event be impractical and inaccurate.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.11/1">The review's analysis and recommendations have been accepted by the Director General of the Prison Service and by Ministers and will be implemented progressively from April 2001 with the aim of year on year reductions in prisoner suicide and self-harm. There will be a strong stress on a preventive strategy which invests most resources where the risks are highest. An all-round pro-active approach will be developed which encourages a supportive culture in prisons based on good staff-prisoner relationships, a constructive regime and a physically safe environment. There will be improved identification and case arrangements for high risk prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.11/2">The review's recommendations will be developed and piloted in five establishments--Wandsworth, Feltham, Eastwood Park, Leeds and Winchester. They will be evaluated and rolled out to other prisons. The three-year strategy will involve a major investment of capital and staff in prisons. In the first year &pound;8 million will be invested in implementation. Improvements will be made to reception and induction areas, for example through installing more first night centres, and by having more safe cells, crisis suites and gated cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.11/3">New healthcare screening procedures will start in 10 pilot prisons. Wing staff will be supported in their work by in-reach mental health teams and by the establishment of dedicated drug detoxification units. There will be full-time suicide prevention co-ordinators in high risk local prisons. The numbers of trained listeners at high risk prisons will be increased substantially.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.11/4">Copies of the review are being placed in the Library. The review recommended:</p>
	<p pid="a.83.11/5" class="indent">a move away from awareness towards prevention;</p>
	<p pid="a.83.11/6" class="indent">a risk-based strategy which invests more resources where the risks are highest and matches the level of support and intervention to the degree or risk of self-harm or suicide presented by the individual prisoner;</p>

	<p pid="a.83.11/8" class="indent">a better physical environment for prisoners, particularly when first received into custody;</p>

	<p pid="a.84.2/1">We are grateful to all who responded to the recent consultation on this issue. There was general agreement as to the purposes of registration as set out in the consultation document. The responses received made clear, however, that voluntary registration is a complex matter which requires further careful examination and consideration before informed decisions can be reached on longer term policy. We have asked officials to develop more detailed proposals in the light of the responses to the consultation and in discussions with interested organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/2">The current regulations, which made registration voluntary for charities connected with a number of religious bodies, expire on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March 2001</phrase>. We have today laid a new statutory instrument to extend those regulations until <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>. That will allow time for the necessary work to be done to enable the way forward to be settled.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/3">We will make a further announcement later this year but we want at this stage to allay concerns expressed by some of those consulted that one of the proposals in the consultation document meant that umbrella bodies would be compelled to take on responsibilities which neither they nor their members want. We can give an absolute assurance that that was not, and is not, the Government's intention.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/4">Many respondents were also concerned that any change could make it more difficult for the public to find out about charities. The further work that we have commissioned will explore ways of making sure that that is not the case.</p>

Businesses which take advantage of the regulations must make all reasonable efforts to inform the users of their systems that their communications may or will be monitored.

	Learning Difficulties: Terms used in Legislation

	<p pid="a.88.5/1">Under the Education Act 1996 children have a learning difficulty if they have a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of children of their age or they have a disability which prevents or hinders them from making use of educational facilities generally provided in schools within the area of their local education authority. Children who are under compulsory school age will have a learning difficulty if they are, or if no special educational provision were made for them would be, likely to have such a difficulty or disability when they reach compulsory school age.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/2">There are other definitions of learning difficulties in legislation dealing with education but they are very similar. For example, the definition in the Learning and Skills Act 2000 defines people as having learning difficulties if they have a significantly greater difficulty learning than the majority of people their age or have a disability which prevents or hinders them from making use of the educational facilities generally provided by institutions providing post-16 education or training.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/3">There is no definition of &quot;learning difficulties&quot; in disability legislation. The 1978 report of the Warnock Committee suggested that &quot;learning difficulties might be described as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe' &quot;. &quot;Severe learning difficulties&quot; was the committee's preferred description of children who were then commonly referred to as being &quot;mentally handicapped&quot; and defined as &quot;severely educationally sub-normal&quot; but the term is not defined in education or disability legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/4">The Government's working definition of a person with a learning disability is a person who has: a significantly reduced ability to understand new or complex information, to learn new skills (impaired intelligence), and a reduced ability to cope independently (impaired social functioning), and which started before adulthood, with a lasting effect on development.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/5">Learning disability is not defined for the purposes of education or disability legislation but it is used elsewhere. For example, it is defined for the purpose of travel concessions in the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and in the Transport Act 1985 (inserted by the Transport Act 2000) as &quot;a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/6">Severe learning disability is not defined in education or disability legislation but is defined elsewhere. For example, it is defined in the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 and the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) (Transitional) Regulations 1995 as &quot;a condition which results from the arrested or incomplete physical development to the brain, and which involves severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.2/1">When applying for work permits employers are normally required to test the European economic area (EEA) labour market by advertising the job in the most appropriate medium and to provide details of any responses and reasons why resident workers are not suitable. This is not required in specified circumstances where it is not appropriate to test the availability of resident labour. These circumstances are where the applications are in respect of employees of multinational companies transferring to offices of the company based in this country, senior board level posts, jobs attracting related inward investment and jobs where there are acknowledged shortages of skills within the resident labour force. Any allegations of the displacement of resident labour following the issue of a work permit are thoroughly investigated.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">The Department of Health has been working with the Health Development Agency to improve the information on caesarean sections in their Pregnancy Book which is distributed free to all first time mothers. Since September 1999, the book includes detailed information on caesarean sections and women are encouraged to ask questions. The text of this book is also available on the website: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/parenting/prhealth.shtml">http//www.bbc.co.uk/health/parenting/prhealth.shtml</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">In addition, the department has taken steps to strengthen local audit processes by publishing figures for caesarean section rates by individual National Health Service trusts. This assists women in providing accurate up-to-date information on which to base their maternity choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">The Government are concerned about the rising rates of caesarean sections and big variations between trusts, as well as the high rates in some hospitals. We have an active programme of work in hand to address the variations and the reasons for the overall rise.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">The National Sentinal Caesarean Section Audit is a Department of Health initiative currently being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. This is a multi-disciplinary audit involving the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Anaesthetist and user representatives. Last autumn (November 2000) the department asked the National Institute of Clinical Excellence to develop clinical guidelines based on the findings of this audit. This should even out variations around the country and help women make more informed choices.</p>
