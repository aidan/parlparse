	<p pid="c.184.9/1">For Great Britain, penalties for breaches of the new working time rules for mobile workers are set out in Regulation 17 of the Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.9/2">For failure to comply with any of the relevant requirements of the regulations (for instance, working time limits, break and rest requirements, night work limits and information/record-keeping requirements), the maximum penalty in a magistrates' court currently, would be &pound;5,000. However, in a Crown Court, the maximum penalty would be a fine at the judge's discretion.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.9/3">For preventing a person from appearing before an inspector or for obstructing an inspector, the maximum penalty in a magistrates' court currently would be &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.9/4">For contravening an improvement notice or prohibition served under the regulations, the maximum penalty in a magistrates' court would be three months in prison or, currently, &pound;5,000. However, in a Crown Court, the maximum penalty would be two years in prison and/or a fine at the judge's discretion.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.9/5">For failure to comply with an inspector's requirements, disclosure of certain information without permission or for a false statement in purported compliance with the regulations, the maximum penalty in a magistrates' court currently would be &pound;5,000. However, in a Crown Court, the maximum penalty would be a fine at the judge's discretion. For disclosure of certain information without permission, the Crown Court has the option of giving a two year prison sentence and/or the fine.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.9/6">Similar penalties apply in Northern Ireland&mdash;see the Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.9/7">To date, nobody has been prosecuted for breach of the regulations. They are still relatively new and enforcers have received few complaints. In response to those complaints, the initial emphasis has been on educating employers and employees rather than prosecution. So far this approach has been largely successful and enforcers have seen improvements being made. Nevertheless, arrangements for enforcement of the new rules (and the resources allocated to this task) are being kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.186.0/1">The meeting was arranged to pursue our request for clarification on a number of points of Indian citizenship law. At the meeting the Indian Director for Immigration and Citizenship stated that he was not in a position to provide the requested clarification, and conceded that some members of the public might in the meanwhile have been given incorrect information by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Indian diplomatic missions. In light of this, the director was requested not to authorise any further statements about the points of law under discussion until the Ministry's position on them was settled. There is no legal requirement for applicants to produce letters confirming non-possession of other citizenships in support of their applications for British citizenship. Indeed, the Ministry had previously intimated, in its Note Verbale No. T42313/2003 of <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-28">28 May 2003</phrase>, that it would not normally be prepared to issue such letters in respect of persons resident in India.

The Government have established an independent licensing fees review panel to consider whether the fees regime is meeting these objectives. It is extremely important that the panel can determine the full costs of the new regime and compare original forecasts against actual outcomes. Over the past few months, the panel has commissioned evidence from around 70 stakeholder organisations touched by the new regime including the Association of Convenience Stores, Rural Shops Alliance, Federation of Small Businesses and local community organisations. The panel will deliver an interim review shortly, followed by a final report in autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.187.8/1">The Country of Origin Information Service (formerly part of the Country Information and Policy Unit) country of origin information products are compiled solely from a wide range of publicly disclosable sources. These sources do not generally contain such detailed information as the breakdown of faiths within community authorities. However, recent enquiries through the British High Commission in Islamabad show that very few Ahmadis are represented in public and semi-public organisations in Rabwah. Approximately 55 per cent of the voting population of Rabwah are Ahmadi, but it appears that Ahmadis do not normally vote in or contest elections for a variety of reasons. This information will be reflected in a forthcoming Country of Origin Information Service bulletin on Pakistan. Information concerning the breakdown of faiths in other authorities will be sought if a specific need for this arises in relation to the processing of asylum cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.188.1/2" qnum="HL1723">Whether any pension schemes which commenced wind-up after 1 January 1997, other than schemes where the employer was solvent, are not eligible for inclusion either in the financial assistance scheme or the Pension Protection Fund; and, if so, under what circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.188.2/1">The financial assistance scheme (FAS) will in general, and subject to detailed provisions in the Pensions Act 2004 and consequential regulations, provide assistance to members of non-money purchase pension schemes that commenced wind up between <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>. The sponsoring employer must also have had a relevant insolvency event by the end of the FAS notification period on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase>. Schemes sponsored by employers that have insolvency events after that date will not qualify for the FAS.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.2/2">The PPF covers non-money purchase occupational pension schemes that have not commenced wind up prior to <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. It should be noted, however, that schemes which meet these criteria will still be ineligible if they are a prescribed scheme or a scheme of a prescribed description, as set out in Regulation 2 of the PPF (Entry Rules) Regulations 2005 or where, subject to prescribed exceptions, they have compromised the S.75 debt payable to the scheme. The PPF publish full details of how these exceptions apply on their website <a href="http://www.pensionprotectionfund.org.uk">www.pensionprotectionfund.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.2/3">PPF involvement is conditional on the sponsoring employer or employers having a qualifying insolvency event. Compensation will be paid only when it is certain that a scheme rescue is not possible and that the scheme has insufficient funds to secure at least the PPF level of benefits. A scheme will also be ineligible where it has no sponsoring employer&mdash;this could occur, for example, if the only employer was dissolved prior to <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.2/4">For eligible schemes not already in wind up before the <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase>, but where the employer is in insolvency proceedings prior to this date, entry to the PPF may be possible so long as the criteria are met. In particular, this would require a new insolvency event to take place after April 2005 (a move from administration to liquidation, for example).</p>

	<p pid="c.189.0/162">Although most reciprocal agreements provide for payment of upratings, that is not their primary purpose. They are intended mainly to provide a measure of co-ordination between social security schemes to protect the social security of workers moving between the two countries during their working lives. They prevent employees, their employers and the self-employed having to pay social security contributions to both the home state and the state of residence at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="c.189.0/163">From 1981 to the present day, successive UK governments have taken the view that no new commitments should be entered into to seek to negotiate new agreements with other countries that would include provision for the payment of social security, benefits to persons abroad, including the uprating of UK state pensions abroad. Most of the UK's existing agreements are in fact consolidations of earlier long-standing ones and were entered into with a view to administrative improvements and efficiencies and also to take into account developments and changes to both countries' schemes over time, rather than to extend the scope for payment of increased amounts of benefits abroad.</p>
	<p pid="c.189.0/164">As shown in the table above, the UK state pension is paid to over half a million people residing in over 100 different countries outside the EEA with which the UK does not have a reciprocal social security agreement covering uprating of the state pension. Around 90 per cent of these overseas pensioners reside in Australia, Canada, New Zealand or South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="c.189.0/165">Only limited information is available on the rules applicable to the export of pensions from these four countries. Such information as is available is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.189.0/166">In Australia, the tax-funded, residence-based age pension is payable outside Australia but only if it was claimed while the person was resident in Australia; it cannot be claimed from outside Australia other than from a country with which Australia has a reciprocal agreement. In contrast the UK state pension can be claimed from anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.189.0/167">In Canada, benefits under the contributory Canada pension plan are payable to people who live outside Canada and are uprated once a year in January. The residence-based, tax-funded old age security pension can be paid indefinitely outside Canada provided the pensioner has lived in Canada for at least 20 years after reaching 18 years of age.</p>
	<p pid="c.189.0/168">The arrangements in New Zealand are that the tax-funded New Zealand superannuation is generally payable outside New Zealand at 50 per cent of the rate payable in the country. As with Australia, it is paid only to people who claimed the pension while resident in the country. However, the rate payable to those moving to a country with which New Zealand has a reciprocal agreement will depend on the terms of the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.189.0/169">There is no universal contributory pension scheme in South Africa. However there are some income-tested social security benefits, including social pensions for the elderly.

	<p pid="c.193.2/1">It is important to have adequate cover for advice to the police. Therefore, guaranteeing a charging service to the police between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm on weekdays is a key requirement of the statutory charging scheme and one that must be satisfied before an area is allowed to operate under the statutory provisions. CPS Direct complements this service by making prosecutors advice available to the police out of these hours and throughout weekends and public holidays.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.2/2">All the 42 Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) areas have been provided with the necessary resources to ensure that they can provide a charging service between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm during weekdays. The levels of service are reviewed in each area by a joint police/CPS team before an area is allowed to operate under the statutory provisions and, again, six months after implementation to ensure prosecutor coverage still meets demand. There are also national arrangements to deal with issues going across more than one area.</p>
