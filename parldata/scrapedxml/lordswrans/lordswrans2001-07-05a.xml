	<p pid="a.51.5/3" class="indent">(b) the case would have to pass all the relevant criteria in the General Funding Code; and either involve a significant wider public interest or have overwhelming importance (affecting the life, liberty or physical safety of the client or his or her immediate family or the roof over their heads) to the client (or clients) seeking funding; and</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/4" class="indent">(c) there would have to be convincing evidence that, given the procedures and other arrangements in the court or tribunal concerned, legal representation was the only adequate way of establishing the facts and presenting the case; and that no alternative means of funding that representation was available; so that taking these factors together, and having regard to our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, it was essential to provide public funding for representation in order to serve the interests of justice.</p>
