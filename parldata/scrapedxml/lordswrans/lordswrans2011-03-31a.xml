	<p pid="a.293.0/1">First, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) will test the resilience of major UK banks to an increase in short-term funding costs through its updated 2011-2105 anchor stress scenario, which is applied to major UK banks as part of its rolling programme of supervisory stress testing. This new anchor scenario includes the twin shock of higher interest rates and a deterioration in economic growth in the initial years of the stress scenario.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/2">Secondly, it is FSA policy to ask banks to test their capital adequacy against a range of alternative scenarios, in addition to the anchor scenario. One such scenario is that set out in the FSA prudential outlook published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-17">17 March</phrase>, which features sharply rising interest rates in the context of rapid global growth and higher inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/3">Thirdly, the FSA also requires banks to evaluate the effect on their banking books of a sudden and unexpected change in interest rates of 200 basis points both upwards and downwards, holding additional capital if this would cause them losses. In addition, the FSA asks firms to run a range of interest rate stresses on their trading books, including historical scenarios (such as the 1994 bond market sell-off), hypothetical scenarios and point of weakness stress tests (which capture risk factors to which banks are significantly exposed).</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/4">Finally, the FSA liquidity policy, implemented in 2010, tests the ability of banks to survive a major shock to short-term funding markets for a three-month period.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.6/1">Disability living allowance (DLA) is a tax-free non-contributory benefit which is not income-related and recipients can spend the money as they choose. DLA is also a gateway to additional support through student eligibility for people in receipt of income-related employment and support allowance (ESA), the childcare disregard in housing benefit and council tax benefit and the disabled child premium.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/2">Being in receipt of DLA is not a consideration when determining eligibility for any of the employment support provision provided by the Department for Work and Pensions. However, it is sometimes the case that DLA customers must also be in receipt of other qualifying benefits to access some of the provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/3">We are committed to ensuring that disabled people have the same employment opportunities and chances as everyone else to find and stay in paid employment, regardless of their disability and this includes people in receipt of DLA. Employment support which may be available to disabled customers, including, but not exclusively those in receipt of DLA are outlined below:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/4">Work Choice-provides tailored support to help disabled people who face the most complex barriers to employment find and stay in work and ultimately help them progress into unsupported employment, where it is appropriate for the individual. Work Choice is voluntary and available regardless of any benefits being claimed.access to work-provides practical advice and financial support to employed disabled people above and beyond what the employer could reasonably provide, to help them overcome obstacles resulting from disability and thus stay in work;residential training-for unemployed disabled adults whose needs cannot be met through any other government-funded programmes and is voluntary and available regardless of any benefits being claimed; andRemploy-an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, delivers a range of employment and development opportunities for disabled people under the Work Choice programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/5">In addition, from April this year, the support that Jobcentre Plus delivers to customers across all working-age benefits is changing. Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers will have more flexibility to judge which interventions will help disabled customers move towards paid employment in the most cost-effective way ensuring provision is tailored to personal and local labour market needs. To support this Jobcentre Plus is introducing a suite of measures bringing together communities, the voluntary sector, businesspeople and employers, to help get people back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/6">In summer this year, the Work Programme will be introduced which will provide more personalised back-to-work support for unemployed people, including many customers with disabilities and health conditions. While not specifically targeted at DLA customers, where these customers are also claiming one of the eligible benefits, they will be able to access Work Programme support at particular points in their claim. In many cases this access will be earlier than for a jobseeker's allowance customer. Providers will also be paid more to get harder-to-help customers, including many with disabilities and health conditions, into sustained employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/7">The Minister for Disabled People also commissioned an independent review of the support the Government provide to disabled people who want to work.

	<p pid="a.296.2/1">The Government are creating a common curriculum for training needs which are generic to all departments. From April 2011, training and development across government departments in leadership, management and the core skills every civil servant should have will be sourced through Civil Service Learning. Reforms to be introduced by Civil Service Learning include a review of the training provided in-house and through outsourced provision. Departments will retain responsibility for their budgets for training and for sourcing training which is specific to their own business needs. There is no separate training budget for senior civil servants. These changes are expected to generate savings of around &#163;100 million per year. Officials have met Civil Service trade union representatives on several occasions to discuss these changes.</p>

Last May, the Government put in place a series of efficiency measures that included limiting the use of first-class travel and making greater use of video and teleconferencing technologies. So far this year, this has contributed towards over &#163;50 million savings in prices paid for travel and accommodation (eg by travelling standard class and purchasing advance tickets) and we have achieved a further &#163;50 million in reducing the amount of travel undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.2/1">Any embryonic stem cell line which is intended for human therapeutic use will need to fulfil certain quality and safety requirements before administration to humans. The extent of the assessment will depend on the purpose of such administration, ie clinical research, application under hospital exemption or full marketing authorisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/2">Researchers wanting to obtain embryonic stem cell lines from human blastocysts created by means of cell nuclear transfer or other means must apply for a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). It is a condition of a HFEA licence that a sample of the stem cell lines derived must be deposited in the UK Stem Cell Bank. To deposit a human stem cell line in the bank, applicants must provide copies of any published scientific papers related to the derivation and/or characterisation of the stem cell line.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/3">Stem cells that are intended for human application come under the regulation of the Human Tissue Authority (HTA). Researchers would need to obtain a licence from the HTA for the processing and storage (and distribution and import/export if these activities are undertaken) of tissues and cells for human application. The HTA does not require researchers to publish their work in a scientific journal.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/4">The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 regulate clinical trials of stem cells that are medicinal products. Where products are intended to be developed for a full licence (marketing authorisation), they specify how research on the safety and efficacy of medicinal product in human participants should be conducted and criteria for ethics review. No clinical trial can begin without the approval of both the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee (GTAC). GTAC has United Kingdom-wide responsibility for the ethical oversight of clinical trials involving either gene therapy or cell therapies derived from stem cell lines.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/5">For products intended to be used therapeutically on a non-routine basis, ie under hospital exemption as per Article 28 of the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Regulations (1394/2007), these will normally be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure they fulfil the basic requirements of quality and safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.5/1">The UN currently estimates that the global population will grow to around 9 billion people by 2050, up from around 6.8 billion today. Almost all of this rapid population growth will be in developing countries, which will increasingly strain the abilities of Governments to deliver basic services for their people-such as education, health, food, clean water and sanitation. The UN estimates that 215 million women in developing countries would like to delay or avoid a pregnancy but do not have access to modern family planning methods. High fertility is associated with low female status, lack of girls' and women's education and empowerment, high risk of infant mortality and low household income. The Government are putting women and girls at the heart of our international development efforts and are determined to make modern methods of family planning available to at least 10 million more women, contributing to a wider goal of 100 million new contraceptive users by 2015.</p>
