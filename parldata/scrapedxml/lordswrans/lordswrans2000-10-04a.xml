	<p pid="a.218.5/1">You will be aware of the Millennium Commission's decision to provide a further grant of &pound;47 million to the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC). The decision was taken following an independent review of the financial situation commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers by NMEC. The resulting report estimated that a further &pound;47 million was required to cover all creditors' needs of NMEC, including current liabilities, contingent liabilities and the anticipated costs of an orderly wind-down. Early closure of the Dome is not a cheaper option. It would have resulted in an additional &pound;30-&pound;40 million in costs on top of the latest additional grant by the Millennium Commission; up to 5,000 jobs, for people directly and indirectly employed at the Dome, could be lost; creditors would go unpaid; small businesses would suffer; and tens of thousand of visitors and many schools with pre-booked tickets would be disappointed. Whilst the recent news has been disappointing, the commission and the Government have taken the sensible approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/2">Whether all or part of the &pound;47 million is used depends on the extent to which contingent liabilities crystallise, on actual wind-down costs and on achievement of the 4.5 million paying visitor volume target for the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.3/1">Funding for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is determined through the normal public expenditure process. Total expenditure by the CPS has increased in cash terms in each year since 1994-95, will increase in real terms in 2000-01 and will continue to do so over the spending review period until 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.3/2">Since 1994-95, the settlements for the CPS have been challenging. Performance against the CPS's timeliness indicators has been maintained by ensuring that scare resources have been directed to the immediate day to day business of prosecuting and by the continuing commitment and efforts of the CPS staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.3/3">The SR 2000 settlement for the CPS was a good one and, as a result, the CPS's budget in 2003-04 will be 8 per cent higher in real terms than in 2000-01. The increase in funding will allow the CPS to improve its overall performance, introduce direct communication with witnesses and implement a modernisation programme that will result in increased investment in information technology and accommodation infrastructure.</p>
