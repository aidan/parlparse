	<p pid="a.45.5/1">There is no trade embargo on Sudan. Companies make their own decisions based on commercial factors. Neither is there an embargo on development assistance. We do not believe Sudan can make sustained progress towards reducing poverty without peace and political stability. However, there is an EU arms embargo on Sudan which the UK helped to initiate in 1994. We implement this rigorously and expect it to remain for as long as the civil war continues.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.2/1">To determine whether or not a crime scene mark and a fingerprint impression have been made by the same person, the fingerprint examiner must carry out a process of analysis, comparison and evaluation by determining whether in each impression friction ridge features are of a compatible type; they are in the same relative position to each other in the ridge structure; they are in the same sequence; there is sufficient quantative and qualitative detail in each in agreement; and there are any areas of apparent or real discrepancy. The examiner must address all these issues before declaring that both mark and impression have been made by the same person.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.0/1">We have welcomed the Commission's intention to revise European Directive 86/609/EEC dealing with the protection of vertebrate animals used in scientific procedures. Home Office officials (representing the United Kingdom) attended the 19th meeting of National Competent Authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-29">29 November 2001</phrase> and offered some preliminary suggestions on possible amendments to the directive. Most of the suggestions are matters of updating or clarification and do not raise substantive issues of principle. Instead, they represent features of the United Kingdom system of controls that would make better provision for the protection of animals, and for a level playing field in economic terms if implemented at European level.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/2">We believe that the directive could be enhanced both by changes to the text and also by guidance on the definition and interpretation of key terms. We have recommended that consideration should be given to strengthening the status of Annex II of Directive 86/609/EEC, dealing with the housing and care of laboratory animals, by making it clear that Annex II sets out the minimum standards required rather than simply providing guidelines. We have not at this stage made any specific reference to the use of non-human primates.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.0/1">The major cause of BSE cases has been the contamination of ruminant feed with mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM) containing the disease agent. Measures in place to protect animal health have been significantly strengthened over time, notably in 1995 and 1996. Of course measures taken will not protect cattle already incubating the disease but will prevent further infection through feed. The normal range of the incubation period makes it inevitable that further cases, which were infected before the enhanced measures became effective, will continue to appear, albeit at a declining rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/2">More significant are BSE cases borne after <phrase class="date" code="1996-08-01">1 August 1996</phrase> when UK feed controls are considered to have been fully effective. The department continues to examine veterinary advice on the possible causes of all such cases for evidence of control failure or new routes of transmission of the disease. Such routes may include maternal transmission, environmental contamination or contamination of imported feed ingredients. To date, BSE has been confirmed in 14 animals born in the UK after <phrase class="date" code="1996-08-01">1 August 1996</phrase>.</p>
