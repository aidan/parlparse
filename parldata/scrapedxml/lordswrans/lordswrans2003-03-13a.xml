	<p pid="a.189.2/1">The Government have today published a circular on best value and performance improvement, containing guidance for principal local authorities about how to achieve best value and secure continuous improvement in delivering local services. It consolidates and replaces existing guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/2">The services provided by local authorities directly impact on everyone's quality of life. It is therefore vital that these services are delivered to a high standard and in ways that are responsive to the needs of their users.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/3">The circular emphasises the important role that best value can play in helping to drive up the quality of local services. It explains how authorities can make arrangements under best value to secure a well-trained and motivated workforce, to review performance effectively and to use the annual performance plans to record their priorities for improvement and achievements.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/4">It includes a code of practice on workforce matters in local government service contracts. The code will ensure that the provision of local services is not undermined by poor employment practices in respect of new joiners to contracted-out services. Partnerships with the private and voluntary sectors should be selected where these will drive up service performance standards, not in order to drive down staff terms and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/5">Authorities should use the guidance to continue to challenge how services are delivered and to look for new and innovative ways to deliver quality services.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/6">Today I am also laying an order requiring all best value authorities to consult recognised unions and employees' associations, and staff, when conducting best value reviews. This will ensure that better decisions are made, increase understanding of the reasons for those decisions and help authorities achieve continuous improvement in service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/7">Copies of the circular have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

This compares with four UK council &quot;transactional&quot; websites in 2002.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-03-13a.194.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="194"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030313/text/30313w02.htm#30313w02_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.194.5/1">Thus far, there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link depleted uranium (DU) with ill health. Many independent reports have been produced that consider the battlefield effects of using DU munitions, but none has found widespread DU contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel. The Royal Society reports on The Health Hazards of Depleted Uranium Munitions (2001, 2002) support the Ministry of Defence's view that risks to the health of soldiers on the battlefield are minimal except for a small number of extreme cases. No British troops have been exposed in extreme circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.5/2">However, the United States Government have carefully monitored the health of some of their soldiers who were exposed in extreme circumstances when DU rounds accidentally hit their vehicles during the Gulf conflict. Some 17 of them have had DU shrapnel embedded in their bodies for the past 12 years but do not show signs of health problems attributable to DU. The offspring of the highly-exposed United States veterans, amounting to some 60 children, are all healthy.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.5/3">With regard to a link between exposure to DU and birth defects, no studies have looked specifically at this relationship. There is no scientific or medical evidence from US studies of an excess of birth defects in Gulf veterans compared with appropriately selected control groups. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence believes that it is an important issue and therefore placed a contract in 1997, through the Medical Research Council, for an independent study of the reproductive health of United Kingdom Gulf veterans compared with a matched control group. This study has been completed at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and will report soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.5/4">The Ministry of Defence's assessment is that DU particulate remains highly localised to the points of impact where DU munitions have struck hard targets: only in these small areas would DU levels be significant enough to necessitate precautions to prevent or reduce possible intakes. Increasing amounts of independent research by eminent scientists within groups such as the Royal Society DU Working Group and the United Nations Environment Programme support this view.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.5/5">We are prepared to use DU tank munitions in future conflicts if necessary because they are the most effective anti-armour weapons. We have a duty to provide our troops with the best available equipment with which to protect themselves and to succeed in conflict. Therefore, British forces currently being deployed to the Gulf will have DU munitions available as part of their armoury.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.5/6">Appropriate safety instructions have been issued to those who have been deployed. These safety instructions make clear that the risks from DU are far lower than those from other hazards arising from military operations and that combat and life-saving activities should never be delayed on account of concern over DU. They describe the potential risks and include pragmatic advice on procedures for minimising any potential intake of DU dust. The emphasis is on avoiding situations where DU dust may be encountered and on wearing appropriate respiratory protective equipment and protective clothing when it is necessary to enter potentially contaminated areas. They also include procedures for transporting and handling DU ammunition. Radiation dosemeters have been issued to those who will spend time in tanks loaded with DU munitions, and biological monitoring will be available for all members of the Armed Forces if DU is used. This will provide verification of the adequacy of the safety precautions. The biological monitoring policy is published on MoD's Internet site at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/depleted-uranium/du-biomonitoring.htm">http://www.mod.uk/issues/depleted&ndash;uranium/du&ndash; biomonitoring.htm</a>. Biological monitoring will consist of urine tests for uranium and its isotopes.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">The FIST programme will bring the benefits of improved technology to the soldier by providing an integrated suite of personal equipment to enhance dismounted close combat capability. This will include the latest surveillance, target acquisition, navigation, communications and miniaturisation technologies, all integrated into robust, flexible and reliable military equipment, capable of operation anywhere in the world. It will further increase the tempo of our battlefield operations, ensuring British forces engaged on the battlefields of the future will be among the best equipped in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/2">Four companies were invited to compete for the role of FIST assessment phase prime contractor, Bae Systems Ltd, Marconi Mobile Ltd, Raytheon Systems Ltd and Thales Optronics Ltd, a division of Thales UK. All submitted strong bids. Following detailed consideration of the proposals, the four tenderers were reduced to two during August 2002. The final phase of the competition focused on the remaining companies' plans for the management of the assessment phase. After a further period of evaluation, the Ministry of Defence has today selected Thales Optronics Ltd as the prime contractor for the assessment phase.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/3">The contract with Thales UK has a value of &pound;20 million. The FIST assessment phase will sustain and create around 70 jobs at Thales plants in the UK. In time, the demonstration and manufacture phase, for which we retain the option to compete the requirement, will sustain and create many more.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/4">The assessment phase will last until 2006. An in-service date for FIST will not be set until the main investment decision, but current estimates are around the end of the decade.</p>

The agency sought advice from the Chairman of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) in the first instance, and then presented the risk assessment to the full committee. COT agreed with the CSM that consumption of Kava-kava is associated with liver toxicity and took the view that the evidence did not justify treating Kava-kava in foods differently from Kava-kava in medicines.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">The 1983 Review of Parliamentary Pay and Allowances (Cmnd. 8881-1) by the Top Salaries Review Body recommended that, in recognition of his pre-eminent position in the judiciary and his responsibilities as a whole, the Lord Chancellor's salary should be higher than that of the Lord Chief Justice. The Lord Chancellor's functions as head of the judiciary include, among other things, being President of the Supreme Court and having overall responsibility for the conduct of the judges and the lay magistracy. The recommendation was accepted by the Government and incorporated into the Ministerial and Other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991. This set the difference between the Lord Chancellor's salary and the Lord Chief Justice's at &pound;2,000. The Ministerial and Other Salaries Order 1996 subsequently increased this to &pound;2,500.

	<p pid="a.204.8/1">The pensions associated with the different offices are determined variously. Lord Chancellors have to retire from legal practice in order to take up office and do so on the contractual and statutory basis set out below. By convention they may not, on ceasing to be Lord Chancellor, resume legal practice regardless of how long they may have occupied the office and the pension therefore compensates for loss of future livelihood.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.8/2">The Lord Chancellor's salary is linked to the salary of the Lord Chief Justice and not the Cabinet Secretary under Section 3 (1) of the Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991, as amended by Article 4 of the Ministerial and other Salaries Order 1996. Provision for the Lord Chancellor's pension and lump sum is made in the Lord Chancellor's Pension Act 1832, the Parliamentary and Other Pensions Act 1972, as amended by the Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991 and the Judicial Pensions Act 1981. The SSRB has been asked to look at the remuneration of the office of Lord Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.8/3">The Lord Chief Justice receives a pension under the terms of either the Judicial Pensions Act 1981 or the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993, depending on the date of appointment to the judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.8/4">The Cabinet Secretary, as a serving civil servant, is eligible for membership of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme, the rules of which are made under the provisions of the Superannuation Act 1972.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.2/1">The Lord Chancellor's pension entitlement is met out of the Consolidated Fund and is not provided for via a pension fund. The notional cost of securing a pension on the open market would, all else being equal, increase in proportion to the level of pension to be secured. Therefore, the notional fund of &pound;2 million quoted previously (WA 142), and by reference to a salary of &pound;180,045, would increase to approximately (a) &pound;2.05 million when based on a salary of &pound;184,096 and (b) &pound;2.25 million when based on a salary of &pound;202,736. The SSRB has been asked to review the remuneration of the office of Lord Chancellor.</p>

This requirement is prominently displayed on driving licences.

	<p pid="a.206.5/2">Drivers' visual acuity is checked at the driving test by the reading of a number plate from a prescribed distance. Drivers can repeat this simple check themselves periodically throughout their driving career and are asked to notify DVLA if their eyesight falls below standard. Because of the potential for more serious consequences of accidents involving large vehicles, such as lorries and buses, drivers of these vehicles are required to undergo a medical examination, including an eyesight test, at age 45 and at five-yearly intervals thereafter until 65, from which time the examination is carried out annually.</p>
