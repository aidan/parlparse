It will also include further discussion on enlargement and the future of Europe, negotiations on the Doha development agenda, and discussions on the inter-institutional agreement between the Council, Commission and European Parliament, which will provide the necessary formal basis for the decisions on EU spending over 2007&ndash;13 taken at the December 2005 European Council.</p>

	<p pid="c.124.0/1">I am informed by Waterways Ireland that the decision to purchase a small gift for all staff in the organisation was made on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-03">3 December 2002</phrase>, and applied to 2002 only.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/2">The senior management group at Waterways Ireland did, however, give separate consideration and approval on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-04">4 December 2003</phrase> to the purchase of a further small gift for all staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/3">I also understand from Waterways Ireland that three quotations were sought for the purchase of chocolates in 2002. Only one quotation was received and the contract to supply chocolates was awarded to that company.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/4">The amount of expenditure involved did not require a cost benefit analysis to be undertaken. It is believed that all the chocolates were eaten.</p>

	<p pid="c.124.6/1">The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), an executive agency of Defra, has been carrying out disease surveillance of wild bird populations since August 2001. Post-mortem examinations are carried out on any incidents of mass mortality affecting wild birds, which are reported via ornithological organisations or via the general public. In addition to screening for important viruses, such as West Nile virus and avian influenza, other examinations such as bacteriology are carried out and alternative diagnoses are recorded. To date 2,103 wild birds from 107 species have been examined. The results are available on the Internet at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/vla/science/science-end-wildlife.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/vla/science/science-end-wildlife.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.6/2">In addition VLA examines the carcasses of wildlife, including birds, for evidence of poisoning on behalf of the Pesticides Safety Directorate of Defra. The annual reports of the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme can be viewed at <a href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/environment">www.pesticides.gov.uk/environment</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.6/3">No specific analyses for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are included in any of the assays carried out under either scheme. There is currently no active research into this area being carried out at VLA.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.6/4">The Animal By-Products Order 1999 prohibits the disposal of animal carcases on land and requires that they are disposed of promptly thus minimising the opportunity for scavenging by wildlife.</p>

	<p pid="c.126.0/1">The Government understand Professor Morgan's concerns. Custody should be the last resort and high numbers in custody can impact on the scope of establishments to provide positive regimes for young people. The Government have been active through the intensive supervision and surveillance programme in providing demanding community interventions for young people who might otherwise be sent to custody. The Youth Justice Board is working to promote high quality advice to courts on sentencing options in individual cases and greater geographical consistency in the sentencing of young people. The Government recognise that there are some young people with serious mental health problems in custodial establishments. The Home Office and the Youth Justice Board are working with the Department of Health on mental health provision for under-18s. Extra secure hospital places have been made available and further places are planned. We are also seeking to improve provision for young people in custody who have less serious mental health difficulties.</p>
