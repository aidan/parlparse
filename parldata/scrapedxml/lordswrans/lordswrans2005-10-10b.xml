	<p pid="b.3.5/1">DfID has allocated &pound;65 million to meet reconstruction needs in the Tsunami affected region. To date, &pound;41 million of this money has been committed, while the remaining &pound;24 million of the allocation has not yet been programmed.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.5/2">In Indonesia, the joint government/donor needs assessment undertaken shortly after the tsunami estimated damages and losses of around US$4.5 billion. The UK has committed &pound;36 million to Indonesia, of which &pound;6 million has so far been paid out to the Multi Donor Trust Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.5/3">In Sri Lanka, the total cost of reconstruction and rehabilitation is estimated to be some US$2.2 billion. Pledges of support in excess of US$3 billion have been secured, which is more than ample to meet the required needs. However, we are concerned that the magnitude of the reconstruction task might be beyond the capacity of local authorities in Sri Lanka to implement efficiently. We are therefore working with the Government and donors to develop programmes to augment the planning and implementation capacity of local government, and have allocated &pound;2 million to meet the costs. In addition, DfID is meeting 10 per cent. of the cost of Sri Lanka's interest payments on their debt to the World Bank. This is worth some &pound;41 million over the next 10 years. The government of Sri Lanka have agreed that the funds released will be allocated to tsunami recovery and poverty reduction programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.5/4">DfID provided &pound;1.6 million towards the humanitarian and recovery effort in the Maldives but has not directly provided commitments towards reconstruction, as we do not have a bilateral programme in this country. However, we are working to encourage the EC to allocate more funding to the Maldives. We have also contributed to the financing of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The World Bank has provided $14 million in financial support to the Maldives reconstruction and recovery programme, while the Asian Development Bank is providing an initial new assistance of $20 million in grants to help reconstruction and rehabilitation.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-10-10b.4.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="4"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51010w01.htm#51010w01_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.4.2/1">Aid in response to the tsunami is reaching all affected sections of the community in Indonesia. International donor and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are working very closely with the Government of Indonesia (GoI) in responding to the areas of need, as identified by the GoI. Regular monitoring and reporting from the UN indicates that in a number of areas, and with the large resources available, recovery programmes are able to offer more than just meeting the basic needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.2/2">The sheer scale of the devastation and its impact on the local administration and infrastructure placed many constraints on the delivery of the assistance in the early stages but the government of Indonesia's strong system of decentralised government and comprehensive planning approach has put the reconstruction efforts to the forefront. The establishment of a specific Agency for Reconstruction and Recovery is proving to be very effective and has recently approved over US$408 million for 96 programmes covering such areas as infrastructure, housing, education, health and economic development.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.2/3">In Sri Lanka emergency assistance immediately after the tsunami was promptly provided to all affected communities. The government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) co-operated effectively in the north and east. The absence of deaths from disease and serious illness in communities devastated by the tsunamis provides the clearest evidence of success. The Department for International Development (DfID) is currently undertaking a review and evaluation of the emergency response to substantiate this.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.2/4">Gareth Thomas MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at DfID, visited Sri Lanka in June to assess the recovery effort. He found that, although reconstruction and recovery assistance is also reaching all affected communities, it is reaching some communities sooner than others.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.2/5">There are several reasons for this. First, the size of the recovery programme is enormous and there are literally hundreds of non-governmental organisations implementing recovery programmes. Co-ordinating these programmes, ensuring consistency with government plans, and equitable delivery and standards across the island is an enormous task for the Sri Lankan authorities. There are limited administrative and technical resources and local government authorities are over-stretched. Inevitably there are bureaucratic delays and frustrations. Donors, including DfID are working with the Government to strengthen their administrative structures and to make the delivery of recovery programmes as efficient as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.2/6">In addition, in some districts of Sri Lanka, the availability of land is a major constraint and is delaying resettlement and recovery. To prevent damage from future tsunamis the government of Sri Lanka have forbidden any reconstruction or new construction within a buffer zone stretching 100 metres from the coast (200 metres in the north and east). Many people previously lived within this zone, and many schools and medical facilities were also situated there. It is proving difficult to secure alternative land where families can be relocated, and where schools and medical facilities can be rebuilt. As a result some people are having to remain in temporary accommodation longer than we all would wish. The situation is further complicated because many of the displaced families were illegally squatting before the tsunamis. DfID and other donors continue to encourage the government of Sri Lanka to be flexible and pragmatic in the application of the buffer zone regulation. In response, the government of Sri Lanka have commissioned an inquiry into the buffer zone and have indicated that they may consider flexible implementation where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.2/7">There has been concern that the lack of an agreement between the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE on how to manage donor assistance was delaying the delivery of assistance to communities in areas contested by the LTTE. The recent agreement concluded between the Government and the LTTE (the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure, P-TOMS) provides a mechanism for ensuring that these areas have access to assistance. We are optimistic that the legal challenge to establishing the structure will be overcome and that it will be made operational in September.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.2/1">It is important that the affected governments and communities are better prepared for all future crises. The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) has set up an interim Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning Centre which involves both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the United States' National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. The interim system covers Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives and other countries in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.2/2">National contact points have been identified and are managed by the IOC team in Paris. National needs assessments are ongoing and a coherent plan for the final system is due by September this year. The first meeting of the Intergovernmental Coordinating Group for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Early Warning System takes place in Australia in early August. It is hoped that the final system will be in place by July 2006. We and other donors are awaiting the final design to decide how we might best support them.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.2/3">The UK supports the creation of this system and other disaster risk reduction measures. DfID has allocated &pound;7.5 million for disaster risk reduction measures to tsunami affected countries. This will include support to community-level work to raise awareness of danger signals from early warning systems and ensure they know how to respond to best protect themselves and their families.</p>

	<p pid="b.6.2/1">Addressing the training needs of those health professionals working with people with autistic spectrum disorders is the responsibility of the appropriate regulatory bodies. They set standards for the pre-registration training of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals, approve the education institutions providing training and decide on curricula. We do share a commitment with them that all health professionals are trained so that they have the skills and knowledge to deliver high-quality health services to all sections of the population.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.2/2">Post-registration training needs for National Health Service staff are decided against local NHS priorities, through appraisal processes and training needs analyses informed by local delivery plans and the needs of the service. Local authorities and health service providers decide how best to provide services to meet the needs of the individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.2/3">We have, however, produced guidance to help local planning of both services and training. These include Valuing People: A New strategy for people with learning disabilities (2001) recognising that many people with severe and profound learning disabilities have autistic behaviours, even if not formally recognised; and <i>Green Light: How Good Are Your Mental Health Services for People with Learning Disabilities?</i> (March 2004), a guide to developing good services to meet the mental health needs of people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.2/4">In addition, in order to promote the development of local protocols for collaboration between specialist learning disability services and specialist mental health services, we have added a learning disabilities dimension to the mental health national service framework (1999) local implementation planning process in 2002 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.2/5">Working with the Teacher Training Agency, the Department for Education and Skills is carrying forward a range of proposals designed to improve the special educational needs skills and confidence of trainee, newly qualified and established teachers.</p>

	<p pid="b.12.2/1">The Secretary of State announced this week that we have expanded the very successful Bookstart programme which currently provides free books to every baby in England at around eight months. The aim is to encourage parents to share books with their children from the earliest age and to instil a life-long love of reading. From later this year, the programme will be extended to provide free books, library invitations and supporting materials to every child 18 months and three years, as well as continuing delivery of the eight-month pack. The programme delivers these packs through health visitors, librarians and early years practitioners. Not only does this reinforce the importance of parental involvement in children's learning, it provides an informal route for parents to access professional support for their own literacy skills development.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.2/2">The department and the primary and secondary national strategies provide a range of materials to support teachers, school librarians and others to ensure that their schools both provide high quality teaching and learning in reading, and promote an environment which encourages children's enthusiasm for reading.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.2/3">In addition, the National Reading Campaign, delivered on our behalf by the National Literacy Trust, promotes reading across the community and aims to ensure that as many people as possible enjoy the pleasures and benefits that independent reading and reading with others can bring. A key element of the campaign includes the reading champions initiative which finds and celebrates positive male role models for reading in educational and community settings and seeks to change boys' attitudes to reading.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.2/4">We encourage schools to develop study support activities which focus on literacy, including reading and book clubs, whether they take place on the school premises or elsewhere such as the local library. Our Playing for Success study support centres which open out of school hours use sport as a theme in their reading activities to encourage children to read. We have also funded the national charity ContinYou to develop resource materials to help schools set up and maintain reading clubs.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.0/1">Over 4 million people work in the children's workforce, of which nearly 2 million are unpaid volunteers.

	<p pid="b.13.3/1">Climate change is a global issue and we have introduced many measures aimed at combating, mitigating and adapting to climate change. Some measures have been implemented directly to tackle climate change. Where the primary aim of the policy is not to tackle climate change, we have tried to ensure that impact on climate change is fully incorporated into the policy. At least &pound;545 million is spent annually on spending policies that tackle climate change, but this is a conservative estimate as there are other spending policies that also have climate change benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.3/2">The figure of &pound;545 million includes energy research and development, contributions to EU research programmes, national research councils and government department research spend, Warm Front and organisations (Carbon Trust and Energy Savings Trust) that help businesses and households be more efficient in their use of energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.3/3">The Government also spend &pound;570 million per annum on flooding and coastal defences each year, some of which will clearly be in response to pressures arising from the need to adapt to climate change.</p>

Manufacturers would still have to prepare a scientific justification and might be required to withdraw products from the market subsequently judged to be unfounded or misleading.</p>

The detailed breakdown of the &pound;250 million for individual schools will made available in autumn 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.8/2">The DfES recognises the significant role of voluntary sector and community organisations in supporting schools and local authorities (LAs) to deliver extended services. They will be key to the successful delivery of extended services and local authorities and schools will need to draw on their provision and expertise. Initial guidance for schools and LAs on partnership working with voluntary sector providers is available through the extended schools prospectus, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June 2005</phrase>. Also a &quot;know how&quot; leaflet entitled<i>, Involving and Working with the Voluntary and Community Sectors</i>, available through the extended schools website</p>
	<p pid="b.25.8/3">(<a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools">www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools</a>) offers practical guidance and information on partnership working, engaging with voluntary and community organisations and useful contacts. Schools and LAs will want to consider how the strengths and good practice from voluntary organisations that they work with can benefit pupils, parents, families and the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.8/4">The NRT (National Remodelling Team) and ContinYou will be supporting local authorities in developing their extended services and in doing so will support them in brokering partnerships with the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.8/5">There are many voluntary and community sector organisations that schools will know through their existing contacts and other partnership working, such as through education improvement partnerships (formerly know as foundation partnerships). Local authorities, through established contacts, can provide advice about wider groups, agencies and services and neighbourhood-level initiatives that are willing to work in partnership to develop extended services.</p>

Statistics for Operation TELIC are still being developed and collected, but this is a complex and lengthy process: In the first instance, we plan to release mortality data for Operation TELIC in respect of serving Armed Forces personnel, and in the longer term our aim is to include those who have been discharged.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.5/1">The aim of the primary care access target is that everyone should be able to see a general practitioner within 48 hours, not that they may only be seen within this time frame. Latest official figures show that virtually all patients can now do so. The Healthcare Commission's findings are not directly comparable. They are based on a survey of patients earlier this year and the 25 per cent. seen outside the target timeframe include patients who chose to wait longer.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/2">The Government, however, accept that there is a gap between the data reported to the Department of Health by primary care trusts (PCTs) from their practices and public perception of access, as reported in patient surveys.

A number of best practice resources are available to help PCTs and general practice to do this, including support from the national primary care trust development team and a leaflet on adopting patient-sensitive appointment systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.6/1">The G8 leaders have declared their intention to aim for as close as possible universal access to AIDS treatment to all those who need it by 2010. Limited health systems capacity is a major constraint to achieving this. Without major improvements to existing health care services, it will not be possible to scale up good quality AIDS treatment and care, including access to anti-retroviral drugs. More effective services will help remove bottlenecks in drug production and supply. They will rely on more doctors and nurses being employed, establishing reliable and accountable supply chain management and reporting systems, better efforts to promote awareness and availability of services, non-governmental organisation (NGO) mobilisation to make treatment effective, and a massive scaling up of voluntary and provider-initiated HIV testing facilities so people can find out if they need treatment. The G8 leaders have committed to working with our partners in Africa to address these needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.6/2">The G8 leaders have also committed to working with the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and other international bodies to establish the best way forward. We have asked the international bodies to develop and implement a package for HIV prevention, treatment and care, which will firmly embed action to secure universal access to treatment by 2010 within comprehensive AIDS programmes. To begin this process the UK will be bringing together our G8 partners, with international organisations including UNAIDS, the WHO and World Bank, with some representatives of African governments and civil society in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.6/3">In September, there will also be other opportunities to take this forward, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank annual meetings where the expansion of health services, alongside supporting more effective AIDS programmes, is a key priority. On 5 and <phrase class="date" code="">6 September</phrase>, the UK will host the Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and at this time we will also receive feedback on the Global Task Team's work to intensify technical support to ensure the increased AIDS financing is used to best effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.6/4">The UK Government has already committed to spend at least &pound;1.5 billion to tackle HIV and AIDS over the next three years, and Hilary Benn, the Secretary of State for the Department for International Development, recently announced a doubling of funding to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. The doubling, from &pound;51 million for 2006 and &pound;51 million for 2007 to &pound;100 million for each of these 2 years, makes the UK the fourth largest donor to the Fund. The UK is already the second largest donor overall in the fight against AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.6/5">In addition to the UK's direct investments in AIDS, DfID is already a major donor to the health sector, including through budget support, and we will be doing more. Our support in Uganda helped the Government end user fees for basic services, and we have invested &pound;100 million in the Malawi health service. We will learn from these and other innovative approaches and take similar steps in the countries that want our help.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.2/1">The HMRC spring departmental report 2005 fully satisfies all aspects of reporting requirements as defined by H M Treasury. The report is both forward and backward looking, sets out plans and information about performance and presents a clear picture of the department's aims, activities, functions, and performance. In addition the report outlines progress against all PSA targets, and clearly explains HMRC objectives, organisation and business processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.2/2">The report also satisfies the reporting commitments given by Lord Goldsmith during the passage of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Bill by providing information on work preparatory to the integration, as well as future plans for HMRC's organisation and delivery plans. The further reporting commitments made by Lord Goldsmith will also be satisfied by future departmental reports over the rest of this financial year.</p>

By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately, and that remains the case. Although it is impossible to determine accurately how many people are in the UK illegally the Home Office published a report which included an estimate of the size of the illegal migrant population in the UK in 2001. It should be noted that the report included an estimate, not an accurate or definitive figure. In February 2005, we published a five-year strategy for asylum and immigration, <i>Controlling Our Borders: making migration work in Britain</i>, which sets out plans for removing those illegally residing in the UK. The strategy sets out plans to ensure that by the end of 2005, the monthly rate of removals exceeds the number of unfounded applications so that we can begin to deal with the backlog.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.11/1">There are a number of different ways in which countries are classified. Under the UN country classification the Maldives is a least developed country due to its vulnerability as a small island state, though it is due to graduate from this status after a three-year transition period. Under the World Bank classification the Maldives is a lower middle income country (LMIC). Both sets of classifications are reviewed regularly, though not since the tsunami struck last December.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.11/2">The joint needs assessment for the Maldives, made in consultation with the government of the Maldives and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), estimated the impact of the tsunami on the economy. Although overall economic growth has decelerated to about 1 per cent. this year, it estimated that the per capita GDP will be $2,800 in 2005, which is well above the threshold for a lower middle income country, and the economy is recovering well.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.11/3">Humanitarian assistance to the Maldives in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami was based on need rather than country classification. DfID provided &pound;1.6 million towards the humanitarian and recovery effort directly following the tsunami. We have also contributed to the financing of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The World Bank has provided US$14 million in financial support to the Maldives reconstruction and recovery programme, while the Asian Development Bank is providing assistance of $20 million in grants to help reconstruction and rehabilitation. We are now working to encourage the EC to allocate more funding to the Maldives for reconstruction.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.2/2" qnum="HL1355">What steps they are taking, in view of a recent survey of junior doctors by the British Medical Association, to ensure that junior doctors do not leave the National Health Service if they are unable to secure an appropriate training post as a result of the move to the new Modernising Medical Careers training system.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.3/1">The British Medical Association survey quoted &quot;over a third&quot; of the 235 respondents as not having secured, at that time, a further training post on completion of their current contract. This is a very small return to draw significant conclusions out of a total trainee doctor population of 49,000 in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.3/2">The aim of the Department of Health is to ensure there are enough doctors to deliver the high-quality services required by patients and the National Health Service. As a result the total trainee doctor population in England has risen from 30,915 in 1997 to 43,406 in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.3/3">Transition arrangements for Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) have yet to be finalised and have consequently not yet had an impact on this issue. There is no plan to reduce training opportunities as a result of MMC.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.2/1">Yes. It remains the Government's view, given that the demand by people all around the world to participate in online gambling continues to grow, that it is better to provide opportunities here for the well regulated provision of facilities for such gambling rather than leave consumers with the option of using only gambling sites which may be at best inadequately regulated and at worst downright criminal. The British gambling industry is well placed to make the most of the opportunities which Parliament has now agreed, following the advice of the independent Gambling Review Body, the law here should make available. We are determined that the system of regulation of online gambling, which it will be the responsibility of the new Gambling Commission to administer, should be second to none in terms of ensuring fairness, propriety and the protection of children and the vulnerable; and we shall be actively seeking to promote international agreement about the standards of regulation which should apply to forms of gambling which are transnational in nature.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.3/1">Member nominated trustees add value to trustee boards by increasing the variety of skills and experience; they bring a different perspective to bear on trustee discussions and decisions, and the involvement of members in the scheme can increase their sense of ownership in their pension arrangements. The Government believe that scheme members and the sponsoring employer should have the right to nominate an equal proportion of a scheme's trustees, and are therefore proposing to increase the proportion of member-nominated trustees from one third to one half.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.3/2">In considering the timing of this change, the Government recognise that pension schemes need time to implement other changes introduced by the Pensions Act 2004, including the changes to the existing member-nominated trustee provisions which may take until the latter part of 2007 before they are fully in place. We have, therefore, in the consultation document on the draft regulations on member-nominated trustees and directors suggested that the move to one half member nominated trustees takes place in 2009. This will give schemes a reasonable amount of time to prepare for the change. We will consider the timing of the change further in the light of the comments made as part of the consultation exercise.</p>

	<p pid="b.70.11/1">The provision of more affordable housing is a key priority and we have a range of policies to deliver this. <i>Sustainable Communities: Homes for All</i>, published in January 2005, sets out the Government's strategy to offer everyone a decent home at a price they can afford. It includes action over the next five years to provide more homes where they are needed, while enhancing the environment, and offers new and improved options for hundreds of thousands of social tenants, first-time buyers and key workers who want to own their own home. It also sets out plans to provide better conditions and more choice to those who rent, with decent homes for all social tenants and to revitalise communities suffering from low demand and abandoned housing, and create more mixed communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.11/2">The aim of rent restructuring is to ensure that tenants have a clear and transparent choice of rental properties regardless of whether the landlord is a local authority or a registered social landlord. Social rents are, and will remain, well below market rents.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.2/1">Where a person goes into residential care and receives assistance from social services with the cost, the &quot;liable relative&quot; rules give local authorities discretionary powers to ask the person's spouse to make payments towards the costs. This is now widely regarded as anachronistic, and we are committed to repeal the &quot;liable relative&quot; rules at the earliest opportunity. However, because these rules are in the National Assistance Act 1948, repealing them will require primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/2">We estimate the costs of repealing the &quot;liable relatives&quot; rules to be &pound;3 million to &pound;4 million per annum. Changes were made to the charging arrangements in relation to savings credit and, as a result, local authorities gained around &pound;5 million per annum. This enables the local authorities to cover the costs of the repeal of the &quot;liable relatives&quot; rules. We would encourage local authorities to use this money to discontinue use of the &quot;liable relative&quot; rules.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.0/1">This information is not available in the form requested. On both road and rail, a wide range of projects contributes to improved safety, but the costs are not individually attributed to safety benefits specifically.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/2">For road safety we continue to develop and implement our road safety strategy. The 2004 casualty figures show we are now over halfway towards our 2010 target of a 40 per cent. reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured, and over three-quarters of the way towards our 50 per cent. target for children.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/3">The road safety strategy is broad and involves activities ranging from local road safety engineering schemes to education and publicity campaigns. The department does not hold records of the costs of each of these activities, aside from the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/4">&pound;14 million per year is spent on THINK! road safety campaigns;</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/5">&pound;4.5 million per year is spent on road safety research; and</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/6">local highway authorities in England spend &pound;90 million per year on local safety engineering schemes, and &pound;21 million on education, training and publicity. The casualty reduction benefits of local safety engineering schemes in England are estimated at &pound;281 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/7">Rail safety statistics have shown a gradual improvement over the years and this country's rail safety record is not out of line with that of other European countries. Neither the Government nor the industry hold information related to the costs of safety improvements. This is because newer rolling stock, signalling and infrastructure is safer than that which it replaces but &quot;safety&quot; is not the prime reason for the replacement. A better trained workforce is safer than otherwise but the &quot;safety&quot; element is not separately costed or evaluated. The only measures required by Government on safety grounds in recent years were the fitting of the train protection and warning system (TPWS), to reduce the incidents of signals passed at danger, and the requirement that Mark 1 (slam door) rolling stock be replaced by the end of November 2005. TPWS fitment was costed at &pound;575 million, with the risk from signals passed at danger falling by 76 per cent. since March 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/8">The rail industry's priorities for safety are set out in the <i>Railway Strategic Safety Plan 2005</i>, produced by the Rail Safety and Standards Board and available on its website <a href="http://www.rssb.co.uk">www.rssb.co.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.75.5/1">The joint Chief Inspectors' report recognises that there have been major developments in policy on children's services but it raises a number of concerns, including the care of children in residential settings, all of which the Government are considering carefully and will respond to in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.5/2">There is already much good practice. For example, the Chief Inspectors found that where guidance&mdash;in particular, the framework for the assessment of children in need and their families&mdash;is being used effectively for new placements to inform the care plan, the higher quality of information has led to better outcomes for these children.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.5/3">Residential care homes should have a statement of purpose&mdash;this should prevent potential perpetrators being placed with potential younger victims. Homes are also expected to have explicit processes to ensure that children are protected and positive behaviour is supported.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.5/4">Residential special schools are also required to have a statement of purpose and are subject to the national minimum standards. The standards cover admissions for example, schools are required to make reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary information about a child including about any matters that might make a child vulnerable or a danger to others. They are required to take account of the effects of a child's admission on the existing group of children. A written placement plan is also required for each boarding pupil specifying how the school will care for the child in accordance with his/her assessed needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.5/5">The Government also recognise the importance and impact of a well-trained workforce on these issues. That is why the children's workforce strategy, published by my department on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, made improving the recruitment and retention of social workers a key priority. The strategy commits the Government to looking at further measures to increase the supply of social workers and calls on local authorities to adopt best practice in recruitment, training and development, working practices, and leadership and supervision.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.3/2">The first application, in which the Lord Chancellor was the respondent, concerned the exercise of powers to make policy development grants to political parties under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 and was dismissed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-10">10 April 2003</phrase> with no order made for costs.</p>

In a petition to the House of Lords, leave for a further appeal was granted but this appeal was later discontinued on the basis that Sinn Fein would continue to be liable for the costs of the original appeal to the Court of Appeal and for the appeal to the House of Lords to the point of discontinuance. The bill of costs in respect of this application is currently being drawn up.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/4">The second application, which challenged the decision by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to impose a financial penalty on Sinn Fein in light of the first report by the Independent Monitoring Commission, was dismissed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-14">14 February 2005</phrase> with an order that Sinn Fein pay the respondent's costs.

Unfortunately, this website is not always updated. We regularly press the AU to improve the availability of public information, and will continue to do so. In the mean time, the monthly reports of the UN Secretary-General on Darfur are available on the UN's website (<a href="http://www.un.org">www.un.org</a>). These include a useful reporting on the security situation, drawing on the AU's assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.3/2">The view of the AU and the UN Secretary-General is that the overall level of violence in Darfur this year has been lower than in 2004. Importantly, attacks against civilians, and civilian deaths, have decreased.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.3/3">Banditry, including cattle looting, harassment of humanitarian workers, isolated attacks on civilians and incidents of rape continued throughout April and May. No large-scale attacks by the parties to the ceasefire agreement&mdash;the government of Sudan, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) or the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)&mdash;were reported in April. However on <phrase class="date" code="">7 April</phrase>, an Arab militia attacked the village of Khor Abeche in Southern Darfur, reportedly killing around 17 civilians. There were a number of clashes between the parties in the second half of May, in the run up to the resumption of the Abuja peace talks on <phrase class="date" code="">10 June</phrase>. These clashes mostly took the form of small-scale rebel attacks against convoys of the government forces or police, with the SLA appearing to be the main perpetrator. There were also incidents of fighting between the SLA and the JEM. There have been no reports in recent months of attacks by the government of Sudan's airforce.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-10-10b.84.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="84"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51010w24.htm#51010w24_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.84.2/1">The supermarket sector was the subject of a wide ranging investigation by the Competition Commission during 1999-2000. In its report, published in October 2000, the commission identified a number of practices which, when carried on by any of the major supermarkets, adversely affected the competitiveness of some of their suppliers with the result that the suppliers were likely to invest less and spend less on new product development and innovation, leading to lower quality and less consumer choice. The commission considered that this was likely to result in fewer new entrants to the supplier market than otherwise. It also considered that certain of practices gave the major buyers substantial advantage over other smaller retailers, whose competitiveness is likely to suffer as a result, again leading to a reduction in consumer choice. It concluded that the exercise of some of these practices by the largest supermarkets operated against the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/2">The commission recommended as a remedy the establishment of a code of practice which would put relations between supermarkets and their suppliers on a clearer and more predictable basis. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) subsequently drew up a code of practice which entered into force in March 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/3">More generally, the commission noted that in a competitive environment it would expect most or all of the impact of various shocks to the farming industry to have fallen mainly on farmers rather than on retailers; but the existence of buyer power among some of the main parties had meant that the burden of cost increases in the supply chain had fallen disproportionately heavily on small suppliers such as farmers.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/4">Although the commission's investigation did not encompass the terms and conditions of supermarkets workers or those of supplying companies it did consider the employment effects of opening new supermarkets. It found no consistent and quantifiably harmful impact on retail employment at the local level. National data indicated that gains in retail productivity between 1991 and 1995 had helped to absorb extra sales with broadly stable levels of labour. The commission noted that if fewer full-time and more part-time jobs were available this will have disadvantaged some, but proved attractive to others. The commission did not believe there had been any significant net loss of employment, but noted that if there had, it was not on a sufficient scale to justify interference in the process of change.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/5">The issue of buyer power, and its impact on suppliers, was also considered by the commission in its September 2003 report on the various bids for Safeway. In this context, the commission identified a number of adverse effects that would flow from the acquisition of Safeway by Asda, Sainsbury's or Tesco. One of these was that as a result of the further imbalance in the respective bargaining positions of Asda, Sainsbury's or Tesco and its suppliers, there would be a further general weakening of some suppliers' positions. In some cases, levels of investment in new products or manufacturing techniques would tend to be lower or slower than would otherwise have been the case, with adverse effects on products innovation and diversity. The commission went on to note that the acquisition by Morrisons might be expected to have a limited adverse effect as a result of the increased imbalance in its bargaining power <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> suppliers, with similar but more limited effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/6">In July 2004 Defra published research by London Economics which analysed trends in retail/farm gate price spreads, (that is, the difference between the price paid to the producer and the retail price) with particular reference to concentration in the retail market. The research found little evidence of trends in these price spreads being associated with increased concentration in the UK retail market.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/7">The Government have made no specific assessment of the impact of increased concentration in the supermarket sector and of practices in that sector on the terms and conditions of the employees either of supermarkets or of their suppliers. However, in 2004 Defra commissioned research designed to measure the demand for temporary workers in the agriculture, horticulture and primary processing industries, and the role of gangmasters in meeting that demand. This research was commissioned in response to a recommendation by the EFRA Select Committee in the report of its inquiries into the activities of gangmasters in the agriculture industry. The research report included an independent assessment by the researchers of how the changing nature of the food chain has influenced employment patterns and practices in agriculture, horticulture and primary processing industry. The researchers reported that both retailers and their suppliers have benefited from improved co-ordination and co-operation within the food chain. The researchers also reported the view expressed by some within the food chain that greater integration can lead to poor and illegal employment practices. Defra has provided copies of the report to the EFRA Select Committee. We will also be placing copies in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/8">The environmental and social impact of food distribution systems was researched in a Defra-commissioned study by AEA Technology to assess the validity of &quot;food miles&quot; as a key performance indicator of the food industry's sustainability. The study into this complex area found that the external costs associated with UK food transport are just over &pound;9 billion per year. Of this, &pound;5 billion is attributed to the costs of congestion, of which half is attributed to the activities of the food industry and half to shopping trips by consumers in cars. The study took full account of trends in transport logistics and retailing, including consolidation within the industry. The Government have challenged the food industry in the draft food industry sustainability strategy being developed in partnership with the sector to reduce the external costs of its domestic food transportation by 20 per cent. by 2012. Copies of the research findings, which were published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-15">15 July 2005</phrase>, have been placed in the Library of the House. No further research on this issue is currently being planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/9">The OFT considered the need for a further investigation of the grocery market in its March 2005 report <i>Supermarkets: The code of practice and other competition issues</i>. After considering comments on the findings of this report, the OFT announced in August 2005 that that there was no case for the referral of the grocery market to the Competition Commission for investigation or for a market study. However, the OFT will continue to refer acquisitions by supermarkets which are likely to give rise to a substantial lessening of competition to the Competition Commission or to obtain undertakings in lieu.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.2/10">The Government believe it is in supermarkets' own interest to agree fair and equitable arrangements for dealing with their suppliers, which will ensure the sustainability of a UK-based supply chain. The Government are considering whether there is further action that they can take to help bring this about.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.11/1">The early period in custody is recognised as a very vulnerable time for young people, therefore a number of procedures have been designed to relieve their distress and enhance safety. On arrival into custody, every young person is interviewed to determine their immediate needs and level of vulnerability. This screening process assesses the likelihood of the young person self-harming and identifies the need for further in depth assessment. Where a risk of self-harm or suicide is identified, appropriate action is taken to minimise it. The Youth Justice Board, in partnership with H M Prison Service, is currently developing an improved screening process to be piloted in six establishments during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.11/2">Information is provided to the young person on the reception process and the support available to them if they feel under stress or depressed, and they are offered the opportunity to telephone someone who may be concerned about their well-being. They are also given a first night pack (including reading and writing materials, a radio and phone card or equivalent) and any additional items required. Diversionary materials, such as magazines/newspapers (and televisions/videos where possible) are provided in reception.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.11/3">Following the first night, every young person starts an induction process which introduces them to the culture and rules of the establishment and details the support available to them. During this process a personal officer/caseworker will be assigned to them to act as an advisor and source of day-to-day support.</p>
