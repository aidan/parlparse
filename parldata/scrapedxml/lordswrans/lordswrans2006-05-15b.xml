	<p pid="b.5.2/1">The Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva has been unable to reach consensus on a programme of work since 1997. The issues on the agenda are: nuclear disarmament; a fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT); prevention of an arms race in outer space; new types of weapons of mass destruction and radiological weapons; negative security assurances; and a comprehensive programme on disarmament and transparency in armaments.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.2/2">No individual country is responsible for blocking progress in the CD on any particular agenda item. Rather, many countries continue to view the agenda as a package and link progress on one issue to that of another. This has led to the unwelcome lack of consensus agreement on any of the agenda items. The UK believes the CD should move away from the package approach and deal with individual issues that are ripe for negotiation. That is why we continue to call for the immediate commencement of negotiations on an FMCT and look forward to discussions on this agenda item in the CD later this month.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.5/1">Her Majesty's Government were not involved in the assessment on the conservation status of common hippos, which resulted in their being added to the IUCN (World Conservation Union) Red List of Endangered Species.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.5/2">The IUCN publishes a full analysis of the data held on their Red List every three to four years, using their own categories and criteria for classifying species at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.5/3">We understand that the common hippo was added to the 2006 Red List, following a population and status assessment undertaken by the Hippo Subgroup&mdash;a specialist group of the Pigs, Peccaries and Hippos Species Survival Commission (SSC), one of many SSCs established by the IUCN.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.5/4">Common hippos are considered by the IUCN to be threatened by human settlements and agricultural development, both of which have compromised much of the wetland habitats on which hippos rely. Poaching for meat and ivory has also contributed to reductions in common hippo populations.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.6/1">The operations directorate within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) has responsibility for the conditions within immigration removal centres; within this directorate, detention services is directly responsible for any improvement in these conditions and the development of standards within immigration removal centres. A key improvement relating to the care of detainees within centres is the focus upon the length of stay. There has been a restructuring of IND services within centres to reduce this to a minimum. This has taken the form of the development of contact teams led by a team leader who is also responsible for monitoring the proper delivery of the contract with the private sector contractors, and the service delivery within the HMP-run centres (Dover, Haslar and Lindholme). The team leaders facilitate a contact-based service providing detainees with up-to-date information from the casework teams dealing with ports, and other authorities, which hold details of individual cases. Detention services gives continual attention to the regimes within centres; regimes generally consist of education provision, activities (sports, games, and work from outside groups) religious affairs and ancillary care such as medical facilities and catering arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.6/2">A regimes forum was set up following a recommendation from Stephen Shaw's report into the fire at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre. The forum was chaired by the senior director of the operations directorate and attended by the director of detention services and senior detention services managers, as well as independent monitoring board members, staff from the Prison and Probation Ombudsman's Office and some representation from non-government organisations. The work of this group has led to the introduction of mobile phones, the piloting of internet use, paid work and a standardised incentives scheme. The forum also assisted with the development of the welfare function within centres, which continues to develop following a very successful pilot at Haslar removal centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.6/3">The work of regime development and improvement is now carried out by the regime/activity managers from each of the centres who meet regularly to continue identifying and implementing improvements in activities within centres.

	<p pid="b.8.2/1">Part 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill provides a power to make orders for the purposes of reforming legislation or implementing recommendations of the United Kingdom Law Commissions (Clause 1(1)). Clause 2(1) of the Bill further specifies that orders reforming legislation (or implementing Law Commission recommendations) under Clause 1 may amend, repeal or replace any legislation. &quot;Replace&quot; means that legislation can be repealed by an order and replaced by free-standing provision in that order.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.2/2">The order-making power in the Bill aims to address the shortcomings of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, which was too narrowly defined to facilitate the delivery of many beneficial reforms. First and foremost, the Bill aims to operate as an effective vehicle for delivering the Government's regulatory reform agenda. It provides a flexible power to reform the law, so that worthwhile reforms are not delayed or implemented piecemeal because of arbitrary limits on order-making powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.2/3">However, the Government have listened carefully to views on this issue as the Bill has progressed through Parliament and have resolved explicitly to focus the order-making powers in Part 1 on better regulation objectives and Law Commission recommendations. In addition, the Government have committed to give Parliament a statutory veto on the face of the Bill in order to provide assurance that the order-making power will be used appropriately. These provisions will build upon the existing safeguards in the Bill which ensure that orders cannot be used to remove necessary protections, rights or freedoms.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.2/4">The Government have tabled amendments to this effect ahead of the Report stage of the Bill in the other place.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.6/1">Tallow arises from animal rendering and can be used as a fuel, particularly within the rendering process itself. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions because the carbon in the tallow displaces fossil fuel and is derived from biomass eaten by the animals during life. The extent to which the biomass is carbon neutral will depend on the agricultural practices used to produce it.</p>
