In 1993, Law Officers' advice relevant to the subject matter of the Arms to Iraq inquiry was disclosed to the Scott inquiry. The advice was published in an annex to the inquiry report. Law Officers' advice on the 1988 Merchant Shipping Act was disclosed to the other parties in the course of the Factortame litigation in which Spanish fishermen were seeking damages from the Government for a breach of Community Law.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/3">I am aware of three other cases in which the views of the Law Officers on a particular matter were disclosed, but not the actual advice. In February 1971, the substance of the Law Officers' advice relating to the UK's obligations to supply arms to South Africa under the Simonstown Agreement was published in a command paper (Cmnd 4589). In February 1993, the views of the Law Officers' advice were disclosed in the debate in the other House on the Maastricht Treaty. In March this year the Attorney-General set out in a Written Answer a summary of his view of the legal basis for the use of force against Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.0/1">The Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America work very closely together on a wide range of veterans' issues. This relationship allows us the opportunity to share the results of research and to discuss many other areas of policy for the potential benefit of current and future veterans.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/2">This relationship is evident at a number of levels. My honourable friend, the Minister for Veterans, recently met the American Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington to discuss common policy interests. He has also met a number of Ministers in other countries who are responsible for veterans' matters. The Senior International Forum (SIF) is an opportunity for senior officials from the US and UK, as well as of the other member countries (Australia, Canada and New Zealand) to work together. Following its second meeting in London in December 2002, the group agreed that closer co-operation on veterans-related research would be led by the US. Other outcomes of the London meeting include the exchange of best practice on service resettlement arrangements and on business innovation in veterans-related support services as well as the creation of closer IT links between veterans' affairs departments. Furthermore, the US and the UK have worked together and kept one another apprised on specific issues surrounding the ill health reported by some veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict in response to veterans' concerns. In support of this, the MoD has provided King's College School of Medicine with data to enable it to conduct an epidemiological study for the US Department of Defense that will look at whether service in the Gulf is associated with increased illness in UK Gulf veterans.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">The right of Catholic sixth-form colleges to give preference on admission to Catholic students, particularly in areas where Catholic post-16 education is either not available or is insufficient in schools, is important to ensure that these students are as able to access a Catholic sixth-form education as their contemporaries elsewhere. Catholic sixth-form colleges were established to provide a Catholic education for Catholic students and seek to offer places for all Catholic students who apply. Their ability to do so and to fulfil their mission would be significantly curtailed in cases of oversubscription were they not able to give such preference.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/2">The Catholic character of sixth-form colleges is maintained by the leadership of the principal and key members of staff. It is supported by all those who work in the colleges, strengthened by the commitment of Catholic students and their parents and valued by students of other faiths and none and their parents who wish to participate in the work and life of the colleges. A college's success in fulfilling its mission is measured by reference to all these criteria as well as by the numbers of Catholic students and others who join, and wish to join, the institution. Consequently, the viability of a college as a provider of Catholic education is a more complex judgment than the application of a minimum number criterion and is always reviewed in the context of local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/3">In 2002 the proportion of non-Catholics in the 16 Catholic sixth-form colleges varied from 38 per cent to 63 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/4">The regulations, which are yet to be laid, are specifically drafted to permit only those institutions listed in a schedule to give preference in their admissions in respect of non-vocational provision to persons of a particular religion or belief in order to preserve that institution's religious ethos. The amendment is not specific to any religion or belief and the schedule lists Catholic sixth-form colleges because they are the only religion or belief based institutions incorporated into the further education sector. We have no plans to incorporate any other religion or belief-based institutions into the further education sector. Nothing in the regulations allows an institution to discriminate otherwise against a person of a particular religion or belief.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/5">The regulations will amend s20(1)(b) of the Employment Equality (Religion and Belief) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/1660). The amendment will not apply to any admission to a course of vocational training, and is therefore consistent with European Community law, in particular Council Directive 2000/78/EC (&quot;Establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation&quot; OJ L303,02.12/2000 p16). The regulations will comply with the international instruments referred to, incuding the ECHR, if any rights in those instruments are engaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/6">The amendment is limited so that it goes no further than necessary to meet concerns as to the need to protect the religious character of the institutions. The amendment will only apply to listed colleges so the extent of its effect is minimised although the substantive provision itself will be generic and could, in principle, apply to institutions of other religions on an equal basis. The amendment will also only apply in relation to Regulation 20(1)(b) (the ability to admit) and does not therefore permit discrimination in the terms of, or post, admission.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/7">The test imposed by the amendment will also be strict. Preferential admission must be shown as necessary to maintain an institution's religious ethos. This will ensure that any preferential admissions are justified and proportionate in the circumstances.</p>

Clause 3(1)(e) provides for the NDA to be given responsibility for treating, storing, transporting and disposing of hazardous material in designated circumstances. Hazardous material is defined in Clause 34 of the Bill as &quot;nuclear matter&quot; as per the Nuclear Installations Act 1965; &quot;radioactive waste&quot; as per the Radioactive Substances Act 1993; and things &quot;contaminated as a result of nuclear activities&quot; as per Clause 33(5) of the Energy Bill.

The NDA's plans for carrying out this function will be required to have particular regard for government policy (Clause 9), and will be set out in its strategy (Clause 12) and annual work plans (Clause 13).</p>

The European Commission has recently issued a call for research proposals within the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development on the topic of monitoring methods and systems of surveillance for species and habitats.

	<p pid="a.78.0/1">The Ligula tapeworm does not commonly affect trout and there is no evidence to suggest that trout or trout fisheries are damaged by this parasite. Cormorants can spread the parasite between fish populations, most commonly roach, but gulls are regarded as the main transmission vector in the UK. Article 5 of the EC Birds Directive requires member states to establish a general system of protection for all bird species. In Great Britain this is through the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. There is thus no provision to enable a general cull. Licences can be granted to allow small numbers of birds to be killed or taken as an aid to scaring, where the birds present a serious problem for fisheries and where there are no other suitable alternatives.</p>
