	<p pid="a.85.5/1">None of Defra's research teams or divisions has been closed. Inevitably there has been reorganisation of science management over the past 10 years, not least due to the formation of Defra in 2001 from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and part of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). More recently, there have been some significant changes within Defra, which have led to the formation of policy groups for food and farming, the natural environment, and climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/2">Additionally, in line with recommendations from the 2004 Gershon review, there have been reductions in the total number of Defra staff, including specialist staff. Defra's research and development budget has also fallen over recent years.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.3/1">Since 1991 the disproportionate cost threshold (DCT) has been set at eight times the average marginal cost of answering Written Parliamentary Questions, marginal cost being taken as the direct cost of civil servants' time. Average marginal cost is based on a one-month sample of all Written parliamentary Questions answered by those departments with the highest volume of questions. Such samples are taken on a quinquennial basis, the next being due in 2009. In years between quinquennial samples, the Treasury applies indexation to the DCT, but only increases it in &pound;50 steps to avoid the need for frequent small changes. The DCT has been set at &pound;700 since the last such increase, in November 2006.</p>
