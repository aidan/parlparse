	Prisoners: Resettlement
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.1.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2" qnum="HL5002">Whether they will publish their response to the joint thematic report Through the Prison Gate published by the Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Chief Inspector of Probation.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-01a.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020701/text/20701w01.htm#20701w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.1.2/1">Through the Prison Gate was the first joint thematic report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation on the theme of resettlement. The two chief inspectors have provided an authoritative and thoughtful analysis of what the prison and probation services are doing together to re-integrate offenders back into the community and so reduce re-offending and of what more both services need to do. We are very grateful to them for this analysis, much of which is reinforced in the report Reducing re-offending by Ex-Prisoners published today by the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU).</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">Both of these reports recognise the importance of identifying the factors which need to be addressed for individual offenders if the risks of them re-offending are to be reduced. They also recognise the importance of developing an integrated approach to the management of offenders throughout their sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">The chief inspectors' report makes recommendations on the need for:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4" class="indent">a national resettlement strategy;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5" class="indent">the position of short-term prisoners to be taken into account when reviewing the sentencing framework;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6" class="indent">the Prison and Probation Services to develop the What Works strategy and to achieve consistency and continuity in preventing re-offending and reintegrating offenders into the community;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/7" class="indent">a case management approach, and of the Prison and Probation Services to review the respective roles of their staff at different stages of a prison sentence;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/8" class="indent">the Prison Service to develop a strategy for prisoners to be located closer to home;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/9" class="indent">the Prison and Probation Services to develop a co-ordinated partnership plan as part of their What Works resettlement strategy;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/10" class="indent">both services to develop a joint strategy for drug and alcohol misuse;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/11" class="indent">both services to provide guidance on the role of home detention curfew (HDC); and</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/12" class="indent">both services to ensure that a national public protection policy is developed for the assessment and management of risk in all cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/13">Many of these issues are also picked up in the SEU report. The Government will now be producing an action plan setting out our proposals for taking forward the recommendations. In drawing up that action plan we will also take account of the recommendations made by the chief inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/14">As the chief inspectors acknowledge, the Prison and Probation Services have made progress in developing and co-ordinating their resettlement policies under the What Works approach. However, there is a need for greater overall strategic direction, including greater sharing of good practice and performance targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/15">We have already taken steps to provide greater strategic direction by making arrangements for the establishment of the correctional services board, which will bring together the heads of the Prison and Probation Services and the Chair of the Youth Justice Board. Outside experience and skills will be provided by non-executive members. Early priorities for the board will include the development of a strategic plan for the correctional services, with a particular focus, as the report recommends, on improving provision for those sentenced to less than 12 months, and, in particular, 18 to 20 year-old offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/16">In taking forward both the chief inspectors' and the SEU reports we will also be developing a national resettlement strategy. Details will be set out in the action plan which will now be developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/17">That action plan will also include proposals for developing and piloting a case management approach, as recommended by the chief inspectors, building upon the pilot schemes which the Prison and Probation Services are already running.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/18">Through the Prison Gate draws attention to the benefits of keeping prisoners closer to their homes in the months before release and to the benefits of home detention curfew in helping prisoners prepare for release. We believe that HDC can play an important part in helping offenders to settle back into the community in a controlled way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/19">We also recognise the advantages for resettlement of prisoners being able to serve their sentences closer to home. Although the increasing prison population makes it difficult to achieve this, we will continue to explore both nationally and regionally what more can be done to minimise the number of prisoners held outside their home area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/20">The importance of tackling drug and alcohol problems is highlighted in both Through the Prison Gate and the SEU report. A good deal of investment has been made by both services in this area, but there is clearly more to be done, particularly in ensuring continuity of care and of provision in the community. We will be addressing this issue further as we take forward the planning and implementation of our resettlement strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/21">Through the Prison Gate also highlights the importance for a national public protection policy of the assessment and management of risk in all cases. The effective management of dangerous offenders is a priority for both the Prison and Probation Services. Both services have a detailed programme of work in support of their public protection objectives and are represented on the Home Office Dangerous Offenders Advisory Group. The establishment of multi-agency public protection panels has placed a statutory duty on police and probation services to make joint arrangements for the assessment and management of sexual, violent and other offenders who may cause serious harm. These panels work closely with the prison service and other agencies in managing the risk presented by such offenders. In addition, the National Probation Service is working with the Police Information Technology Organisation on the development of a joint police/probation database which will cover all offenders falling under the public protection duty placed on the police and the National Probation Service by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/22">Both services are also working together with the Parole Board to develop revised guidance on the settling of licence conditions to ensure a more consistent approach and are piloting the use of electronic monitoring as a licence condition, focusing in particular on dangerous offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/23">A detailed commentary on all the recommendations contained in the inspectorates' report describing work currently in hand by the Prison Service and the National Probation Service has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/24">Through the Prison Gate, together with the SEU report, has set out a challenging set of tasks for the new correctional services board. We will in due course be publishing an action plan setting out our detailed proposals in response to the SEU report and the recommendations of the chief inspectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">The offence currently specified in Schedule 2, paragraph 3, covers smuggling (facilitation of illegal entry) rather than trafficking. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill contains a new offence of trafficking for the purposes of controlling someone in prostitution, and we will include this offence in Schedule 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">We have made clear that we regard this as a stop-gap offence pending the introduction of wider offences of trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation when parliamentary time permits.

	<p pid="a.4.8/1">I, together with my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and my right honourable friend Jim Wallace, the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice for Scotland, represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="">13 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/2">A points: the A points were approved as in document 9825/02 PTS A 31 and ADD 1 and COR 1 (a copy of which has been placed in the Library), except points 23, 24, 25 and 45.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/3">Terrorism: the Council noted a terrrorism threat assessment document, Europol reports on security measures taken since <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> and extremist terrorism and a report on the current list of terrorist organisations. The Director of Europol reported on the work of the Europol Counter-Terrorism Task Force, noting that the provision of information to Europol had improved but remained insufficient and that more could be done to improve co-operation with the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/4">Activities of the Spanish Presidency on the subject of violence against women, to be submitted by the Ministers of Education, Justice, Home Affairs and Health at forthcoming Councils: the Presidency presented a study on measures adopted by member states to combat violence against women and a guide to good practice to mitigate the effects of and eradicate violence against women.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/5">Illegal immigration and external borders: during a general debate on illegal immigration and asylum, the Home Secretary called for the Seville European Council to deliver concrete results so that citizens could see the relevance of a European Union (EU) approach. He said that the message should not be one of &quot;Fortress Europe&quot; but a coherent policy which opposed racism, welcomed legal inward migration, protected refugees and ensured that each member state accepted its responsibilities. The Home Secretary vigorously supported common action to protect the European Union's external frontier, arguing that this should be achieved through the use of joint operations at weak points in the border, extensions of the immigration liaison officer network and greater use of Europol's expertise, rather than through the establishment of a new border police. He also supported the need to complete work on common asylum measures and co-operation with third countries in a spirit of &quot;positive conditionality&quot;, involving the provision of assistance to support returns and develop migration infrastructures.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/6">The Council also noted a Presidency report on progress made in the fight against illegal immigration, agreed conclusions on measures to be established for the prevention of and the fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings by sea and agreed a plan on the management of external borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/7">Proposal for a Council regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third country national: in discussing key aspects of the draft Dublin II Regulations, the majority of member states, including the United Kingdom, said that the exisitng Dublin convention criteria should be taken as a starting point but that procedures should be improved and time limits shortened. Two member states with difficult external frontiers argued that they should not be penalised by virtue of their geographical position. Two other member states also opposed the proposed new criterion on tolerated illegal presence.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/8">Proposal for a Council Decision on the implementation of specific measures for police and judicial co-operation to combat terrorism in accordance with Article 4 of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP: the Council reached a general approach on the Council decision. Portugal, France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom maintained parliamentary scrutiny reserves on the text.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/9">Proposal for a Council framework decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking: the Council reached a general approach on the majority of the text. However, member states were divided by a proposal to permit the imposition of lower penalties for trafficking in small quantities of drugs. The Presidency concluded that discussions on this item would continue under the Danish Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/10">Proposal for a Council directive to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid and other financial aspects of civil proceedings: the Council agreed that the scope of the draft legal aid directive should be limited to cross-border claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/11">Proposal for a Council regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested claims: the Commission presented its proposal for a European enforcement order. This would abolish, in uncontested cases, the requirement for a court to examine the procedure by which a judgment was issued in another member state before recognising the validity of that judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/12">Civilian aspects of crisis management: the Presidency reported that member states had met the targets set by the Gothenburg European Council for the provision of officials and judges to international missions intended to strengthen the rule of law in third countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/13">Any other business: the Commission presented its revised scoreboard on the implementation of the Tampere European Council conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/14">Mixed Committee: the Mixed Committee with Norway and Iceland met at ministerial level in the margins of the Council. It noted the existence of two negotiating mandates for the association of Switzerland with the implementation of the Schengen acquis, the Dublin Convention and Eurodac acquis; of a general approach on the proposal for a decision amending Article 40 of the Schengen Convention, subject to parliamentary scrutiny reserves from Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; of conclusions concerning the new requirements for the Schengen Information System (SIS) and a technical solution for the participation in the SIS by the United Kingdom and Ireland, reflecting the partial participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland in Schengen; and of a plan on the management of external borders.</p>

The letter of intent is a broad government policy document and there is no link between such letters and access to fund resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.6/3">These grain stocks were seen as appropriate for a disaster response, which, when coupled with an early warning system, should have allowed time to import necessary food.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.6/4">However, the Government of Malawi sold all of their food stocks, which has exacerbated the crisis. This sale has recently been under investigation by the National Audit Office, and it is unclear what happened to the proceeds from these sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.6/5">The Government of Malawi have admitted that the early warning system failed, and the UK Department of International Development is working with others to assist the Government of Malawi in developing a comprehensive long-term national food security strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.6/6">At the same time, the UK has allocated &pound;13 million to direct support for food import and distribution in Malawi and Zimbabwe, and in addition we have recently committed &pound;45 million for further support through the World Food Programme for NGOs for food distribution and inputs for the next planting season in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.2/1">The board of governors, on which all member countries are represented, is the highest authority governing the IMF and through which IMF management is held accountable by member governments. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is the UK's governor. The board of governors meets once a year at the IMF annual meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/2">The International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), currently chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is the main committee of the board of governors.

The UK is a single country constituency and the executive director is a senior official from HM Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/4">The recent establishment of the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office is an important development to enhance the accountability of the IMF. After wide consultation with member governments, the IMF and civil society on the design of their work programme, the IEO intends to publish its first report, on repeat use of fund resources, in time for the annual meetings. The IEO will continue to report regularly to member governments through the IMFC and the executive board.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/5">The Government are also committed to improving the accountability and transparency of the UK's dealings with the IMF. HM Treasury publishes an annual report to Parliament and to the public describing in detail the position taken by the UK on key policies and operations.</p>

These reviews will therefore reflect the matters that are important to patients and will not be limited to single issues determined by the centre.

	<p pid="a.15.2/3">There are three targets that trusts are working towards. These are:</p>

In addition, guidance on achieving single sex accommodation Enhancing Privacy and Dignity has been issued to the NHS, together with Health Building Notes and Design Guides HBM 4 In-patient accommodation&mdash;Options for Choice. The guidance provides NHS trusts with design solutions for new accommodation to meet the requirements of privacy, dignity and safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/8">The Government define appropriate levels of privacy and dignity as being wards split into single sex bays, or single rooms, with associated single sex toilet facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/9">The majority of hospital wards are usually subdivided into bays and single rooms which are designated as male or female and are therefore able to care for men and women without compromising privacy and dignity. Each NHS trust will decide how to configure their wards to meet local needs and case mix demands and to reflect the design of the ward.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/10">It is the responsibility of each NHS trust to manage patient admissions in such a manner as to ensure that patient privacy is protected. Guidance on maintaining patient privacy and dignity was issued to the service in 1997. This advises that patients are given the opportunity to request alternative accommodation where accommodation offered is shared by men and women. Where a patient refuses admission into hospital because of shared accommodation, a further admission date into appropriate segregated accommodation is offered.</p>
