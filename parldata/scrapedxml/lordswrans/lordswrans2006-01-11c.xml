	<p pid="c.53.5/1">When assessing an individual asylum claim we will take account of country information relevant to that claim. This would include information, if available, on the treatment of returned failed asylum seekers. Where we refuse a claim and the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal dismisses any appeal we therefore consider that it is safe for that individual to return. This is one of the reasons why the Home Office does not routinely monitor the treatment of individuals once removed from the UK. Another reason is that in some countries such monitoring could of itself place returnees at risk when otherwise they would not be. In addition, we cannot require such individuals to keep in touch with us. Therefore, we would consider some form of systematic monitoring only if particular circumstances made it appropriate for a given country. However, where specific allegations are made that any returnee, to any country, has experienced ill-treatment on return from the UK, these are followed up through the FCO and the relevant British Embassy as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="c.53.5/2">The memoranda of understanding we have recently negotiated with Jordan and Libya do not relate to the removal of individuals who have no entitlement to remain in the UK, but to cases where we wish to deport the person on the grounds that their deportation from the UK would be conducive to the public good. The number of deportations, compared with the total number of removals, is small, and the number where we may feel it necessary to seek assurances is likely to be very small indeed. The purpose of the assurances in those particular cases is to enable the UK to satisfy itself that removal will be consistent with our international obligations.</p>

This includes an objective by 2006 of promoting, co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the National Mine Action Plan at a national level, with an emphasis on six prioritised provinces. This is undertaken through the national observatory for mine action and would be expected to include effective verification of de-mining in these provinces. The Colombian Government's four-year national development plan features mine action as an important government priority, and as signatory to the Mine Ban Treaty they have put in place various initiatives to address the problem. Wherever it is possible to increase clearance efforts this should be commended. However, the decision on where to prioritise mine action is for the national authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.60.0/1">Where the height of a hedge should be reduced in a series of cuttings, a local authority is required under the terms of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 to specify over what period of time the work should be completed, and the final height reached. If they wish, a local authority may specify in a remedial notice how such works might be phased. A sample form of words is included in the appendix to the guidance document <i>High Hedges Complaints: Prevention and Cure</i>. Alternatively, a local authority might encourage the hedge owner to discuss and agree with them a suitable timetable for the phasing of the works.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.0/2">Under the 2003 Act, if an owner fails to reduce a hedge to its final cutting height within the overall period set by a local authority, they commit an offence and could face prosecution and/or the authority could carry out the necessary works themselves and reclaim the costs from the hedge owner. No offence is committed if the hedge owner fails to carry out the cutting according to the phases set out in a remedial notice or agreed separately with a local authority. There is no means, therefore, of enforcing the timing of individual stages of phased reduction. It is, however, open to a local authority to send warning letters if a stage has passed without action being taken.</p>

The identity cards scheme intends to put a number of measures in place to facilitate individuals with sight conditions, such as nystagmus, to record their iris biometrics successfully. For example, the recording process will be conducted by a trained operator who will be able to assist the individual during the scan. Additionally, the ability of biometric recording equipment offered by potential suppliers to record irises of those with sight conditions will be considered during planned biometric trials. However, in the event that it is not possible for an individual with a sight condition to record an iris biometric on enrolment after a number of attempts or an attempt with a different set of equipment, that person would be not be required to provide it. Nevertheless, they would still be able to participate in the biometric recording process, as they would still have the opportunity to provide fingerprints and a facial image.</p>

	<p pid="c.62.0/1">The Home Office-led evaluation of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on levels of crime and disorder will use a range of measures at both a national and local level. These include national crime surveys of victims and offenders supplemented with case studies involving five towns and cities in England. These local case studies, one of which is Croydon which is within the Metropolitan Police force area, will look at patterns of police recorded crime and disorder in relation to licensed premises and extended hours. Recorded crime data have been requested on the following crime types: violence against the person; sexual offences; and disorder and criminal damage. This work will also include, within the case study areas, surveys of local residents and interviews with the responsible authorities which have been designated under the Act as well as with local night-time economy businesses including licensees. Furthermore, the evaluation will also, where possible, draw upon data which details the number of patient attendances at accident and emergency and the number of calls for assistance from the ambulance service for each of the case study areas. The Home Office plans to publish the findings from the evaluation and once it has done so the report will be placed in the Library. In addition, the Home Office is conducting a monitoring exercise, which aims to provide a quicker and more limited assessment of the Act than the evaluation which is detailed above. Police forces have been asked to supply, on a voluntary basis, monthly returns on violent crime and criminal damage broken down by the hour of offences. If the findings are published then the report will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.72.5/1">Small schools encounter difficulties and the smaller the school, the more acute those difficulties can become. Difficulties arise when children have to be taught in composite classes and do not have access to opportunities for social interaction and personal development that exist in larger schools, and where there is less scope for professional teacher development.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.5/2">The Department of Education considers all the relevant information relating to a proposal to close before a decision is taken. This includes the views of the relevant Employing Authorities and Boards, in the context of the individual school and the existing provision in the immediate area. In each of these cases, enrolments were falling, the projected intakes were small and the views of the Education and Training Inspectorate were taken, which was that the educational interests of the children would be served more effectively by approving the closure proposal and educating the children in a larger school.</p>

	<p pid="c.73.8/1">We welcome the publication of the Anti-Slavery International training kit for identifying trafficked people, which includes useful information for front-line personnel. The Home Office, in consultation with non-government organisations, has already produced a toolkit aimed at front-line police, immigration officers and other agencies and professionals who may come into contact with potential victims of trafficking. It provides generic information and practical advice on identifying victims of trafficking and how to appropriately and fairly deal with them. The toolkit is intended as an additional resource to support local operations. Immigration officers throughout the UK have been made aware of the Home Office toolkit and receive regular briefings to highlight the trends in trafficking. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate is conducting a review of staff training and guidance in 2006 and will consider circulating the Anti-Slavery International training kit as part of this wider work. The type and level of training on human trafficking provided to police officers is a matter for individual police forces. However we will also draw the attention of Centrex (the Central Police Training Authority), which is reviewing police training on trafficking, to the existence of the Anti-Slavery International training kit. Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) are being established in all local authority areas following the requirement set out in the Children Act 2004. DfES will shortly be producing guidance that will set out that it will be the responsibility of the LSCBs to ensure that training and safeguarding and promoting welfare is provided in order to meet individual needs.</p>

Information on government grants to police authorities in England and Wales on a per capita basis is set out in the table. We do not distribute grant to police authorities purely on the basis of population. The police funding formula uses a range of socio-demographic factors to reasonably reflect the relative needs of each authority. Grant allocations also take into account a police authority's ability to raise revenue via the police precept.</p>

This formed part of a package of further support to the United Nations helicopter operation of &pound;5.5 million. DfID has also provided support to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which includes provision of helicopters and through the Ministry of Defence funded the delivery of two Puma helicopters from Spain for use by the ICRC.</p>
