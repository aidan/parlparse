	<p pid="d.53.2/1">Parliament decided in 1967 that one of the grounds for an abortion is,</p>
	<p pid="d.53.2/2" class="indent">&quot;that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.53.2/3">Parliament did not define serious handicap in the Act. Indeed, it chose to leave this to the expert judgment of the two doctors involved, who are required to form their own opinion about the seriousness of the handicap the child would suffer if born, taking into account the facts and circumstances of each individual case.</p>
	<p pid="d.53.2/4">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' guideline <i>Termination of Pregnancy for fetal abnormality</i> (1996) gives advice to medical practitioners and also states that if an abnormality has been detected and two medical practitioners are of the opinion that there are grounds for a termination under the Abortion Act, then the woman should be advised that she has this option.</p>

	<p pid="d.53.5/1">Operational mission directives are derived from government objectives, both of which are outlined formally in the directive issued by the Chief of Defence Staff for every operational deployment. These objectives are then cascaded by military commanders to all personnel when preparing to deploy and while deployed on operations. Ministers regularly visit military personnel in the UK and in operational theatres as part of routine business. It would not be practical for Ministers to visit all ranks of military personnel deploying for active service overseas, whether based in the UK, Germany, Cyprus or elsewhere.</p>

This entered into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April 2006</phrase>. It includes provisions that allow a member state to exclude or remove an EU national from its territory on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health. This directive is transposed into UK law by the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006. Provisions setting out the basis for exclusion or removal of an EU national are contained in Regulations 19 to 21 and 24.</p>

	<p pid="d.58.2/1">Yes. We are actively taking steps to support victims of female genital mutilation (FGM). This includes funding voluntary organisations such as FORWARD which work closely with health, education and child protection agencies, and the practising communities themselves.</p>
	<p pid="d.58.2/2">There are seven specialist clinics in the NHS catering for the particular health needs of women and girls who have been mutilated. The Department of Health is funding research on the prevalence of FGM in this country and the production of training materials for professionals dealing with victims of FGM. In addition, the Home Office, the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills have together provided information about female genital mutilation to police forces and others in the criminal justice system, doctors and midwives throughout the country, and local authority social services departments and the education sector. <i>Working Together to Safeguard Children</i>, the main multi-agency guidance on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, makes clear that a local authority may exercise its powers under Section 47 of the Children Act 1989 if it has reason to believe that a child is likely to suffer or has suffered mutilation.</p>
	<p pid="d.58.2/3">Internationally, we support work in a large number of countries, particularly Africa, aimed at eradicating FGM and providing adequate healthcare for girls and women affected by it. British consular staff can provide assistance and support to victims of FGM who have been taken overseas, such as helping to arrange for medical treatment and repatriation. They can also work with foreign and UK law enforcement agencies to try to locate a potential victim before FGM is carried out.</p>

	<p pid="d.63.0/1">The White Paper, <i>Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system</i>, (Cm 6841) sets out a package of proposed reforms. It includes a number of measures which would help to make the system more flexible and make national insurance credits more valuable, and more generous.</p>
	<p pid="d.63.0/2">The proposed reduction of the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension to 30 is a very significant change that makes the system more flexible; it allows people to undertake a variety of activities during their working lives, and still be able to build a full basic state pension. This would be particularly beneficial to women.</p>
	<p pid="d.63.0/3">Credits would be made more valuable by removing the first contribution condition, so that credits count towards pension entitlements in exactly the same way as paid contributions for the first time. This clearly signals that social contributions are rewarded and recognised by society in the same way as paid work. The credits would be awarded on a weekly basis only to the extent needed for the year to become a qualifying year.</p>
	<p pid="d.63.0/4">In addition to making credits more valuable, the credits system would be made more comprehensive and generous, by reforming home responsibilities protection into a weekly credit and introducing new weekly credits for parents and carers&mdash;aligned in BSP and S2P and these would count towards satisfying the qualifying years in the same way as paid contributions.</p>
	<p pid="d.63.0/5">The new credits which will be introduced if the proposals in the White Paper <i>Security in Retirement</i> are implemented in full are shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid="d.64.5/2">Customers moving from the Post Office card account will have a number of alternative account options which will meet a wide range of needs and circumstances&mdash;including more than 25 bank accounts which can already be accessed at Post Office branches (and we hope there could be more in future), as well as new savings accounts which the Post Office is introducing. There is no real difference in accessing money at the Post Office through a bank account compared to a Post Office card account&mdash;people can go on collecting the same money, on the same day, at the Post Office using a plastic card and PIN. Customers who have managed to open and operate a Post Office card account should be able to do the same with at least a basic bank account.</p>

	<p pid="d.66.5/1">The RAF's BL755 and RBL755 anti-armour cluster bombs are due out of service by the end of the decade.</p>
	<p pid="d.66.5/2">The RAF has no plans for future air dropped cluster munitions. The UK's fast-jet launched anti-armour capability is now achieved primarily with precision anti-armour missiles such as Brimstone and Maverick.</p>
