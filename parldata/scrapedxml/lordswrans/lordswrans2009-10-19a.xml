	<p pid="a.33.2/1">Under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995, local authorities are required to review and assess air quality in their authorities for certain key pollutants as set out in the air quality strategy. Where levels of these key pollutants are above the air quality objectives set out in strategy, they must carry out a more detailed assessment of air quality and, if necessary, declare an air quality management area (AQMA) and prepare an action plan to deliver air quality improvements in line with the local air quality management (LAQM) process. The third round of this process began in 2006, with all local authorities required to complete the first phase of this round&mdash;an updating and screening assessment (USA)&mdash;by the end of April 2006. Local authorities which identified a risk of exceeding an air quality objective then carried out a detailed assessment in 2007. Similarly the fourth round of the LAQM process commenced in April 2009 with all local authorities required to submit a USA by the end of April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/2">All London boroughs have declared AQMAs for pollutants that breach air quality objectives. Except for the London Borough of Havering, all London boroughs have action plans in place and are reporting progress against these to Defra. Havering has declared an AQMA across the entire borough for high concentrations of PM10 (particulate matter) and N02 (nitrogen dioxide), and has drafted an action plan which is currently being reviewed by the Greater London Authority.</p>

The protected characteristics which may be combined are age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Clause 14 is therefore relevant where a claimant experiences less favourable treatment because of a combination of two different protected characteristics, such as disability and race or disability and gender.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/2">If a person is disabled by both physical and mental impairments, these impairments should be treated as the protected characteristic of disability with respect to any claims for discrimination that they may wish to make. Should a person experience less favourable treatment because of one or more physical or mental impairments, they can submit one or more disability discrimination claims. Even though a single claim may involve a number of impairments, provided that the person met the definition of a disabled person, in that those impairments had a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day to day activities, this would be treated as disability discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.5/1">As the UN Environmental Programme report highlights, the aquifer underneath Gaza is being unsustainably exploited. This results in the water table dropping in areas where abstraction is greatest, with significant salt water intrusion.

A sustainable solution to water use in the region will have to be an important part of peace negotiations, which we are working to promote.

	<p pid="a.46.0/1">Within British nationality law there are provisions which require a person to be a British national, and to have no other citizenship or nationality. UKBA is therefore required, when considering such cases, to assess whether a person has any other citizenship.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/2">It has been alleged that a Malaysian citizen loses that status on acquiring a British overseas citizen passport. However, two rulings have influenced UKBA's understanding of this position.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/3">The first of these was the case of Lee Thean Hock, in which the Malaysian courts indicated that the issue of a BOC passport, was not sufficient for someone to be deprived of Malaysian nationality. The second, on which UKBA rely, is that of AL and Others. The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal ruled that, as the Malaysian constitution specifies that a person can be deprived of their citizenship by order if they acquire another nationality, it is not lost automatically on acquisition of another nationality or passport.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/4">The Nationality Instructions on Malaysian citizenship refer to both of these rulings for the information of nationality caseworkers. It is on the basis of AL and Others that nationality caseworkers assume that the holder of a British overseas citizen passport will not have lost any claim to Malaysian citizenship unless the Malaysian authorities confirm that he or she has actually been deprived of that status by order, or his or her renunciation of that status has been registered by the Malaysian authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/5">Although the judge in the case of AL and Others stated that the Hock case is &quot;clearly not meant to be regarded as a precedent&quot;, he also stated that &quot;nevertheless, it may be regarded as throwing doubt upon the claims made on the appellant's behalf&quot;. It is of interest as it is a Malaysian court ruling which supports the UK 's understanding of Malaysian citizenship law and it is therefore relevant to providing context to the broader understanding of Nationality caseworkers.</p>
