	<p pid="b.130.8/1">The Government welcome the assessment of the manning situation made in the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body report. The Armed Forces are broadly in manning balance in spite of some significant shortfall areas. Restructuring and subsequent requirement reductions will help to resolve many of these structural imbalances and close the deficit by April 2008. There will, however, continue to be shortfalls in some branches and trades beyond this date.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.8/2">Both recruitment and retention remain generally satisfactory despite a challenging environment. A number of measures, which are covered in the report, continue to address problem areas. In addition, a two-month recruiting bounty scheme has been put in place for Royal Artillery and Infantry to assist in this problem recruitment area.</p>

	<p pid="b.131.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has put measures in place to increase awareness at all levels and to mitigate against the development of post-traumatic stress disorder and other stress-related disorders among service personnel. Personnel receive briefings before they are deployed to prepare them for dealing with potentially stressful operational situations. While personnel are in theatre, we provide appropriate levels of support from trained mental health staff, either based in the UK or in theatre. On their return from theatre, personnel receive a post-deployment briefing, which includes leaflets and a presentation covering stress reactions. The families of returning personnel are also offered a presentation and issued with leaflets to alert them to the possible after-effects of operational deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.5/2">On the relatively rare occasions when personnel develop a mental health problem as a result of their deployment, community-based mental health care is available to every military unit and every service person via our 15 departments of community mental health across the UK and satellite centres in Cyprus, Germany and Gibraltar.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.2/1">We are currently assessing the educational impact and operational effectiveness of interactive whiteboards (IWBs) in both primary and secondary schools. The assessment will consider the extent to which the use of IWBs impacts on standards at key stage 3 and GCSE in the core subjects. It will also measure the impact on standards in literacy and numeracy in primary schools. These evaluations started in 2004 and will end in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/2">To date, earlier pilot projects by Newcastle University, research by Becta, and reports by Ofsted into the use of IWBs have told us that their introduction has had a positive impact in classrooms and the response from teachers and pupils has been extremely positive. IWBs have improved the quality of teaching, stimulated pupils' concentration and positive responses, and enhanced teachers' explanations and demonstrations.</p>

The current GDS is a complex combination of item-of-service and fixed payments. There are more than 400 fees, ranging from &pound;7.30 for a clinical examination to &pound;307.80 for a single orthodontic appliance. In addition, dentists are paid an amount for each patient registered with them.</p>

In return, they will be expected to provide an agreed level of service over the course of a year, measured in terms of weighted courses of treatment.

	<p pid="b.139.2/1">In their review, Her Majesty's Government will consider all relevant issues that might need to be reflected in a revised financial memorandum.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/2">The purpose of the memorandum is to provide guidance on the use of the grant-in-aid for official royal travel by air and rail. Details of annual allocations are not included in the memorandum; however an annual budget is agreed separately between the department and the royal household. This amounted to &pound;5.9 million in 2005&ndash;06. Current forecasts are that expenditure for the year will be &pound;5.6 million delivering, an underspend of about &pound;300,000. The provisional budget for 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;6 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/3">There is no current intention to restrict the use of the Queen's helicopter or chartered helicopters. The decision to establish The Queen's Helicopter Flight in 1998 continues to be fully justified. In addition to delivering substantial cost savings compared with the previous 32 Squadron Wessex service, the helicopter has proved to be a highly efficient and cost-effective travel option. It provides the opportunity for members of the royal family to undertake a number of engagements at different locations on the same day.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/4">The costs of all official journeys by air or rail undertaken by members of the royal family are met by the grant-in-aid. The only current restriction on travel relates to use of the royal train, which is confined to HM the Queen, HRH the Duke of Edinburgh and HRH the Prince of Wales. There is no current intention to impose any further restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/5">One of the key aims of the grant-in-aid was to improve accountability and transparency for royal travel. This aim is achieved in a number of ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/6" class="indent">The household publishes a comprehensive annual report, which is placed in the Library and also published on the official royal website. This provides considerable detail on the operation of the grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/7" class="indent">Expenditure for the grant-in-aid is approved by Parliament as part of the Department for Transport's Estimates. In 2002, following a National Audit Office report, the Public Accounts Committee conducted a detailed review of royal travel and credited the household in making major savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/8" class="indent">The grant-in-aid is subject to regular scrutiny by the National Audit Office and annual independent audit.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/9" class="indent">Sir Peter Gershon is nearing completion of the report commissioned by the Cabinet Office into the provision of air travel for the royal family and government Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/10">Given the above measures, Her Majesty's Government do not consider that there is a need to introduce any additional scrutiny.</p>
