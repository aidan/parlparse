	<p pid="a.7.8/1">Most academies are replacing schools which have failed to provide an adequate education for their pupils. All trustees of an academy are bound by charitable law to act in the best interests of the academy. The funding agreement for each academy sets out the framework under which the academy operates, including having admissions arrangements which comply with the code of practice and teaching the national curriculum core subjects. The funding agreement also sets out a range of interventions that the Secretary of State can implement where an academy is in breach of its funding agreement or where he has concerns about its management or performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/2">Academies are also inspected by Ofsted in the fifth or sixth term after they open and thereafter on the same basis as other maintained schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.2/1">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires a local authority to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills before either disposing, or changing the use, of any school playing field. Section 77 applies where the playing fields are used by a maintained school, or have been used for the purposes of such a school at any time during the preceding 10 years. Consent is not required, however, where the land in question, after the change of use, becomes used in connection with the provision, by a local authority, of educational facilities for a maintained school, or any recreational facilities. A local authority, therefore, may build permanent classrooms, install mobile classrooms or build an indoor leisure centre on playing fields without the need for consent.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.0/1">The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 set out the minimum area of team game playing fields that local authorities should provide for schools. The minimum area of team game playing fields depends on the number and age range of pupils attending the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/2">In certain cases, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills can agree to relax the minimum standards but only under circumstances set out in Section 543 of the Education Act 1996. Briefly, these circumstances are:</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/3" class="indent">(i) where it would be unreasonable to require conformity because of the nature of the existing site;</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/4" class="indent">(ii) where there is a shortage of suitable sites;</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/5" class="indent">(iii) in order to control public expenditure where the school is to move to a new site, and</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/6" class="indent">(iv) where other sports facilities are available to the school; for example, leisure and sports centres, all-weather pitches and sports halls, etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/7">Schools that did not meet the minimum standard when the regulations were introduced were deemed to have an agreed relaxation to those standards. They must, however, apply for a further relaxation if they make any change to the size or layout of their team game playing fields. This means that even where there is a net increase in the size and range of sports pitches, schools still need to apply to have the standards relaxed if the new layout does not meet the minimum standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/8">There were no central figures collected before 2000. The table below shows, by year, the number of applications to relax school playing field standards under Section 543 to the Education Act 1993 that have been approved since 2000. There is no need to record unsuccessful applications.</p>

The campaign aims to send a strong message that alcohol related violence will not be tolerated and to raise awareness of the issues affecting police and partners and our communities in towns and cities across England and Wales. Its success will be judged as part of the wider programme of work set out in the Government's strategy for tackling alcohol related harm. We will also be collecting a range of data to measure success, such as the numbers of fixed penalty notices issued and the numbers of licensees selling to underage persons. We are working with the Department of Health to ensure that accident and emergency departments collect data on alcohol-related admissions where possible. We will be publishing aggregated data from participating areas at regular intervals throughout the campaign.</p>

The information, however, could be calculated from the CIPFA Public Library Statistics, which are available in the House Library. Total expenditure on public libraries in England (excluding capital payments &amp; agency services and capital accounting) rose, in cash terms, from &pound;730.7 million in 2000&ndash;01 to &pound;845.1 million in 2002&ndash;03 (Source: <i>CIPFA Public Library Statistics (Actuals)</i>).

	<p pid="a.19.0/1">Fishery action plans (FAPs) have recently been initiated by the Environment Agency in England and Wales to provide a mechanism for fisheries development at the catchment scale (or wider), with the objective of maximising sustainable development of fisheries and associated ecological, social, economic and recreational benefits. FAPs seek to identify the main issues affecting fisheries, including bird predation, prioritise these and plan appropriate action. Such fishery action plans do not apply in the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/2">Cormorants are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which fulfils the UK's obligations under the EC Wild Birds Directive 79/409/EEC to conserve all wild birds. Results from earlier Defra-funded research on the impact of cormorants on inland fisheries support the view that this is a problem for specific fisheries rather than a general problem. Where such site-specific problems exist, licences can be granted to allow limited numbers of birds to be killed or taken as an aid to scaring. However, it must be shown that there is no other satisfactory alternative to the issuing of a licence. Nevertheless, the Government are currently looking into further measures to help resolve their conflict with fisheries.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/3">Similar provisions apply in many other European Union countries, although there is some variability in the number of birds that are killed. It is not possible to compare the effects of shooting between member states. The numbers of birds killed or taken under licence in each EU country are reported to the Commission annually.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.3/1">Increased development of renewable energy resources is vital to facilitating the delivery of the Government's commitments on both climate change and renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/2">We recognise that the location of wind farms can sometimes be a sensitive issue. Our landscapes have always been influenced by ever-changing human activity. Buildings and other structures&mdash;including, for example, traditional windmills and monuments&mdash;have often been seen as enhancing the landscape and providing a point of interest. In some settings wind farms will be seen by many as aesthetically pleasing; in other less so.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/3">That is why the Government have ensured that there is clear guidance for planning authorities to follow. <i>Planning Policy Guidance Note 22: Renewable Energy</i> makes clear that local planning authorities should always assess and judge the merits of a planning application on a site-specific basis, including consideration of impacts on the landscape. The consultation paper for the forthcoming PPS22 reinforced these elements.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.2/3">The non-health impacts of vehicle emissions will vary from place to place and pollutant to pollutant. For instance, road transport makes a significant contribution to urban concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), varying between 70 and 90 per cent of annual mean concentrations at roadside locations and 50 to 71 per cent of NOx concentrations at urban background locations. These emissions will contribute to adverse effects on buildings, materials, terrestrial ecosystems, such as crops and forest, aquatic ecosystems and visibility, but the impacts have not been explicitly calculated. It should also be noted that it is very difficult to place an economic value on some of these impacts.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.2/1">Movement anomalies are unavoidable as there are inevitable delays in updating any database as well as occasional mistakes in the information reported by keepers. Markets are already responsible for reporting all individual cattle movements and all batch movements of pigs, sheep and goats. Movement notifications are recorded on a central database.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/2">Defra is working to encourage market operators to use electronic data transfer and developing on-line systems to increase the speed and accuracy of livestock movement reporting.</p>
