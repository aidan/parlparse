<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-12-08a.105.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="105"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91208w0001.htm#091208105000004">
	<p pid="a.105.2/1">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) does not hold self-reported ethnicity data, but data on the &quot;ethnic appearance&quot; of persons who have a DNA profile on the database. The ethnic appearance data have six broad ethnic categories plus &quot;unknown&quot;. They are based on the judgment of the police officer taking the sample and are recorded for police intelligence purposes to assist in subsequent identification. The ethnic appearance data have only been recorded for volunteer samples since 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/2">The table below shows the number of DNA profiles on the NDNAD broken down by ethnic appearance, as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-16">16 October 2009</phrase>. &quot;Unknown&quot; means that no ethnic appearance was recorded by the officer taking the sample. The number of profiles held is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because some profiles are replicates-ie, more than one profile is held for one individual. This may occur if, for example, an individual gives different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests. It is estimated that 13.8 per cent of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/3">Data on the number of subject profiles retained on the NDNAD broken down by ethnic appearance are published in the NDNAD annual reports. The latest annual report for 2007-09 is published on the NPIA website at <a href="http://www.npia.police.uk/en/14399.htm">http://www.npia.police.uk/en/14399.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.2/1">Al-Muhajiroun publicly disbanded in 2004. In 2006, two successor groups to Al-Muhajiroun-Al-Ghurabaa and the Saved Sect-were proscribed by the then Home Secretary. We are aware of media reports that Al-Muhajiroun has been relaunched. Organisations which cause us concern are constantly reviewed and should fresh information come to light which would bring them within the definition of being &quot;concerned with terrorism&quot; as defined in the Terrorism Act 2000 it opens up the possibility of proscription, which we believe is a tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism. Any decision on proscription must be proportionate and based on evidence that a group is concerned in terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/2">Where individuals incite violence or commit other crimes, this is a matter for the police. We have strengthened our powers to catch those who cross the line from legitimate debate into inciting violence or who commit offences motivated by racial or religious hatred. Where there is any evidence of criminal activity, the police take the appropriate and necessary action. However, the challenge to extremists who skirt the bounds of legality cannot just be one of law enforcement. We also have to provide a robust legal challenge to groups that espouse intolerant and divisive ideologies. Where individuals or groups continue to articulate views which fall short of supporting violence and are within the law, but which reject and undermine community cohesion, the Government will challenge these views. Alongside this challenge, we also work with community organisations and individuals to give them the skills they need to be able to counter the messages of violent extremists themselves.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-12-08a.114.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100640" speakername="Baroness Thornton" colon=":" colnum="114"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91208w0002.htm#091208105000139">
	<p pid="a.114.3/1">The estimate of 110,000 younger adults eligible for free personal care at home is based principally on the referrals, assessments and packages of care (RAP) data from councils for 2007-08<sup>1</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/2">Fair Access to Care Services (FACS) guidance on eligibility for local authorities, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, establishes four levels of eligibility for services. These are critical, substantial, moderate and low, with critical representing the highest level of social care need.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/3">The RAP data shows 82,000 younger users of local authority home care and 35,000 younger users of direct payments on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>-out of 395,000 younger recipients of community-based services. It is not known what proportion of the 117,000 who receive personal care are in the critical need group, but it is expected that they would be the majority.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/4">Therefore, for the purposes of the impact assessment, it is assumed that there could be some 100,000 younger adult local authority-funded users receiving personal care in the critical category. It is likely that most of them receive their care free, as their incomes are generally low. It has therefore been assumed that 90 per cent already receive free personal care at home and that 10 per cent make a means-tested contribution towards the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/5">Little is known about the number of younger adults who currently fund their own care at home. It has been assumed that approximately a further 10,000 younger adults may be brought under state funding following the introduction of the Personal Care at Home Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/6">No specific estimate of a margin of error has been made. However, the figures have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 to reflect the uncertainty. The figure of 110,000 should therefore be treated as an estimate.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/7">The estimated cost of extending reablement services is based on an assumed cost per person of &#163;1,000. This is an average cost and acknowledges that the actual cost of individually tailored packages will lie within a range depending on the length of time and specialist services required.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/8">The anticipated benefits of reablement-ie, helping individuals to live independently at home for longer, thus delaying the need for formal care and/or admission to residential care-have not been specifically included in the impact assessment, so if benefits do arise this will free up resources which can be spent on offering more people reablement services. Neither the number of individuals who already benefit from reablement, nor the precise scale of the benefits, is known for certain. For this reason, no attempt has been made to quantify the net cost/benefit of reablement services.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1" qnum="HL414">To ask Her Majesty's Government what is their basis for the forecast in paragraph 5.10 of their assessment on the Personal Care at Home Bill that volumes of service demands would increase by 1.5 per cent per annum and prices by 2 per cent per annum; and whether they had regard in making those forecasts to the increase in the demand for and cost of free personal home care in Scotland between 2003-04 and 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2" qnum="HL415">To ask Her Majesty's Government what proportion of the 933,000 elderly people in 2010 estimated by the Personal Social Sciences Research Unit to be in the highest critical needs category will receive free personal home care under the Personal Care at Home Bill who (a) receive no such free care now, and (b) pay for a proportion of such care now.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-12-08a.115.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100640" speakername="Baroness Thornton" colon=":" colnum="115"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91208w0003.htm#091208105000147">
	<p pid="a.115.2/1">The assumptions about the annual growth in volumes and unit costs are taken directly from Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU)'s micro-simulation model for older people. The figure of 1.5 per cent per year increase relates to the estimated impact of demographic pressure. It is separate from the estimated impact on demand of the introduction of free personal care. The figure of 2 per cent increase in real terms per year is a PSSRU assumption reflecting expected real rises in average earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/2">In Scotland, the experience of extending free personal care differs in respect of coverage, in that it is provided not just to those in highest need and includes those in residential care. For this reason, it was not considered appropriate or relevant to extrapolate changes in demand for personal care to the English context.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/3">Fair Access to Care Services (FACS) guidance on eligibility for local authorities, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, establishes four levels of eligibility for services. These are critical, substantial, moderate and low, with critical representing the highest level of social care need.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/4">Table 10 of the PSSRU's technical report of its micro-simulation model for older people<sup>1</sup> estimates the number of people aged 65 and over whose needs are assessed as critical according to FACS before informal care considerations. Since the receipt-or not-of informal care forms part of the FACS assessment, it is important to take this into account when estimating the volume of individuals whose needs are likely to be assessed as critical according to FACS criteria, which the PSSRU does in table 12 of its report.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/5">In addition, when estimating the volume of individuals likely to benefit from the proposals in the Personal Care at Home Bill, it is important to exclude those living at home who are not considered to be in highest need-that is, those requiring help with fewer than four activities of daily living-and those in residential care.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/6">As a result-and including estimates of two specific demand effects-the estimated number of older people who will receive free personal care at home under the Personal Care at Home Bill is approximately 55,000 and the number estimated to be making a means-tested contribution towards the cost is 35,000 in 2011-12. These figures, which are shown in greater detail in table 2 of the impact assessment on the Personal Care at Home Bill, should be treated as estimates.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.5/1">Records of the removal of potentially unlawful terrorist content by informal contact between the police and internet service providers have not been kept until now due to low awareness of this aspect of the administrative guidance concerning Section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2006. I understand the police have not yet found it necessary to use the formal powers given under Section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2006 to close any websites. That decision is, of course, an operational decision for the police to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.5/2">The Home Office is working with the Association of Chief Police Officers (Terrorism and Allied Matters) to update the guidance on the use of Section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2006. The guidance will be made more accessible with clearly explained procedures and be drawn to the attention of senior officers in all forces. This guidance will be available in January 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.0/13">When the fees regulations were drafted it was agreed that the cost of the shared service component of the administration charge should be phased in over a two-year period: 50 per cent of the increase of this component in 2007-08; 75 per cent in 2008-09; and 100 per cent in 2009-10. Please see the previous PQ1007 130209 for details of these costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/14">Due to a reassessment of the cost of shared services by Animal Health this plan has been modified slightly. The cost was phased in with 75 per cent of the increase from <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase> and then 100 per cent in the current fees regulations amendment as detailed above.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/15">This proposal to phase in a proportion of the increased administration costs was a one-off proposal to improve affordability for farmers and maintain good will between industry representatives and Defra at a time when the industry was under great pressure to ensure regulatory compliance with the National Control Programmes for Salmonella control. It did not establish a precedent for temporary subsidies on charges and this was clearly communicated to industry representatives in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/16">The response to a joint consultation, Local Authority Property Search Services, carried out by the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Ministry of Justice last year indicated that the majority of local authorities are losing money in providing the personal search service of the local land charges register at the current fee of &#163;11. The fee will increase with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> to &#163;22. This increase balances the interests of local authorities and those undertaking personal searches.</p>
