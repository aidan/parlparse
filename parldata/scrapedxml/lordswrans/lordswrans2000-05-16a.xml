	<p pid="a.7.2/1">Her Majesty's Government have no current plans to bring farmland into public ownership in the South Downs. The Countryside Agency has submitted a bid to DETR for additional funding for a new restoration initiative involving research and piloting demonstration projects, building on and integrated with existing initiatives to restore open downland and provide access to it in the South Downs. This could involve a number of mechanisms, of which targeted land purchase on the open market might be one. However, detailed proposals have not yet been developed. The Countryside Agency is currently discussing its preliminary ideas with a range of local organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.5/1">All the information requested could only be provided at disproportionate cost. The Air and Environment Quality Division of the Department of the Environment, and subsequently of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, has included the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in all inter-departmental contact on the proposal for a waste incineration directive since the European Commission's initial soundings on its first working paper in February 1994. This includes the period of discussions of the &quot;working paper on the incineration of waste&quot; in meetings of national experts convened by the European Commission from April 1997 to summer 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.5/2">There was numerous and frequent correspondence between DETR and other interested departments, including MAFF, following the German Presidency's decision to take the draft waste incineration directive to Council Working Group at the start of its term of office in January 1999.

DETR and MAFF officials additionally met bilaterally on <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-16">16 April 1999</phrase>. MAFF concerns about the implications of the proposal for animal carcass incinerators were raised in a letter from the Minister of State of <phrase class="date" code="1999-02-16">16 February 1999</phrase> and were discussed at all the subsequent meetings involving the two departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.2/2">Where an unoccupied dwelling is entered on the council tax valuation list but requires or is undergoing major repair works or is undergoing structural alteration, it can benefit from up to a year's exemption. We believe this is a reasonable period of exemption, after which the dwelling is subject to 50 per cent council tax whilst it remains unoccupied.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/3">Government guidance in PPG 7--The Countryside--encourages the re-use of rural buildings and should be taken into account by local planning authorities in preparing development plans and in individual development control decisions.

If any new information is provided which calls into question the relevant safety assessments, this would be considered carefully and appropriate action taken. The Novel Foods applications process has, from December 1999, been made yet more open by the publication of UK applications for novel foods on the Internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.6/2">The fee in question appears to relate to the statutory requirement under the national list regulations for making written representations about proposed national list decisions and applies equally to GM and conventional varieties. The requirement pre-dates the advent of GM plant varieties and was introduced to help meet the cost of operating the representations and hearings arrangements in the national list system.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.6/3">The national list system does not itself address the safety aspects of GM traits. This is dealt with under quite separate legislation. No GM plant variety may be proposed for addition to the national list until the appropriate GM consents have been obtained.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.2/1">As part of our objectives of reducing crime and dispensing justice fairly, we have already put in place a comprehensive programme of work to reduce the rate of reoffending. This includes ensuring that the prison and probation services work more effectively together; improving the enforcement of community penalties; developing programmes, in custody and in the community, which are known to reduce reoffending (based on the &quot;what works&quot; strategy) and building on the opportunities which new technology opens up.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/2">Together these developments present an opportunity to consider possible new forms of sentences which better protect the public and reduce reoffending. In particular, they open up the possibility of a more flexible sentencing structure in which the boundaries between custodial and community penalties are less rigid. However, the current legal framework established in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 may not be best suited to an approach of this sort. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has therefore decided to review that framework. The review will complement that of the criminal courts being conducted by Lord Justice Auld. Its terms of reference will be:</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/3">&quot;In the light of the Government's objectives to protect the public by reducing crime and reoffending, and to dispense justice fairly and consistently, to consider what principles should guide sentencing decisions; what types of disposal should be made available to the courts in order to meet the overarching objectives; the costs of different disposals and their relative effectiveness in reducing reoffending; what changes therefore need to be made to the current sentencing framework, as established by the Criminal Justice Act 1991, so as more effectively to reduce reoffending, including any transitional and consequential arrangements; and the likely impact of any recommendations in terms of costs and the effects on the prison population. In particular, the review should bear in mind the desirability of promoting flexibility in the use of custodial and community based approaches.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/4">The review will be led by a senior official from the Home Office. I want it to be a rigorous, evidence based exercise. It will operate in an open way, involving and seeking views from as wide a range of interests as possible. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary expects it to take about 12 months from now to produce recommendations, which will then be the subject of formal consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.5/1">The Government know of some recent concern in relation to police investigations into alleged offences under the Official Secret Acts.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/2">Sections 11, 13 and 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 afford &quot;journalistic material&quot; special protection. It is recognised in Section 9 of the Act, however, that there are occasions when it will be right to allow the police to seek an order from a circuit judge for the production of such material. Failure to comply with a production order will leave it open for the judge to punish the person concerned for contempt.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/3">This procedure is compatible with Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which, in its third paragraph, recognises that freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities. It sets out areas where that freedom may be subject to restrictions if they are provided by law and necessary in a democratic society. Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights makes similar provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/4">It is quite proper for the police to use these powers to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing and they should do so free from government direction or interference. It is also right for the courts to determine where the balance should lie between journalistic freedom and the other interests recognised both by the covenant and the convention.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.0/1">Research into the pathogenicity and epidemiology of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy has been extensive. Last year this Government spent over &pound;26 million on research on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies. There has been no specific research to detect these agents in medicines. However, when bovine materials are used in the manufacture of some human vaccines and some injectable medicines, manufacturers are required to comply with the European Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Medicinal Products. This requires careful sourcing of the bovine materials such as from countries where there have been no reported cases of BSE, the nature of the animal tissue used in the manufacture, and the production process and its control.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/2">For injectable products that do not include bovine material as an ingredient in the finished product, purification processes designed to remove the material are used. The manufacturers of such products are required to provide validation of those processes to the Medicines Control Agency. For products that include bovine material in the finished product, compliance with the guidance minimises any risk of the presence of BSE infected material at any stage of the manufacturing process.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.2/1">In the 1950s, prior to controls being undertaken, cattle to human transmission was thought to be responsible for over 2,000 human deaths a year and many more non-fatal infections. The main route of transmission was believed to be milk. Following the introduction of pasteurisation of milk and controls in cattle including the tuberculin testing of cattle, the numbers of confirmed human Mycobacterium bovis infections have fallen to around 40 a year, averaging 1.2 per cent of confirmed tuberculosis cases between 1993 and 1998. Many of these infections are in older people and are thought to represent reactivation of old disease. When infection occurs in children it is recently acquired. Between 1994 and 1998 only one of 342 (0.3 per cent) confirmed cases of TB in children aged 0 to 14 years was identified as Mycobacterium bovis. It is not clear whether this particular infection was contracted from infected milk or meat.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.2/1">We recognise the importance of updating the legislation governing discipline in the Armed Forces. It has been the intention for some time to consolidate the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957. We have been taking stock of the consolidation in the light of the changes to the present legislation made by the Armed Forces Discipline Bill and the likelihood of further changes in the quinquennial Armed Forces Bill in the next Session. A further consideration is the Government's intention, indicated in the Strategic Defence Review, to replace the three present Acts with a single tri-service Act. It is planned that the substantive development of this important project should get under way as soon as the quinquennial Bill is enacted and that, when the work is complete, the resulting legislation should be introduced when the parliamentary timetable allows. As a consequence, legislation consolidating the present Acts would be likely to have an effective life of only a few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/2">We have therefore concluded that the most sensible approach would be to subsume consolidation within the development of the tri-service Act, the purpose of which will be to provide legislation that better meets the requirements of the three services in an increasingly joint environment.</p>
