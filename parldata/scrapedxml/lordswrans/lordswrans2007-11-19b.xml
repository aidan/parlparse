	<p pid="b.40.2/2">The research is being conducted in collaboration with commercial companies which are capable of developing the technologies in a miniaturised form that is portable and reliable in the field, as well as producing the complex equipment required at an affordable cost. This equipment must also be robust and able to be disinfected when moved from farm to farm. Progress in this area is being made, but more research is needed in relation to safety, appropriate cost, and the ability to diagnose all strains of the FMD virus. The opportunity has been taken, during the recent FMD outbreak, to contribute to the validation of the lateral flow device; one of the potential on-farm diagnostic methods currently being developed.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.6/1">The UK position with regard to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 1989 (ILO 169) was set out in a 1989 White Paper (<I>Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries</I>, Command Paper Number: CM 1078). As the White Paper noted, ILO 169 was essentially an update of the 1957 ILO Convention 107. The White Paper explained that Convention 107 could not be applied in the UK as there were no indigenous, tribal or semi-tribal people there, and so had not been ratified by the UK. These same arguments applied to Convention 169 as it did not alter the scope of Convention 107. This position still stands. The UK takes its international law obligations very seriously and as a general rule will sign and ratify an instrument only when we can ensure our full compliance with it and commit to its implementation.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.5/4">ONS does not publish separate estimates for flows of personal remittances. Estimates of personal remittance flows to and from the United Kingdom are included in the UK Balance of Payments &quot;Pink Book&quot;, table 5.1, within the published series for other receipts of and payments by households and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH).</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/5">There are components produced at a lower level than these published data, which broadly represent cross-border household to household transfers, and are therefore close, in concept, to personal remittances. However these estimates are highly uncertain which is why they are not published separately on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/6">ONS has estimated that remittances comprise at least 75 per cent of the series published in the Pink Book for total payments and receipts by households and NPISH. The estimates for each of the five years are in the table below. However it should be stressed that these estimates are highly uncertain.</p>
	<table>

It should be noted, however, that estimates of future sale proceeds are subject to fluctuations in the property market and cannot be guaranteed.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.2/2">For reasons of commercial sensitivity it is not possible to itemise each asset currently planned for disposal. However, the largest anticipated sale is that of Defra-owned land and buildings at Guildford, which we expect to account for approximately one-third of the income from asset disposals over the period 2007-08 to 2010-11.</p>
