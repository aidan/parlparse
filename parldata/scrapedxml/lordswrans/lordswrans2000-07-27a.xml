The Government does not know how many other similar applications may have been made and rejected without communication, or may await consideration by the Court and may be communicated later. It is not possible to list the numbers for each category because not all applications contain the necessary information. But the majority, including the original case of this type Benham v UK, fall into category (b): community charge default.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.5/2">The controls exercised by my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment have been adjusted in the light of the new company structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.5/3">Each company's Memorandum and Articles of Association were approved by the Secretary of State and the Department for Education and Employment continues to exercise similar controls over the companies, although the Secretary of State's right to appoint the Chairman and between 30 and 49 per cent of Ufi Limited's Board of Directors/members is now time-limited to <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.74.5/4">The previous Funding Agreement between the Department and Ufl Ltd. has been superseded by one with both companies which provides for a number of checks and controls on the spending of public funds.

This regime will apply only so long as Ufi Limited receives government support.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.5/6">If the Funding Agreement is terminated due to breach of contract or insolvency, the intellectual property rights will pass to the Secretary of State if he so requests. The Memorandum of the charity provides that, if it is wound up or dissolved, the Secretary of State has a right of veto over the disposition of any remaining assets. The charity cannot dispose of any of the shares of Ufi Limited without the prior authority of the Secretary of State. The charity cannot alter the constitution of Ufi Limited in so far as this affects the Secretary of State's controls.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.2/1">As the noble Lord is aware, the Annual Report describes, amongst other factors, the Government's progress in improving standards of education. It also underlines our commitment to ensure &quot;high standards are met in every school and college&quot; so that &quot;the talents of all can be developed to the full&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/2">My right honourable Friend the Secretary of State's decision to approve the proposals to close Merrywood fully accords with this commitment. In reaching his decision, the Secretary of State was mindful of the fact that Merrywood has been in special measures since April 1997. Since going into special measures, OFSTED has undertaken seven monitoring visits. Despite this, the school has still not made sufficient improvements to be removed from special measures. Numbers on roll are low, attendance levels are low and academic achievement is the lowest in the LEA. As a result, the small number of pupils displaced by the school's closure will be likely to benefit by accessing a better standard of education through attending alternative schools.</p>

It is not proposed that the Franchising Director will regulate car parking charges directly under the provisions of the Transport Bill. However, it is expected that there will be reasonable commercial and contractual incentives on operators to keep car parking charges to a minimum. Many train operators already have contractual commitments to provide CCTV and additional security patrols at station car parks. The Franchising Director will be seeking further improvements through the franchise replacement process.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.5/1">Following M.

He has achieved those two aims. In parallel with the changes he introduced to the product and the business, he instituted a complete review of budgets. The outcome of that review indicated a potential cost overspend by the end of the year of &pound;26 million unless measures were introduced to stem expenditure and find savings. Through the introduction of measures to increase revenue and by driving down costs, NMEC is confident that costs can be brought back to the original &pound;758 million ceiling. Under the terms of the grant agreement between NMEC and the Millennium Commission, the commission is required to approve the company's budgets. The commission accepted the outcome of the budget review and has ongoing discussions with the company about cost efficiencies and cost savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.5/2">The nature of the discussions prior to the appointment of M. Gerbeau as Chief Executive and the basis on which he agreed to take up the post are matters between him and the board of the company.

In June 1997, this Government gave the Dome project the go-head with five key commitments one of which was that it should have a lasting legacy in terms of the regeneration of the Greenwich peninsula.

	<p pid="a.86.8/1">Dome Europe has won the competition to take over the Dome when the Millennium Experience ends on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-31">31 December</phrase>. We believe their proposals will deliver a high quality, innovative and economically sustainable long-term future for the Dome, of which the people of Greenwich and the United Kingdom can be proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.8/2">The proposals will build on the remarkable achievements in constructing the Dome and delivering the Millennium Experience this year. Provision of a world-class visitor attraction will continue, and will benefit from Dome Europe's investment of around &pound;400 million in the core Dome site over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.8/3">In supporting the Dome's transition from the current Millennium Experience to another major visitor destination, Dome Europe is proposing to create an urban entertainment resort, through a combination of uses inside the Dome and on adjacent land. The latter will include hotels, a convention centre, commercial leisure, restaurants, residential units, offices, retail and community facilities. Whilst the proposals are all subject to the granting of planning permission, and much work remains to be done to complete the sale of the site, we are confident that Dome Europe's proposals will deliver an exciting contribution to the continued regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.8/4">We have further decided that, of the overall consideration for the sale of the Millennium Dome (details of which must remain commercially confidential at this stage), some &pound;53 million should be paid to the New Millennium Experience Company from total expected early payments from the competition of &pound;105 million. There is also provision for additional payment for land value in certain circumstances and a share of profits if and when the business changes hands. The remainder of this total amount, after meeting third party commitments, will go to English Partnerships. In reaching this view, we took account of the benefits to the Greenwich Peninsula and the Thames Gateway in terms of continuity of jobs and assured future private investment in the site, building on the substantial public investment already made--more than &pound;1 billion--towards major environmental, transport and other improvements on the Peninsula.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.8/1">Since October 1999 it has been our administrative practice to serve all persons detained under Immigration Act powers, whether or not they are asylum seekers, with a form of notice (the IS91R) giving written reasons for their detention. Reasons are given by way of a checklist. This honours a commitment given in the Fairer, Faster and Firmer White Paper. We are currently considering whether a requirement to give written reasons should be included in rules (which are to be made under Section 153 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) for the management of detention centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.8/2">Following concern expressed by the noble Earl and others at Third Reading of the Bill which became the 1999 Act, we undertook to review the IS91R form. That review is now nearing completion and our aim is to introduce a revised IS91R this October. Though I cannot pledge that we shall be able to satisfy them in every particular, we are confident that the revised form of notice will go some way towards meeting the concerns which have been expressed by noble Lords and others about the existing form.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.3/3">The analysis indicates that in 1999 off-course betting expenditure was about 14.7 per cent below the level it would have reached in the absence of the National Lottery and that, by implication, the horserace betting levy raised &pound;9-10 million less than it might otherwise have done.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.6/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Home Office, Mr Clarke, can confirm that Setting the Boundaries: reforming the law on sex offences, report of the review of sex offences, has been published today.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.6/2">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary set out the terms of reference for the review in his reply of <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-25">25 January 1999</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 80-81). The review was asked to look at the law in England and Wales and to make recommendations that will provide clear and coherent sex offences that protect the individual, particularly children and more vulnerable people from abuse and exploitation; enable abusers to be appropriately punished; and are fair and non-discriminatory in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.6/3">This review was open and inclusive--it involved many stakeholders directly in its steering group and advisory external reference group, and consulted with many more at a series of conferences and seminars. It has looked at the evidence from research and the experience of law reform in other countries. The review has now completed its report to Government. It has made far-reaching recommendations to strengthen the effectiveness and protection of the law for children, raised important questions about the nature of the protection that should be offered to vulnerable people, proposed codifying and clarifying the law on consent in rape and setting the law on a fair and non-discriminatory basis for men and women whether as victim or offender. It also recommends new laws for dealing with the trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation and the use of children in sexual exploitation, as well as looking at penalties and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.6/4">The issues involved are sensitive and complex ones, on which there will be differing views. It is a long time since we have had such a thorough and comprehensive set of proposals on the law of sex offences, based on careful thought and consultation. But these proposals are just that--recommendations made to Government by a broadly based review set up to provide the framework for further debate. The review involved many people from outside the civil service from many different groups and backgrounds, as well as civil servants from a wide range of departments. Before the Government can come to a conclusion on any of them we need further input and views on what is recommended. This is the start of a real debate on what we think the law should be and how it should be framed.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.6/5">We would like views on all of the proposals in the report. The review has posed some specific questions, but we want reactions to all the recommendations. We would like to know how well they would work, whether they would add to the protection of the vulnerable, whether they would apply fairly, equitably and with justice and whether there would be any effects or consequences that have not yet been identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.6/6">The Government particularly welcome the proposals to strengthen the law for children and vulnerable people--we have made great strides in tackling the issues of evidence for children and vulnerable people and it is time that the offences in the criminal law were revised to ensure robust and comprehensive protection for the weakest in our society. It is important to get the law right while ensuring that vulnerable people are not deterred from seeking advice from statutory authorities. We would welcome views on the proposals that relate to the protection of children and vulnerable people--what the impact and consequences of those would be. We welcome the review's clarity on the importance of the age of consent and the need to maintain it at 16.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.6/7">The Government do not think it would be right to take a view on the proposals in the report until they have been scrutinised and tested in consultation. This report and its proposals are not an end but a beginning--the report provides a carefully argued framework for consideration by all those who are affected, personally or professionally, by these proposals. The report is being made widely available in summary and full form both in hard copy and on the Home Office website. It is free and available on request, as is a supporting volume of evidence. The period for consultation is long--until March 2001--to give time for the full implications of the proposals to be considered. My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Home Office, Mr Clarke, looks forward to an important social debate that will help the Government frame proposals for a safe, just and tolerant society.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.6/8">Copies of the report and summary have been placed in the Library and the Vote Office.</p>
