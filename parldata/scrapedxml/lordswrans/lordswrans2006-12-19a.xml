	<p pid="a.293.2/1">A number of initiatives have recently been introduced to assist first-time buyers in Northern Ireland. The co-ownership scheme, which has, since 1978, assisted almost 20,000 mainly first-time buyers to become home owners, was amended earlier this year to make it more accessible for people on lower incomes while the starting threshold for stamp duty on property was increased to &pound;125,000. In addition, an independent housing affordability review has been initiated. This will look at barriers affecting those seeking affordable housing in the owner occupied, social and private rented sectors and make recommendations as to how these might be overcome. A progress report will be issued for public comment later this month and the final recommendations will be presented to Government next spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.2/1">Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. It is DfID's fifth largest programme. The UK is Afghanistan's second largest bilateral donor. At the London conference in January 2006, DfID committed to providing &pound;330 million in development assistance over the next three years. This forms part of the UK's overall pledge of &pound;500 million over the next three years to reduce poverty, improve security and governance and tackle the opium industry. The UK aid budget for Afghanistan is &pound;102 million this year, rising to &pound;113 million in 2007-08, and &pound;115 million in 2008-09. In addition, DfID contributes 18 per cent&mdash;around &pound;125 million&mdash;of the European Commission's pledge of &euro;1 billion over 2002-2007, and 10.4 per cent of the World Bank's spending in Afghanistan of $250-300 million a year. We also contribute to UN programmes and to the Asian Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/2">Iraq currently requires help from the UK and others to stem violence and build a stable society and economy. In 2003, the UK pledged &pound;544 million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for Iraq. The UK has now fully disbursed this pledge and committed a further &pound;100 million to be spent on reconstruction and development in Iraq over the next three years.</p>

The attached table illustrates the action that has been taken.

			<tr pid="a.296.2/8"> <td>1.</td> <td>The board recommends that command relationships are clearly articulated in operational orders and that the whole chain of command is clearly briefed as to whom it reports to and who tasks it.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. A review of command relationships training conducted during individual training courses was undertaken in 2004. As a result of this review, it was recommended that a further review of training objectives was to be conducted in conjunction with arm and service directors to ensure that training objectives are included in appropriate phase 2 and 3 courses for both TA and regular officers and soldiers, where training is not already delivered.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/9"> <td>2.</td> <td>The board recommends that any operations room operating in this sort of environment adopts a uniform booking out system. It further recommends that the system be checked on a regular basis to ensure that all attached units are complying and that an all informed patrol matrix is being maintained.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. A review of operations room procedures training conducted during individual training courses was undertaken in 2004. As a result of this review, it was recommended that a further review of training objectives was to be conducted in conjunction with arm and service directors to ensure that training objectives are included in appropriate phase 2 and 3 courses for both TA and regular officers and soldiers, where training is not already delivered.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/10"> <td>3.</td> <td>The board recommends that watchkeepers are trained in maintaining a log and that it is made clear to them that logs could potentially become an exhibit in legal proceedings.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. A review of watchkeeping skills training conducted during individual training courses was undertaken in 2004. As a result of this review, it was recommended that a further review of training objectives was to be conducted in conjunction with arm and service directors to ensure that training objectives are included in appropriate phase 2 and 3 courses for both TA and regular officers and soldiers, where training is not already delivered.   The specific requirements for maintenance, accuracy and retention of the log are to appear as a reminder on the cover of the log sheet (Army form B58).</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/11"> <td>4.</td> <td>The board recommends that a review be conducted of Royal Military Police (RMP) officer training to ensure that its young officers are better trained to command small isolated detachments. Additionally, the board recommends that thought is given to the RMP carrying out more infantry training, specifically focusing on infantry skills.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. Provost Marshal (Army) review of operational performance standards for Military Police Officers Course (MPOC) and RMP Company Commander's Course (CCC) has taken place. Adjutant- General Corps Training and Development Team has amended training objectives for both courses to include the management of command and control relationships at the appropriate level, when operating both integral to and detached from RMP units. Training has been delivered to MPOC from April 2005 and RMP CCC from September 2005. The recommendation for RMP to carry out additional infantry training was not agreed as there is no indication that any shortfall in infantry training had any bearing on the outcome of this incident. Training of the RMP must reflect the functional requirement and be based upon policing and associated skills within an all arms environment.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/12"> <td>5.</td> <td>The board strongly recommends that a detailed communications estimate is carried out on entering theatre, which is then regularly updated. Additionally, urgent operational requirement (UOR) funds should be made available to purchase additional, off-the-shelf communications assets as required.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. Theatre communications estimates are carried out in all cases and reviewed at regular intervals. The type and number of communications systems available in theatre has increased significantly, heavily utilising the UOR process. Additions include: 210 Thuraya Sat phones, improved and extended coalition secure tactical network and improved coverage of Iraqi mobile phone network.   In addition the Army is currently in the process of totally overhauling its communications equipment as part of the Bowman project (providing an increase in reliability and availability of communications assets).   Theatre standard operating procedures have been revised to ensure that all patrols deploy with a minimum of two separate forms of communications, in two separate vehicles, to allow for redundancy (this policy also applies to Afghanistan)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/13"> <td>6.</td> <td>The board recommends an assessment be carried out as to the suitability for the RMP to train and operate the general purpose machine gun (GPMG).</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. GPMG have been added to the equipment table of RMP units for the purposes of self-protection at a scaling of five per regiment and three per independent company, to provide for local area protection.   Note: There was no evidence to suggest that a lack of firepower had any bearing on the outcome of this incident, and the chain of command expressed concerns that the issue of heavy weapons would detract from the ability of the RMP to conduct its primary function. No further staff action was taken regarding the recommendation for training.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/14"> <td>7.</td> <td>All personnel issued with grenades must be trained in their operating procedures before issue.</td> <td>Closed.   It is mandatory that soldiers complete all basic lessons and weapon-handling tests (WHT) before any live firing/throwing of weapons takes place. Appropriate reminders are to be periodically issued to the chain of command.   Note: The board had raised concerns that grenades were issued to the RMP without appropriate training, but it should be noted that within the context of this operation, grenades had been withdrawn from the whole battlegroup on the basis that they were no longer appropriate. There was therefore no suggestion that the lack of grenades had any direct bearing on the outcome of this incident.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/15"> <td>8.</td> <td>The scaling of ammunition should be set at battlegroup (BG) level and individual detachment commanders should not be able to dictate ammunition holdings.</td> <td>Closed   The PJHQ has reviewed current policy for the scaling of ammunition for operational theatres and has confirmed that extant procedures for calculating overall scales using A606 procedures should remain. Minimum scales for individual weapons are to be set at BG level to ensure consistency throughout the area of responsibility and individual detachment commanders are not to be allowed to reduce holdings below this level.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/16"> <td>9.</td> <td>The board recommends that morphine is made available to soldiers operating in potentially hostile environments.</td> <td>Closed.   Morphine is available to all personnel operating in all potentially hostile environments, as long as there are no contraindications to its use. The actual decision as to whether to issue it in any given situation is a tactical one, based on an adequate risk assessment and is an executive rather than a medical one.   Note: The board had concluded that morphine was available if it had been asked for. Concerns over misuse, which is not supported by any evidence provided to the board, or the risk of disciplinary action if lost was not considered germane to the board's proceedings. The policy for accounting for controlled drugs already existed when this recommendation was made.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/17"> <td>10.</td> <td>The board recommends that, where practical, consideration be given to providing an officer from Army Legal Services as a BOI member.</td> <td>Closed.   The advantage of having an Army Legal Services officer as either the president or as a member of a board of inquiry had already been recognised and was reflected in standing orders at the time the recommendation was made.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/18"> <td>11.</td> <td>HQ LAND gives direction on the outstanding disciplinary issues which should be resolved before the findings are exposed to the families.</td> <td>Closed.   Disciplinary action had been ruled out prior to the release of the board of inquiry report to the families of the six RMP.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.296.2/19"> <td>12.</td> <td>Any meeting between the families and MoD representatives are carefully orchestrated, with terms of reference agreed in advance.</td> <td>Closed   Procedures already exist to handle all such meetings with sensitivity.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.300.8/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) has provided assistance totalling some &pound;250 million to the Government of Montserrat (GoM) since the beginning of the volcanic crisis of 1995-7. As part of this, DfID and GoM agreed in 2004 a country policy plan and indicative funding of &pound;40 million for the three years to March 2007. A new multi-year support plan, and associated funding, is expected to be agreed next year.

	<p pid="a.307.2/1">The recent Leitch review on skills supports the stance that estimating the exact number of skilled or otherwise qualified personnel to fulfil the needs of science-related industries is difficult and not advisable in a dynamic and rapidly changing economy. It does not believe that the Government should aim to predict the impact of future technological advances and attempt centrally to provide the skills they believe will be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.2/2">The Government can and do analyse data on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects, employment rates of science graduates, international comparisons of stocks and flows of science skills, and consider national employer skills surveys. Such analyses (for example, the DTI's economic paper No. 16 <I>Science, Engineering and Technology Skills in the UK </I>March 2006, and DfES research report 775: <I>The Supply and Demand for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Skills in the UK Economy</I>) suggest that, at the broadest level, the supply of STEM skills is likely to meet demand over the next decade. However, we accept that there is the need for further action regarding the situation for specific science subjects, such as engineering and physical sciences. The falls in participation in mathematics and science A-levels are equally a cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.2/3">The Government have, therefore, made science education a high priority. The <I>Science and Innovation Investment Framework 2004-14: next steps</I> and STEM programme reports set out our commitment to improving STEM skills by increasing attainment of science and mathematics at GCSE level, increasing participation in science subjects post-16 and improving the quality and number of science teachers.</p>

	<p pid="a.311.6/1">The chief executive of Water Service (Mrs Katharine Bryan) has been asked to write to the noble Lord in response to this Question.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.6/2"><I>Letter from Mrs Katharine Bryan to Lord Laird dated December 2006.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.311.6/3">You recently asked a Parliamentary Question to ask Her Majesty's Government what proposals they have to invest in sewerage facilities in the Coleraine, Portrush and Portstewart areas (H1955). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.6/4">Water Service is investing significant resources to upgrade the sewerage facilities in this area in order to cater for the existing and future needs of the residents and to meet increasingly stringent environmental standards. An extensive study of the north coast area, in terms of existing and required wastewater treatment facilities up to the year 2032, was completed by Water Service in 2002. The study, which took account of technical, economic and environmental considerations, concluded that the construction of a new wastewater treatment works to serve Coleraine, Portrush, Portstewart, Castlerock and Articlave represented the optimum solution for the provision of the wastewater treatment facilities required in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.6/5">The North Coast Wastewater Treatment Works scheme is a substantial project, costing in the region of &pound;45 million. Construction commenced in January 2005 and the works are now nearing completion. Wastewater flows are scheduled to be diverted from Portstewart in April 2007, Portrush and Coleraine in May 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.6/6">Work associated with the construction of new pumping stations at Coleraine, Portrush, Portstewart Castlerock and Articlave, which will allow transfer flows to the new north coast works, will permit the removal of effluent discharges to the Articlave and Bann Rivers and to the sea at Castlerock, Blackrock and Ramore Head. A considerable amount of work has already been completed on the upgrading of the sewerage network in the Portrush and Portstewart areas and a number of recommendations identified by a study of the Coleraine area have been included in Water Service's capital investment programme.</p>
