	<p pid="b.1.1/2" qnum="HL3116">What pilots the Department of Health has commissioned on targeted screening and brief interventions in accordance with the Government's Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy, to ascertain whether and how the various models can provide value for money in terms of cost savings to the National Health Service; and why there is no coherent alcohol strategy for hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.2/1">The Department of Health has completed a tendering process and has selected a consortium, led by Newcastle University and St. George's Medical School, University of London, to operate a programme of pilots (now referred to as trailblazers). This will let the Government know whether and how the various models of alcohol screening and brief interventions can provide clinically effective and cost-effective interventions within the National Health Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/2">The contract has still to be finalised, but the pilots will operate in three settings: primary care, accident and emergency and criminal justice settings. Current evidence indicates that alcohol screening and brief interventions can be effective in some hospital settings such as accident and emergency, fracture clinics and facial injury clinics, but the evidence is inconclusive for other general hospital wards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/3">The department recently launched <i>Alcohol Misuse Interventions: Guidance on Developing a Local Programme of Improvement</i>. This provides those responsible for the planning of health services, including hospitals, with guidance to improve local arrangements for delivering alcohol interventions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.5/1">Such estimates should be compared with the figure given in the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit's interim analytical report on alcohol-related harm only if the same methodology and comparable data sources are used. This would not however, identify changes as a result of the Licensing Act 2003 distinct from changes resulting from other influences. The Government take alcohol-related crime and disorder seriously and through the Licensing Act 2003 introduced a range of new closure powers and increased penalties to enable swift action to address problems. The impact of the Act on levels of crime and disorder will be evaluated in due course, though this will not include an analysis of the cost of alcohol-related crime and disorder. To date, there is no clear evidence that levels of alcohol-related crime and disorder have changed as a result of the Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.5/1">The Government have no plans to delay formal enlistment age into the Armed Forces until an individual's 18th birthday. If the Armed Forces were required to raise the minimum age of entry, it would create serious manning problems, since 35 per cent. of all recruits in financial year 2004&ndash;05 were aged under 18. The services, in particular the Army, would be unable to man current structures and maintain current capabilities. It is probable that, should the minimum entry age be raised, good quality school leavers would settle into other careers and thus be lost to the services.</p>

From the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase> the health message also included advice to avoid contact with firefighting foam.

	<p pid="b.4.2/5">A further joint statement from these health bodies was issued on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase> advising that the assessment to date is that there has been no significant impact on health following the incident, provided members of the public had followed the earlier advice, and that there was no likelihood of further acute risk to health.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.6/1">The Government's drug strategy aims to reduce the harms caused by all illicit drugs. To do this, it focuses on the most dangerous drugs&mdash;heroin, crack and cocaine (class A)&mdash;the most damaged communities and those whose drug use causes most harm to themselves and others. For young people, the Government provide universal drugs education and targeted interventions for vulnerable young people who are most likely to develop drug misuse problems. For example, the FRANK helpline offers honest, credible advice to young people, their parents and carers about illegal drugs and has attracted more than a million calls and over 6 million website visits. Class A drug use among young people aged 16&ndash;24 is stable. Internationally, through the Concerted Inter-Agency Drugs Action group (CIDA), UK law enforcement agencies are working together, and in partnership with those in South America, the Caribbean, Spain and the Netherlands, to tackle the supply of cocaine to the UK at all stages of the chain. Between April 2001 and December 2004, CIDA agencies seized 52 tonnes of cocaine bound for the UK market and recovered over &pound;94 million of drug-related criminal finances, as well as disrupting or dismantling 605 drug trafficking organisations. They have also increased substantially the number of cocaine swallowers detected in Jamaica.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.6/2">Nationally, individuals charged with certain offences in the 97 areas with the highest levels of acquisitive crime are tested for class A drugs under the Government's drug interventions programme (DIP). This is one of a number of interventions aimed at identifying drug misusing offenders and moving them away from crime and into treatment and support services. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire police have the power to test for class A drugs on arrest for certain trigger offences. Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a drug worker. These new powers will be expanded further from <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>. For drug treatment, heroin misuse has been the main problem and the focus of services. This situation is changing. The number of stimulant users (e.g. crack cocaine) presenting to treatment services is slowly increasing and effective interventions with this group include counselling or residential rehabilitation services. Most users use a range of drugs and drug services need to focus on individual clients' needs, not the drug of misuse. Increasingly, flexible treatment packages are being adopted in line with the National Treatment Agency's effectiveness strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.2/2">The department recognises that changes are taking place in some existing community hospitals. This may be because they do not provide the services needed by the local community, or are in antiquated buildings that it is not possible to refurbish to the standards of the 21st century NHS. A new generation of community hospitals and facilities will be required in order in order to respond to demographic changes and shifting needs of patients. Local health economies will need to plan these changes carefully in full consultation with their local communities.</p>

The central Home Office inquiry number is no longer an 0870 number and was replaced with 020 7035 4848 from September 2005. The 0870 number is being kept for 18 months as publicity material such as phone book entries will take a while to reflect the change.</p>

	<p pid="b.21.2/1">Ministers at the Department of Health have held four formal meetings with the NHS Litigation Authority since the start of January 2004. There have also been a small number of informal meetings (at conferences etc) during this period. At the formal meetings the issues of compensation payments and costs associated with claims for clinical negligence were discussed, among other issues. A search of the department's correspondence databases shows that three exchanges of correspondence have occurred between the NHSLA and Ministers since the beginning of 2004. One exchange dealt with the circumstances of an individual claim, one with the Arm's Length Bodies Review and the other related to a ministerial invitation to attend a meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/2">Officials from across the department meet and correspond on a very regular basis, both formally and informally, with the NHSLA and discuss a wide range of topics including compensation payments and costs associated with claims for clinical negligence. It is therefore not possible to quantify exactly how many meetings officials have attended or items of correspondence that have been issued.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.0/1">Until December 2003, the Lifer Management Unit was part of the Lifer Unit in Prison Service headquarters and was responsible for the arrangements relating to the transfer and categorisation of life sentence prisoners. On transferring to the Home Office in December 2003, the Lifer Unit was renamed the Lifer Review and Recall Section (LRRS) and then became part of the National Offender Management Service. The main functions of LRRS are confined to dealing with lifer parole review casework and life licensee casework. With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-01">1 February 2004</phrase>, the responsibilities for transferring and categorising life sentence prisoners within the closed lifer estate passed from LRRS to the Prison Service operational line. Consequently, most decisions on such matters are now taken by senior managers in prisons. Details of those changes are contained in Prison Service Instruction 08/2004, copies of which are in the House of Lords Library. Prison staff will continue to be responsible for managing lifers through sentence on the basis of the life sentence plan (LSP). The LSP provides a structure for staff to plan, monitor and record the way in which individual lifers can address and reduce their risk factors during sentence. The LSP will continue to be kept under review in the light of the development of risk assessment models and the impact of the population trends for lifer and indeterminate sentence prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.3/1">The School Admissions Code of Practice makes clear that interviewing is poor practice. Admission authorities must have regard to the code when setting their arrangements. The High Court held in December 2004 (in <i>The Governing Body of the London Oratory School</i> v <i>The Schools Adjudicator</i>) that there might be times when an admission authority could justify departing from the code's guidance, if it could show good reason for doing so. The court did not rule specifically on the issue of interviewing.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.3/2">The existing system effectively combines legislation, code and the adjudicator as a means of allowing some flexibility within limits, and providing a means of considering objections to potentially unfair admission arrangements.</p>
