	<p pid="a.3.5/1">The two tests currently used in Britain and other developed countries for the antemortem diagnosis of TB in cattle are the tuberculin skin test (the primary screening test) and the gamma interferon blood test (the ancillary test). Both tests have been subjected to extensive validation and research work published by British and foreign authors in international peer-reviewed journals over many years, and as a result, they have been officially recognised by the EU Commission and the OIE (International Animal Health Organisation).</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/2">The Government receive advice on the specific applications and performance of the tests in Britain from specialists within Defra (including the Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA)), independent experts and, previously, from the former Independent Scientific Group (ISG) on cattle TB. These advisers are all familiar with, and are regular contributors to, the peer-reviewed scientific literature on this subject. Additionally, all the research on the gamma interferon test conducted at VLA's TB research group (an internationally renowned centre of excellence in this particular field) is peer reviewed at the proposal and final report stages. All projects are also reviewed at least every five years by external experts as part of Defra's science programme review.</p>

Officials from these bodies met again in December 2007 to discuss what should be elevated to the subsequent ministerial IDMGb meeting. Given that the last ministerial IDMGb agreed that a study into conservation priorities in the overseas territories should be carried out by the JNCC, this will certainly be one of the issues which will be discussed. The next meeting of the ministerial IDMGb is scheduled for the latter half of June 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.5/1">Current digital radios require more energy than their traditional analogue counterparts to process the signals they receive. Evidence from the Government's market transformation programme (MTP) suggests that on average, a digital radio requires around 8.5 watts to operate compared to the 2 watts needed for an analogue radio. While there is little evidence that this gap is closing at present, in line with most new technologies it is likely that we will see some gains in efficiency as digital radios develop over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.5/2">While the MTP has not carried out any tests to estimate the energy consumed by listening to digital radio via a television and set-top box receiver, the Energy Saving Trust (EST) fairly recently tested four televisions in this way. These tests indicated that listening to digital radio in this way required between 60 and 183 watts. The actual energy used varied according to the type of television, the screen size and whether the screen was on or the display was black. Black screen display is available only for BBC radio channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.5/3">&quot;Screen blanking&quot;, which allows the selected radio station to be received in audio only, can reduce the energy consumption to around 25 watts. Although not yet widely available, we expect this technology to become more common in the near future.</p>

The first is the annual report of the Foreign Compensation Commission, which is produced as a requirement of the Foreign Compensation Act 1950. The second is the annual report of the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission, which is laid pursuant to Section 2(6) of the Marshall Aid Commemoration Act 1953.

This is a tight deadline which can be met only through a concerted effort from both Ivorian and international institutions. The UN Operation in Cote d'Ivoire has a mandate to certify the election process. Its most recent report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-15">15 April</phrase>, which can be found at <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/sgrep08.htm">www.un.org/Docs/sc/sgrep08.htm</a>, indicated that while there was a political consensus on holding elections there was still much work to be done. It also noted the elections would bear serious risks if they were not conducted in a transparent, free and credible manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/2">The Federation of Students of Cote d'Ivoire (FESCI) is the focus for a report on human rights abuses published by Human Rights Watch in May 2008. The report focuses on the past role of FESCI as a political mob for hire. In December 2007 FESCI elected a new leadership team who have tried to refocus the work of the students' union on educational matters rather than national politics. There has been a considerable reduction in the cases of abuse and intimidation by students on the wider population since the appointment of the new FESCI president. There does, however, remain a risk that politicians will attempt to mobilise FESCI support during the electoral process.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.0/1">All public procurers are required to seek value for money (VFM), normally through fair and open competition. Authorities must also comply with their legal obligations under the EU procurement rules and adhere to the EU treaty principles. Equality in the context of the Question refers to the principle that all suppliers be treated equally; ie opening supply opportunities to all, regardless of their status and reducing barriers to their participation in public procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/2">VFM is defined as the optimum combination of whole-life costs and quality to meet the user requirement. Accounting officers have a responsibility to deliver VFM for the Exchequer as a whole. In areas of common spend such as commodity goods and services, including mobile phone services, collaborative procurements, carried out on behalf of a range of public bodies, are likely to result in improved value for the Exchequer and often for individual authorities, compared with individual, department-specific procurements. There are a number of pan-government framework agreements already established, including the OGCbuying.solutions frameworks for mobile telephony, which departments should always consider before an independent procurement is originated as they usually lead to better VFM. OGC's new on-line policy and standards framework guides departments through the key principles and processes of public procurement.</p>

Passage of the torch relay through any country is a matter for the authorities of the country concerned. We and EU partners do, however, continue to make clear our concerns for Tibetans involved in the recent unrest, including that they have access to the medical and legal assistance of their choice. The EU raised these concerns at the most recent round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which took place in Slovenia on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-15">15 May</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/1">We agree that the way to resolve the underlying issues in Tibet is through dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama. Following the recent events in Tibet and surrounding areas, we have, together with EU partners, consistently emphasised to both sides the need for genuine discussions. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister did so most recently when he met the Dalai Lama in London on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-23">23 May</phrase>. We welcome the recent meeting between Chinese officials and representatives of the Dalai Lama on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-04">4 May</phrase> as the first step in this process and hope the second round of talks due to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-11">11 June</phrase> will lead to substantive progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/2">We do not believe that a boycott of any part of the Olympic Games would help the situation in Tibet or elsewhere. On the contrary, we firmly believe that it is in our interest to support a successful Olympics in Beijing as part of China's re-engagement with the world. The Dalai Lama himself has made clear that he does not support a call for the boycott of the Olympics.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.8/1">The trial is intended to test the technical and operational feasibility and assess the potential costs and benefits of this type of transport solution in Great Britain. While there are a number of aspirations for tram train deployment in the UK, there are many practical operational, safety and technical issues that need to be overcome before agreement to implement this type of technology could be given.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.8/2">We are studying their potential in partnership with others in the rail industry and this includes looking at tram trains that are currently being used in other countries including Germany. The trial will occur in two phases. The first phase will test the application on the conventional rail network only, which in this instance is the Penistone Line. The second phase will test how the tram train operates between the conventional rail network and a street tram system.</p>
