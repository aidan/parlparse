The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) report on Rodent infestations in domestic properties in England reports on the extent of rodent infestations using data collected in the DETR's 1996 English House Condition Survey (EHCS). A key finding is that 0.4 per cent of dwellings were infested by indoor rats and 1.7 per cent of dwellings affected by outdoor rats. The infestation rates were higher in urban areas and dwellings in areas with substantial problems such as dereliction, litter, vacant properties and scruffy gardens had a higher rate of infestation. There are no similar data available from the EHCS on foxes.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.2/1">The Health and Safety Commission and Executive are responsible for regulating the health and safety of people at work. Employers working with large quantities of radioactive substances where off-site emergency plans and arrangements to inform the public may be necessary must comply with the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRR99), the Public Information for Radiation Emergencies Regulations 1992 (PIRER), and the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (NIA65, as amended, for nuclear licensed sites). This would include employers working with depleted uranium if the stock was sufficiently large.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">PIRER places a duty on employers that, where a radiation emergency is reasonably foreseeable and the public are likely to be in an area where they are liable to be affected by such an emergency, prior information is provided by the employer to members of the public. The approach is to consider, first, whether the quantities of radioactive substances are sufficient to require either an assessment under IRR99 or a review under licence conditions under NIA65, and second, to consider whether a radiation emergency could be considered to be reasonably foreseeable. Currently, the only sites requiring off-site emergency plans are nuclear sites and these plans are prepared by local authorities, who are also involved in the provision of information to the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.5/2">The aim of the regulations and the supporting approved code of practice and guidance is to help employers to establish a risk management framework so that exposure to ionising radiation is kept, not merely below the specified dose limits for individuals, but as low as is reasonably practicable. The guidance covers general precautions for staff who work with radioactive materials but it is not specific to work with depleted uranium products. Depleted uranium also has a recognised chemical toxicity and will be subject to the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999, and the associated approved code of practice and guidance.</p>

Figures for other years are not available. New generating capacity is expected to be added in the shape of combined cycle gas turbines and renewables.

	<p pid="a.165.2/2">For the first time in generations, there is a real prospect of uniting Europe. The Treaty of Nice brings this goal closer by reforming the EU's institutions to enable them to operate effectively after the accession of up to 12 new member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/3">The treaty increases the relative weight of Britain's vote in the Council of Ministers and raises the threshold for a qualified majority. The democratic legitimacy of decisions taken by qualified majority voting is assured by the addition of a population threshold, which means that the three largest member states (including the UK) can still block decisions together. In addition a qualified majority must have the support of at least the majority of member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/4">The treaty delivers a reformed Commission, with one Commissioner per member state from 2005 up to a maximum of 27. It proposes more qualified majority voting where this is in Britain's interests, and preserves the veto in areas where the Government said we would.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/5">It allows groups of member states to move ahead faster in some areas where it is clear that not all are ready to, provided that this co-operation meets the conditions we secured to protect the Single Market, prevent discrimination in trade between member states, ensure compatibility with existing agreements and guarantee that co-operation is open to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/6">A declaration to the treaty looks forward to a wide public debate about the future of the European Union. A further Intergovernmental Conference will be held in 2004 to make changes arising from this debate. Public consultation was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-07">7 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/7">In making the institutional changes necessary for the accession of new member states, the Nice Treaty opens the way for enlargement of the EU. This has been the goal of successive governments for the sake of the peace, stability, and prosperity of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/8">The Nice Treaty cannot enter into force until all member states have ratified it in accordance with their national procedures. The Government intend to introduce legislation to enable the UK to ratify the Nice Treaty as soon as it is practically possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.0/1">The Government are advised on matters of food safety by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/2">Beef from European Union member states may be imported freely into the United Kingdom under the rules of the single European market. From a food safety perspective, it must have been produced in accordance with the requirements of the Fresh Meat Directive (Directive 64/433/EEC), and those of Commission Decision 2000/418/EC on specified risk material controls that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-01">1 October 2000</phrase>. Imported beef from other member states is also subject to EU Trade Regulation 2777/2000, which bans the sale of beef from animals aged over 30 months at time of slaughter except those which have been tested negative for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). This regulation came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>. Moreover, the Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No 2) Regulations 1996, as amended, (and the equivalent in Northern Ireland) prohibits the sale for human consumption of beef from any animal aged over 30 months at the time of slaughter, with exemptions only for animals from specifically identified grass-fed herds in the United Kingdom, and for animals from 14 non-European Union countries that have traditionally supplied the UK and in which there has been no history of BSE. This legislation therefore applies to beef imported from other member states as well as to home produced beef.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/3">The recent cases of imported German beef found to have SRM still attached have been taken up with the European Commission and with the German national authorities. Two German abattoirs have had their licences to produce meat (both for their home and export markets) suspended by the relevant German authorities. In the UK, the Meat Hygiene Service (and its equivalent in Northern Ireland) has been instructed to check every single consignment of imported carcass beef from Germany which is received at licensed meat plants in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/4">Given the EU and domestic controls that are in place and the increased level of checks on beef imported into the UK from Germany, the FSA does not consider that a ban on further imports of beef from Germany is justified or warranted on public health grounds.</p>

The waiting time at Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust for some of these investigations has improved over the past six months (since August 2000). For example CT scans have improved to four weeks from 13 weeks. However, how long patients wait should depend on their clinical need. We do acknowledge that some patients can wait a long time for tests.

Failure to do this may result in contravention of existing legislation governing false and misleading labelling and presentation. The guidelines make clear in particular that products containing meat should not be described as &quot;British&quot; if they contain imported meat, but could be described as &quot;made in Britain from&quot; with either a specific (e.g. &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Danish&quot;) or general (e.g. &quot;imported&quot;) indication of the origin of the meat ingredients they contain.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.4/2" qnum="HL1230">Further to the Written Answer by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath on 12 March (WA 62), whether staff, capable of diagnosing deep vein thrombosis in the 25 hospitals referred to in the answer and who will be on call but not on site during the Easter holiday period, will be summoned automatically if a patient is suspected of having a deep vein thrombosis; and</p>
	<p pid="a.168.4/3" qnum="HL1231">Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Hunt of Kings Heath on 12 March (WA 62), how hospitals which do not have staff to use the relevant equipment out of normal working hours will know how serious the condition is; and what treatment is appropriate if tests are not carried out for up to three or more days.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.5/1">If a patient is suspected of having a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) then all 31 Accident and Emergency Departments in London will have staff available 24 hours, seven days a week to diagnose this condition, and treatment will commence. The 25 hospitals referred to in my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-12">12 March</phrase> (WA 62) will have staff on call to operate the equipment to confirm this diagnosis. As is normal National Health Service practice, if a member of staff is not on site but is on call, he or she will be contacted if it is deemed clinically necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.5/2">Decisions on the seriousness of a medical condition are matters for clinical judgment. The signs and symptoms of DVT are swelling and tenderness in the calf especially when the foot is flexed. The calf may also be tender and red. If the clot has travelled to the lungs (pulmonary embolus), there is chest pain and breathlessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.5/3">The initial treatment is with heparin, which rapidly thins the blood and prevents the DVT from becoming larger and causing a pulmonary embolus. Heparin is used because warfarin, the oral treatment, takes between 24 and 48 hours to have an effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.2/1">The Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill does not define Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as publishers but provides a defence in certain circumstances if a court were to hold that an ISP had published a tobacco advertisement. We believe that the Bill is fully compatible with the Electronic Commerce Directive. It provides appropriate defences for ISPs in circumstances where they are unaware that they are handling a tobacco advertisement.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.0/1">A response to Professor Banner's representations has been made through a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-21">21 February 2001</phrase> from the Chief Medical Officer. Professor Banner is a recently appointed Chairman of a sub-committee; he is not a member of the main Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), which advises the Government on vCJD and BSE.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/2">The letter from the Chief Medical Officer points out that the panel was established to advise on incidents involving the potential transmission of CJD or vCJD through clinical interventions. The role of the panel as a sub-group of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP)/Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) Joint Working Group, is to advise health authorities on the appropriate action to be taken on specific incidents involving clinical interventions on patients who went on to develop CJD or vCJD.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/3">SEAC at their meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-28">28 November</phrase> were informed about the key elements of the strategy to protect patients against possible vCJD risk that was to be announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-04">4 January 2001</phrase>. The extract from the SEAC public statement describes this discussion as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The Committee were informed of the Department of Health's strategy to combat the theoretical and presently unquantifiable risk of person to person transmission of vCJD via surgical instruments. A major initiative had been launched to improve standards of washing, decontamination and general hygiene, earlier identified by the Committee to be key steps in reducing risk. This would take some time to yield results. In the meantime, single use instrument sets for tonsillectomies were likely to be introduced in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/5" class="indent">The Committee welcomed the overall risk reduction strategy and the advances being made on decontamination. The committee also endorsed the concept of using tonsillectomy as a pilot scheme to see how single-use instruments would work in practice. In addition, the Committee recommended that the introduction of single-use instruments for other higher risk procedures should not be abandoned; that instrument labelling and tracking should be improved; that the monitoring of decontamination procedures should be both frequent and robust; and that it would be desirable for the reforms outlined to encompass private and military hospitals as well as the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/6">Thus, the strategy itself was broadly welcomed by SEAC, the parent committee. The announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-04">4 January 2001</phrase> drew on the public statement of SEAC.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/7">The Government value the work that the panel is undertaking and are allocating appropriate resources to enable it to fulfil its remit.</p>
