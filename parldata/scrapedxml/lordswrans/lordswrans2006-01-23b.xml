	<p pid="b.143.2/1">The Police Federation of England and Wales was established by the Police Act 1919, under which it has a statutory responsibility to represent its members in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency. There is no similar basis under which members of the Armed Forces could form an association along these lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.2/2">There are however a number of alternative processes in place to ensure members of the Armed Forces can express their views on matters which affect their service or their welfare. There are regular surveys to monitor welfare matters, and it is an integral part of the duty of our chain of command to look after the welfare and well-being of their people. Individuals have the right to complain about any matter relating to their service to the Defence Council. Further modernisation of the complaints process is being proposed, including the introduction of an independent element as part of the Armed Forces Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.144.5/1">We do not currently screen men for prostate cancer as both screening and treatment techniques are not sufficiently well developed to allow for such screening. However the Government are committed to introducing a national screening programme for prostate cancer if and when screening and treatment techniques are sufficiently well developed. The National Screening Committee keeps this work under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/2">Research under way in both Europe and the United States of America looking at whether screening using the prostate specific antigen test would reduce the death rate from prostate cancer is being monitored closely. It is worth noting that prostate cancer is the only cancer with a Department of Health research target, and we are currently spending the promised &pound;4.2 million a year. Much of this work is relevant to screening.</p>
