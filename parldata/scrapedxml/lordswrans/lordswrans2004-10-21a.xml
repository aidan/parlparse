	<p pid="a.93.0/1">Environmental reports relating to trials of Sonar 2087, including the report of the first sea trial of 2002, will be published on resolution of some outstanding copyright issues. This is expected by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/2">The global environmental impact assessment was produced on the basis of defining the potential for physical or physiological impacts on humans, mammals and fish and addressed methods by which they could be avoided or minimised. The behavioural impacts of Sonar 2087 on marine life were monitored during the June 2004 sea trial by an academic marine mammal behaviourist from Aberdeen University and will be addressed in the report on that trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/3">The in-service operational use of Sonar 2087 will adhere to the existing Royal Navy environmental command guidance (<i>Interim Command Guidance for Users of In-Service Active Sonars to Mitigate Against Marine Mammal Disturbance</i>).</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/4">Should new evidence be found which suggests a link between the current method of deploying Sonar 2087 and a detrimental effect on marine life then we would, as a matter of course, consider what changes to the current mitigation measures should be made.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.8/1">The Government, mainly through DfID, the FCO and MoD, support a number of African regional institutions including the Africa Union and the New Partnerships for African Development (NePAD). DfID's support to African institutions is to help them develop their own Plans for African development. UNHCR maintains a permanent presence at the African Union (AU) through the UN Liaison Mission at AU headquarters in Addis Ababa. The two organisations have had a joint Comprehensive Implementation Plan on refugees since March 2000. NePAD is now part of the AU and we expect the two institutions' contacts with UNHCR to be rationalised within the new joint structure in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.8/2">DfID's own co-operation with UNHCR is governed by a DfID institutional strategy paper (ISP), which was prepared in extensive consultation with UNHCR. DfID currently provides UNHCR with &pound;17 million unearmarked core funding per annum. Also, the Africa divisions of each organisation have co-operated on specific refugee issues. DfID Africa Division has funded a number of UNHCR country-specific appeals. In country-specific emergencies the UN consolidated appeals process, of which UNHCR is a part, is one of DfID's key needs assessment mechanisms.</p>
