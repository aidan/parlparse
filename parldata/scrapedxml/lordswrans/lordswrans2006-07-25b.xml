	<p pid="b.241.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/2" qnum="HL6933">Whether there are any legal impediments (a) to the imposition of a ban on imports to the United Kingdom of all primates, dead or alive; and (b) to the restriction of research using them to descendants of animals already resident in the United Kingdom.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-25b.241.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="241"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60725w0001.htm#06072541000093">
	<p pid="b.241.2/1">Any European Union (EU) or UK ban on the import of primates, dead or alive, not prohibited by the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) would amount to a prima facie breach of World Trade Organisation rules. In order for a ban to be justified, it would have to be capable of falling within the scope of the permitted exceptions listed in Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those most likely to apply are Article XX(a) (public morals), Article XX(b) (protection of health and life) and/or Article XX(g) (conservation of exhaustible natural resources). Further, any such restriction must also be compliant with the requirement that there is no unjustifiable or arbitrary discrimination nor a disguised restriction on trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/2">There are no animal health grounds for imposing a total ban on imports into the UK of all primates, dead or alive. A unilateral UK ban would not be in accordance with Community law, which provides for imports subject to compliance with animal health controls. The Government have no policy in favour of imposing restrictions on the import of non-CITES listed primates on the grounds of conservation.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/3">In addition, any restrictions on imports to the UK from within the European Community would have to be justifiable within Community law and the requirement of free movement of goods. Any departure from an EU-wide position on trade with third countries could be held to be in breach of trade rules under Community law.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/4">The restriction of research using primates to the descendants of animals already resident in the UK is not permissible under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which regulates the use of living animals in research and testing. This is because the 1986 Act gives the Secretary of State a discretion which can be used to authorise regulated procedures to be undertaken on primates which are sourced from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/5">Section 10(3) of the 1986 Act provides that the conditions of a project licence issued under the Act shall, unless the Secretary of State for the Home Department considers that an exception is justified, include a condition to the effect that no non-human primates shall be used under the licence unless it has been bred at a designated breeding establishment, or obtained from a designated supplying establishment. The Secretary of State for the Home Department cannot fetter his discretion to grant an exception; he must always consider each application on its merits. The published guidance on the operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gives guidance about the exercise of this discretion to permit the use of non-human primates from overseas.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.5/1">The majority of the 42 recommendations made by the biomass task force in October 2005 have been accepted fully or in principle. The remaining recommendations are being considered further, in some cases pending the outcome of ongoing reviews, such as the waste strategy review.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.5/2">The Government have identified 65 actions to take forward the recommendations of the biomass task force; most of these actions should be implemented by April 2007. A number of actions will, by necessity, continue beyond that date, such as the five-year capital grant scheme for biomass boilers and CHP systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.5/3">The majority of the measures proposed by the biomass task force require no additional funding. Among those actions that do, funding has been announced for the five-year capital grant scheme of &pound;10 million to &pound;15 million over the first two years. This funding will also support an additional round of the bio-energy infrastructure scheme. The level of funding for the continuation of support for the establishment of energy crops under the new rural development programme for England has yet to be finalised; it will be subject to EU and Government decisions on rural development funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.8/1">I can confirm that an employment agency would act as a gangmaster, as defined at Section 4 of the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, when supplying a worker to undertake work to which that Act applies. This includes work in the agriculture and food processing industries. The provisions of the Employment Agencies Act 1973 do not apply to those activities of an employment agency which are regulated by the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.8/2">Fees charged for a gangmaster licence range from &pound;250 to &pound;4,000. In addition, where the Gangmasters Licensing Authority considers it necessary, an additional fee ranging from &pound;1,600 to &pound;2,500 may be charged for an application inspection. An application inspection will involve a visit to the applicant's business lasting one to two days. Fees are banded according to business turnover with the highest fee levels applying to businesses with a turnover in the sector of more than &pound;10 million per annum. Fee rates have been set to reflect a business's ability to pay and to recover Gangmasters Licensing Authority operating costs. A full consultation was conducted before fee rates were fixed.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.29/1">The costs of the Olympics are under review. The Olympic Delivery Authority is currently procuring the delivery partner that will help it to deliver the Olympic and legacy construction. One element of the delivery partner's role will be to examine the Olympic programme and direct costs associated with it. We expect this assessment to be completed within six to nine months of the appointment. This assessment will need to be seen in the context of the legacy and wider regeneration benefits of the Olympics.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.44/1">No. Some exemptions are statutory, such as those for disabled blue badge holders, and others are invariably written into local authority traffic regulation orders, which local traffic authorities are empowered to make to create parking restrictions under powers in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, such as for vehicles used by the fire brigade, ambulance service and police, or vehicles being used to remove an obstruction. Also, there is a general exemption in &quot;no waiting&quot; areas for loading and unloading.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.44/2">In areas covered by decriminalised parking enforcement (DPE), local authorities issue waiver permits to allow vehicles to park, where parking restrictions apply, on specified stretches of road for specified periods.

	<p pid="b.241.92/2">Current copyright and design law provides a comprehensive regime for protecting and controlling the re-use of Crown and Ministry of Defence-owned intellectual property. However, the protection afforded is not perpetual and once it has expired manufacturers are free to reproduce the designs. The Ministry of Defence has in place a number of licensees who manufacture replica medals and miniatures for sale, for which fees are paid. We do not control the reproduction of the ribbons as, in the opinion of the MoD's intellectual property staff, the designs do not meet the originality threshold to obtain copyright or design protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.92/3">In addition, where we do have copyright protection, the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2005 obliges public sector bodies to licence the reproduction of this material on an equitable basis, where a request is received.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.92/4">My noble friend may be aware of the current Government review of intellectual property legislation by Andrew Gowers, under the Treasury. The MoD has made an informal submission to the review on the subject of protection of medals and decorations of the Armed Forces. However, the issue of the protection of honours is wider than just those for which the Armed Forces are eligible, these being the responsibility of the Honours Committee of the Cabinet Office. Ultimately it will be the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry, as the department responsible for intellectual property, to propose any legislative amendments that Ministers choose to implement from the report's recommendations.</p>

Any such applications, made to either the Jury Central Summoning Bureau or Crown Court, would be dealt with on their individual merits. In the case of a self- employed magistrate, the effect of jury service on both their work and their ability to sit as a magistrate would be taken into account in coming to a decision.

	<p pid="b.241.119/1">In the Ministry of Defence letter of <phrase class="date" code="">5 June</phrase> to the president of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal, the fourth paragraph states: &quot;As you are aware, the Ministry of Defence welcomed the decision by the Pensions Appeal Tribunal in the case brought by Mr Martin. The Tribunal's decision accepted the use of the umbrella term Gulf War Syndrome for accepted conditions which are causally linked to service in the 1990-91-Gulf War. The Secretary of State recognised that some veterans were concerned that the link between their ill-health and their service in the Gulf had not been sufficiently acknowledged. The Tribunal's decision in Martin gave a formal means of providing such recognition and it was for that reason, not least, that the Ministry of Defence welcomed it&quot;. The then veterans' Minister, in his Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November 2005</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 129WS), hoped that this formal recognition would help to provide an element of closure for those who have sought this acknowledgement of their ill health. The extract from the <phrase class="date" code="">5 June</phrase> letter was made in the context of the earlier ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.119/2">Moreover, in the spirit of helping to provide closure and acting in good faith, the Veterans' Agency in its notification letters to Mr McGreevy went further than required by including previously accepted conditions, which were linked to his Gulf service, under the umbrella term of Gulf War syndrome. While the <phrase class="date" code="">5 June</phrase> letter accepts that this was done in error, it nevertheless indicates the Ministry of Defence's willingness to assist in the closure process.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.149/1">We have agreed to purchase 10,000 certified emission reductions from the Kuyasa low-income housing energy upgrade project in Cape Town, South Africa, to offset the emissions attributable to the UK's presidency of the G8, including all the Prime Minister's flights. The Kuyasa project will retrofit 2,309 low-cost houses in the Khayelitsha township with insulated ceilings, solar water heaters and low-energy lightbulbs. The remaining contributions for the Prime Minister's flights in 2005 have been included in the Cabinet Office's offsetting under the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund. The process for establishing the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund is under way, and it will be launched formally later this year. Once this has happened, we will identify other projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.155/1">The White Paper, <I>Security in Retirement: Towards a new pensions system</I>, set out a package of reforms aimed at increasing the number of people entitled to a state pension and the amount to which they would be entitled.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.155/2">A key element in the package is to reduce the number of qualifying years for a full basic state pension to 30 for both men and women (from 44 for men and 39 for women now) reaching state pension age from 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.155/3">The reduction in qualifying years to 30 will mean around 125,000, or around 70 per cent of women reaching state pension age in 2010 are expected to achieve full entitlement&mdash;compared to around 50 per cent in 2010 without reform (Government Actuary Department's retirement pension model). The majority of those remaining are expected to achieve between about 61 to 99 per cent of a full basic state pension, with others getting up to 60 per cent full entitlement based on their own records, whereas without reform they may have got nothing. The information requested is in the tables below. The estimates are approximate and reflect the inevitable uncertainty associated with any future projection.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.176/2">An important input to this is the sustainable consumption round-table's recent report, which recommends ways in which government and business can enable people to exercise more sustainable consumption choices.

	<p pid="b.241.179/1">We are unable to give a value to the timber imports identified as illegally felled that enter the UK as timber imports are not identified as legal or illegal at ports of entry.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.179/2">The UK Government take the trade in illegally felled timber very seriously and are taking a range of actions to address it. The EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation adopted last year enables member states to enter into partnership agreements with developing countries and provide them with assistance to tackle illegal logging. This assistance will include a licensing system designed to identify products as legal and license them for export to the EU. It will be reinforced by powers for HM Customs to take a range of actions relating to unlicensed products from partner countries; this will allow member states to prohibit the import of illegal timber from those countries into the EU for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.179/3">The UK Government recognise that government purchasing policies can also send a strong signal to the market and timber suppliers. Since 2000, the UK Government have committed central departments to seek to procure products made from timber that has been legally harvested and grown in a sustainably managed forest or plantation.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.179/4">At the international level, the UK is also working with other major timber-consuming countries. Most recently, this has included following up G8 commitments to tackle illegal logging made at the G8 environment and development ministerial in 2005, and establishing a joint working group on forestry with China.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.182/1">According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations 2005 statistics, global deforestation, mainly due to conversion of forests to agricultural land, continues at a rate of 13 million hectares per year. At the same time, forest planting and natural expansion of forests have reduced the net loss of forest area. The net global change in forest area in the period 2000-2005 is estimated at -7.3 million hectares per year (an area about the size of Panama or Sierra Leone), down from -8.9 million hectares per year in the period 1990-2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.182/2">Estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that tropical deforestation is currently responsible for about 20 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Only approximately one-twentieth of this is offset by reforestation in temperate regions. Tropical forests act as a significant carbon sink, helping to limit the rate of rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide to less than 50 per cent of the rate of emissions. Removal of rainforests weakens this buffering and exposes us more to the effect of our emissions. An accelerated rise of carbon dioxide from both an increased source and a weakened sink implies an accelerated rate of global warming.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.182/3">Rainforest destruction also affects climate through changes in other greenhouse gases, organic soot particles and through processes such as water recycling, which have local and global impacts. For example, rainforest loss can increase the concentration of ozone, another greenhouse gas.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.182/4">Aerosols are released by burning forests and can modify temperature and local rainfall regimes. Rainforests recycle rain water back to the atmosphere, which maintains their own moist climate and also affects neighbouring regions; deforestation can modify atmospheric circulation and rainfall across the globe.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.188/1">DfID leads the British Government's efforts to develop alternative livelihoods to opium production in support of Pillar 6 of the national drugs control strategy of Afghanistan. DfID will contribute &pound;130 million to these efforts between 2005 and 2008. A proportion of this funding is specifically targeted on improving agricultural opportunities for farmers. This work ranges from funding research to help identify, test and implement new crops and technologies through to improvements in health and husbandry for livestock.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.188/2">At the same time as developing agricultural opportunities, DfID also supports the Government of Afghanistan's national programmes that are helping to increase access to credit and improve infrastructure for farmers to transport their produce to market. Progress is being made, but it is gradual and will take many years. However, evidence from other countries demonstrates that where the population does not have access to legal livelihood opportunities efforts to reduce opium cultivation, as part of a broader strategy, are not sustainable.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.209/1">DfID's representative in Helmand is based in the provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in Lashkar Gah, Helmand province. The PRT also contains representatives from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the military and, arriving shortly, the British embassy drugs team. These four representatives work together as the Helmand executive group, which is responsible for the delivery of the UK joint plan for Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.209/2">DfID leads in advising the civilian and military members of the Helmand PRT on the development implications of all interventions in the province. For example, the PRT supports a number of quick impact projects (QIPs) designed to demonstrate immediate progress to the people of the province and to help build a platform for longer-term activity. DfID's advice helps maximise the developmental impact of these projects and ensures that they fit with national government priorities. The Helmand executive group jointly supervises identification, selection, implementation and monitoring of QIPs, which are funded from a range of departmental budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.209/3">In June, DfID increased the funding available for QIPs by &pound;3 million, but the advisory role of the DfID representative remains the same.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.245/1">The information is not available in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.245/2">The White Paper <I>Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system</I> (Cm 6841) includes proposals to ensure more carers are able to build up better state pensions. To do this we are proposing to introduce a new carer's credit for those reaching state pension age from 2010. It would be available for relevant weeks of caring within a tax year allowing a person to build entitlement to basic state pension (BSP) and state second pension (S2P) if they are caring: for 20 hours or more a week; and for one or more persons receiving the middle or highest rate of disability living allowance care component, attendance allowance, or constant attendance allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.245/3">We have proposed to link the new carer's credit to those caring for someone in receipt of specified disability benefits. We estimate that around 70,000 people a year could gain a credit for BSP from this proposal, and over half of these will be women. The new credit should also mean around 110,000 more women and 50,000 more men will be accruing entitlement to S2P.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.245/4">We estimate that this may leave around 60,000 people in 2010 who report themselves to be caring for 20 hours or more who may not be accruing BSP through paid contributions or credits, including the new carer's credit. The equivalent figure for S2P is around 180,000 people. It is not possible to break down these figures further by the individual benefits received by the person being cared for.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.245/5">The potential costs of awarding these extra people a credit for BSP and S2P build up slowly over time. They could reach some &pound;200 million in 2030, over and above expenditure on the current system.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.245/6">With existing data sources, it is difficult reliably to estimate the intensity of care that someone in receipt of a disability benefit such as incapacity benefit or the disability premium in income support, may be receiving from a particular carer. It is also unclear what care needs, if any, those in receipt of these benefits might have.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.245/7">For the purposes of estimating the cost of the new carer's credit in the White Paper, it was assumed that all those in receipt of the middle or higher rate care component of AA/DLA, or CAA, would have a carer providing more than 20 hours' care per week. Although this is not a precondition for the receipt of those benefits, entitlement provides a clear indication that the recipient has a significant level of care needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.245/8">As with any reform, the timing of change to the state pension system involves striking a balance: to achieve fair outcomes for tomorrow's pensioners, while ensuring that the transition from the current arrangements is affordable, avoids complexity and is delivered successfully. Backdating the carers credit to make it available on the basis of self certification for past periods of caring activity would not be feasible; to do so would be intrusive and forfeit any checks and balances in the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.245/9">It is not possible to make accurate estimates. However, assuming that all those eligible for the proposed carer's credit from 2010 were automatically awarded five years worth of backdated credits, costs of the new carer's credit could reach around &pound;200 million, over and above expenditure on the current system in 2030.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.245/12" class="indent"><sup>2.</sup> Numbers of people are rounded to the nearest 10,000. Estimated costs are rounded to the nearest &pound;100 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.245/14" class="indent"><sup>4.</sup> Costs presented are likely to be overestimates, since they assume that all people eligible for the carer's credit need to use this credit to enhance their state pension record.
