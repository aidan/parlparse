Data from 2003&ndash;04 onwards were collected via a research project on ASBOs which collected data for financial years.

	<p pid="a.104.5/1">Any change relating to the law of blasphemy would have to begin with a review in which various options could be considered. All UK faiths and interested parties, particularly the established Church, would need to be consulted and the issues examined in some depth. We have no plans to initiate such work, but would be content to listen to representations on the subject. We doubt that there is any competence under the European treaties for EU action in this area. Even if there were, we would require some persuasion that there was a legitimate need for EU action in this field.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.5/1">SOCA's approach to reducing the harm done to the UK by serious organised crime differs from that of the precursor agencies: NCS (National Crime Squad), NHTCU (National Hi-Tech Crime Unit), NCIS (National Criminal Intelligence Service), parts of HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) and INDIS (Immigration and Nationality Directorate Intelligence Service). All staff of the precursor agencies who are transferring to SOCA have been through a preliminary exercise to map them into posts in SOCA. The resources made available to SOCA will be greater than the sum total of the resources available to the precursor agencies. The majority of the facilities of NHTCU will fall to the e-crime team in the intervention directorate of SOCA. The NHTCU's previous role in relation to the use of the internet for paedophilia will pass to the new Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. There are a few national functions that NHTCU historically held which may pass to the e-crime team. Responsibility for these functions is being discussed between ACPO, NHTCU, SOCA and the Home Office.</p>
