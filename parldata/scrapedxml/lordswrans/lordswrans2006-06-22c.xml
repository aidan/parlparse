	Africa: Development Targets

	<p pid="c.95.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="c.95.1/2" qnum="HL6348">On what grounds they are optimistic that Africa can meet the targets set out in Chapter 2.8 of the Department for International Development's departmental report 2006 for poverty reduction, primary school enrolment and child mortality by 2008; and what resources they will now commit to these objectives.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-06-22c.95.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="95"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060622/text/60622w01.htm#60622w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.95.2/1">DfID uses international data showing progress towards the millennium development goals (MDGs) to monitor these public service agreement (PSA) sub-targets. These are obtained from the World Bank and agencies of the United Nations, which have in turn obtained data from the countries in question, evaluated its quality and in some cases made adjustments to ensure international consistency.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/2">Most of our 2005&ndash;08 PSA targets for Africa are based on progress in 16 PSA countries. The exception to this is the poverty indicator, for which an internationally produced estimate of overall poverty in the region is used.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/3">Our view that Africa will meet PSA targets for poverty reduction, primary school enrolment and child mortality by 2008 is based on the difference between the baseline and most recent data, together with an assessment of longer-term trends since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/4">For the overall poverty sub-target, although 2002 data show little or no change from the 2000 baseline and there are enormous challenges, there are also grounds for optimism. For example, according to the World Bank, economic performance in Africa in 2004 was the best since 1997. Our entire aid programme in Africa is targeted at reducing poverty. Our bilateral aid to Africa exceeded &pound;1 billion during 2005&ndash;06 and we are on track to double aid to Africa between 2004&ndash;05 and 2010&ndash;11. We have also followed up on commitments made at Gleneagles on specific support to economic growth, such as providing $20 million to the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa, $30 million to the Investment Climate Facility and $20 million to the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/5">The trend for primary school enrolment is upwards. Latest figures show 77 per cent enrolment; up from 70 per cent in 2000. We will continue to prioritise education. In April 2006, the Chancellor and Secretary of State for International Development pledged &pound;8.5 billion over the next 10 years to finance 10-year education plans in African countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/6">Child mortality is falling in many countries (though countries such as Sierra Leone and Democratic Republic of Congo still have very high rates). The 2000 baseline child mortality rate across our 16 PSA countries was 157, on current trends we predict it will fall to 147 by 2008. We are continuing to increase our support for building sustainable, basic health services in Africa and tackling important childhood diseases by expanding access to insecticide-treated bed-nets and immunisation. Access to clean water and sanitation is also critical for child health and we are doubling our expenditure on this up to &pound;95 million by 2007&ndash;08.</p>

Some of these funds are being used to support the relief response, including ensuring access to reliable basic services.</p>

	<p pid="c.96.8/1">It is important to note that the Commission's recent communication <i>Europe in the World&mdash;Some Practical Proposals for Greater Coherence, Effectiveness and Visibility</i> (further information can be found at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external-relations/euw-com06-278-en.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external&ndash;relations/euw&ndash;com06&ndash;278&ndash;en.pdf</a>) does not seek to enhance the role of the EU in foreign policy, but rather to make the EU's existing external policies more co-ordinated and effective. Further, there are no proposals within the communication to pool the diplomatic resources of EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.8/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has deposited an explanatory memorandum with Parliament setting out the Government's views on the communication. In short, these are that, although we do not agree with all of the Commission's proposals, we welcome the paper as a helpful contribution to an important workstream. It is right that the EU should be considering ways of making its external policies more co-ordinated and coherent, within the framework of existing treaties. And we agree that better strategic planning and better co-operation between the EU institutions and the member states can help this.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.8/3">We therefore look forward to further discussions on the Commission communication, and the external coherence workstream more generally, during the Finnish presidency.</p>

	<p pid="c.100.0/1">The Ministry of Defence has well established welfare support systems which are available to those 1990&ndash;91 Gulf veterans and their families who are still serving and for those who have left the services. Appropriate medical treatment is provided and financial support is available through pensions and no-fault compensation arrangements (including widows' benefits and children's allowances). Practical help is available from the service welfare organisations and Veterans Agency welfare service. We are committed to funding appropriate scientific research with the aim of improving the long-term health of veterans with persistent symptoms.</p>

	<p pid="c.100.3/1">The principal issue raised by veterans claiming Gulf War syndrome before the Daniel Martin decision was that it should be recognised as a discrete medical condition. There was, and remains, no scientific basis for doing this, and this was confirmed by the Pensions Appeal Tribunal decision of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>. We have recognised the need to bring an element of closure for those who have sought some acknowledgement that their ill health is connected to their Gulf service. For this reason we welcomed the tribunal's decision that Gulf War syndrome should be used as an umbrella term covering any recognised medical condition caused by service and connected to service in the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf War. We have repeatedly made clear that the application of the umbrella term does not, in itself, affect the amount of an award, as compensation is already paid to veterans based on their level of disablement due to service in the Armed Forces, regardless of where it was caused.</p>

No promotion to a higher grade was involved.

	<p pid="c.106.8/3">Temporary transfer may also be effected in two ways. Departments are encouraged to facilitate secondments to north/south bodies, where civil servants have been successful in an open competition but wish to remain in the NICS and the body is content to fill the position on these terms. If the seconded post involves a promotion, then officers revert to their existing NICS grade on return from secondment. Secondly, at the bodies' request, staff may be transferred on loan at their existing grade to meet an urgent need, such as cover until open recruitment can take place.</p>
