	<p pid="b.315.5/1">Strangford Lough was designated as a special protection area in 1997 under the European birds directive in recognition of its international importance for both breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds (including light-bellied Brent geese). It is also a Ramsar site (wetland of international importance) and an area of special scientific interest. All suitable land and inter-tidal areas have been included within these designations, including the north shore.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.5/2">A regular programme of site monitoring assesses the effectiveness of these designations. In relation to the migratory birds (breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds), this takes the form of targeted bird surveys at the relevant time of year.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.5/3">Site designations also ensure that any proposed changes or developments within the designated site are subject to appropriate assessments to ensure that they do not have an adverse impact on the features of interest, including the internationally significant numbers of Brent geese that over-winter on the lough.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-03-01b.315.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="315"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70301w0001.htm#07030139000032">
	<p pid="b.315.14/1">The current form of the religion question that is being used for the census test, which is being carried out in five local authority areas in May, is the same as that used in the 2001 census. The wording of the question was decided after a lengthy consultation prior to the 2001 census with a wide range of interested parties and census users, including representatives of all the major faith organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.14/2">The question collects information on religious affiliation or identification, which is required by many users for monitoring equality. The question does not attempt to collect detailed information about the extent to which people practise their religion or the depth of their belief. This would require the inclusion of additional questions and/or explanations and therefore require the allocation of more space than is currently available on the census questionnaire. Responses to the consultation exercise carried out in 2005 in England and Wales on topics for the 2011 census indicated a strong requirement for information on religious affiliation or identification but not on religious practice or religion brought up in. Indications from the continuing consultation are that the majority of the user community is satisfied with the information collected in the 2001 census.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.14/3">The Office for National Statistics is currently conducting further consultation focusing specifically on the topics of ethnicity, identity, religion and language, which will help to inform the development of questions. Details of this consultation can be found at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_155.asp">www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_155.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.14/4">It is apparent that demands for information from the census are greater than are likely to be able to be accommodated, and difficult trade-offs will need to be made. The current working assumption is that we will be using the same religion question in the 2011 census in England and Wales as in the 2001 census and the 2007 census test.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.14/5">Final decisions on the content of the 2011 census will not be made until the programme of consultation and question testing is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010. A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals including the wording of any questions about ethnicity and identity is scheduled to be published in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.315.19/2" qnum="HL2058">Why the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has a notice in its meeting rooms warning of the risks of moving furniture and requesting 48 hours' notice before furniture is moved; and whether the HSE will require other government offices to issue the same notice.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-03-01b.315.20" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="315"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70301w0001.htm#07030139000108">
	<p pid="b.315.20/1">The HSE's approach to moving furniture in its offices is based on its own assessment of the risks from manual handling&mdash;one of the main causes of work-related absence among its staff. Where furniture needs to be moved regularly, it is mounted on lockable wheels so that any staff can move it easily. For other, bulky and cumbersome furniture, arrangements have been made with porters to move it safely; signs have therefore been posted in some meeting rooms advising staff of this arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.20/2">The relevant legislation, the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992, is goal-setting and requires organisations to find and implement arrangements that are appropriate to their particular circumstances. There is no intention that the solution adopted by HSE should be imposed inflexibly on other government offices.</p>

	<p pid="b.315.23/23">For 2005-06, the rate of RIDDOR reportable injuries to HSE staff members in HSE head offices was 107 per 100,000. In the HSE there is a high level of reporting of injuries, particularly of RIDDOR reportable incidents, so these figures are likely to be as close to reality as practicable.</p>
