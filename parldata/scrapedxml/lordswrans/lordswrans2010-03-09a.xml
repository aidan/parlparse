	<p pid="a.29.5/1">We fully recognise the importance of ensuring that service personnel do not spend an undue proportion of their time on separated service or operational deployments, which is why harmony guidelines are maintained. Unfortunately, at a time of high operational commitment, breaches of harmony guidelines do occur, but initiatives and regulators are used to help ameliorate the situation. These include flexible appointing between ranks, mobilisation of Reservists, financial retention and re-engagement incentives, contractorisation and reviewing the numbers of posts required for each operation on a regular basis. In addition, longer-term initiatives are used to promote increases in training, recruitment and retention.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-01">1 March 2010</phrase>, there were 146 Royal Navy and RAF pilots trained to fly Harrier aircraft. In addition, three Royal Navy pilots are currently deployed with the US Marine Corps flying the US version of the Harrier. Of the 146 pilots, 65 are currently qualified to fly Harriers but this number could be increased through refresher training. Of the pilots currently qualified, 34 are qualified for night flying, 47 are qualified to take off and land on an aircraft carrier and 11 are qualified to take off and land on an aircraft carrier at night. The numbers of pilots in these categories are increasing as Joint Harrier Force regenerates its wider capability following its return from deployment in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.5/1">The Royal Navy's current level of officer manning is sufficient to meet the tasks it is required to undertake. To ensure it continues to meet its manning requirements in the future, the Royal Navy has a number of retention initiatives, which include: financial retention incentives and specialist pay; the development of increased opportunities to transfer to longer commissions; and the Moral Component of Operational Capability project, which is examining the need to strengthen the ethos and values within the naval service. In addition, the significant benefits of staying in the Navy, such as job security, pay and pension, healthcare, leave, adventurous training et cetera, are detailed in a new brochure which will very shortly be cascaded through the Navy's divisional chain.</p>

Information on how individual contracts are monitored is, therefore, held by the individual business unit and not collected or retained centrally. However, for central DCSF Management Consultancy Frameworks, which covered the period up to the end of March 2008, a feedback form was used to gather information on the performance of the organisation. This form was issued to individual business units at the end of each contract and requested feedback about the performance of the organisation.

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">It is difficult to obtain official, reliable information about prison conditions in Cuba. The Cuban Government tightly control information about, and access to, their prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/2">Following a fact-finding mission to Cuba in 2009, Human Rights Watch reported concerns about prison conditions including: overcrowded cells; unhygienic and insufficient food and water; inadequate medical treatment; and cases of solitary confinement, harassment and beatings. The report additionally highlighted the lack of an effective complaint mechanism to address concerns. Our embassy in Havana maintains contacts with various unofficial groups in Cuba that focus on prison conditions as well as the families of political prisoners whose complaints reflect the concerns of Human Rights Watch. Such reports certainly give us cause for concern as to the possibility that prisoners in Cuba may be being subjected to mistreatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/3">We consistently raise concerns about prison conditions with the Cuban Government and call on them to allow independent inspection of their prisons. The Cuban Government ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1995 and in January 2009 invited the UN Special Rapporteur for Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to visit Cuba. The visit has not yet taken place. We hope that the special rapporteur's visit will be arranged soon and that he will be granted sufficient access to places of detention to be able to conduct a proper assessment of the situation. We will take careful note of his findings.</p>

This suggests that a rising block tariff would make it more expensive for many fuel-poor households to heat their homes to an acceptable standard and may, therefore, make it more difficult to remove these households from fuel poverty.</p>

In 2009-10 the cost of this service to participating NHS primary care trusts and GP practices has been approximately &#163;27 per patient, which includes the pack, training for health professionals and a telephone alert call when weather and virus conditions combine to put the health of people with COPD at risk.</p>

This survey also showed that 85 per cent of patients using the service understood their condition better, 54 per cent were seeking a repeat prescription, 42 per cent were reporting their symptoms earlier and 43 per cent were taking more exercise. Other research has shown a UK average 20 per cent reduction in hospital admissions for COPD and a reduction in excess winter deaths in the West Midlands.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.3/2">Our embassy in Pristina is working closely with parties and stakeholders involved in resettlement of the Roma, including the Kosovan Ministry for Communities and Returns, the municipal government of Mitrovica and the European Commission liaison office, and will continue to do so. These parties support resettlement in non-contaminated areas because this provides the most sustainable long-term solution for the inhabitants of the camps. Various NGOs provide nutritional and livelihood support and there are medical staff on hand. There is also access to the municipal hospital for those who need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/3">We want to help ensure that resettlement efforts are fully co-ordinated in order to provide a sustainable future for the camp inhabitants. The municipality of Mitrovica has donated land to the rebuilding project, so that all the current inhabitants of the camps can be relocated, and the European Commission liaison office in Pristina has pledged &#8364;5 million in funding for the Roma Mahalla in Mitrovica.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.3/1">In 2006, 1,013 individuals were identified as having been released from prison without consideration by the UK Border Agency for deportation and by the end of 2006 all had been considered for deportation. Steady progress continues to be made on these cases despite their age and complexity.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/2">The chief executive of the UK Border Agency has provided regular updates on this group of cases to the Home Affairs Committee. She reported in February this year that 782 of the 1,013 cases have been concluded, 371 of which have been removed or deported from the United Kingdom. Also, 125 cases are still going through the deportation process and a further 25 are still serving custodial sentences, while 81 are still to be located.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/3">As the chief executive also made clear in her latest letter to the HASC, the UK Border Agency receives around 850 referrals a month, about half of which meet the criteria for deportation. In a caseload of this size, there are challenges in referral and consideration for deportation particularly around short-term and remand prisoners. Improved processes with the courts and NOMS and a new notification and recording system mean that the UK Border Agency is able to identify cases where the referral did not take place as it should. This system has identified five cases in the more/most serious category where referral did not take place as it should and consideration for deportation was pursued retrospectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">Since October 2008, Royal Navy units have carried out compliant boardings on three suspected pirate vessels operating off the coast of Somalia where hostages were subsequently found on board. In all three cases the hostages were released following the Royal Navy's intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/2">In November 2008, HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot; boarded a Yemeni vessel 60 nautical miles south of the Yemeni coast, which had been hijacked by suspected Somali pirates. Six Yemeni hostages were released and returned to Yemen. The eight suspect pirates were transferred to the Kenyan authorities for prosecution and are currently on trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/3">A further two boardings took place within Somali territorial waters in April and October 2009, resulting in the release of all hostages: 11 Yemenis, two Tanzanians and one Somali Tanzanian. Following detailed analysis of evidence, the suspects were also released because it was assessed by legal advisers that the likelihood of a successful prosecution in a regional state was low. This was, in part, due to a lack of clear evidence, an unwillingness of hostages to give evidence in a regional court and the fact that Somalia has jurisdiction over Somali territorial waters, so a transfer to Kenya or any other regional state could not take place. The UK, however, continues to encourage other regional countries to accept suspected pirates, in line with its commitments under the Djibouti code of conduct.</p>
