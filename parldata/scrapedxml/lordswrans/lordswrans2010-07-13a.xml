However, as part of the work being undertaken to reform the financial services sector, the Government will take action to tackle unacceptable bonuses. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued a remuneration code of practice. This lays out detailed principles that require the largest banks, building societies and broker dealers in the UK to establish remuneration policies that are consistent with effective risk management. In enforcing its code, the FSA can request information from firms in order to determine if remuneration policies are consistent with effective risk management.</p>

In summary, the evaluation of EMA showed that, while it has a significant positive impact on participation and attainment, a high proportion-just over 90 per cent-in receipt of EMA would have been likely to participate without it. A value-for-money assessment of EMA was carried out in 2008 based on this evaluation and estimated that the monetised benefits of EMA outweighed the costs despite the high deadweight.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.5/3">It should be noted that there are differences in the coding conventions used for both parts of the Question about numbers of cases of VTE in relation to diagnosis and death.

Patients treated by their general practitioner or as out-patients are not included. Some DVTs manifest themselves as pulmonary embolism. This means that a number of the patients who have been diagnosed with PE will also have been diagnosed with a DVT. It would not be advisable to sum the number of episodes for PE and DVT because of the potential for double counting.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.5/19" class="indent">1) A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/20" class="indent">2) The information is the number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2004-05 to 2006-07) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.5/22" class="indent">4) Counts for the different diagnoses shown are not necessarily mutually exclusive and therefore summing the different diagnoses is not possible (eg, a patient may have a DVT and a PE in a single episode, and would be counted once in each relevant column-double counting would occur if the values were summed).</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/23" class="indent">5) Diagnosis is recorded in HES using ICD-10 codes. ICD-10 code I80.2 is used for a diagnosis of DVT where there is no further information on the site of the thrombosis. However, DVT may also be recorded under a number of different codes, although these codes may also include cases which are not considered deep. The full list of relevant ICD-10 codes is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/24" class="indent">I80.0 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of superficial vessels of lower extremities</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/25" class="indent">I80.1 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of femoral vein</p>

	<p pid="a.120.5/35" class="indent">7) Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer included in admitted patient HES data.</p>

This comes against a backdrop of other developments which appear designed to consolidate the purported annexation of east Jerusalem. Such actions erode trust between the parties at a crucial time.

HMRC plays no further part in the process, and cannot monitor how quickly those claims are dealt with. However, where a UK resident believes that the other country is failing to apply the double taxation agreement properly, he may ask HMRC to intervene on his behalf though the &quot;mutual agreement procedure&quot; set out in our tax agreements.</p>
