	<p pid="b.54.2/1">My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence considered it appropriate to use a shorter consultation period as the proposal is a simple, beneficial change that we want to put in place as quickly as possible. The Royal British Legion asked for the consultation period to be extended and after careful consideration it was decided not to agree to its request. None of the other ex-service organisations consulted asked for an extension.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/2">The principle vehicle for consultation in this instance was the Central Advisory Committee, a statutory body which advises MoD Ministers on war pension and compensation issues. The details of the proposal were also made widely available to members of the Armed Forces, who had an opportunity to comment. A range of comments on the proposal were received, including from the Royal British Legion, and these are being examined ahead of making changes to the secondary legislation. A summary of responses received will be placed on the MoD website early next year.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.2/1">The Children Act 2004 requires local authorities in England actively to promote awareness amongst their communities of the requirement to notify private fostering arrangements to the authority. The extent to which they are doing this is a factor which Ofsted takes into account when assessing the quality of local authority children's services. The nature of local communities will vary considerably from one local authority area to another, and it is therefore appropriate that it should be for local authorities to promote awareness, and determine the most effective service response, at a local level. We have published guidance for authorities, <I>Promoting Awareness of Private Fostering Arrangements</I><I>,</I> on the DCSF website.

	<p pid="b.63.6/1">The development of the port at Great Yarmouth consists of the construction of an outer harbour. The capital cost of the scheme, which is currently under way, is expected to be &pound;54 million. This comprises &pound;40 million for maritime access works &mdash;breakwaters and port entrance structures&mdash;and construction costs of port user infrastructure&mdash;quaysides, berths&mdash;of &pound;14 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.6/2">Public funding of &pound;8.6 million (East of England Development Agency), &pound;4.6 million (European Regional Development Fund), &pound;3.1 million (Norfolk County Council) will part-fund the maritime access works, with Great Yarmouth Borough Council providing support in kind through lease of land valued at &pound;1.6 million. The private sector developer, International Port Holdings, will meet the balance of the cost. The port user infrastructure is being funded entirely by the private sector developer. The risk of cost overrun on both the maritime access and the commercial port infrastructure works will be borne by the private developer.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.6/3">As part of the project appraisal, Partnerships UK, one of the consultants advising on the project, recommended to EEDA that, in order to demonstrate the likely viability of the project, its funding of the outer harbour development should be subject to revenue commitments from a ferry operator being secured and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry made this a condition of his consent to EEDA to fund the project. The Minister for Regions, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, subsequently waived this condition, being satisfied with EEDA's judgment that the plans of the preferred developer were viable without such revenue guarantees. The private sector port developer will carry the risk of any revenue shortfall. The European Commission decided that the public funding for the maritime access works did not constitute state aid. At present no road or rail improvements are considered necessary in connection with this development.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.6/1">The General Practitioner Patient Survey is a national survey of patients' experiences of access to their general practitioner services. The survey has been developed with and is run by the independent research company, Ipsos MORI. Survey results are used to trigger payments primary care trusts (PCTs) make to general practitioner (GP) practices when they achieve national access standards. From these data, PCTs have developed with local practices action plans to deliver improvements in access to care in GP services in those areas with the poorest reported satisfaction. For the first time these data are available to patients which can help inform decisions on choice on registration with GP practices and how their own practice performs compared with other practices, locally or nationally.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.6/1">The public service agreements published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October 2007</phrase> will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. Those which the Home Office leads relate to migration, safer communities, alcohol and drugs, terrorism and the criminal justice system (led jointly with the Attorney-General and the Secretary of State for Justice). Each PSA priority outcome is underpinned by a single delivery agreement shared across all contributing departments and developed in consultation with delivery partners and frontline workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.6/2">In response to (a), individual impact assessments were not produced for PSAs as each delivery agreement represents a range of co-ordinated activity ranging from existing and new legislation, which follows the normal parliamentary route, through to new or ongoing publicity campaigns to promote specific initiatives such as tackling anti-social behaviour. Impact assessments, previously called regulatory impact assessments, are only required when the Government bring forward specific new proposals. These are intended to assess the full impact of such proposals&mdash;for example, the costs and benefits, both monetised and non-monetised, to the public, private and third sectors&mdash;and we would expect that any significant effects on the rural community would be identified as part of that process, particularly as this has been given greater prominence in the new impact assessment format recently introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.6/3">In response to (b) the new PSA delivery agreements are cross-government and may relate to policies for which other departments are responsible. Previous assessments of policy areas for which the Home Office is responsible are published on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www">www</a>. homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/publications/regulatory- impact-assessments/</p>
	<p pid="b.72.6/4">In response to (c) any new assessments will also be published there or, where we are consulting on new proposals, the assessment will accompany the consultation documents at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/haveyoursay/">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/haveyoursay/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.72.6/5">Equality impact assessments were prepared for our new PSAs, as a legal requirement, and are published at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/publications/regulatory-impact-assessments/#assess2007">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/publications/regulatory-impact-assessments/#assess2007</a></p>
