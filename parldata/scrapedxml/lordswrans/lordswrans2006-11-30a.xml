There is no specific estimate of overheads incurred in planning the journey, as only two officers were involved in the visit and the planning of such visits and meetings is considered an integral part of their jobs. It was an extremely useful exercise as it secured an explanation from the Nepalese authorities of their nationality law which had not been forthcoming hitherto despite several rounds of correspondence. It has therefore enabled the Home Office to obtain clarity and, once written confirmation of the position is received from the Nepalese, will greatly facilitate decision-making on the outstanding applications made under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997.</p>

The Government recently provided resources for a new unit in the City of London Police Service to investigate allegations of foreign bribery. This will complement the work of the Serious Fraud Office, deter corruption and help bring prosecutions against corrupt individuals and companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/3">In addition, the Government will shortly be introducing a range of new measures, among which are:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/4">the third EU money laundering directive; implementation in the UK will require that all sectors under money laundering regulations must identify the beneficial owners of their customer if the customer is a legal entity or legal person. It will also require that all trust and company service providers are fit and proper persons and that these businesses are not run for criminal purposes. Further, it explicitly prevents banks and financial institutions doing transactions with banks with no physical presence and which are unaffiliated with a regulated financial group;the creation by DfID of a new &pound;100 million Governance and Transparency Fund, designed to help citizens hold their governments to account;the provision of specialist resources to developing countries to investigate and prosecute corruption cases; andthe provision of technical assistance to establish effective anti-corruption practices under the UN Convention against Corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/5">Company law and its related enforcementregime tackles financial crime in a number ofways, particularly through requirements to publish accounts and powers to wind up companies and disqualify directors. The new Companies Act 2006 imposes important obligations on UK companies and their directors to behave responsibly. All directors are under a duty to act with appropriate care, skill and diligence. This applies to directors of a UK parent company who act as shareholder of an overseas subsidiary. In addition, the Act requires that atleast one director of a company must be a natural person.</p>

It will also give the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and local trading standards officers wider powers to inspect records where they have reasonable cause to suspect that an offence has been committed under the Estate Agents Act 1979 or that a person has committed other breaches under the Act. This will make it easier for enforcers to identify serious misconduct by estate agents and to take appropriate action against them. The Bill will also expand the circumstances in which the OFT can consider the fitness of estate agents to practise and consequently take regulatory action against them.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.9/1">The information requested falls within the responsibilities of the Medical Research Council. Professor Blakemore, the chief executive of the MRC, has written to me regarding this matter. An extract from his letter is given below.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.9/2" class="indent">&quot;In 2003, the MRC, through our Military Health Research Advisory Group (MHRAG), conducted a comprehensive review of relevant research into Gulf Veterans' illness. As Lord Sainsbury outlined in a written answer to the Countess of Mar on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October 2006</phrase>, the review involved a one-day closed scientific meeting between the MHRAG and a number of scientists from the UK and overseas. This was followed on the next day by a separate private meeting of the MHRAG to appraise the MRC of scientific progress, of the potential for gaining further knowledge and of research needs, and of what the likely medical issues might be. As reported by Lord Sainsbury, in a written answer to a question from Lord Morris of Manchester, we estimated the cost of the review to be between &pound;20,000 and &pound;25,000. This estimate related to the closed scientific meeting, the MHRAG meeting the following day, and the publication of the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.9/3" class="indent">We of course publish the memberships of our Council and standing advisory Boards/Committees; and the membership of the MHRAG is recorded in the published review. However, it is not the MRC's practice to release into the public domain the names of individuals who either attended, or who may, or may not, have been considered as participants, in closed ad-hoc scientific meetings. If we felt there was a particular reason to make names public, we would make that clear in the letters of invitation. In the case of this scientific meeting, we did not do that. For what I hope are obvious reasons, we would never make public the names of individuals whom we had considered inviting to join a particular committee or meeting, but whom we subsequently decided not to invite. I am therefore not in a position to respond to the Countess of Mar's second question&quot;.</p>
