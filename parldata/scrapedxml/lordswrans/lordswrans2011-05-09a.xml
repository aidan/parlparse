UK and European Union terrorist finance legislation prohibits funds being made available for the benefit of Hamas, but it is not a barrier in itself to NGOs delivering services to ordinary Gazans. NGOs are permitted to make contact with Hamas if this is necessary for the delivery of assistance, although this should happen at the lowest possible technical level. We judge that the key hindrances to the delivery of aid in Gaza are in fact Hamas's interference in NGO operations, which should desist; and Israel's ongoing access restrictions on importation of goods and movement of people, into and out of the territory.</p>
