	<p pid="a.215.2/1">As part of our programme of modernisation, the Government have reviewed the organisation and operation of the public sector ombudsmen in England. Underlying this review was a recognition of the need to ease public access and improve efficiency in dealing with complaints across different sectors. The review was published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-13">13 April</phrase> (Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-14">14 April 2000</phrase>, col. WA 70).</p>
	<p pid="a.215.2/2">While the review was well received, it was always our intention to consult widely on the outcome of the review. We want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to comment on the review's recommendations, which, if implemented in full, will radically reform the ombudsmen system in England. That is why we have today published a consultation paper inviting comments on the review and on any other aspect of the organisation or operation of the public sector ombudsmen in England. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of the House and in the Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.2/3">The Government recognise and value the contribution made by everyone involved in the work of the ombudsmen. We also recognise the significant contribution made by the ombudsmen themselves in helping public bodies maintain and improve the standards of service they offer. The challenge now is to consider how to strengthen that contribution and ensure that all public bodies provide a first class service to all citizens.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.5/1">Section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 allows for release from prison on compassionate grounds in exceptional circumstances. All prisoners are entitled to make an application for early release on compassionate grounds, and the criteria for determining such applications are set out in Prison Service Order 6000: Parole, Release and Recall.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.5/2">Where such an application is made on medical grounds, the Prison Medical Officer provides a medical assessment. The Governor is required to make a proper assessment of the risk the prisoner represents and comment on whether he supports the application before referring the case to Prison Service Headquarters. The advice of Prison Healthcare Advisors within the National Health Service Executive is then sought before a final decision is taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.5/3">There is no statutory right for a prisoner to be examined by an independent specialist of his own choice where an application for early release on compassionate grounds is refused, and no standard policy guidelines apply. Such situations would be considered in the light of individual circumstances. The general principle is that prisoners should be afforded access to the same range and quality of health services as the general public.</p>
