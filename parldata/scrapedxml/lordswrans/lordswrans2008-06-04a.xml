	<p pid="a.51.8/1">There was a significant downward trend in annual mean concentrations of nitrous oxides (NOx) at the airfield perimeter in the period 1993 to 2004, and a small downward trend in nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Concentrations of particulates (PM10) remained broadly constant over the period 2000 to 2004. These and other results were set out in the report of the Heathrow Air Quality Technical Panels in July 2006 published by the Department for Transport and available on its website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/environmentalissues/heathrowsustain/">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/environmentalissues/heathrowsustain/</a>. Our recent consultation on adding capacity at Heathrow airport shows that concentrations of all these pollutants around the airport are predicted to be within allowable limits in the event of further development.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">My department has no plans to carry out DNA testing on all birds that may be removed from Schedule 4. The department has no evidence to suggest that the population of birds currently listed in Schedule 4 is other than from primarily legitimate sources. The costs of DNA-testing the whole captive population would be prohibitively expensive and would not be justified by any possible enforcement or conservation benefit. Any DNA testing to be carried out by Animal Health will be based on a risk and intelligence-led approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">Modern breeding techniques use artificial insemination from a variety of possible male donors. The movement and death of many of the birds involved in this process means that any comprehensive testing scheme for all birds subject to registration would simply not be logistically possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">The prohibition on the import of wild birds into the EU was extended in July 2007 and with this prohibition likely to remain in force for the foreseeable future the situation in the commercial trade of wild birds has changed. My department therefore revised the criteria for the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) assessment of species to be listed in Schedule 4. The list of species provided by the JNCC was considered in terms of the proportionality of the burden that registration of these species would place on keepers, balancing any conservation benefit that may arise from registration against the regulatory burden imposed by registration.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.8/1">The UK CITES Management Authority (UKMA) makes every effort to ascertain the legality of acquisition of a bird before issuing a transaction specific certificate. However, if information came to the attention of the UKMA after issuing a certificate which led it to doubt the veracity of the original application, it would trace the ownership via the name and address in box 1 &quot;holder&quot;, as the certificate is re-issued every time the bird is used on a commercial basis by a new keeper. Applications for certificates will also contain details of parent birds, if known.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">Of the 12 species originally proposed by the JNCC for listing in Schedule 4, nine are non-EU species. Animal Health has issued CITES permits for six species (red-browed amazon; red-tailed amazon; hyacinth macaw; blue-throated macaw; red vented/Philippine cockatoo; and Bali starling) in the past 10 years, indicating that these species have been kept in captivity in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">The EU ban on wild bird imports has meant that, other than birds imported for conservation programmes, only captive-bred birds from approved breeding establishments have been permitted for import into the EU.

We have had insight through the data provided by the aluminium industry on the positive measures they are taking to reduce CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">We understand that the EU aluminium industry has reduced its total direct CO2 emissions from primary aluminium smelters by 49 per cent and its Perflouro carbon (PFC) emissions by 83 per cent between 1990 and 2005<sup>*</sup>. UK primary aluminium smelters are at or close to world leading CO2 efficiency for the technology employed. The sector as a whole is increasing international focus on the potential of industry sectoral agreements or approaches in delivering global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.3/1">The Small Business Act has been welcomed by UK Government. It will not be a legislative measure&mdash;its aim will be to set principles and outline measures to improve the framework conditions for European small businesses, while taking full account of their diversity. It will cover a range of policy areas; for example, the impact on small business of EU regulations, facilitating access to finance and helping them enter new markets, including the single market.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.3/2">Small businesses regularly say that their key concern is the disproportionate burden of regulation on them and so our priority is to see a bold set of measures within the Small Business Act to reduce regulatory burdens coming from the EU. It is as part of this &quot;better regulation&quot; element that we are pressing the European Commission systematically to consider, where possible, exempting small businesses with fewer than 20 employees from EU regulation, as we plan to do for domestic regulations. Where exemption is not possible, either for legal or policy reasons, we suggest the Commission should work with small firms to design specific approaches for them, including simplified enforcement and effective guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.4/2" qnum="HL3806">Whether they will give local authorities increased powers to regulate lap-dancing clubs in their areas by (a) extending the use of the sex encounter establishment licensing category countrywide; and (b) removing the exemption for establishments that possess a premises licence.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/1">The Licensing Act 2003 is able to regulate these premises in relation to any concerns about the four licensing objectives&mdash;the prevention of crime and disorder, the prevention of public nuisance, public safety and the protection of children. However, we are aware that some licensing authorities have concerns about the powers available and feel that they are not adequately able to control these establishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/2">We are in the process of providing additional guidance for local authorities on the Licensing Act and how it can be used to deal with lap-dancing clubs. As part of this process, we will be asking licensing authorities for feedback if they still have concerns. This will tell us if the controls under the Licensing Act are sufficient or whether we need to do more to protect local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/3">If we find that there is a need to provide licensing authorities with additional powers to deal with any nuisance or criminal activity associated with lap-dancing establishments, we will consider the full range of options. This could include changes to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, which regulates sex encounter establishments (such as sex shops and sex cinemas).</p>

	<p pid="a.60.8/1">The Government take the issue of noise seriously, and have given new powers to local authorities to deal with noise with the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/2"><I>Statutory Nuisance under the Environmental Protection Act 1990</I></p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/3">Section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as amended) lists what is capable of being a statutory nuisance. At Section 79(1)(g) is &quot;noise emitted from premises so as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/4">Section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 places a statutory duty on local authorities to inspect their areas periodically for existing and potential statutory nuisances, and to take reasonably practicable steps to investigate complaints of nuisance. Once satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists or may occur or recur, the local authority must serve an abatement notice under Section 80 of the Act on the person responsible for the nuisance (or the owner or occupier if the person responsible cannot be found or the nuisance has not yet occurred).</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/5">For noise, the local authority can (under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005) choose to defer serving an abatement notice for up to seven days in order to pursue specific alternative steps to resolve the problem. If the noise nuisance is not abated within seven days, the abatement notice must then be served, and it can served at any point within that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/6">A complainant can also take private action through the courts under Section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The complainant must give a minimum of three days' notice in writing of the intention to take private action to the person who is the subject of the complaint, and must specify the subject of the complaint. If the court agrees that a statutory nuisance exists, or may occur or recur, it will issue an abatement notice. There is a defence for industrial, trade and business premises of &quot;best practicable means&quot;. There is a defence of &quot;reasonable excuse&quot; for causing a statutory nuisance or breaching an abatement notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/7"><I>Noise Act 1996 and Licensed Premises</I></p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/8">Section 84 of and Schedule 1 to the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 amend the Noise Act 1996 so that it applies to licensed premises. The fine upon summary conviction for exceeding the permitted level, as measured from within the dwelling of a complainant, will be up to &pound;5,000. The local authority will be able to offer the option to discharge liability to conviction with the payment within 14 days of a fixed penalty notice of &pound;500.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/9">The permitted level is 34dB(A) where the underlying level does not exceed 24dB(A), or 10dB(A) above the underlying level where this exceeds 24dB(A). This permitted level applies to both domestic and licensed premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/10">Section 84 of and Schedule 1 to the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 came into force in relation to England on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. We have revised the permitted noise levels and an approval for devices measuring noise levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/11">These were brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February 2008</phrase> following a stand-still period required under the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 98/34/EC.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/12"><I>The Noise Council's Code of Practice on Environmental Noise Control at Concerts</I></p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/13">The Noise Council's Code of Practice on Environmental Noise Control at Concerts was published in 1995 and is designed to help organisers, promoters and regulators to plan and manage the noise issues associated with such events. It was prepared by a working party of professionals experienced in this field and was published following a public consultation. Since then, it has become widely used in the UK and can provide a means of enabling successful concerts to be held while minimising the disturbance caused by noise.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/14">Compliance with the various provisions of the code of practice does not confer immunity from any legal obligations, such as the statutory nuisance regime contained within Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.8/15">It is understood that there is dialogue between the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the Institute of Acoustics (both of which were members of the Noise Council) exploring the possibility of reforming a working party and the extent to which the code should be reviewed or revised.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.2/1">Information on trends in congestion is available for England for (a) the strategic road network (inter-urban roads) and for (b) the 10 largest urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/2"><I>(a) Inter-urban roads</I></p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/3">Provisional figures for the PSA1 target year ending March 2008 show that average vehicle delay on the slowest 10 per cent of journeys on motorways and trunk roads in England has risen from 3.78 to 3.95 minutes per 10 miles since the baseline year ending July 2005, an increase of 4.4 per cent. This covers a period of 32 months and represents an annual increase of 1.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/4">These figures represent average daytime delays (6 am to 8 pm) on the 91 routes currently used for monitoring performance on the strategic road network. Figures are presented on a rolling year basis. Delay is calculated as the difference between observed journey time and a reference journey time (the time that could theoretically be achieved when the traffic is free flowing).</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/5"><I>(b) Urban areas</I></p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/6">Traffic congestion in urban areas is measured by &quot;person journey time per mile&quot; for the 10 largest urban areas in England: London, the six metropolitan areas (Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire) and Bristol, Leicester and Nottingham. The table &quot;person journey times (minutes per mile)&quot; shows the increase or decrease in traffic congestion.</p>
