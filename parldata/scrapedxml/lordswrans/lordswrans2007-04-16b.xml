	<p pid="b.1.2/15">These figures include laboratory costs, the costs of Meat Hygiene Service controls in abattoirs and Rural Payments Agency expenditure on the collection, brainstem sampling and disposal of cattle that have died or been killed on farm or in transit (fallen cattle). The costs of testing cattle with clinical signs of BSE are excluded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/16">The EU Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) Regulation (999/2001) requires the UK to test all fallen cattle aged over 24 months. An amending regulation (1923/2006), which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-19">19 January 2007</phrase>, provides for the European Commission and member states to agree either to raise the age limit for testing fallen cattle throughout the EU, or to accept an individual member state's application to implement an alternative surveillance programme. The latter is dependent on several factors, including the agreement of harmonised criteria against which a proposal from a member state would be assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/17">Defra has asked the European Commission to raise the EU age limit for testing fallen cattle from 24 months. We are also considering how best to present an application for an alternative testing programme for fallen cattle, subject to the UK fulfilling the criteria when they are agreed. No change to the age limit for testing cattle slaughtered for human consumption (from 30 months) is envisaged at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.6/1">We have an absolute duty to the men and women in our Armed Forces, who put themselves in harm's way on our behalf, to provide first-class medical care for them if they are injured. This is precisely what the Defence Medical Services are doing on a daily basis, both on operations overseas and&mdash;in partnership with the NHS&mdash;back in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/2">Where concerns are expressed by individual patients about their treatment and care, we address them. Very occasionally, as in any hospital, mistakes can be made. We will, with the NHS authorities, investigate each reported case thoroughly and report back to the patient and his or her family and make sure that any mistake is corrected wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/3">When someone is seriously injured, our priority is to ensure that they receive the best possible treatment that is available. Military personnel who sustain a serious physical injury on operations overseas are usually taken to University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), which includes Selly Oak Hospital, and which is a centre of excellence in the medical care of the types of injuries our casualties sustain. Wherever practicable, military patients are allocated to one of the 12 military consultants who work at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), based at Selly Oak Hospital. However, by far the largest proportion of specialist care is provided by NHS consultant staff, which reflects the range and capabilities of the knowledge, skills and resources the NHS makes available to our patients. Furthermore, RCDM will be moving to the new hospital being built in Birmingham as part of a major investment and will be the largest critical care unit in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/4">We of course appreciate the importance of our patients continuing to feel part of the military family. We have created a military managed ward (MMW), located in the main body of Selly Oak Hospital, which reached initial operating capability just before Christmas 2006. A combined team of military and civilian personnel provides care for military patients whose clinical condition allows for them to be nursed in this ward.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/5">The MMW currently consists of two six-bedded bays, with access to four additional side isolation rooms, making a potential total of 16 beds, and is part of the 34-bed S4 trauma/orthopaedic ward. The number of beds on the ward is more than sufficient to match the current levels of military casualties needing trauma/orthopaedic care, although, if necessary, further beds can be allocated. There are military managers involved at every level on the MMW, with a military ward manager responsible for all aspects of the military presence on the ward, whether staff or patient issues, and for liaising with appropriate authorities. The military ward manager is assisted by three military deputy ward managers who are responsible for the planning and delivery of patient care to both military and civilian patients, although they primarily focus on military activity. As well as the managers, there are now a further 19 qualified military nurses, and six military health care assistants allocated to ward S4 military nursing staff are now on duty on every shift on the ward, including the night shift. A military nurse team member visits every military patient being treated at a Birmingham hospital at least three times a day.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/6">The MMW is one of several improvements we have recently made to the treatment of military patients. A military surgical consultant has been appointed as the military trauma patient co-ordinator, who liaises with colleagues to provide advice on service issues and ensures that military aspects of their treatment are taken into account. We have enhanced the military community psychiatric support to our patients in the Birmingham area and, in addition, each military patient now has a named military nurse whom he or she can contact at any time on clinical and other issues. Military patients at Selly Oak and elsewhere in the Birmingham area are supported by the work of four welfare officers of the Defence Medical Welfare Service and other welfare organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/7">The creation of the MMW has been welcomed by service chiefs. The Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Richard Dannatt, said in a BBC interview on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-13">13 March 2007</phrase>: &quot;There is nowhere better in the country, nowhere more expert at polytrauma medicine, than the hospital in Selly Oak. That's why our people are there&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.11.5/1">The Hall&eacute; Orchestra has raised some concerns regarding the way in which the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) operates. In essence, these concerns relate to the effectiveness of the bureau being compromised in not notifying employers of any subsequent offences that may be committed by an employee and that it is therefore necessary for employers to obtain repeat clearance applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.5/2">The CRB was set up under Part V of the Police Act 1997 to enable employers, through the use of disclosure information, to make safer recruitment decisions where a position involved regular supervision of, or caring for, children and/or vulnerable adults. Therefore, disclosure information is intended to be used as a recruitment tool in conjunction with the full range of other pre-appointment checks to ensure that a prospective employee is suitable for the post.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.5/3">However, the Hall&eacute; Orchestra may be interested to hear that new legislation in the form of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-08">8 November 2006</phrase>. This creates a new vetting and barring scheme, led by the Department for Education and Skills, which is intended to minimise the risk of children and vulnerable adults suffering harm at the hands of those who are employed to work with them. It seeks to do this by ensuring that, where evidence suggests that an individual presents a risk of harm, he/she is barred as soon as possible from working with children and/or vulnerable adults by an Independent Barring Board (IBB).</p>
	<p pid="b.11.5/4">The CRB will continually update the IBB as new relevant information comes to light, thereby ensuring that the status of the individual is kept under review. It is envisaged that, under the scheme, employers would be notified of any changes to an individual's status. Further information on this scheme may be obtained from the Department for Education and Skills website at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk">www.dfes.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.5/5">I hope that this Answer proves helpful.</p>

In the east, south-east and south-west single-issue reviews of the regional spatial strategies are under way.

The east of England is the most advanced in its process, with publication of its <I>Issues and Options</I> consultation document due on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May</phrase>. In the Yorkshire and Humber region, the issue of accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers was considered at the examination in public into the draft regional spatial strategy carried out in October and November 2006. The panel report is expected to be published shortly. The need for further assessment work by the regional planning body will be considered in the light of the panel report.

	<p pid="b.27.0/1">The 2005-06 national school sport survey found that some 189,000 pupils in schools in school sport partnerships (SSPs) are registered as being gifted and talented because of their ability in physical education or sport. Those with exceptional talent are encouraged to join local sports clubs accredited by the relevant national governing bodies for the sports in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/2">As part of the national school sport strategy, &pound;18 million has been set aside from 2004 to 2008 for the School Club Links programme, to encourage and strengthen links between schools and accredited sports clubs. Through this programme, schools are working with the national governing bodies of sport to provide a safe environment for young people to take part in sport beyond school in accredited sports clubs, with access to their facilities and their coaches.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/3">The School Club Links programme is a key work strand within the national school sport strategy. The aim of this work strand is to increase the percentage of five to 16 year-olds from school sport partnership schools who are members of, or participate in, governing body or otherwise accredited sports clubs. Currently, 27 per cent of pupils in partnership schools participate in at least one sports club linked to their school&mdash;up from 19 per cent two years ago. The most common club-linked sports are football (78 per cent), cricket (52 per cent), rugby union (46 per cent), dance (40 per cent) and athletics (38 per cent). On average, schools have club links with approximately six sports.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/4">The national school sport strategy aims to increase both the quantity and quality of PE and school sport for all pupils, whatever their particular needs or circumstances. This includes pupils with special needs and those from minority ethnic backgrounds. School sport partnerships are encouraged to target their available resources towards those with special needs or from ethnic minorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.31.2/1">The Brofiscin quarry has been designated as a special site because of the substances present and the specific geology of the site (carboniferous limestone). This is not related to the volume of waste that was accepted at the site.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.2/2">The costs incurred to date by the Environment Agency (EA), which include site investigation, drilling, monitoring, analytical costs and interpretation, are approximately &pound;800,000. Additional legal costs have been incurred for counsel and advice with regard to the proceedings in the United States, to the sum of &pound;17,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.2/3">The EA is also conducting extensive inquiries to determine who should bear responsibility for remedial actions and associated costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.2/4">A full interpretative report is due to be published by the EA in April. The report will bring together the findings of the recent drilling work and monitoring to present a three-dimensional picture of the quarry. This will help us to understand the extent to which contamination is migrating into the surrounding rock, groundwater and surface waters. The EA, Rhondda Cynon Taff County Borough Council and the Welsh Assembly Government will be liaising on possible further work at the quarry based on the findings of the April report. It is not, therefore, currently possible to assess the likely total expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.31.5/1">In Wales, responsibility for policy on waste management and contaminated land lies with the National Assembly, which receives specialist advice from the Environment Agency (EA) and the Food Standards Agency (FSA). In relation to Brofiscin quarry, the EA has looked at all the available reports&mdash;including those listed in my Written Answer to the noble Countess on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase> (<I>WA 72</I>)&mdash;in developing a conceptual site model. The Welsh Assembly Government are providing funding for the development of the model to aid in the assessment of potential remediation options.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.5/2">In relation to the Maendy site, consideration was given to the report of a study carried out by the Department of the Environment in 1975.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.5/3">In respect of the Solutia site at Newport, a report was produced in 2005, which included the assessment of opportunities for bio-accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) within the food chain due to releases to the Severn estuary. The FSA reviewed this assessment and concluded that the operation was unlikely to have any unacceptable effects on the food chain.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.5/4">The EA has no information in its records concerning the origins of any wastes deposited at the Rayleigh site. This site was operated and closed prior to 1974 and neither the EA nor the predecessor authority for waste (Essex County Council) was responsible for the day-to-day regulation of the site. The information that the EA holds on pre-1974 landfills is provided to it by the district council that authorised such sites, usually by way of planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.5/5">For the landfill site known as Bennett Bank, near Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, a pollution prevention and control (PPC) application was submitted on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-07">7 May 2004</phrase> and contained an environmental setting and installation design report (ESID) together with a hydrogeological risk assessment (HRA), a stability risk assessment (SRA), a landfill gas risk assessment (GRA) and a habitats impact assessment. These reports would have all contained analytical data that the EA used in considering the application for a PPC permit for the Bennett Bank landfill sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.5/6">During the permitting process, further questions were asked in support of the technical aspects of the application on 9 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-16">16 July 2004</phrase>. The responses to these contained further analytical data and were material considerations used by the EA in deciding to grant a PPC permit for the facility, a decision made on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.2/1">My department currently has no plans to issue guidance to the Environment Agency as a result of the amendment from the European Commission to paragraph 3 of Article 8 of the EC Water Framework Directive (WFD)(2000/60/EC).</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/2">The amendment changes procedures for the Article 21 committee of the WFD (and introduces the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny) including that for adopting technical specifications and standardised methods for the analysis and monitoring of water status. The Environment Agency (alongside other UK competent authorities) will continue to advise the UK Government through the UK Technical Advisory Group on the WFD on technical matters which arise in the Article 21 committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/3">The intercalibration process required by the WFD should lead to a common understanding across the European Union of good ecological status in water bodies. It is expected that the Article 21 committee will be asked to adopt a Commission decision on the results of the intercalibration exercise for the first river basin planning cycle during autumn 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/4">It is envisaged that the classification scheme in various parts of the UK will be finalised in the months following the adoption of the intercalibration decision by the Article 21 committee.</p>
