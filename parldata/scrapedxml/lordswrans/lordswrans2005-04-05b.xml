	<p pid="b.89.1/2" qnum="HL2002">How many people are dependent on food aid in Darfur, Sudan; to what percentage of the region aid agencies have access; and what assessment has been made of the plight of people living in areas where there is no presence of international non-governmental organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.2/1">In February 2005 the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed food aid to 1.6 million beneficiaries from a target of 2 million in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.2/2">Security is currently the main factor limiting the delivery of humanitarian aid in Darfur, but the sheer size of Darfur is also a challenge. At the beginning of March, the UN had access to 88 per cent of the 2.45 million people judged to be in need of humanitarian assistance in Darfur, but we expect access to deteriorate severely in some areas when the rainy season begins in May. The UN is currently pre-positioning food in advance of the rains.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.2/3">While there has not been a humanitarian needs assessment specifically of areas where international non-governmental organisations are not present, assessments are ongoing across Darfur. For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-24">24 March</phrase>, a four-day inter-agency assessment to Dar Zagawa in north Darfur was completed&mdash;the area had not been accessed since December. Preliminary findings there indicate that coping mechanisms among the local population are incrementally diminishing due to limited access to markets, inaccessibility of normal livestock migration routes and declining wild food stocks. The situation for displaced persons was found to be even worse. The mission recommended general food distribution to all assessed communities, and that further health and education assessments be made. Assessments in other areas will continue over coming days and weeks across Darfur.</p>

Agencies are now operating again and we understand there have been no repeats of such robberies.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.5/1">The current African Union (AU) mandate requires it to carry out proactive monitoring and allows it to protect civilians in the immediate vicinity under imminent threat of attack. The AU and the United Nations Department for Peace Keeping Operations, together with representatives from the European Union, US, Canada and the UK, have recently returned from a two-week assessment mission to Darfur, Khartoum and Addis, to consider the work being undertaken by the AU mission, and what further support could be offered. Our expectation is that the assessment mission will recommend that the first priority be to get the current monitoring mission (of up to 3,320 personnel) deployed and fully operational as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.5/2">As the next stage, the mission's view is that the AU will need more troops on the ground, and they have suggested a figure of 5,887. It is for the African Union's Peace and Security Council to decide how to take these recommendations forward. We have made clear our willingness to support the AU, should it decide that an expanded mission was required. We have already provided significant financial and technical assistance to the AU.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.2/1">Countries sign up to a set of values when they join the Council of Europe, including a commitment to the rule of law and to defending human rights.

	<p pid="b.91.2/2">The judgments on claims brought by Chechen civilians are the first instance of an international court finding Moscow guilty of human rights violations in Chechnya. The rulings set an important precedent, especially as there are currently around 120 cases brought by Chechen applicants pending before the court.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.2/3">Our European Union (EU) partners and ourselves expect the Russian Government to take these judgments seriously and to act on the findings.

	<p pid="b.94.5/1">The Armed Forces operate a policy whereby all new recruits, regardless of age, who have completed 28 days' service (excluding leave) have a right to discharge within the first six months of service by giving not less than 14 days' notice in writing to the commanding officer if they decide that a career in the Armed Forces is not for them. In addition, service personnel under 18 years and three months of age who have passed their statutory six-month period for &quot;discharge as of right&quot;, and have had their clear &quot;unhappiness&quot; at their choice of career registered by their commanding officer before reaching 18, can be considered for release from the Armed Forces. This provision does not provide &quot;discharge as of right&quot;. The commanding officer has discretion to delay a decision on discharge if he has doubts about the permanence of the individual's &quot;unhappiness&quot; up until the individual reaches 18 years and three months of age. However, it is exceedingly rare for such an &quot;unhappy&quot; individual to be refused permission to leave.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.3/1">Lump sum injury payments awarded under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) are individual payments of compensation for personal injury caused by service in the Armed Forces. Depending on a number of factors, it may be advantageous to the recipient to place the lump sum in trust if he or she is also in receipt of income related benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.102.6/2">Scientists have advised that salmon escaping in winter suffer the greatest post-release mortality rates of all. About 0.5 per cent of escapees tend to return to spawn in rivers in the vicinity of their site of loss. However, because they are not primed specifically to these rivers, by spawning time the escaped fish will disperse more widely than is usual (i.e. for wild fish).</p>
