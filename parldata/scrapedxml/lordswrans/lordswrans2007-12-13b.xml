	<p pid="b.81.5/18">The definition of high flood risk areas used by Communities and Local Government is the high-risk zone mapped by the Environment Agency as being at a probability of flooding, excluding the presence of flood defences, of at least one in 100 each year for river flooding and at least one in 200 for coastal flooding. High flood risk areas account for about 10 per cent of land in England, including parts of major cities such as London.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.5/19">Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development and the Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in such areas. Planning policy statement 25 (PPS25) ensures that flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable.</p>

It is the duty of the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) to monitor the performance of Network Rail and to take action if Network Rail fails to meet its regulatory targets.
