	<p pid="c.188.2/1">The noble Lord's Question refers to the EU's so-called comitology procedures. Comitology refers to the various types of committee that oversee the implementation of Community law, and is governed by Council Decision 1999/468/EC. There are three types of comitology procedure: under one, the regulatory procedure, which is used for the approval of genetically modified crops, if the relevant committee made up of member state representatives (acting by qualified majority) does not deliver an opinion or delivers an unfavourable opinion, the Commission can submit its proposal to the Council. The Council then has to confirm by qualified majority whether it adopts or opposes the proposal. If the latter, the Commission's proposal cannot be adopted in that form. But if the Council takes neither course of action within three months, the Commission adopts the measure. This system allows the Council to supervise the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers under Article 211 EC while avoiding blockages of implementing legislation unless there is a qualified majority against. The Commission has also made a statement indicating that in sensitive sectors it will avoid going against any predominant position which might emerge within the Council against the appropriateness of an implementing measure.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.2/2">The Commission estimates that 99.5 per cent. of implementing measures are adopted following the agreement of the committees without reference to the Council. The latest report available from the Commission on the working of committees during 2003 (OJ C 65 17.3.2005) records only one example of a measure being referred to the Council and subsequently adopted by the Commission (authorisation of the placing on the market of sweet corn from genetically modified maize Bt11). This compares with 2,768 instruments adopted by the Commission in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.2/3">The Government supported the reform of the comitology procedures under Council Decision 1999/468/EC. However, as EU presidency, they are also taking forward discussions of the Commission's 2002 proposal for reforming comitology, which the Commission revised in 2004 following an opinion from the European Parliament. There have so far been three working group meetings to discuss the revised proposal and there will be two more under the UK presidency. As presidency, we are working to find a reform that would be acceptable to all parties.</p>

	<p pid="c.192.5/1">The Middle East peace process remains a high priority for the European Union's General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC). The efforts of the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union/High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, have also helped to shape the international community's response to the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.5/2">The EU continues to offer political and practical support to the work of the Quartet's Special Envoy for Disengagement, James Wolfensohn. At the <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> GAERC, the council reiterated its support for James Wolfensohn and urged the parties to reach rapid agreement on the issues contained in his rapid action plan including arrangements for Gaza's borders and crossings, the Gaza seaport and airport, movement of goods and people between Gaza and the West Bank, and freedom of movement in the West Bank. The council also accepted Mr Wolfensohn's request, on behalf of the parties, that the EU consider playing a third party monitoring role at the Rafah crossing point on the Gaza-Egypt border and expressed the EU's willingness in principle to provide assistance with the operation of crossings at Gaza's borders on the basis of an agreement between the parties. The EU is currently considering a possible non-executive monitoring role.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.5/3">The EU continues to be one of the biggest international donors to the Palestinian Authority. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-19">19 September</phrase>, the European Commission announced that it would provide around &euro;280 million in 2005 to help build Palestinian infrastructure and revive the Palestinian economy. We are pleased that this money includes a substantial contribution to help tackle the priorities identified by James Wolfensohn. At the <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> GAERC, the council welcomed the Commission's detailed communication entitled <i>EU-Palestinian co-operation beyond disengagement&mdash;towards a two-state solution</i>.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.5/4">The EU is also working with US security co-ordinator, General Ward, to help the Palestinians in the field of security sector reform (particularly with regard to civil policing). At the <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> GAERC, therefore, the council decided to launch a European security and defence policy police mission in the Palestinian territories to build on the work of the EU Co-ordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support and provide enhanced support to the Palestinian Authority in civil policing.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-11-21c.193.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="193"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo051121/text/51121w03.htm#51121w03_spnew6">
	<p pid="c.193.2/1">A key aspect of personalised learning is strong partnerships beyond the school. Voluntary organisations and the local community have a key role to play in working with schools to help drive forward progress in the classroom, to extend opportunities, broaden pupils' horizons, to remove barriers to learning and support pupils' well being.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.2/2">We also envisage a strong role for the voluntary sector in meeting our vision for all schools to provide access to a core offer of extended services by 2010. There are many good examples of schools that are already providing extended services in partnership with the voluntary sector and we expect that many more schools will choose to develop services in partnership with existing local voluntary sector providers benefiting from the long standing skills, experience and knowledge that they have in delivering services for children.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.2/3">We recognise that effective one-to-one learning, whether carried out by the school workforce or voluntary organisations, can help to personalise the learning for pupils and help them to make better progress if delivered in a structured and coherent manner to supplement whole classroom learning. We know that many good schools are already using both voluntary organisations and volunteers from the local community to offer one-to-one support to meet the learning needs of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.2/4">In relation to literacy support for schools, the department already has links with a range of volunteer programmes run by charitable organisations including Volunteer Reading Help, the National Reading Campaign's Reading Champions initiative, run by the National Literacy Trust and the National Literacy Trust's Reading is Fundamental scheme. We believe that these make an effective contribution to the personalisation of learning within schools. Also of significance is the wide range of voluntary literacy support that takes place through business-sponsored schemes, through local school or community-run initiatives, and through the involvement of parents in their child's learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.2/5">While we welcome the contribution of the voluntary sector in helping to personalise the learning of pupils, in particular by providing one-to-one literacy support, schools are the best placed to determine when and how to use national and local voluntary organisations to help them tailor teaching and learning to meet the needs of all their pupils.</p>
