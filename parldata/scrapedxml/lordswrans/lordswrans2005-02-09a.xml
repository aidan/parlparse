He released the report to United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January</phrase>. The report concludes that the government of Sudan, the Arab militias and the rebels are all guilty of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law, which may amount to crimes against humanity and/or war crimes. The report also found that the government of Sudan has not pursued a policy of genocide in Darfur, although a &quot;competent court&quot; will need to decide whether certain individuals have done so. The report stresses that the crimes which have taken place in Darfur &quot;may be no less serious and heinous than genocide&quot; and recommends that the crimes should be referred to the International Criminal Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/2">The ICI has given the UNSG a list of suspects it believes may have perpetrated these crimes, and recommends that he pass this list to a competent prosecutor. The UNSC is united in its determination that there can be no impunity for these crimes and will be discussing the next steps over the coming days.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.3/2">Further targets have been set for income support, jobseeker's allowance and housing benefit for subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.3/3">The department has already made significant progress in delivery against these targets. By March 2004 we had reduced fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 37 per cent to 6.4 per cent compared with the 1998 baseline figure of 10.4 per cent, achieving the first stage of the target. We have achieved even more in reducing fraud. Compared to the 1998 baseline figure, by March 2004 we had reduced the level of fraud in working age income support and jobseeker's allowance by half. Since 1997 we have saved the equivalent of over &pound;1 billion through our efforts in reducing fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.3/4">However, even when these targets are achieved the level of loss cumulatively across departmental expenditure is likely to remain above 1 per cent.

	<p pid="a.124.2/1">There are no available data to give a definitive answer to this question. There is no evidence to show that bovine TB itself is a major cause of death in badgers. The evidence available suggests that in badgers infected by bite wounding, there is a more rapid dissemination of disease, which might lead to an earlier death; whereas badgers with infected lungs, indicating a respiratory route of infection, can survive for long periods. Some individuals have been recorded as surviving for up to three or four years.</p>
