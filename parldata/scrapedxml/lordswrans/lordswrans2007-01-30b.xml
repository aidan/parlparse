Department of Health and national treatment agency investigations into this have not confirmed widespread disinvestment from commissioners in residential treatment services.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.5/2">The review of effectiveness of treatment for alcohol problems was published in November 2006 by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (the NTA). Its authors are three distinguished UK academics: Dr Duncan Raistrick, who runs the Leeds Addiction Unit and is a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists; Nick Heather, Emeritus Professor of Alcohol and Other Drug Studies at Northumbria University; and Christine Godfrey, Professor of Health Economics and Health Sciences at the University of York. It is for the authors of the review to decide whether to respond to any part of the article they feel is inaccurate, should <I>Addiction Today</I> allow this.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.5/3">In commissioning and publishing this review the NTA has sought to make available the evidence base on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alcohol interventions and treatment. The ultimate aim is to ensure that people affected by alcohol problems have access to evidence-based cost-effective help and treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.0/1">The latest measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration show a slightly increasing trend, which will feed through into increased climate forcing and global temperature rise.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.0/2">The increases in atmospheric CO2 in 2005 and 2006 were high but not exceptional. In 2005 CO2 concentration rose by 2.0 parts per million (± 0.2 ppm) and in 2006 by 2.1 (± 0.2 ppm). These increases were lower than those seen in 2003, at 2.5 ± 0.2 ppm). Between 1958 and 2000 such large annual rises were rare, with only three occurrences in the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.0/3">It is not yet clear whether the above average annual increase in 2005 and 2006 were primarily due to manmade or natural factors. Possible causes include hot dry summers in Europe and drought in Amazonia, with consequent widespread forest fires. It is too early to be confident that the recent trend towards increasing CO2 concentration will continue, though it is considered likely.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.0/4">Recent analyses, including the Stern review on the economics of climate change, show that, with strong international action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, stabilisation of atmospheric concentrations at 550 ppm is still achievable. The UK has continued to keep climate change high on its international agenda in 2006. During 2007, the UK will work across all fronts, including the EU, G8 and UN, to inject greater urgency and momentum into the process of driving down global emissions.

	<p pid="b.33.3/1">All munitions undergo rigorous and comprehensive testing both before they are brought into service and once they are part of the UK's stockpile, to ensure there is no degradation in safety or performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.3/2">The M85 submunition is usually tested by live firings on a controlled range. This offers the opportunity to recover any unexploded devices for further inspection, including noting the correct operation of the self-destruct mechanism. The data are analysed to determine the continued effectiveness and safety of the weapon system and, in partnership with the prime contractor, BAES Land Systems Munitions, to establish whether any improvements can be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.3/3">The supply of the 155mm ballistic sensor munition (BSFM) is still subject to tender evaluation, a part of which is the compliance against self-destruct requirements. This will be further assessed during sub-system testing and live firings during the demonstration and manufacture phases, to verify the overall performance before the BSFM enters service.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.3/4">BLU-108B, MJ1 and MJ2 submunitions are not incorporated into any weapons that are in service with UK Armed Forces. There are no other weapons in the inventory incorporating submunitions with a self-destruct mechanism.</p>

However, in some cases it has not proved possible to resolve disputes between the various parties. In these cases the claims of all such parties have been penalised accordingly. This has resulted in further correspondence being submitted to the RPA which is currently being considered.

	<p pid="b.36.3/1">Bone health, including the development of strategies to prevent osteoporotic fractures, is a key priority of the National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People. The NSF recommends that where individuals are identified as being at high risk of developing osteoporosis, investigations such as dual energy x-ray absorptiometer (DXA) scans should be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.3/2">Arrangements for the delivery of the standards of care outlined in the NSF are a matter for local determination. However, the Government are taking steps to increase NHS capacity in DXA scanning to improve access and reduce waiting times. In 2005-06, &pound;3 million was allocated from a centrally held revenue budget for purchasing additional scans from the independent sector. Capital provision of &pound;17 million has been made available in 2006-07 and 2007-08 for investment in new DXA scanning equipment.</p>

In other cases the public authority retains the right to change its requirements from the PFI contractor as a consequence of significant changes to the public service it is providing from the PFI scheme.

	<p pid="b.40.8/2">Under the Environment Act 1995, local authorities are required to assess air quality to determine whether the air quality strategy objectives are likely to be achieved. Where local air quality objectives are likely to be exceeded, the local authority is required to declare an air quality management area (AQMA) and to develop an action plan to improve results, in association with stakeholders such as the Highways Agency (HA). In 2001 Dartford Borough Council introduced an AQMA for a 250 metre-wide corridor along the A282 from Junction 1a to 300 metres south of Junction 1b. The HA is committed to working with local authorities to try to achieve the air quality strategy objectives and EU limit values, and Dartford's AQMA is one of those prioritised for action in the HA business plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.8/1">The toll plazas perform an essential safety role at the Dartford crossing, as they control the number and speed of vehicles through the tunnels and around the bridge. The Highways Agency considers that because of the limited overall capacity of the crossing itself, a free flow of traffic would increase the probability of accidents, leading to more delays overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.8/2">If the toll plazas were removed, some other method of controlling traffic flows to achieve an optimal outcome would be needed. We therefore consider it unlikely that the toll plazas generate significant additional disruption to traffic, or significant additional emissions, compared to a theoretical crossing with no toll plazas.</p>
