	<p pid="b.147.2/1">The production costs for the equivalent of 1 kilogram of morphine in 1999 in Australia was $56, compared to $450 in Afghanistan. Opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan is extremely labour-intensive; in Australia, cultivation is a largely mechanised process. The production costs for Afghanistan include fertiliser (estimated at 250 kilograms of urea and 250 kilograms of diammonium phosphate per hectare at a cost of $200), oxen, at a rate of 10 days per hectare at a cost of $2 per day; and 350 labour days, including 200 days for harvesting, at an estimated wage rate of $6 per day); and 150 days for land preparation, sowing, weeding, field clearance and seed collection, at an estimated rate of $2.5 per day). It assumes opium production of around 40 kilograms per hectare and that 10 kilograms of opium are required to produce 1 kilogram of morphine equivalent. These figures are drawn from a variety of sources, including the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and consultancy work commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The 1999 figures are the most up to date published by the INCB due to the commercially sensitive nature of the data.</p>

	<p pid="b.148.2/1">Air passenger duty liability is normally payable to HMRC for each calendar month on the 22nd of the month following. However, Ministers have confirmed that payment of the extra APD for February will be deferred by one month. This means that for the February return, due to be rendered in March, airlines are to declare and pay the duty at the old rate. The balance of the payment for February, covering the increase, will be payable alongside the March return. Further information on this can be found in paragraph 9.1 of Public Notice 550, <I>Air Passenger Duty</I>, a copy of which is available on the HMRC website.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.2/2">The March return is to be completed with the new increased rates and rendered with full payment, to include the February adjustment, in April.</p>

The &pound;165 million represents the additional revenue owing to this increase, which is accounted for in 2006-07, as with all scorecard costings, on a national accounts basis. This means revenues for APD received up to and including <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-22">22 April 2007</phrase> are included in the &pound;165 million score for 2006-07. An explanation of the national accounts can be found on page 288, Chapter C, of Budget 2006, a copy of which is available on the HM Treasury website.</p>

	<p pid="b.149.0/1">In 2001, the Department for International Development (DfID) commissioned a study by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia and the Natural Resources Institute at the University of Greenwich, <I>The Impacts of Global Climate Change on the UK Overseas Territories</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/2">In 2005 the Overseas Territories Environment Programme (OTEP), a jointly funded programme of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and DfID, supported a project managed by the Tyndall Centre to help build capacity in the Caribbean British Overseas Territories (OTs) to assess their vulnerability to climate change and to plan adaptation measures. The Tyndall Centre and the territory stakeholders produced a guidebook, <I>Surviving climate change in small islands</I>, which was distributed widely and is available at <a href="http://www.tyndall.ac.uk">www.tyndall.ac.uk</a>. This report has recently been used as a guidance document for the latest bidding round for new projects under OTEP.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/3">Both projects included consideration of the implications of climate change for biodiversity but did not focus on this aspect exclusively.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/4">DfID's OTs department is taking steps to facilitate the participation of the five Caribbean UK OTs in regional climate change adaptation programmes, funded through the Global Environment Facility and managed by the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre, based in Belize. Among other things, this will enable the territories to draw on regional expertise in undertaking more detailed assessments of the potential impacts of climate change on their biodiversity and on ecosystem services more generally.</p>

	<p pid="b.149.3/1">We are aware of the importance of biodiversity within the UK Overseas Territories (OTs). The Government, working through their scientific advisers, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, undertook assessments of the biodiversity values in the OTs. A report in 1999, <I>Biodiversity: the UK Overseas Territories</I>, commented on the state of biodiversity in each territory. In September 2001, the Government signed environment charters with most of the OTs, listing commitments for the UK and the OTs. These charters form the basis for our relationship with the territories on environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.3/2">In 2003, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development (DfID) established the overseas territories environment programme to assist the territories with the implementation of the charters. Initial funding was &pound;1.5 million per department over three years. DfID has since approved &pound;1.5 million for the financial years 2007-08 to 2009-10. The FCO has approved &pound;469,000 for the financial year 2007-08. Future allocations will depend upon the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.3/3">In addition, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), through its Darwin initiative, has contributed over &pound;1.5 million on biodiversity projects in the UK OTs since 1993. Further support has been channelled through international biodiversity agreements, in particular the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). The south-Atlantic territories are important breeding sites for some very rare albatrosses and petrels, which benefit from the international collaboration that stems from ACAP and from the additional voluntary funding that Defra provides to it. Later this year, Defra also plans to contribute to the costs of an officer who will co-ordinate ACAP activities in the south-Atlantic territories.</p>

The transition plan draws together information from a range of individuals, including the young person themselves, their school, and other professionals that are working with them. It is designed to plan ahead for the provision and services they may need to make a smooth transition from school to adult life. Schools or local authorities must draw up the plan, and the Connexions service must oversee its implementation. The school must invite a representative of the local social services to the annual review meeting so that they can contribute to the planning, including the transition to adult services. The health services should also be invited where that is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.155.5/40">The five FOI requests were received from the same applicant within a period of 25 consecutive days and are considered to be requests for similar information as defined in subsection (2)(a) above, as they all closely refer to British nationality and passport-issuing matters relating to Hong Kong. The FCO believes that the aggregated cost of responding to all five requests, two of which consisted of more than one specific request for information, would have greatly exceeded the appropriate limit as set out in the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.155.5/41">The applicant has exercised his right under the provisions of the FOI Act to seek an internal review of the FCO's decision to aggregate the costs of these requests. The FCO is currently reviewing its decision accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="b.160.2/1">The Government provide support and &pound;6.5 million homelessness grant funding to Westminster City Council, which has responsibility for reducing rough sleeping in its area. The local authority and its partners believe that the proliferation of soup runs across the borough, such as those provided at Howick Place, is damaging to its rough sleeping strategy. The Government support the authority's strategy to provide the most effective help possible to reduce the number of rough sleepers in the borough.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.2/2">Westminster operates building-based services (BBS) for rough sleepers inside buildings rather than on the streets to remove the incentive for people to appear on the streets as rough sleepers in order to access services. Outreach workers encourage people on the streets into BBS.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.2/3">In Victoria, services are provided at the Passage day centre. These services address support needs, reconnect people to their home area and refer individuals to appropriate hostel accommodation. There are practical facilities, including food, showers and laundry; healthcare, including mental health and substance misuse services; training and employment services.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.2/4">The Government's success in tackling rough sleeping is based on interventions to change people's lives for the better. Soup runs provide food to a wide range of people, only some of whom are homeless or in any form of housing need, and often contribute to street culture and draw new people into homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.2/5">We are committed to sustaining reductions in the number of rough sleepers and to further reduce numbers in London. In 1998 there were 1,850 rough sleepers on the streets of England on any single night; in 2006 there were just over 500. The 2007 annual estimate of rough sleeping will be published in September.</p>

	<p pid="b.162.5/1">In March 2005, the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service jointly consulted with external interested parties over possible changes to their respective Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs). The consultation presented three options for reporting releases from &quot;land treatment resulting in benefit to agriculture or ecological improvement&quot;. These were:</p>
	<p pid="b.162.5/2">Option 1: report against the substance list for water from the proposed European PRTR regulation (which subsequently became the list for land in the published European regulation);</p>
	<p pid="b.162.5/3">Option 2: report against a reduced but unspecified substance list (for example, metals only);</p>
	<p pid="b.162.5/4">Option 3: report against the full proposed UK PRTR substance list for water.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.5/5">Following comments received during the consultation, it was decided that reporting of the quantity of individual substances released to land following &quot;land treatment resulting in benefit to agriculture or ecological improvement&quot; would not be a requirement for all the UK PRTRs (this includes the Environment Agency's pollution inventory). Operators are, instead, only required to report the quantity of material transferred off-site from an industrial site for &quot;land treatment resulting in benefit to agriculture or ecological improvement&quot; where this exceeds five tonnes per year.</p>

	<p pid="b.164.2/1">The saving in carbon dioxide emissions reported in <I>Nature</I> is equivalent to about 0.03 per cent of UK carbon dioxide emissions in 2005. However, research undertaken in 2005 by the Building Research Establishment on behalf of Defra found that, while moving the clock forward one hour throughout the year to align the UK with Central European Time would realise some savings in carbon dioxide emissions from domestic lighting and non-domestic cooling, those savings would be more than offset by increases in non-domestic lighting and cooling. The BRE estimates do not take account of any additional savings from reductions in peak demand leading to greater electricity generating efficiency. We have not analysed the overall financial costs and benefits that could result from the change. Work by the Transport Research Laboratory, commissioned by the Department for Transport and published in 1998, suggested that there could be a net saving of over 400 people killed or seriously injured per year, although as the total number of road accident casualties has fallen significantly since 1998, any casualty reductions arising from the change are also likely to have fallen. All those estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, as the <I>Nature</I> article points out. Any changes to the UK time-zone would need to take full account of the effect on society as a whole.</p>
