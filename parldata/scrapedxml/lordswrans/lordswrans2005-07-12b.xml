	<p pid="b.137.2/1">Information on the number of asylum seekers who were detained in 2004 under Immigration Act powers and of those the number of mothers with young children is not available. It would be available only by examination of individual case files at disproportionate cost. Quarterly snapshots are published showing the number of people detained under Immigration Act powers on the last Saturday of each quarter, and they can be broken down by gender and by detainees who are under 18 years old. Those individuals were all detained as part of families whose detention as a group was considered necessary and include minors detained with their families under NSA provisions at Oakington reception centre. The power to detain is an essential part of protecting the integrity and effectiveness of our immigration control. The decision to detain is made on a case by case basis and may be appropriate in one or more of the following circumstances: to effect removal; to establish a person's identity and claim; where a person presents a risk of absconding; or where the application is capable of being considered quickly.</p>

	<p pid="b.139.2/1">The UK has not yet taken a decision on whether or not to sign the convention. We support fully all of its aims, and we too want to see widespread action to tackle that abhorrent trade at source, to protect and support the victims and to bring those responsible to justice. However, there are certain provisions in the convention that present concerns for the UK, and they remain under active consideration. We want to resolve those issues before taking a decision on signature. We have already put in place a range of measures to combat human trafficking. We intend to build on those and will continue to work nationally and internationally to ensure that we have in place the right policies to meet our responsibilities on the issue. We are looking at what further steps would be required, if the UK becomes a signatory, to ratify the Council of Europe convention. That work has not yet concluded, but our initial assessment is that full implementation would require some legislative changes.</p>

However, the transition to that point requires a rebuilding of trust and confidence, which in turn is dependent on an end to paramilitary and criminal activity and the decommissioning of illegally held weapons.</p>

	<p pid="b.142.5/1">The proposed lorry road user charge (LRUC) was not intended as a pilot scheme for national road pricing. However, our work on the LRUC has strengthened the Government's view that distance-based charging for using the UK's roads is technically achievable. In particular, our &quot;proof of solution&quot; work with prospective suppliers has enabled us to see the technology in action and is confirming our expectations of its ability to deliver a distance-based charge.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.5/2">Now that we are taking forward work on a national system of road pricing, it is right for us to take forward the plans for distance-based lorry charging as part of the wider work on national road pricing&mdash;to work for a single comprehensive, cost-effective system. So, although the current procurement for lorry road user charging will not continue, we will continue to work with industry and ensure that we carry the full experience gained from the project into the wider work to develop a national road-pricing system for cars and lorries, and we will continue to work with the haulage industry to ensure that its needs are represented as we develop a national road-pricing system.</p>
