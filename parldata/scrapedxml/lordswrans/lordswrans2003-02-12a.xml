	<p pid="a.118.2/1">The Sexual Offences Bill follows a major review of the criminal law on sexual offences. We do not believe there is anything in our proposals which would encourage an increase in the number of false allegations that are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.2/2">The police are duty bound to make detailed investigations where allegations are made of serious offences. Following the initial investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considers the content of the police findings and makes its own independent assessment. Both the police and the CPS have to consider the nature of the evidence before them and whether it is reliable enough to support a realistic prospect of conviction. It is the overriding duty of the CPS to ensure that the right person is charged with the right offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.2/3">There are important safeguards in the criminal justice system to ensure that those who are falsely accused or wrongly convicted can have this injustice righted. These include the presumption of innocence, the high standard of proof on the prosecution, the right to legal representation, the right to call any witnesses to challenge and test evidence through cross-examination and the right to seek leave to appeal against conviction or sentence. There are also a range of offences to deal with those who might seek to pursue such allegations, including the offences of perverting the course of justice, wasting police time and perjury. The latter carries a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.9/1">We have no plans to enhance the current death-in-service benefits ahead of implementing the findings of our reviews of the Armed Forces pension and compensation schemes. Current attributable benefits paid to a widow under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) and the War Pensions Scheme (WPS) are among the more generous of the public service schemes. While the current rate of death-in-service benefit is low at between one and one-and-a-half times the individual's representative rate of pay, it needs to be seen in the context of the other benefits available under our compensation arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.9/2">Where the member dies in service from attributable causes and leaves a widow, widower and/or dependent child, a short-term family pension, equal to the service person's annual rate of pensionable pay, is payable for up to 182 days. The short-term pension maintains the household income level in the early months of bereavement. In addition to the basic death-in-service lump sum, an attributable gratuity is also payable equal to the annual rate of a full career pension. Thereafter, a long-term widow's or widower's, and children's pensions are paid. Attributable widow(er)'s pensions are significantly enhanced, index-linked and paid for life, regardless of whether the widow(er) remarries or cohabits. The attributable widow's and widower's pension is 90 per cent. of the member's full career pension, less an abatement to reflect the amount by which the War Pensions Scheme war widow's or widower's pension exceeds the basic state widow's pension. Attributable children's pensions are also enhanced, index-linked and are paid until age 17 and may continue if higher education is undertaken. Apart from these valuable occupational pension benefits, the WPS provides additional compensation for families of those service personnel whose death is attributable to their service. This includes a tax-free War Widow's Pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.9/3">The department's reviews of the Armed Forces pension and compensation arrangements have included consideration of the level of death-in-service benefits. We expect to finalise proposals for the new AFPS and make a public announcement of the key proposals, early this year. However, the new schemes are not expected to be available before 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.9/4">In the meantime, should service personnel consider that the AFPS and WPS benefits do not meet their personal circumstances, they should continue to make personal life insurance provision. As I indicated in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-29">29 January 2003</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 1129&ndash;32), we recognise that some service personnel who are being deployed to the Gulf are having difficulty in securing new life assurance cover in order to enhance their families' financial security. Insurance cover is still available but the Government are examining options should this situation change.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.2/1">The standard assault rifle issued to United Kingdom Armed Forces is the Small Arms (SA) 80. The SA80 modification programme has significantly improved the reliability and performance of the weapon. Extensive trials carried out across all climatic conditions before the modified weapon was introduced, and more recent trials and demonstrations in Afghanistan and Oman, have established the weapon is reliable, accurate and can be maintained in an operational environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/2">Challenger 2 is a world-class battle-winning tank. There were no major mechanical problems with Challenger 2 tanks on Exercise Saif Sareea II, but the exceptionally dusty conditions in Oman resulted in higher use of air filters than had originally been planned for. As a result of the lessons identified during the exercise, modifications to improve the performance of the tank in desert conditions are under way.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.2/1">Prolonged absence from a property should be notified to the property insurer, which may require additional security measures to be taken as a condition of continued insurance cover. There may also be an increase in insurance premium and/or an increased excess payable by the insured in the event of a claim. To compensate personnel, regardless of marital status, for the effects of separation from home life, reservists who meet the eligibility criteria receive longer separated service allowance (LSSA) or (for those serving seagoing units) longer service at sea bonus (LSSB). These are payable at three rates (basic, middle and higher) dependent on periods of accumulated separation (for LSSA) or length of sea service in qualifying units (for LSSB). In addition, when called-out, reservists are paid the full X-factor, which is an additional 13 per cent. of their basic pay. The X-factor takes account of the relative disadvantages of conditions of service experienced by members of the Armed Forces compared with those in civilian life.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.0/1">We are pleased to announce today that the Government have invested an extra &pound;88 million over the next three years to provide recombinant clotting factors for haemophilia patients in England. Haemophilia patients up to age 21 are already receiving these products. The extra funding will extend the availability of recombinant clotting factors to adult patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/2">Over the next few months the Government will then work with key stakeholders, including the Haemophilia Society, clinicians and primary care trusts, to design a programme for rolling out access to recombinant products to older age groups. This roll out will take time to achieve because of the large volume of product involved. However, by March 2006 the vast majority of haemophilia patients should be receiving recombinant clotting factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/3">We have taken a number of steps to make clotting factors used to treat people with haemophilia as safe as possible. We hope this extra &pound;88 million will ultimately give all haemophilia patients access to synthetic treatments where these are recommended by clinicians.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/4">We would like to take this opportunity to commend my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester on his excellent support and compassion for haemophilia patients and their families. His work as President of the Haemophilia Society has been unstinting and we admire his determination to achieve the very best for its members.</p>
