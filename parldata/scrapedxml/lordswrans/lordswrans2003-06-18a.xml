	<p pid="a.97.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-22">22 January 2003</phrase>, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he intended to reduce the maximum discounts available to tenants under the right-to-buy scheme in 42 areas that were under the greatest housing market pressure, as evidenced by a high incidence of homelessness and high house prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">Having considered representations from a number of local authorities and post-transfer housing associations, the Deputy Prime Minister decided to reduce the maximum discounts in 41 areas. This decision was implemented by the Housing (Right to Buy) (Limits on Discounts) (Amendments) Order 2003 (Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 498), which was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-06">6 March 2003</phrase> and came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-27">27 March 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">At the request of honourable Members opposite, this order was debated on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-12">12 May 2003</phrase> in the other place by the Third Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation (Official Report, Commons Session 2002&ndash;03, <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-12">Monday 12 May 2003</phrase>, Cols. 003 to 026). During the debate my honourable friend the Member for Harrow East, agreed to publish information on how all housing authority areas ranked in terms of housing pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/4">This information is set out below. It relates only to England. The order does not affect areas in Wales, which for right-to-buy purposes are subject to different arrangements administered by the National Assembly for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/5">The areas are grouped according to the nine English regions&mdash;London, South East, East, South West, East Midlands, West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, North East and North West. Each area was ranked on a scale of 1 (high) to 5 (low) according to the levels of homelessness and house prices locally, and these rankings were used to determine the 41 areas under the greatest housing pressure. Subsequently, information relating to earned incomes became available, and the model was rerun to take account of affordability. The effects on individual areas of doing so were marginal. The revised rankings are also set out below.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" name="Keith Hill">My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning (Keith Hill)</phrase> has today written to Mr Edward Davey MP and to the Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation to convey this information, and to Mr Philip Hammond MP and to Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP to clarify a separate point made during the debate about the costs of the right-to-buy. Copies of these letters have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Barrie</p>

	<p pid="a.98.17/1">The RAF has undertaken both basic flying training and on-going flying training overseas with varying results. The RAF's experience has been that initial training is not completed any more quickly than the equivalent training in the United Kingdom, partly because the lack of experience of flying in different weather conditions means that additional training is required when pilots return to the UK. Ongoing non-operational flying is regularly conducted overseas with more success, although additional time is taken travelling to and from the training location.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.59/1">The available information on the social class of higher education students covers only those who apply to full-time and sandwich undergraduate courses via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) and its predecessor organisations, the Universities Central Council for Admissions (UCCA) and the Polytechnic and Colleges Admissions Service (PCAS). The proportions of accepted applicants who came from the skilled manual, semi-skilled and unskilled social classes were 26 per cent in 1992 and 28 per cent in 2001; comparable figures for earlier years are not held centrally. In 2002, following a major review of government social classifications commissioned by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), a new socio-economic classification was introduced, which is not directly comparable with the social class figures for previous years.

	<p pid="a.98.62/1">The transport segment of the Transport, Energy and Telecommunications Council was held in Luxembourg on 5 and <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase>. My right honourable friend, the then Minister of State for Transport (Mr Spellar) represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/2">The Council agreed a three-part package on aviation external relations. This includes mandates for the Commission to negotiate an air service agreement with the US on behalf of the Community, and to negotiate on specific Community issues with other third countries, while allowing flexibility for member states to negotiate and implement air service agreements bilaterally. We welcome this package as a pragmatic and balanced response to the European Court of Justice rulings in the &quot;open skies&quot; cases, and my right honourable friend spoke in support of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/3">A general approach was reached on a regulation suspending the use-it-or-lose-it rule for airport slot allocation for the summer season 2003 for application in summer 2004, because of the exceptional circumstances&mdash;the Iraq conflict and SARS&mdash;that affected passenger demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/4">There were written reports to the Council on progress on two legislative proposals in aviation, the draft regulations on insurance requirements and protection against unfair pricing practices by third countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/5">There was a debate on a draft regulation on ship and port facility security. Further work will be done in COREPER with a view to agreement at the October Council. There was consensus that work should focus on implementing the IMO regime for international traffic and the possible extension to Class A passenger ships on domestic voyages (primarily those travelling more than 20 nautical miles from the coast). We support this regulation, which will ensure the consistent application of IMO requirements agreed last December. We expressed our concern at the automatic application to shorter domestic voyages at Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/6">Council Conclusions were agreed on improving the image of Community shipping and attracting young people to the seafaring profession. We welcome this initiative and my right honourable friend proposed that there should be a review of progress during the UK Presidency in 2005, following a Commission report. This was welcomed by the Commission and the Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/7">Written reports were submitted to the Council on designation of particularly sensitive sea areas and on the outcome of the IMO Diplomatic Conference of 12 to <phrase class="date" code="">16 May</phrase> to adopt a Protocol to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/8">Council Conclusions were agreed supporting the integration of EGNOS (project for enhancement of the GPS system in Europe) and the Galileo satellite navigation project. We are in favour of the integration of EGNOS and Galileo.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/9">The Commission reported on progress of the High Level Group of Member States and acceding country representatives looking at future priorities for the transport Trans-European Network. The group's report will be submitted to the Commission, which will bring forward proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/10">Council Conclusions were agreed on the Commission's road safety action plan, entitled, Halving the number of road accidents victims in the European Union by 2010: a shared responsibility. We welcomed the document and said that, where legislative measures are in prospect, they will have a much better chance of early acceptance by the Council if careful consideration of proportionality and subsidiarity issues is given beforehand. My right honourable friend referred to the UK's good record on road safety, which showed the value of our approach. The UK was one of the member states singled out by the Commission as models for best practice in reducing road accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/11">There was a written report on progress on the draft directive on minimum safety requirements on tunnels in the trans-European road network. Several member states, including the UK, although supporting the general aim of improving safety, have had concerns about some of the detailed technical provisions in this directive. The Commission recognised that further technical work needs to be done and that there is a need for flexibility in application. The Council will aim to reach agreement on the directive later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/12">The Commission reported on its plans for transport infrastructure charging. It plans to issue a proposal on a revised Eurovignette system for the charging of HGVs before the summer break. A number of member states called for rapid progress to be made on expected wider proposals for transport infrastructure charging. My right honourable friend called for proposals which will support the implementation of the UK's own lorry charging scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.62/13">No formal votes were taken at this Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.68/1">Even though no new data will now be collected for HASS, the Government recognise that the existing database will remain a valuable resource for many years which should continue to be freely available for users. They will, therefore, be looking for proposals from other organisations that would be interested in taking it over. The value of the database should be enhanced by the inclusion of the past three years data which has been delayed by IT problems. The Government hope to be able to publish this later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.68/2">The report of the Accidental Injury Task Force identified a need to strengthen the surveillance of accidental injury at regional and local levels in the NHS. This will be the Government's first priority. However, it is too soon to say whether NHS surveillance will collect data on product involvement in accidental injuries in the sort of detail which HASS has provided. If detailed data is required on product safety issues, this can be collected through targeted surveys.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.95/1">In 1999, at the time that the discharge limit for technetium-99(Tc-99) was reduced from 200 TBq/year to 90 TBq/year, we asked the Environment Agency to carry out a review of Tc-99 discharges and report its findings in advance of those for the main review of all other radioactive discharges from the Sellafield site. Following public consultation on its proposals the agency published its proposed decision for Tc-99 in September 2001. In December of last year, we announced our agreement with the agency's proposals which, when implemented, would result in the Tc-99 discharge limit being reduced to 10 TBq/year in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.98/1">In England and Wales there are approximately 150 premises in the manufacturing sector that hold certificates of registration, under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993, from the Environment Agency in relation to the keeping and use of depleted uranium. The vast majority are simply users of articles manufactured from depleted uranium, eg industrial radiography source containers. The agency's central records list only five premises, other than sites licensed under the Nuclear Installations Act (Amended) 1965, that are engaged in manufacturing and are specifically authorised to dispose of depleted uranium wastes. In addition to the five sites referred to above, the agency is aware of manufacturing activities involving depleted uranium at licensed nuclear sites such as AWE Aldermaston. A number of nuclear sites (for example BNFL Springfields) and some Royal Ordnance sites (for example ROSM Featherstone and Cardiff) were previously engaged in the manufacture of depleted uranium components, but have now ceased manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.98/2">In England and Wales the disposal of depleted uranium waste is controlled by means of certificates of authorisation issued by the agency under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. Specific conditions and requirements relating to disposal are detailed in the certificate. During the regulatory process of applying for a certificate specific guidance is provided by the agency to each applicant.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.128/1">It is the responsibility of individual National Health Service organisations to ensure that they comply with legal requirements when dealing with requests for access to health records. The Data Protection Act 1998 provides individuals with a right of access to their health records. However there are certain circumstances in which the record holder may withhold information.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.128/2">Access may be denied, or limited, where the information might cause serious harm to the physical or mental health or condition of the patient, or any other person, or where giving access would disclose information relating to or provided by a third person who had not consented to the disclosure. The decision over whether to grant or withhold access must be made by individual record holders. However individuals do have recourse to the NHS complaints procedure if they feel that their application for access has not been dealt with appropriately.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.134/1">There are numerous organisations which regulate, audit and inspect differing aspects of the provision of hospital care at infrequent intervals. The majority of these organisations generally focus on one particular aspect of healthcare provision. Therefore, regulation, audit and inspection is only one area of their work. It is therefore not possible to distinguish whom, in any one organisation, is working on these areas of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.134/2">The only body which undertakes a full inspection of National Health Service hospitals is the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) which undertakes a rolling programme of clinical governance reviews. On average each trust might be inspected once every four years. CHI currently employs 357 staff, 51 of which are engaged in inspection work. The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) inspects private sector providers. The NCSC currently employs 2,285 staff, 53 of which are engaged in private and voluntary sector healthcare inspection work.</p>
