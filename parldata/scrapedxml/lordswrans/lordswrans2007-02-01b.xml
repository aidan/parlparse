Our aim is that it will improve and enhance our efforts to do so. In recognition of the high profile, public confidence and success achieved by ARA in Northern Ireland in tackling organised crime and dealing with organised criminals, SOCA will have a designated officer responsible for asset recovery work in Northern Ireland, and there will be no diminution in the resources available for assets recovery work there.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.38/1">At present, the planning for the enrolment network for the national identity register remains at a high level and on a national basis. Detailed planning for implementation at individual locations will take place in due course. However, the Identity and Passport Service is already putting in place an extended local office network in order to meet and interview first-time applicants for passports and to prepare for recording biometrics for passports and identity cards in due course. This network consists of 69 offices throughout the UK in the following proposed locations:</p>
	<p pid="b.71.38/2">Aberdeen, Aberystwyth, Andover, Armagh, Barnstaple, Belfast, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Birmingham, Blackburn, Boston, Bournemouth, Bristol, Bury St. Edmunds, Camborne, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Cheltenham, Coleraine, Crawley, Derby, Dover, Dumfries, Dundee, Edinburgh, Exeter, Galashiels, Glasgow, Hastings, Hull, Inverness, Ipswich, Kendal, Kilmarnock, King's Lynn, Leeds, Leicester, Lincoln, Liverpool, London, Luton, Maidstone, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Newport, Newport (Isle of Wight), Northallerton, Northampton, Norwich, Oban, Omagh, Oxford, Peterborough, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Reading, Scarborough, Shrewsbury, Sheffield, St Austell, Stirling, Stoke-on-Trent, Swansea, Swindon, Warwick, Wick, Wrexham, Yeovil and York.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.38/3">These offices will open in 2007 and the local office network will subsequently be used as the basis for the national identity scheme. Where the network of enrolment centres needs to be further expanded, we will first seek to use high street offices that are already used by central and local government. We will also look at options for the private sector providing outlets. The extent to which this will be done and the offices involved will be determined following further analysis of the needs of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.62/1">Information about the potential for radioactive contamination to have been buried under a specific part of the Olympic Park site is referred to in an internal memo by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority in 1972, following information received from the London Borough of Newham. The memo referred to &quot;radioactive material&quot; of,</p>
	<p pid="b.71.62/2" class="indent">&quot;brickwork, metal etc. from a local factory contaminated by an isotope of Thorium with some derivatives&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.71.62/3">buried in 40 gallon drums, with an attached plan showing an &quot;approximate&quot; position in an area formerly used as a waste tip area.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.62/4">A 1994 study (by WS Atkins on behalf of Lee Valley Regional Park Authority) was commissioned to assess radiological contamination risk in a small area of the Eastway Cycle Circuit identified in the 1972 memo. This concluded that there was no positive indication of the existence of the reported levels of buried radioactive material. The only elevated levels of radioactive activity were localised and attributed to the presence of varying lumps of granite and fuel ash.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.62/5">The results of the 1994 survey were provided to HM Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Both organisations reviewed the findings and neither identifies the need for further work.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.62/6">When this information came to light in July 2006 the London Development Agency reviewed all of the documentation available including the report and correspondence mentioned above and consulted the borough environmental health officer and the Health and Safety Executive, both of whom were satisfied that no immediate action was required. At the point when this area needs to be disturbed for remediation purposes the Health and Safety Executive and other regulatory bodies will be consulted. This work is not scheduled to happen until after July 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.74/1">It is not possible to put a figure on the number of vulnerable women in prison. There are women in prison who may be considered vulnerable for a number of reasons, such as mental health problems, drug addiction, histories of abuse and victimisation or who are at risk of self-harm or suicide.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.74/2">The Government want to ensure that custody is used only for women offenders who really need to be there because of the seriousness of their offending or because they present a risk. That is why we are taking forward the women's offending reduction programme which focuses on improving community-based services and interventions to support greater use of community sentences wherever possible. This includes the &pound;9.15 million we are investing in new initiatives to demonstrate how an integrated multi-agency approach in the community can be more effective at tackling the multiple needs of women offenders and avoid the use of custody.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.74/3">The noble Baroness, Lady Corston, is completing her Review of Women in the Criminal Justice System with Particular Vulnerabilities which may suggest further action that could be taken to prevent women with vulnerabilities ending up in prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.83/1">A regulatory impact assessment (RIA) on the SIA licence fee was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-12">12 January</phrase>. The Security Industry Authority (SIA) is expected to be self-funding through the income received from licence fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.83/2">The proposed new licence fee of &pound;245 is an increase of 29 per cent over the current fee of &pound;190, and was calculated by the SIA on the basis of the forecast licensable population and operational expenditure for 2007-08 and 2008-09. The SIA has reduced its costs&mdash;for example, by reducing its workforce by 30 per cent and moving to new, cheaper offices. The SIA's cost-saving measures have reduced the initial fee increase forecast of &pound;281 by &pound;36 to &pound;245.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.83/3">The proposed fee increase is conditional upon the making of a Section 102 order under the Finance (No. 2) Act 1987, followed by the appropriate negative regulations under the Private Security Industry Act 2001. The updated regulatory impact assessment on the SIA licence fee increase can be found on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/ria-sia-industry-licence-fee/">www.home office.gov.uk/documents/ria-sia-industry-licence-fee/</a>.</p>

It is intended that the increase will come into force from <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase>, conditional upon the making of the necessary secondary legislation. This will be the first increase in the SIA licence fee since the SIA was set up nearly four years ago.
