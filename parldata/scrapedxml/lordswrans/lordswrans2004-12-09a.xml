The cost and time required adequately to de-risk a project are dependent on a number of factors including its complexity and the initial maturity of the component technologies. Departmental guidance suggests that up to 15 per cent may be spent to de-risk the project but this is not interpreted as a target. The amount budgeted for individual projects reflects the results of more detailed analysis on a case-by-case basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.5/1">Appropriate resources are made available to senior responsible owners (SROs) to enable them to deliver the programme and benefits for which they are responsible. SROs do not require direct managerial budgetary control for their programmes because their role is to provide a single clear focus of accountability. Ultimately, an SRO acts with the full authority of, and on behalf of, the defence management board and is therefore fully empowered in order that he or she can deliver the programme and its benefits. Management of work within the individual TLB area or in each line of development remains the responsibility of the top-level budget holders, who are of course, also accountable to the defence management board.</p>

The report did, however, highlight areas for further work. These are already being addressed in an action plan drawn up by Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA), which will be subject to regular monitoring. To ensure independent external assessment of the initial training system, the department has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI). The MoU enables the introduction of independent inspection, reinspection and oversight of the defence learning provision. A programme of inspection will be undertaken on an annual basis and reports will be published, thus enabling training to be benchmarked against appropriate national standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/1">The level at which authorities set their council tax in 2005&ndash;06 is primarily a matter for individual councils. The Government have recently announced the provisional local government finance settlement for 2005&ndash;06 which provides another very good settlement for local government. It provides for an increase in total support from government grant and business rates in 2005&ndash;06 of &pound;3.5 billion, or 6.2 per cent and guarantees an above-inflation increase for all authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/2">Given this substantial investment in local government, the Government expect to see substantially lower council tax increases next year. Average council tax increase in England in 2005&ndash;06 should be less than 5 per cent. This applies to all authorities, including police and fire authorities. The Government are prepared to take even tougher capping action next year than we did in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
