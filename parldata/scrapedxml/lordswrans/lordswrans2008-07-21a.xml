	<p pid="a.197.2/1">EU legislation currently prohibits the use of bovine tuberculosis vaccines, as the use of injectable BCG vaccine for bovine tuberculosis in cattle interferes with the current tuberculin skin test. Changing such legislation requires successful negotiations with the Commission in Brussels and other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), the UK's national regulatory body, will be the licensing authority for the vaccine. A licence will be granted only once VMD has gathered specific information on the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine and is satisfied that it meets the necessary criteria. By granting a licence, it also indicates that the vaccine complies with relevant EU regulations for veterinary medicines. It will also consider the role of the current tuberculin diagnostic test alongside the vaccine. This will facilitate the formal negotiation for inclusion of cattle vaccine use in EU legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/3">Prior to the licensed vaccine being available, the Government will engage in discussions with the Commission and other member states to facilitate the formal negotiation process.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">Bovine tuberculosis (TB) can be transmitted to humans, and, not least because milk and dairy products are traded internationally, the European Union clearly has an interest in ensuring that the risks of disease transmission are minimised. Food hygiene regulations in England provide for the execution and enforcement of certain Community instruments laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin. Similarly, the European Union has responsibility to reduce the risk of disease spread that could be caused by the intra-Community trade in live cattle.</p>

The register is intended for colleges which wish to recruit students from overseas and whose main purpose in the UK is to study. The Citizenship Training School in Leyton does not appear on the register.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.5/2">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and the Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator are responsible for accrediting and reviewing qualifications. The QCA also oversees the work of the awarding bodies which are responsible for developing, assessing and quality-assuring qualifications. For a college to be recognised as an assessment centre, it will need to satisfy the awarding body's criteria on the quality and security of its assessment regimes.</p>

In addition, menus are colour coded, according to their nutritional/dietary content, to inform customers. All the catering suppliers have in place their own welfare and farm assurance schemes and are independently audited to ensure that they adhere to the standards and accreditations of which they are members. This includes the specific legislation that is in place for animal welfare. As a minimum, these suppliers are required to operate to BRC grade A in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.11/1">There are two types of bonus payments made to staff within the NIO. First, there is the special bonus scheme which is available for all staff up to assistant director level. Nominations for special bonus awards can be made by any member of staff at any stage during the year and each director is responsible for assessing those recommendations for staff within his/her directorate and approving payment, as appropriate. This is normally done on a quarterly basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.11/2">Secondly, there is annual performance bonus scheme for staff up to grade A and another separate scheme for members of the SCS. The amount available and the basis for SCS bonuses are determined centrally by Cabinet Office. Line managers make recommendations and established pay committees determine who should receive a bonus. Each pay committee is chaired by a non-executive director and staff of a higher grade than those being assessed. The Permanent Secretary's pay is determined by the Permanent Secretaries' Remuneration Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.11/3">For staff up to and including grade A the amount available and basis for the annual performance bonuses is determined as part of the overall departmental pay remit approved by HM Treasury. Line managers make recommendations and an established moderating panel determines who should receive a bonus. In all cases, the staff on the moderating panels are of a higher grade to those being assessed.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.5/1">The bail order for terrorist suspect U was released to the media with consent from the Special Immigration Appeals Commission judge. Before releasing the bail order, administrative staff removed the personal details&mdash;namely, terrorist suspect U's name and bail address&mdash;from the electronically stored document. The software used for the document, Microsoft Word, has a facility for tracking changes made to documents. While the final document that was sent to the media was a clean copy, recipients were able to access the previously deleted information by utilising this tracked changes facility. However, despite this, the reporting restrictions issued by the judge at the same time as the bail order still applied and prevented this information being published.</p>
