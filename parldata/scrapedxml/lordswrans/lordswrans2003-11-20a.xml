	<p pid="a.339.5/1">Immigration detainees held in Immigration Service removal centres and those held in prisons solely under immigration powers both have rights to social visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.5/2">The extent and timing of visiting hours at each Immigration Service removal centre do not need to be identical given that individual centres have different operational priorities and may accommodate different categories of detainees. However, it is reasonable for detainees and their families to be able to expect a minimum standard of visiting arrangements and we are working towards this position.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.5/3">Individual immigration detainees held in prisons for reasons of control and security have visits in accordance with procedures for which the Prison Service is responsible and no differently from other unconvicted prisoners with whom they are categorised and held. Arrangements for social visits to unconvicted prisoners, including immigration detainees, are set out in the Prison Service operating standard on prisoners' family life. It would be impracticable and undesirable to provide special visiting arrangements for a specific group of unconvicted prisoners, especially where the individuals concerned are unlikely to be held together. As such, immigration detainees held in prisons will continue to receive social visits in line with the existing Prison Service operating standard.</p>

	<p pid="a.340.2/1">The Armed Forces vaccination policy follows national guidelines as set out in Immunisation against Infectious Disease 1996 (&quot;The Green Book&quot;) published by the Department of Health, and is laid down in JSP 311&mdash;Joint Service Manual of Immunological Procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/2">It is Ministry of Defence policy to offer public health vaccinations to service personnel routinely, with boosters at appropriate intervals thereafter. Therefore it should not be necessary to administer several vaccinations or boosters together immediately before a deployment. In an emergency, or if personnel are required to deploy at short notice, then boosters or additional vaccinations may be unavoidable if personnel are not up to date. This is the same as for anyone travelling overseas at short notice. In such circumstances, full account would be taken of any other treatment or medication that an individual might be receiving at the time, balanced against the risk of contracting potentially serious diseases during deployment. The MoD has specific guidance in place to prevent certain vaccines being administered together.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/3">Immunisation programmes for service personnel are kept under review to ensure they develop in line with Department of Health practices, military-specific risk and threat assessments, medical advice and recommendations from internationally recognised health organisations, such as the World Health Organisation. Where military-specific risk assessments indicate a policy variation from the &quot;Green Book&quot; or the World Health Organisation guidance, changes would only be made following consultation with experts in communicable disease and public health medicine. Policy changes may also be driven by the availability of suitable pharmaceuticals. Changes to vaccination policy are issued to medical officers via Surgeon General policy letters, which are sent out down the single service chains of command.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/4">The differences between the immunisations given to service personnel in 1990&ndash;91 and the immunisations given today are summarised in an Answer given in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-10">10 June 2003</phrase>, (Official Report, col. 764W).</p>

	<p pid="a.341.8/1">It has been a long-standing policy of successive governments that the cost of erecting memorials and associated projects are not usually met from public funds, but from private donations or public subscription. The Ministry of Defence does not have responsibility for either the funding or maintenance of war memorials. The MoD receives many requests from individuals, ex-servicemen's groups and charitable organisations seeking assistance with various projects. It would not be possible to be seen to support one project rather than another. The vast majority have worthy goals and can make an equally compelling case for support. It would be divisive and open to criticism from unsuccessful applicants, if the Government were to pick and choose which projects to support.</p>

	<p pid="a.342.5/1">There has been no direct cost to individual members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme for the benefits that the scheme confers since the current scheme was introduced in 1973. The scheme is non-contributory for members, with the cost of benefits being met by the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/2">While members make no direct contribution, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) compares the overall remuneration of the Armed Forces with that offered by comparator civilian employers. The AFPRB currently makes a 7 per cent abatement of the pay of civilian comparators to take account of the extent to which AFPS benefits are better than those of civilian comparators. This abatement has varied over time depending on the outcome of the AFPRB's comparisons. The abatement does not equate to the cost of providing pension scheme benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/3">As with members of the current AFPS, members of the new AFPS will not make a direct financial contribution. The next valuation of the AFPS by the AFPRB is scheduled for the 2006 report. It would not be appropriate to forecast what the AFPRB may decide on the comparative value of the scheme. As an independent review body, they will reach their own decision on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.344.0/1">My Answer to the earlier question on this issue explained that the investment available in the current spending period, &pound;75 million, will allow us to improve the speed and quality of work in the civil and family courts and reduce unnecessary delays caused by manual working practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.0/2">Focusing the available investment on the most appropriate courts we will have a positive impact on the users of civil and family courts. We will install a modern IT infrastructure into a large number of civil sites. The targeted sites will include all care centres, all trial centres, the principal civil and family courts plus a number of sites across circuits to ensure a fair geographical distribution. This is in addition to the 61 sites included in the criminal infrastructure programme and will capture 80 per cent of all civil business. This will enable court users to access the court by use of email and we intend to develop a possession online service for housing cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.0/3">As I have previously explained, I am not yet in a position to make a formal announcement about other individual modernisation projects, which remain at various stages of planning. All projects will go through a rigorous internal evaluation to ensure they contribute to our public service agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.2/1">Work is not being contracted by individual lines. Instead, there are four framework contracts, one each for London, Kent, Sussex and Wessex. Individual items of work will be organised within those frameworks and, in many cases, will benefit more than a single route. The upgrade as a whole is due to be completed in 2005 by which time we all expect slam door trains to have been withdrawn from passenger service and the replacement rolling stock brought fully into use.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.2/1">We are aware of the BCVA survey. The nature of TB testing is such that most TB tests are completed on or shortly after their due date. Delays in the submission of test results from local veterinary practices, or delays in the input of those test results on to the database when they have been received at animal health offices, could result in some tests appearing as outstanding when the tests have been carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/2">Early in 2002, pressure of work following the foot and mouth disease outbreak may have led to delays in the input of test results on to the database, but this position is now much improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/3">Herds with tests overdue by more than three months are now put under movement restrictions. Because of this, careful checks are made to ensure that all tests that have been done (and results received) are entered on to the database.

	<p pid="a.363.5/1">The European Commission has commenced formal proceedings against the United Kingdom under Article 226 of the EC Treaty and Article 26(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/2">The Commission considers that:</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/3" class="indent">(i) the United Kingdom has not provided its competent authorities with the sufficient means to perform their tasks of inspection and control, as laid down in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy;</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/4" class="indent">(ii) the United Kingdom has not ensured in a sufficient and effective way the compliance with the Community rules in force concerning control measures, notably inspection and monitoring of all fishing activities within its territory and within the maritime waters subject to its sovereignty or jurisdiction;</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/5" class="indent">(iii) insufficient and ineffective control has been observed in particular with respect to those obligations related to the use of the VMS (vessel monitoring systems) by vessels operating in the UK waters, to the recording of the exact amount of catches in the logbook, to the submission of sales notes, to the submission and recording of landing declarations, to the submission of transport documents and to the establishment of a validation system comprising in particular cross-checks and verification of data in order to ensure respect of the obligations laid down in Articles 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14 and 17 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93;</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/6" class="indent">(iv) the United Kingdom has not taken the appropriate measures against the natural or legal persons who do not comply with the rules in force of the common fisheries policy, including proceedings capable of effectively depriving those responsible of the economic benefit of the infringements or of producing results proportionate to the seriousness of such infringements, effectively discouraging further offences of the same kind, and is of the view that the United Kingdom has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 1(2), Article 2(1) in connection with the Article 3(6), Article 6(3), Article 8(1), Article 13(1&ndash;3), Article 14 (1 and 2) and Article 19 (1&ndash;3), and Article 31 (1 and 2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/7">The Government have two months in which to respond and to demonstrate compliance with their obligations under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93. If the Commission is not satisfied with the Government response it may take preventive measures as provided for in Article 26(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2371/2002 and issue a reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the EC Treaty. Beyond that the Commission may refer the issues to the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.5/8">Effective enforcement is integral to the success of the common fisheries policy and to efforts to conserve fish stocks. The Government are taking the Commission's criticisms very seriously; are currently consulting with the Scotttish Executive, the Welsh Assembly government and the Northern Ireland authorities, and expect to submit a postive response to the Commission early in the new year.</p>

In April 2003, the Government supported EU co-sponsorship, with the United States, of a UN Commission on Human Rights resolution on Belarus. This expressed deep concern about restrictions on religious organisations. Our Ambassador in Minsk has also raised our concerns with the Belarusian Foreign Minister. General human rights violations in Belarus have led EU member states, including the UK, to suspend ministerial contacts with their Belarusian counterparts.</p>
