	<p pid="a.47.5/1">The Bail Act 1976 establishes a presumption that a defendant will be granted bail, and this presumption applies even where the offence is of a sexual or violent nature. But the Act also sets out reasons that may justify withholding bail. The most important are that the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that if released the defendant would abscond, commit an offence, or interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. It is for the court to decide in a particular case whether any of these exceptions to bail are present and whether the defendant may therefore be remanded in custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">Carbon savings are generated within the UK power sector when low-carbon generation displaces conventional fossil fuel technologies. However, as the UK power sector is part of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) which has placed a cap on emissions, any carbon savings achieved in the UK power sector have to be netted off by lower carbon abatement elsewhere in the EU-ETS.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/2">The extent of carbon savings is dependent upon the assumed generation mix, which is dependent upon a range of factors, including fossil fuel and carbon prices, the economics of electricity generation, technological progress, and policies pursued (including those designed to meet climate change targets) . DECC models different generation scenarios in order to develop policy, rather than forecasting a specific generation mix. The net carbon savings will depend on the scenario used.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/3">For example, in DECC's recently published <I>Updated Energy Projections</I> central baseline scenario, 411TWh of electricity is estimated to be supplied from wind (onshore and offshore) in the next 10 years (2011-20). If we assume this displaces generation from the marginal plant<sup>1</sup> it translates to 15MtCO2 net carbon savings. In this scenario, there is no new nuclear forecast until 2022. This scenario does not include the impacts of any proposed electricity market reform measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/4">By contrast, under the central scenario commissioned by DECC from the consultancy Redpoint (to inform the electricity market reform White Paper and including EMR policy options), 445TWh of electricity is supplied from wind and 38TWh of electricity from new nuclear in the next 10 years (2011-20). By the same method as before, this translates to 17MtCO2 and 2MtCO2 net carbon savings respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.6/1">The report's sponsoring departments, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for International Development (DfID), set out commitments in the report's action plan and have made significant progress on several fronts to ensure the consideration and take up of the report's findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.6/2">Defra ensures that the UK leads the way on sustainable intensification of agriculture and champions a more integrated approach to food security and the development of a sustainable and resilient global food system through international fora such as the UN Conference on Sustainable Development. Furthermore, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' contribution to the G20 process and establishment of the Agricultural Market Information System support moves to manage price volatility through improved market information and transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.6/3">DfID is promoting more effective, national and international approaches to global food security; for example, by funding studies which link agriculture and climate change; strengthening modelling through contributions to the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) programme; and through its support for the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) research programme. DfID has strengthened international public policy by conducting systematic reviews of evidence and has invested in research and new technologies to support improved health, nutrition and hunger outcomes in developing countries. DfID continues to develop and pilot new ways of stimulating innovation and supporting the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.6/4">The Government Office for Science is engaging with leading global stakeholders; for example, United Nations' agencies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank and the African Union to catalyse action in response to the report in areas which include global sustainability, hunger amelioration, green growth and knowledge transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.6/5">At a domestic level Defra has established a project called the Green Food Project which Government will undertake jointly with the farming and food industry, consumer and environmental organisations, to consider some of the implications of the report in England. The project will consider how we might reconcile the goals of increasing food production and enhancing the natural environment, in order to lead the way on sustainable intensification.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">The Government published the report <I>Agricultural P</I><I>rice </I><I>S</I><I>pikes 2007/2008: Causes and </I><I>P</I><I>olicy </I><I>I</I><I>mplications</I><sup><I>1</I></sup> earlier this year, prepared in response to the commodities price spikes in 2008. Within this report, annexe 5 considers the global impact of biofuels on agricultural commodities. Specifically, although the demand for the agricultural commodities used in biofuel production has increased substantially over the past 10 years, biofuel use remains a small proportion of overall commodities demand. Medium-term economic modelling suggests that this may lead to upward pressure on commodities prices, most likely leading to increased production.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">The analysis also concluded that there is some evidence that increased demand for biofuels has led to lower stocks, but other factors such as active destocking policies by governments have been more important. We are currently unable to estimate the precise impact of biofuel production on food production or stock levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">The European Commission must monitor and report every two years on the impact of biofuel policy and increased demand for biofuel on social sustainability. This includes reporting on the availability of foodstuffs at affordable prices, in particular for people living in developing countries. If necessary the Commission must propose corrective action. We are feeding our views into the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/4">The UK was instrumental in the development of sustainability indicators as part of the work of the Global Bio Energy Partnership (GBEP) which was set up under the UK's G8 Presidency in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">For many years, the Government of Brazil have been striving to address the problems of extreme poverty and hunger, especially among children. From 2003-08 the Bolsa Familia program within the Zero Hunger campaign helped to lift 12.2 million people out of poverty, to contribute significantly to the overall decrease in inequality, and to reduce greatly levels of malnutrition throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">The Zero Hunger campaign has had distinct success. In the past 10 years, Brazil has cut the prevalence of underweight children in half and the country is on track to halve the rate of hunger before the 2015 millennium development goal deadline. The campaign was showcased at the joint Department for International Development (DfID) and United States Agency for International Development &quot;Millennium Development Goals Countdown&quot; event in the margins of the UN General Assembly in September. DfID is working to promote the dissemination and practical application of lessons from Brazil's experience in low-income countries, particularly in Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.5/1">The UK supports healthcare in Gaza through our financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA), and our core funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The PA provides healthcare services to non-refugees and hospital care for all Gazans. UNRWA provides primary healthcare to the 70 per cent of the population in Gaza who are refugees. Our financial support, along with that of other donors, to the PA is crucial in enabling the PA to procure drugs and disposables by helping to reduce budgetary constraints on the Ministry of Health. We are also supporting the UN Access Co-ordination Unit to work with the World Health Organisation, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and aid agencies to facilitate the transfer of medical equipment and supplies into Gaza. The UK is at the forefront of the international effort pushing for the easing of movement and access restrictions for Gaza and raises these issue regularly with the Israeli Authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January 2011</phrase>, we published <I>Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer</I>. It shows how the Government's reforms will improve outcomes for all cancer patients. The strategy sets out an ambition to save at least an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014-15 through earlier diagnosis of cancer and improved access to screening and radiotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/2">To support earlier diagnosis of cancer, the Government have committed over &#163;450 million over the next four years. This money will be used to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer; fund increased general practitioner access to diagnostic tests; and pay for more testing and treatment in secondary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/3">The strategy also sets out our commitment to work with a number of charities focused on rarer cancers to assess what more can be done to encourage appropriate referrals to secondary care and to diagnose rarer cancers earlier. Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including a pancreatic cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis and to discuss potential solutions. This will inform our future work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-16">16 September</phrase>, we announced plans to roll out a regional awareness symptom campaign focusing on lung cancer in October and a national campaign focusing on bowel cancer next year. In addition, there will be local trial campaigns for less common cancers, namely oesophagogastric cancer and the symptom blood in urine (an indicator of kidney and bladder cancers). Work is also under way to test the feasibility of developing a more generic cancer campaign that could apply to all cancer types including pancreatic cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/5">Finally, <I>Improving Outcomes in Upper Gastro-intestinal Cancers</I>, published in 2001, makes recommendations on the treatment, management and care of patients with upper gastro-intestinal cancers including pancreatic cancer. The Cancer Outcomes Strategy makes it clear that the improving outcomes in cancer guidance, published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, will continue to be a feature of all commissioned cancer services.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.5/1">We are greatly concerned at the humanitarian situation in Sudan. This is particularly acute in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile State where conflict continues and where humanitarian access is limited. Refugees displaced from Southern Kordofan into South Sudan are reported as malnourished, underlining the urgency of the need for humanitarian access after four months of no international response being permitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/2">There is also a significant ongoing humanitarian need for those displaced from Abyei and in Darfur. We are working closely with the UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations to press for greater access to those that need help the most and for the protection of civilians. In Sudan since May, we estimate that 110,000 people have been displaced from Abyei; 200,000 from Southern Kordofan; 25,000 from Blue Nile State, plus a further 25,000 out of the state to Ethiopia and a further 6,000 into South Sudan; and since January 2011 at least 70,000 in Darfur, with 1.9 million long-term displaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/3">In 2011, the UK has provided &#163;40 million to the UN managed Common Humanitarian Fund which channels funds through UN agencies and non-governmental organisations, of which around 60 per cent will be spent in Sudan to alleviate the needs on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/4">We expect this to help deliver the following results:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/5">emergency shelter and non-food items to 2.4 million people;life-saving health and nutritional support to 6 million people;safe water and sanitation to 3 million people; andfood security and livelihoods support to 5.4 million people.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) shares relevant information and intelligence about Structured Trust Advantaged Repackaged Securities (also known as STARS) with other fiscal authorities through the Joint International Tax Shelter Information Centre, in accordance with the exchange of information articles in our double taxation treaties.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/2">HMRC carries out risk assessments of its customers and where it identifies structured financial products, it reviews them as appropriate. Where HMRC takes the view that there is UK tax at risk, it will challenge such structures. Where it takes the view that there may be a threat to another fiscal authority, it liaises as appropriate with that fiscal authority.</p>

We will balance this efficiency with the appropriate safeguards to make sure that public funds are distributed wisely. We will provide a self-reporting tool for all those who are outside the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, such as the self-employed, to ensure that universal credit payments take into account all household earnings. The regularity with which information will be required and assessment made is being considered in order to balance obligations on the claimant and responsiveness to need.</p>
