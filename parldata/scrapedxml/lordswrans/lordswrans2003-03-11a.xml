	<p pid="a.167.2/1">Funding levels for the courts are set within the context of the overall spending review (SR) settlements for the department. We have recently completed the detailed allocation of resources across the department for the next three years, following the SR2002 settlement by the Treasury back in the summer. There have been some difficult choices in balancing competing demands for funding, but we have ensured that the focus has remained firmly on service delivery, particular in the courts. Specific measures that have been taken to protect front-line services include:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2" class="indent">Ensuring that funding for the courts provides the essential staffing and sitting day levels required to meet PSA targets, taking into account our current performance on criminal, civil and family waiting times and administrative process;</p>

	<p pid="a.167.5/1">Reform of the justice system is one of this Government's priorities. Since 1997 we have implemented major improvements in the criminal and civil courts. In 2000 I asked Sir Andrew Leggatt to review the tribunal system. We published Sir Andrew's radical blueprint for reform&mdash;Tribunals for Users: One System, One Service&mdash;in August 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/2">Since then the Government have been determining how best to meet the challenge set by Sir Andrew. We have taken a wide range of views, including through a formal, consultation exercise. A summary of the responses to that consultation has now been published; a copy has been placed in the Library of the House and it has been published on my department's website at <a href="http://www.lcd.gov.uk/civil/tribunals.htm">www.lcd.gov.uk/civil/tribunals.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/3">The Government have decided that the best way to take tribunal reform forward is to bring most non-devolved central government tribunals together into a single service. The service will reflect the needs and specialisms of individual jurisdictions and will in particular respect the differences between party versus party and citizen versus state tribunals. It will be a distinct part of the justice system, accountable to me. Initially the new service will be based on the 10 largest tribunals. Of these, the Immigration Appellate Authorities, the Office of the Social Security and Child Support Commissions the Tax Tribunals, the Pension Appeals Tribunal, and the Lands Tribunal already form part of my department. The Appeals Service, Employment Tribunals, Mental Heath Review Tribunal, Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal, Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeal Panel will transfer to the LCD over the period 2004&ndash;05 to 2007&ndash;08 from their current parent departments. Where appropriate, other smaller tribunals will also join the new service. The Government will publish a White Paper later this year on the reform and modernisation of the tribunals justice system within an increasingly unified tribunals service.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.2/1">The data protection principles&mdash;a form of statutory code of good information handling practice&mdash;are set out in the Data Protection Act 1998. Among other things, the principles require personal data to be processed fairly and lawfully; and to be obtained only for specified and lawful purposes and not further processed incompatibly with those purposes. The term &quot;processing&quot; covers disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">The Act provides exemptions from its non-disclosure provisions in circumstances where it recognises that the public interest requires disclosures of personal data which might otherwise be in breach of its requirements. In particular, Section 29 of the Act provides an exemption from the non-disclosure provisions in cases where their application would be likely to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, or the assessment or collection of any tax, duty or similar imposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3">Section 35 provides an exemption from the non-disclosure provisions where the disclosure is required by law or is necessary for the purposes of legal proceedings, obtaining legal advice or establishing, exercising or defending legal rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/4">Additionally, Section 28 provides a wide exemption from the Act's provisions, including the data protection principles, to the extent required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/5">It is for Transport for London to ensure that its processing of personal data complies with the data protection principles or meets the terms of a relevant exemption. The Data Protection Act is administered independently of the Government by the Information Commissioner. Any directly affected person may request the commissioner to make an assessment as to whether it is likely that any processing of personal data has been or is being carried out in compliance with the Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.2/1">Training of judges and magistrates is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), which is a body independent of government. It is chaired by Lord Justice Waller.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/2">Authorisation to hear public family law cases is governed by the Family Proceedings (Allocation to Judiciary) (Amendment) Directions 2002, which are made under the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/3">Before such authorisation, circuit judges must first attend the public family law induction seminar (formerly known as the residential seminar for potential nominated care judges). Most may already have attended residential private family law seminars, and heard private family law cases. District judges are also invited to attend this course when they have been authorised to hear interlocutory applications in this category, having already undergone similar training in relation to private family law.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/4">Thereafter, both circuit and district judges attend residential continuation seminars every three years in each jurisdiction they exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/5">District judges (magistrates' courts) have the same care jurisdiction as lay magistrates and those who sit regularly in the Family Proceedings Court are also invited to attend the JSB public family law induction seminar as well as private family law seminars. Statutory responsibility for the training of lay magistrates currently rests with magistrates' courts committees (MCCs) under Section 64 of the Justice of the Peace Act 1979, within a framework laid down by the JSB. The current outline syllabus for the training of family panel magistrates covers childcare issues as follows: key principles of the Child Care Act 1989; the welfare principle; needs of the child/basic child development; and the role of the local authority/child protection measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/6">Specific training in care issues continues to develop. A series of seminars on the case management protocols is presently being organised for the autumn, and further seminars on the Adoption Act will follow in 2004.</p>

The Department for International Development (DfID) is holding regular discussions with these and other international organisations about their contingency planning. Estimates of the numbers of people who may be displaced vary according to a range of different scenarios, and plans are being developed accordingly. UNHCR's planning covers all of Iraq's neighbouring countries. DfID is a regular contributor to ICRC's annual Iraq emergency appeals, and has given it &pound;1 million for its 2003 appeal. DfID has also supplemented its core contributions to UN agencies with an additional &pound;3.5 million of funding to date to support UN humanitarian contingency planning for Iraq, including for UNHCR.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">Lord Filkin represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in Brussels on 27&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/2">The A points were approved as in document PTS A 8 (6756/03) (a copy has been placed in the Library) with the exception of point 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/3">The Council discussed the draft Council decision on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection. Member states remained divided on whether refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection should receive equal treatment on family unity (Article 21), access to employment (Article 24), social welfare (Article 26) and healthcare (Article 27). The Presidency reminded member states of the undertaking made at the Seville European Council to adopt the text by June.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/4">The Council reached a general approach on the draft Council directive on the right to family reunification subject to consideration of the European Parliament's opinion and one parliamentary scrutiny reserve. The UK has not opted in to the adoption of this measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/5">The Commission set out its ideas for strengthening of the procedures for passport control at the Schengen entry points, designed to tighten existing controls on the entry of third country nationals at Schengen borders. Two member states presented a joint paper on the future use of biometrics in visas and residence permits. Lord Filkin stressed the importance of work in this area being carried out in line with existing international standards. He also invited the Commission to examine ways of using Eurodac data to assist in identifying those who overstayed in the Schengen area.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/6">The Commission gave a short presentation of the forthcoming feasibility study on improving sea-borders control, proposing the creation of three maritime zones covering the western, central and eastern Mediterranean.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/7">This was followed by an orientation debate concerning the effectiveness of financial resources available at Community level for dealing with migration issues. Lord Filkin called for appropriate budget and burden-sharing mechanisms and urged the Commission to produce its report on burden-sharing before June. One member state called for an increase in the Community budget to support JHA-related work on burden sharing, while two others argued for restructuring of the European Refugee Fund to allow money to be used for repatriation measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/8">During the open debate on fighting organised crime in the western Balkans the Presidency underlined its commitment to action in the Balkans and the need for concrete follow-up to the London conference on organised crime in South East Europe. The Presidency also reiterated the view that responsibility for change rested with governments in the region. Lord Filkin focused on the need to move from rhetoric to action, to implement the commitments made at the London conference and to develop appropriate mechanisms to monitor progress. He also underlined that countries in the region must co-operate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Other member states highlighted the importance of reinforcing the rule of law, the creation of stable institutions and of increased police co-operation in response to the trafficking of drugs and people through the Balkans.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/9">The Council suspended negotiations with the US on the draft agreements between the EU and USA on judicial co-operation in criminal matters and on extradition which remained subject to a reservation by one member state. The Presidency undertook to prepare documents for member states' use for the purpose of consulting their national parliaments on the proposed agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/10">The Council discussed the outstanding issues on the draft framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. There was agreement that the scope of offences in Article 1 should not include acts directed against a group of persons defined by reference to their &quot;belief&quot;. However, a recital was proposed explaining that the use of the word &quot;religion&quot; could include persons &quot;defined by reference to their religious convictions or belief&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/11">Member states remained divided on the scope of criminal liability in Article 8. Four delegations favoured the inclusion of a provision obliging member states to derogate from dual criminality for mutual legal assistance in relation to offences of racism and xenophobia if they applied the stricter test for criminal liability. The UK and five other member states opposed. Lord Filkin reiterated the need to strike a balance between effective measures on racism and xenophobia and freedom of speech; he noted that improvements to judicial co-operation arrangements should be pursued through mutual recognition initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/12">The Council discussed a list of offences for which cross-border fines would be enforced in the absence of dual criminality in the draft framework decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. A majority of delegations, including the UK, were content to use the list adopted for the European arrest warrant, adding road traffic offences and six other types of conduct. However, one member state said that the European arrest warrant list was unsuitable for this instrument and three others had reservations on the inclusion of specific offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/13">The Council reached a general approach on the draft framework decision on attacks against information systems subject to consideration of the recitals, the European Parliament's opinion and parliamentary scrutiny reserves from five member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/14">Under &quot;Any Other Business&quot;, the Commission gave a progress report on the implementation of the Afghan Return Programme. Voluntary returns were due to commence on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>. Over lunch, the Commission reported on negotiations with Switzerland for its participation in Schengen arrangements. There was also a discussion of current counter-terrorism arrangements, including the role of Europol.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.2/1">In the light of concern that some asylum applicants from other countries are posing falsely as nationals from Iraq, we have decided to pilot language analysis testing for use in cases where appropriate when a person claiming Iraqi nationality applies for asylum. Language testing arrangements in such cases will start on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-12">12 March 2003</phrase> and continue for an initial period of one month.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/2">The purpose of language analysis is to provide expert evidence which helps to identify the place of origin of asylum seekers. Language analysis is used in a number of European countries, and the results have been generally successful. In the UK, language analysis has been used already in the case of asylum claims made by nationals claiming to be from Afghanistan, Somalia or Sri Lanka. It was found to be a valuable aid in the asylum consideration process, clearly identifying in many instances that the applicant was not of the nationality he or she claimed to be, or not from the area of the country from which they claimed to originate. Language anaysis also benefited genuine applicants by confirming the information they gave about their nationality.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/3">The extension of language testing to nationals from Iraq is being given legal effect today by an authorisation made by myself under section 190 of the Race Relations Act 1976. Where there are objective reasons for doubting the nationality of a person claiming to be from Iraq, the authorisation will enable staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to request the applicant to undertake a further interview which will be taped and sent to a language expert for analysis. Individuals may refuse to consent to this further interview (which will be conducted at the initial screening stage), but this refusal can be taken into account when determining whether the applicant has established the facts of their case. This may lead to their claim being refused.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/4">We will review the need for this further authorisation later in the year. Independent scrutiny of the likely effect of authorisations made by Ministers and how they are operated in practice by officials is exercised by the Race Monitor, Mary Coussey, who reports to Parliament via the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/5">A copy of the additional authorisation has been placed in the Library of the House. Any additional or amended authorisations will also be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.2/1">Current provisions already allow a police officer to require a driver to take an eye-test where there is reasonable cause to suspect that the driver's uncorrected eyesight might have contributed to a road traffic accident. The Government are satisfied that these powers are adequate and have no plans to introduce a requirement for routine eye-testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">In 2001 there were 228 driving incidents in which eyesight might have been a factor. There are however approximately 750,000 road traffic accidents in Great Britain each year. Routine eye-testing after each would represent an unnecessary and onerous extra burden on the police.</p>

APOS jointly advises the First Secretary of State and the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government on the maintenance and improvement of quality standards for the Planning Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/2">The panel's main finding was that the demanding quality standard target, that 99 per cent of the inspectorate's casework should be free from justified complaints, was being maintained. However, the panel also made a number of recommendations on steps that could be taken to further enhance quality standards. These included improvements to training and procedures, which have already been implemented, and the introduction of arrangements to correct simple errors within decision letters which is included in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill currently before Parliament. The remaining recommendations are all part of a continuous process of training, development and monitoring, such as the introduction of a rolling customer satisfaction survey, to build on the experiences of users of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.3/3">I am particularly pleased to note the panel's comments on the good work of the inspectorate in encouraging diversity within the organisation, in promoting training interchange schemes to develop staff and in encouraging electronic access to information for the public and other interested parties through its Planning Portal project. These initiatives are playing an important part in the Government's wider initiative to promote planning as a positive instrument and to involve the community more effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.8/2">A number of primary care trusts were also established during the year. Public dividend capital is not required for the establishment of new primary care trusts as they are subject to a different financial regime. Net assets transferred from dissolving NHS trusts to primary care trusts are reflected in the general fund of the primary care trust.</p>

	Non-producing Milk Quota Holders: ECJ Ruling

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-03-11a.182.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="182"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030311/text/30311w04.htm#30311w04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.182.3/1">The ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Thomsen case has important implications for UK dairy farmers. It means that quota holders who do not produce against their quota for one year will have it confiscated to the national reserve. In effect, non-producing milk quota holders (NPQHs) will no longer be able to hold quota. Leasing out of quota will not be enough to avoid confiscation.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.3/2">There has understandably been considerable interest in the timetable for implementation of the ruling in the UK. We can confirm that the new rules will apply from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. Accordingly NPQHs who have not produced against their quota in 2003&ndash;04 will be allowed until <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> to sell it. If they do not do so by that date, it will be confiscated to the national reserve. During the 2003&ndash;04 quota year NPQHs may lease out quota if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.3/3">Currently, NPQHs who lose their quota may apply for its restoration within six years of confiscation if they resume active production. However, under current EC proposals this period may be reduced to two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.3/4">In association with this, we shall be going out to consultation later in the year on the possible introduction of a 70 per cent usage rule. Under such a rule, producers who do not use at least 70 per cent of their quota over a period to be fixed would have all or part of the unused portion confiscated to the national reserve. The introduction of such a rule would depend on the outcome of the consultation exercise. Subject to final confirmation of the legal base, we also propose to consult on breaking the link between quota and land, which will make it easier for tenants to buy in their own right any quota released by NPQHs.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.3/5">We recognise that the change concerning NPQHs is an important one and have publicised the new rules widely, including sending individual letters to all NPQHs. We believe that we have put in place a fair transitional arrangement that both allows NPQHs a reasonable period of time to adjust to the new circumstances and also recognises the UK's obligations under Community law.</p>
