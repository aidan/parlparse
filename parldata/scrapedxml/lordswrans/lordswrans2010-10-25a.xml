	<p pid="a.220.2/1">The Government welcome the agreement on strengthening capital and liquidity standards reached on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-12">12 September</phrase> by governors and heads of supervision at the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BOBS). The agreement will be integral to ensuring financial stability going forward and significantly increases the quality and amount of capital banks will hold. In addition to this, a countercyclical capital buffer will be introduced to lean against excessive credit growth. For the first time, internationally agreed liquidity standards will also be introduced, as well as a leverage ratio.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/2">The supervision of individual institutions and system-wide regulatory requirements are determined by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), an independent body. Following the onset of the financial crisis the FSA implemented a supervisory framework, which already requires the largest deposit-taking institutions to hold significantly more and better capital than under Basel II. This has resulted in UK banks being among the best capitalised across the advanced economies. While implementation of the new Basel III measures will be phased in gradually, mitigating any risks posed to the economic recovery, banks will be required to increase further the quality and amount of capital held from <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-01">1 January 2013</phrase> and in every year thereafter, until full implementation of the majority of elements is achieved in January 2018.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/3">These measures will ensure that both individual banks and the wider financial system are significantly safer. More, and better-quality, capital will ensure that banks are able to survive losses and continue to lend to the real economy; enhanced liquidity in the financial system will protect banks from shocks in the funding markets; and the leverage ratio will prevent a system-wide build-up of excessive leverage, as was the situation in the lead-up to the crisis.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.3/2">The spending review published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October</phrase> set out spending plans for the four years up to 2014-15. It announced that child benefit will be withdrawn from families with a higher-rate taxpayer from January 2013, so that people on lower incomes are not subsidising those who are better off. The Government also announced they will preserve key benefits for older people, including winter fuel payments and free off-peak local bus travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/3">The Government will use some of the savings from withdrawing child benefit from families with a higher-rate taxpayer to fund significant above-indexation increases in the child tax credit. This is better targeted on low-income families, worth &#163;30 in 2011-12 and &#163;50 in 2012-13, and will ensure the spending review will have no measurable impact on child poverty in the next two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.0/1">Civil servants employed since <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-30">30 July 2007</phrase> are not currently covered by the Civil Service Compensation Scheme. However, if they are made redundant and have at least one year's service, they would, with Treasury approval, receive a special severance payment of one month's pay for each year of service. The Government have announced proposed reforms to the compensation scheme which will apply to all civil servants. Under these proposals civil servants who are made redundant will receive payments of one month's pay for each year of service. Payments will be capped at 12 months' pay in cases of compulsory redundancy and 21 months' pay for those leaving on a voluntary basis. We intend that these terms will supersede the current terms following the passing of interim legislation (Superannuation Bill). The Bill had its Third Reading in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-13">13 October</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.2/1">The Government place great importance on the vital role the Commonwealth and its Secretary-General play in promoting and protecting democratic values and fundamental human rights among its members. Ministers and officials regularly make this clear in their interactions with the Commonwealth Secretariat, including most recently when my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary met with Secretary General Sharma on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-25">25 August 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/2">To date the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), the body responsible for addressing serious and persistent violations of Commonwealth principles and values, has taken the lead in speaking out over human rights abuses by members. The Secretary-General has generally played a less visible but equally valuable role using his good offices to prevent abuses before they occur and by encouraging members to work with the Commonwealth to address human rights concerns where they arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/3">An 11-member eminent persons group, which includes my right honourable friend Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former Foreign Secretary, has been appointed to examine options for reform with a view to enabling the Commonwealth to achieve its full potential. Concurrently the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group is undertaking a review of its mandate and working methods. Both bodies will make recommendations to Commonwealth leaders at their next meeting in Perth, October 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/4">Thus far, CMAG has acted only when there has been an unconstitutional overthrow of a Government, but has not dealt with other serious or persistent violations of other declared core values of the Commonwealth. While the review remains a work in progress the Government support the view of eminent persons group member Sir Ronald Sanders, who has expressed a clear desire to see CMAG and the Secretary-General empowered to address the full range of violations of Commonwealth principles and values.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/5">The Government strongly support Commonwealth revitalisation. We hope these processes will result in a Commonwealth that is more effective in protecting democracy, including fundamental human rights, and focused on promoting greater prosperity through enhanced trade linkages.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not have automatic annual pay increments as part of its pay system. All pay awards in the FCO, both for staff in the Senior Civil Service (SCS) and below, are solely performance-related as measured by the annual appraisal process. For staff in the SCS, consolidated base pay has been frozen for 2010-11. For staff below the SCS, the FCO is in a three-year pay agreement which runs from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> and so does not enter the two-year public sector pay freeze until <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/2">All staff below the SCS are entitled to a salary increase with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>. The specific increases are variable based on their performance in the previous reporting cycle. Those whose level of performance is assessed as needing improvement will receive no award. The estimated increase in pay bill linked to these increases is &#163;3.6 million or 1.58 per cent of the pay bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.8/2">the Department for International Development (DfID) has recently discussed the legal system and remedies for domestic and personal violence with the State Government of Bihar, where high levels of violence against women have been reported; we are encouraged that the 2009 Right to Education Act came into effect in India in April 2010. DfID maintains a regular dialogue with the Government of India and the states on implementing the Right to Education Act of 2009. DfID is supporting the Act though a &#163;50 million contribution to India's flagship Education for All programme;DfID is helping to protect the health and personal security of millions of sex workers across India by supporting India's National AIDS Control Programme; andalthough we have not discussed police training in relation to human trafficking with the Government of India, we work closely with state governments on police training. For example, DfID is currently in discussion with the Government of Bihar regarding the inclusion of police reform activities under the Bihar Governance Project. The EU also funded a project from 2006-10 which focused on assisting children vulnerable to or survivors of trafficking and sexual exploitation in West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. In addition, through the EU, we continue to encourage India to ratify and implement the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its Protocol on People Trafficking.</p>

These reviews include an assessment of its contribution to poverty reduction via increased revenues from the extractive sector, which can be used by governments for public goods and services. The 2010 annual review found specific examples of increased revenues in Liberia and Nigeria. The UK and other supporting countries also called on the EITI to establish a stronger results framework in 2010. As a result an independent evaluation of the EITI's contribution to development in signatory countries has just begun and initial findings will be presented to the next EITI global conference in March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/2">DfID has provided over &#163;10 million to the EITI Secretariat and World Bank Multi-Donor Trust Fund which provide technical assistance to countries in meeting the requirement of the EITI.

The UK's support has contributed to publication of 50 EITI national reports and three countries reaching compliance status. Compliance of a further 14 countries will be assessed by the EITI board by the end of 2010.</p>

If the amendments enter EU law: a charging scheme would no longer need to include vehicles weighing between 3.5 and 12 tonnes; a time-based scheme would need to limit daily, weekly and monthly charges to specific percentages of the annual charge; a distance based charge could be set to cover the costs of air and noise pollution as well as infrastructure, and varied up and down from this level to reflect congestion in specific locations. Other EU countries have existing time and distance-based charging schemes, and it is not yet known how these schemes will change as a result of the amended directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.3/15">A number of factors will have led to the decrease in the number of visas issued for temporary employment during this period. These would include changes to the immigration system, such as the phased closure of the seasonal agricultural workers scheme and sectors based scheme to non-EU nationals between 2006 and 2008, the accession to the EU of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and the introduction of the points based-system in November 2008. The latter led to the recategorisation of some of the immigration categories. External factors such as the global economic downturn may also have led to a decrease in the number of temporary workers coming to the UK.</p>
