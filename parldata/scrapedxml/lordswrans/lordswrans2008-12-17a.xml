	<p pid="a.35.2/1">UK government financial assistance to Helmand, as with the rest of Afghanistan, comprises contributions from the Department for International Development (DfID), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Afghanistan Drugs Interdepartmental Unit (ADIDU), and the tri-departmental Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF). Helmand is a UK priority because success there is vital to Afghanistan's future. It is Afghanistan's largest province; its political influence within the Pashtun heartland is central to the future, either of a political settlement or of the insurgency, and it lies at the core of the narcotics trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/2">The reason for the increase in funding to Helmand in 2008-09 is the introduction of the SAF, which by design focuses primarily on stabilisation activities. Final decisions on the future split of resources between Helmand and the rest of Afghanistan have yet to be made, though we expect to maintain a similar balance.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.5/1">Provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) operate under International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) direction across Afghanistan, and are interim institutions designed to help extend the reach of the Afghan Government, improve security, and facilitate stabilisation and governance work. Most provinces in Afghanistan remain fragile. PRTs allow stabilisation and development work to take place where a lack of security prevents development agencies and the Government of Afghanistan from operating independently.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.5/2">In Helmand, the UK-led PRT is helping to focus civilian and military activity on supporting provincial governance and stabilising the principal population centres, which is a critical basis for longer-term development. The UK continues to discuss the role and future of PRTs regularly with the Afghan Government, ISAF, UNAMA, other donors, and civil society groups. Afghan government and UNAMA co-ordination on security, stabilisation and development issues has improved in recent months and this will help in setting exit strategies for PRTs, about which a public debate has not yet begun.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.5/1">The <I>Fairer Access to Care Services</I> (FACS) guidance sets out how councils should assess an individual's needs; they should assess the person's wider needs (including their potential needs), and make specialist assessments of particular needs, where required. The assessment should be rounded and person-centred to lead to appropriate eligibility decisions and services provided that promote independence. Professionals need to explore the intensity of particular needs and instability and predictability of problems from day to day or over longer periods of time. The FACS should be followed whether or not the person being assessed is likely to receive services provided by the local council or through direct payments. A copy of the guidance has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/2">It is important that the needs-led focus of assessment is retained. Those on direct payments are able to pay for services when they need them. The flexibility inherent in direct payments means that individuals can adjust the amount they use each week and &quot;bank&quot; any remaining funds until the extra needs arise. The local councils are also able to set up procedures for making additional payments in emergencies&mdash;for example, when symptoms are aggravated.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/3">The National Assistance Act 1948 sets out the framework within which local authorities may decide what people can afford to contribute. Capital assets and income have always been taken into account in making this assessment. Charging for non-residential social services is discretionary. It is for councils to decide on whether and how to set charges. The legal basis is that charges generally should be reasonable, and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can. The guidance aims to ensure in particular that service users on low incomes are protected from charging and that any charges levied on disability benefits are subject to an assessment of the costs to service users of coping with disability, to ensure their reasonableness.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.2/4">Any allegation of fraud or other financial abuse involving a charity is a matter of serious concern to the commission. An allegation of that nature will be given immediate attention and we will quickly assess what is the most appropriate action to take. That will depend on the facts of each case.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/5">This process will usually include us needing to validate and verify the reliability and credibility of the concerns, including the allegations and any evidence produced, along with the source of the concerns. We also consider previous commission involvement, and scrutinise information held by us. We liaise with other regulators, law enforcement and other agencies. I hope that I can reassure you by confirming that if it is clear straight away that there is cause to suspect a crime may have taken place, the commission would immediately contact the police. if further evidence emerges during our engagement with the charity, we would again not hesitate to contact the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/6">The commission has published a Risk and Proportionality Framework for our compliance work, which is publicly available on our website, <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk">www.charitycommission.gov.uk</a>, and explains the commission's approach and sets out the criteria it uses to decide whether to investigate a case further.

	<p pid="a.47.0/1">The national screening programme (NSP) for sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy produces peer-review reports following each external quality assurance visit. These make an assessment against the service objectives and quality assurance standards for the programme. The reports are shared with key stakeholders including local commissioners so that action can be taken to ensure that errors are dealt with competently and sensitively and professionals and organisations can make year-on-year improvements in service. The NSP is in regular contact with the national clinical director so that any appropriate action can be taken at national level to improve service.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/2">The NSP does not currently collect information on management of the patient's blood sugar and blood pressure by their general practitioner to include in the annual report. After a patient has been screened, a report is sent to the health professional managing the patient's diabetes care. Advice is given in information leaflets to both patients and to health professionals about the importance of managing blood sugar and blood pressure levels, and the quality and outcomes framework rewards general practitioners for measuring and improving these levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/2">The United States Government provide three-quarters of the money available, much of it on AIDS care and treatment.

	<p pid="a.53.0/1">There is consistent evidence of inequality in the mental health of black and minority-ethnic (BME) communities, especially in the incidence of severe mental illness. For example, the 2006 <I>Aetiology and Ethnicity in Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses </I>(AESOP)<I></I>study indicates that, compared with the white British population, people from African-Caribbean communities are nine times more likely to experience schizophrenia and eight times more likely to experience manic psychosis; people from black African communities are six times more likely to experience either condition; and other BME groups have more modestly increased rates. The AESOP findings apply across the adult age range and for both women and men. The rates of psychosis in Africa and the Caribbean are comparable to those in the United Kingdom overall. The reasons for this are still not fully understood, but this suggests that recognised risk factors for mental illness, including poor housing, unemployment, social exclusion and the experience of racism itself are still burdens borne disproportionately in the UK by BME populations and are contributing to an increased incidence of mental ill health.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">In 2005 the department launched Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care (DRE), a five-year action plan designed to improve BME communities' experience of mental health services, and to address the apparent inequalities in the incidence of severe mental illness between ethnic groups in England. There has been significant progress. For example, the DRE programme has helped to develop replicable good practice around tailored pathways of care for BME service users; new training in race equality for mental health staff has been tested successfully and made available nationally; pilot projects of the programme improving access to psychological therapies have demonstrated that BME communities can have equal access to, and equal outcomes from, the new services; and primary care trusts have so far recruited over 400 new community development workers, whose role is to build links between local BME communities and mental health services and to help communities play a part in planning and providing those services. We do, though, believe that the National Health Service still must do more to meet the needs of increasingly diverse local populations, particularly by delivering early and equitable access to effective community-based interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/3">These issues will stay a priority for services for the duration of the DRE programme and beyond. We do not believe that institutional racism is a helpful label to apply&mdash;the solutions lie in the hands of individuals, not just institutions. We have been open and honest about the problems in mental health care and how we intend to tackle them.</p>
