	<p pid="a.146.2/1">The Government are pleased to accounce new measures to support female victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/2">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum (NIA) Act 2002 introduced a new offence that commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase> of &quot;trafficking a person for the purpose of controlling him or her in prostitution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/3">From today, safe accommodation and a range of services will be provided to support female victims of human trafficking through a non-governmental organisation. A six-month pilot scheme located in London will cater for approximately 25 women, on a rolling basis, who meet the criteria for access to the services, including a willingness to come forward and co-operate with the authorities in the combating of international organised crime that could lead to prosecutions of criminals.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/4">We will consider, in light of individual circumstances, whether it would be appropriate to allow such victims who have co-operated to remain here. Where they are to return home, we will assist them to do so, providing them with initial counselling, ensuring that they have suitable accommodation to return to and providing help to enable them to reintegrate into their own community and find employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/5">We are also publishing a new best practice toolkit for the police, immigration officers and others who deal with illegal immigrants and trafficking victims. The toolkit will help them to identify victims and to provide practical advice on how to deal with them appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/6">The Sexual Offences Bill, introduced into the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-28">28 January 2003</phrase>, also proposes new comprehensive offences of trafficking for sexual exploitation to replace the stop-gap offence introduced by the NIA Act 2002 of trafficking in prostitution. These new offences tackle the movement of people into, within and out of the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation and will carry maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment. The offence relating to trafficking within the UK applies equally to UK nationals trafficked from place to place in the UK and to foreign nationals brought here and then moved around from place to place within the UK. This is the first time that the trafficking of UK nationals within the UK has been tackled in legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/7">Internationally, we are committed to addressing the issue of trafficking by our involvement with the EU framework decision on combating the trafficking of human beings and the UN protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking. We believe the trafficking provisions in this Bill meet the requirements of the EU decision and the UN protocol, and indeed go further in that they criminalise trafficking for a sexual offence per se, whereas the protocol specifies it ought to be criminal only in certain circumstances; for example, where force, coercion or abduction are involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/8">They also go further than the provisions in the NIA Act in specifying that it will be a criminal offence to traffic someone for the purposes of submitting them to a sex offence, rather than limiting this to trafficking them for the purposes of exploiting their prostitution. This allows us to offer greater protection against all forms of sexual trafficking; for example, for those who are trafficked in order to be sexually assaulted by others where there is no prostitution taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/9">In addition, the Bill introduces new offences to tackle directly the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The activities that the offences cover include buying the sexual services of a child, causing or encouraging a child into commercial sexual exploitation, facilitating the commercial sexual exploitation of a child and controlling the activities of a child involved in prostitution. The maximum penalties available for these offences will range from seven years to life imprisonment depending upon the nature of the offence committed and the age of the child victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/10">All these provisions together will set in place a comprehensive framework of robust legislation and improved support that will enable us both to bear down on perpetrators, often organised criminals, and provide a better response to victims.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.2/1">The Government unequivocally support the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. These are in no way diminished by the fact that when the courts make a decision adverse to a government department it is open to a Minister to say publicly that he does not accept the decision and intends to test it on appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/2">Ministers do not normally comment publicly on the decisions of the courts in cases in which they are not involved, but they may sometimes do so, if, for example, a particular decision leads Ministers to be of the opinon that the law has not been interpreted by the courts in accordance with Parliament's intentions and needs to be clarified or otherwise amended.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.0/1">Pesticide products such as slug pellets are assessed by the Pesticides Safety Directorate for their environmental effects. This includes the evaluation of their toxicity to birds and possible effects on reproduction. Products which are likely to cause a direct and unacceptable impact on the environment do not receive approval for sale or use.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/2">Data are regularly collated and reported on the use of molluscicides for agriculture and horticulture in the pesticide usage survey reports. Surveys are conducted on a rolling programme and not all crops are surveyed each year. These reports are available in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/3">The song thrush population has declined steeply within the past 25 years, occurring in both woodland and farmland, but that on farmland is substantially greater. The recent breeding bird survey and common bird census trends suggest that the decline has levelled off since the mid-1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/4">Evidence suggests that the decline may have been driven by lower survival rates of birds in their first year and/or by a decline in the number of breeding attempts that pairs are (on average) able to make in each season. This may be related to food availability both in the winter and in the breeding season. Decreasing song thrush abundance has been linked to agricultural intensification, but woodland-specific factors such as drainage and the depletion of the shrub layer may also be implicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/5">However, research shows that increasing pesticide use may reduce food availability and indirectly contribute to the decline in 20 species of song birds, including the song thrush. In areas of mixed farmland landscapes, woodland and grassland provide important foraging habitats. In arable landscapes where these habitats are scarce the birds used gardens and arable fields in the breeding season. Thus in landscapes dominated by arable farmland, reductions in invertebrate availability due to pesticide application (as well as other factors of intensification) may affect song thrushes.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-03-10a.153.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="153"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030310/text/30310w03.htm#30310w03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.153.6/1">Coal-fired power stations are currently regulated by the integrated pollution control (IPC) regime. IPC was established by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and regulates industrial pollution through a system of authorisation. IPC is being superseded by the integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) regime, established by an EC directive of the same name. Installations that came into operation before <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-31">31 October 1999</phrase> will be regulated by IPPC from 2006. New installations or those undergoing substantial change will be required to apply for an IPPC permit with immediate effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/2">IPC requires operators to demonstrate that they will use the best available techniques not entailing excessive cost (BATNEEC) for their activities. BATNEEC has to be applied to prevent or minimise the release of prescribed substances and to render harmless any such substances which are released to air, water and land. If releases are made to more than one environmental medium, the best practicable environmental option is applied. The regulator assesses BATNEEC on a site-by-site basis and keeps authorisations under review. Depending on the characteristics of the plant, BATNEEC may include the use of flue gas desulphurisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/3">In an IPPC permit application, operators are required to demonstrate that they will use the best available techniques (BAT) to control pollution from their activities. BAT aims to prevent, and where that is not practicable, to reduce to acceptable levels, emissions from the activities. BAT also aims to balance the cost to the operator against the benefits to the environment, and is assessed by the regulator on a site-by-site basis, taking into account European guidance on what constitutes BAT for that sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/4">The Government's policies for reducing air pollution were published in January 2000 in Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The strategy contains standards for eight main pollutants of concern, including sulphur dioxide, below which significant risks to public health are likely to occur. The air quality strategy sets target dates for the standards to be achieved. The latest data suggests the 2004 and 2005 targets will be met across most of the UK. The 2005 target for sulphur dioxide is the most stringent.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/5">The UK is a party to the Second Sulphur Protocol under the UN/ECE's Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, whereby SO2 emissions must be reduced by 50 per cent by 2000, 70 per cent by 2005 and 80 per cent by 2010 (all from a 1980 baseline). The UK is well on track to meet these targets, and by the end of 2000 had achieved a 76 per cent reduction from 1980 baseline levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/6">Within the EU, the National Emission Ceilings Directive sets emission ceilings for certain pollutants to be achieved by 2010, and the UK reduced its SO2 ceiling to 585ktonnes. The directive is part of the EU's Acidification Strategy, where one of the overall aims is to reduce by 50 per cent the areas of European ecosystems receiving excessive levels of acid pollution (exceeding their critical loads).</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/7">Emission limit values for pollutants likely to be emitted in significant quantities must be set in an IPC authorisation or IPPC permit and would reflect the requirements of these instruments.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.3/1">There are no plans at present to require joint inspections by Ofsted and the proposed new Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection. Plans for the new commission will be contained in a Bill to be placed before Parliament in due course. More broadly, the Government are encouraging all those in education, health and social services to work together to support improvements in the way children's special educational needs are identified and met.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/2">A national service framework for children is being developed to promote an integrated approach to supporting children with disabilities and SEN, ensuring that services are designed around the needs of individual children and their families. Children's trusts will pilot new models of local joined-up working in planning, commissioning and delivering services for children with SEN and disabilities, and the forthcoming Green Paper on Children and Young People at Risk will look across government to address a number of key issues concerning preventive strategies and early intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/3">In relation to early intervention, we are promoting more coherent practice in co-ordinating services for disabled children aged 0&ndash;3 and their families through the Together from the Start guidance for education, health and social services professionals and our Early Support pilot programme, which will test the principles of the guidance and related guidance on early intervention/support services for deaf children and their families in practice. The programme is currently supporting 27 individual projects involving a variety of agencies at both local and national level. We recently announced additional funding of &pound;12 million to extend the programme to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/4">We intend to publish later this year an SEN action programme setting out the Government's objectives and priorities for special educational needs.

	<p pid="a.158.8/1">The Vital Connection laid the foundations for mainstreaming equality, diversity and inclusiveness in every part of the National Health Service. This objective was reinforced by the NHS Plan, published in July 2000, which introduced the Improving Working Lives Standard. The standard makes it clear that every member of staff is entitled to work in an organisation which can prove it is improving diversity and tackling discrimination and harassment.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.8/2">All NHS employing organisations are required to demonstrate progress against the equality targets set in Vital Connection as part of the Improving Working Lives assessment and accreditation process. Most NHS employing organisations are required to be accredited as putting the Improving Working Lives Standard into practice by April 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.8/3">The Positively Diverse Programme, introduced in 2001, further supports NHS organisations to implement equality and diversity and the targets in Vital Connection. Some 147 NHS organisations are now using the Positively Diverse Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.8/4">The Human Resources Directorate is currently examining its equalities and diversity programmes, including the Improving Working Lives Standard and the Positively Diverse Programme as part of the department's continued efforts to strengthen the delivery of equality and diversity within the NHS.</p>

The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland with responsibillity for Transport, Angela Smith MP, intends to make a written statement on this matter in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.6/14">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-06">6 November 2002</phrase>, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Angela Smith MP launched the Northern Ireland Road Safety Strategy 2002&ndash;12. This document sets out the strategic objectives to improve road safety over the next decade. It seeks to promote an integrated partnership approach across the statutory road safety agencies and departments and throughout the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.6/15">From a general road safety perspective, the strategy makes clear the Government's commitment to improving road safety for everyone throughout Northern Ireland. It contains 161 actions focused on the main causes of deaths and serious injuries and aims at a one-third reduction (from the average for the period 1996&ndash;2000) in the number of people killed or seriously injured on Northern Ireland's roads by 2012 and within that overall target, a 50 per cent reduction in the numbers of children killed or seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.6/16">Some of the action measures to achieve the strategic objectives are already in place, others are scheduled to be in place within the next three years and further action measures will be introduced over the following four to 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.6/17">Copies of the Northern Ireland Road Safety Strategy 2002&ndash;12 have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
