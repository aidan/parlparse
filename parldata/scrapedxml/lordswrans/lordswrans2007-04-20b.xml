	<p pid="b.93.2/1">The training budget for the Bowman Combat Infrastructure Platform is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Bowman contract was awarded to General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd on a firm-price basis for the complete system, including initial conversion training, following a competitive tendering exercise. There was no requirement to provide discrete firm prices for the various elements of the Bowman Combat Infrastructure Platform (BCIP) programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/2">BCIP continuation training will be delivered using existing military training establishments and schools, as well as new generic training facilities. Training for the less specialist courses at all levels has been absorbed into existing course syllabi by the appropriate arms and service directors. Consequently, the department is unable to break out specific BCIP training costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/3">Training for capability additions will be an ongoing requirement throughout the in-service life of Bowman. For the next capability addition, BCIP5, General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd is contracted to develop the additional training material.</p>

It is also possible that, where a bailiff repeatedly charges for work that has not been done, this conduct will amount to fraudulent trading either under Section 9 of the 2006 Act or under the provisions on fraudulent trading in company legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.95.5/1">The basic rule regarding the powers of entry for bailiffs is that there is a right of entry that may be exercised into any relevant premises. In circumstances where a bailiff illegally obtains entry to a debtor's premises, their conduct will amount to fraud only if they dishonestly, and with the intent to make a gain or to cause a loss, make a false representation, fail to disclose information or abuse their position. While an illegal entry may be made with the intention of making a gain or causing a loss, it may well not involve the other elements necessary to commit a fraud.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.5/1">The Government do not intend to make Holocaust denial a criminal offence in the United Kingdom. The Government deplore attempts to deny the Holocaust, including those views expressed in a pseudo-intellectual manner. We understand why some European countries, because of their particular histories, have expressly legislated against Holocaust denial, but successive Governments have taken the view that criminalising Holocaust denial in the UK would represent an unnecessary infringement of freedom of expression. It is of course the case that, if Holocaust denial is expressed in a way that is threatening, abusive, or insulting and incites racial hatred, or is likely to do so, then that would be unlawful under the Public Order Act 1986.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.6/1">The current delivery arrangements for passports do not require that the passport be handed to the addressee. Most first-time deliveries are made without a signature being obtained, but where one is required it does not need to be that of the addressee.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.6/2">Signatures are required for deliveries to certain postcodes where there is a known risk of loss or fraud. In other areas couriers will usually try to obtain a signature if someone is at home, but this is not mandatory. Where there are concerns on the part of the courier as to the security of the delivery due to, for example, a communal letterbox, then a signature is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.6/3">Evidence of identity is required for a redelivery. While the addressee is not required to be present, the recipient of the package needs to provide evidence of the addressee's residence at the address, such as a utility bill or driving licence. Signatures are always required for redeliveries.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.6/4">In delivering passports, the Identity and Passport Service attempts to balance the requirements for high levels of security, affordability/value for money and customer service. The current arrangements strike a balance between these demands and have seen an 80 per cent reduction in passport losses in the delivery process compared to the previous arrangements, which utilised first-class mail. The IPS continues to work closely with SMS to further reduce losses and improve quality of service.</p>

More specific data are not kept by Werrington on how much outdoor exercise each young person receives daily. However, there is a gym and an extensive sports field that are used by the trainees mainly at weekends and on a seasonal basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.2/1">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) published its youth resettlement framework for action in 2006. The framework focuses on developing the key resettlement pathways including health, education, training and employment and substance misuse. The YJB has rolled out resettlement and aftercare provision schemes (RAPS) in over 50 youth offending team (YOT) areas, providing planned resettlement activities for young offenders in custody and in the community. The YJB also published its accommodation strategy in November 2006. Critically, the strategy looks to ensure that young offenders have adequate access to accommodation services by improving the organisation of YOTs. The strategy has supported work to phase out the provision of unsupported bed and breakfast accommodation for 16 and 17 year-olds. It also makes the prevention of family breakdown and homelessness a key priority for the youth justice system.</p>
