	<p pid="a.1.1/2" qnum="HL3477">What support they have given to the Fairtrade Foundation, financially and in other ways, during the last two years; and what support they are giving in the current year, including the promotion of fair trade goods at local and central government level.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.2/1">The Department for International Development has supported fair trade initiatives for a number of years, both in developing countries and in the UK. This support forms part of a wider collaboration between government, the private sector and civil society to encourage more socially responsible and ethical business practices. As companies and consumers become more aware of the connections between the way business is done and the livelihoods of poor people in developing countries, so the pressure for positive change grows.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">To this end, DfID has provided &pound;169,000 from 1999&ndash;2002 in support of media work by the Fairtrade Foundation and an additional &pound;120,000 from 2001&ndash;2003 to support the foundation's efforts to reach new consumers through its annual Fairtrade Fortnight campaign. This year's campaign, just completed, highlighted the positive developmental impacts of fair trade, raising the profile of products now on offer in UK shops and supermarkets. Hilary Benn, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development, delivered a speech at the launch on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-04">4 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">In June 2001, DfID approved a further grant (&pound;150,000 over two years) to the Fairtrade Foundation to support an innovative project in East Africa to increase regional producers' involvement in international fair trade labelling. It established an East African regulatory body that offers consulting services, inspection and monitoring of fair trade standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">Several government departments are developing policies to procure fair trade goods, although the relative lack of product lines means that this cannot yet form a substantial part of overall procurement practice. 1st jenny</p>

	<p pid="a.2.0/1">The requirement for training of magistrates rests with magistrates' courts committees, under guidance issued by the Judicial Studies Board. The Judicial Studies Board has issued training material relating to anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) (Crime and Disorder Act 1998&mdash;training material for Sections 1 and 4; anti-social behaviour orders&mdash;April 1999 and revised April 2001) based on Home Office guidance on anti-social behaviour orders issued in 1999. This material reflects the seriousness of breach of an ASBO.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.0/2">The maximum penalty for conviction on indictment for a breach is five years' imprisonment or a fine; but it is for the courts to determine what sentences for breaches of ASBOs are appropriate in individual cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.3/1">The police do not record the number of incidents involving nuisance caused by young people. The British Crime Survey, however, reports on how much of a problem people perceive various forms of disorder to be in their local area. &quot;Teenagers hanging around on the streets&quot; was recorded as a &quot;very&quot; or &quot;fairly&quot; big problem for 20 per cent in 1992, with the trend generally upwards to 32 per cent in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/2">Police forces are required by the Crime and Disorder Act to join local authority representatives and others in crime and disorder partnerships, which can play a significant part in tackling anti-social behaviour. Partnerships have been asked to identify an anti-social behaviour co-ordinator to ensure that nuisance caused by young people and others is given sufficient attention, not only by the police but also by other key partners in the local area. 1st jenny</p>

The Council decided to defer consideration of additional targeted measures against the Government of Zimbabwe until its next meeting in May.

It knows of no cases where depleted uranium (DU) has been used in fireworks, whether they have been manufactured in the UK or imported from elsewhere. The primary function of DU in an explosives context is its use in munitions designed to penetrate armour plate. HSE is not aware of any valid contribution that the material would make to a pyrotechnic composition and in its view the cost of using it would be prohibitive.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.2/1">The maize being grown in the genetically modified crop farm-scale evaluations is a type of GM herbicide tolerant maize produced by Aventis CropScience GmbH (formerly AgrEvo) that is known by its code number T25. The maize is tolerant to the widely used herbicide glufosinate ammonium; this has been achieved by the insertion of a gene that makes the enzyme phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT). PAT inactivates glufosinate inside the plant rendering it non-toxic. This is quite different from so-called Bt maize which is maize genetically modified to express an insect control protein derived from the common soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Expression of the protein throughout the plant provides control of the insect pest, the European corn borer, and certain other lepidopteran insect pests to which the protein is toxic.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/2">The farm scale evaluations only involve GM herbicide tolerant oil seed rape (both spring and winter sown), maize and beet. In 1998 these three types of GM crop were on the verge of entering commercial agriculture in the UK when real concerns were raised about the impact the management of these crops with their specific herbicides would have on the agricultural environment. The Government, through a voluntary agreement with industry, have halted their commercial introduction and that of other GM crops until the evaluations are completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/3">Bt maize was not included in the evaluations because there was and continues to be no proposal to grow it in the United Kingdom. Unlike other parts of the European Union, the corn borer is not a pest in the UK. In addition, the current methodology of the farm-scale evaluations would be inappropriate because the same herbicide management regime would apply to both Bt maize and non-GM maize. If there were a proposal to grow Bt maize here we would need to be satisfied that the potential impact of its insect resistant properties and the overall management regime for the crop did not result in unacceptable environmental effects.

A number of trades have already taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/2">A total of 34 organisations successfully joined the scheme through a competitive auction held in March. In return for taking on legally binding emissions reduction targets, these organisations will each receive a share of the financial incentive that the Government are making available over the five years of the scheme. They can choose to meet their annual targets by reducing emissions themselves or by buying surplus allowances from other participating organisations. To date, over 50 other organisations have opened trading accounts so that they can buy and sell allowances.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/3">We expect the volume of trades and number of participants to increase in the autumn and beyond when participation in the scheme widens as some of the 6,000 companies in climate change agreements begin buying allowances to enable them to meet their targets or selling any over-achievement to other participants. Projects that produce quantified reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will also be able, in time and subject to prior approval from the Government, to earn credits that can then be traded through the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.6/1">The case of Ms B has highlighted again the fundamental importance of the principle of valid consent in treatment decisions and of the need for trusts and practitioners to be aware of the relevant law. To this end, we issued in March 2001 the Reference Guide to Consent for Examination or Treatment, together with 12 key points on consent: the law in England, which was sent to all health professionals in England. In October last year we issued model consent to treatment forms for implementation in April 2002 and a model consent policy which all National Health Service trusts should implement by October 2002.</p>
