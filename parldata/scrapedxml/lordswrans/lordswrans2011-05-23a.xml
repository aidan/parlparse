	<p pid="a.367.2/1">The Government do not hold records of actual exports. As previously advised, the Government hold information about export licences issued, refused or revoked and information about what these licences cover, including a summary of the items, overall value and type (eg military, other), are published in the annual and quarterly reports on strategic export controls. As an export licence is required to export arms and other military equipment from the United Kingdom, details about what items were licensed for export to Indonesia will be contained within these reports. However, the fact that a licence has been issued does not mean that an export has necessarily taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.2/2">All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria taking account of all prevailing circumstances at the time of application. A licence will not be issued where to do so would be inconsistent with the criteria or other relevant announced commitments. In particular, criterion 2 concerns the &quot;respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country of final destination&quot;, and states that the Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. If the situation in the country changes or new information comes to light that causes us to have concerns, we can and do revoke export licences where we consider that the proposed export would, in light of the changing situation, contravene the criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.370.0/1">From 1989 the Burmese military regime concluded 17 ceasefire agreements with major ethnic groups. However, tensions began to heighten from 2009 as the Burmese authorities sought to subsume armed groups into a national border guard force as part of their pre-election preparations. Major armed groups resisted the border guard force proposal in order to protect their local autonomy. The Government have received reports that the Burmese military subsequently responded by closing all communication channels to the armed groups and claiming that the ceasefire agreements no longer existed. Tensions in these areas have recently escalated leading to renewed conflict. We have also heard reports of increased military movements against the Wa and Mon-two of the largest groups. We are very concerned about the likely humanitarian consequences of any escalations in fighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/2">The British ambassador raised concerns with the Burmese Government about the situation when he met Burmese Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-10">10 May</phrase>. At a UN Security Council debate the same day, we called for all armed groups to protect civilian populations and to bring to account those responsible for human right abuses.

	<p pid="a.373.9/1">The UK is currently experiencing an intense dry spell which has led to low river levels and dry soils that are more normally seen in June. Low river levels are starting to put pressure on river environments and are beginning to impact on farmers who rely on water to irrigate their crops.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.9/2">It is important that we are as prepared as possible for a potential drought and the further impacts it would have. The Secretary of State met representatives of sectors impacted by the dry weather and relevant regulators on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-16">Monday 16 May 2011</phrase> to ensure that agencies and organisations are working together to anticipate and manage any problems that may arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.9/3">The Environment Agency has been asked to report to the Secretary of State on the likelihood of a drought in the longer term, and how it might affect farmers, the food industry and consumers. Natural England will work with conservation groups to reduce the impact of dry weather on wildlife and will also report back to the Secretary of State on its plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.9/4">Water companies are monitoring the situation and a minority anticipate they may need to impose restrictions if the dry weather continues. Overall the industry is resilient and confident of maintaining supplies. Together with the Environment Agency, water companies will provide an update on public water supplies and they are currently reviewing their drought plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.9/5">Defra and the Environment Agency will also meet with those sectors that abstract their water from rivers to identify steps that can be taken to make that water go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.9/6">We cannot control the weather, but it is important that we all work together to manage the impacts. The dry weather is a reminder that water is a limited resource-some parts of England have less water per person than many hotter and drier countries. By using our water wisely not only can we save money on energy and water bills, but also we can help to ensure we have sufficient supplies for essential domestic and industrial purposes, while minimising the impact on the natural environment.</p>

The bulk of payments available to Work Programme providers are for helping people stay in work in the long term. For example, providers can claim payments for customers moving from incapacity benefits to employment and support allowance for over two years after job entry. This is a strong incentive both to continue supporting customers with health conditions and their employers, and to find jobs that are appropriate for the individual in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/4">Jobcentre Plus is putting in place a much more flexible, personalised approach to helping people back into work, including:</p>

The volume of humanitarian assistance we provide is based on up-to-date assessments of humanitarian needs.

If we achieve this, the level of our humanitarian assistance would decline gradually to around &#163;6 million or 7 per cent of our total aid to southern Sudan by 2015, allowing more spend on basic services, safety, and justice.</p>

With these sanctions the EU is sending a clear message that we will act against those who brutalise peaceful protestors and seek to repress their legitimate aspirations for reform. If the violence does not stop and all political prisoners are released, we will take further measures including sanctions targeted at the highest levels of the Syrian leadership. The UK actively supported the resolution in the special session of the Human Rights Council passed by a clear majority of Human Rights Council members condemning Syria's conduct and launching a fact-finding mission to investigate human rights abuses. And in New York we have begun discussions with our partners at the UN to seek UN condemnation of the situation in Syria.</p>

This is a three-year programme which aims to address a broad range of key training needs already acknowledged in the UK wine sector, in addition to any further skills gaps identified as part of the scoping study. Places are heavily subsidised and training is delivered both at Plumpton and other locations throughout the UK so as to facilitate producer participation; andthe United Kingdom Vineyards Association (UKVA) recently secured funding to conduct a comprehensive sustainability benchmarking study of UK vineyards and wine producers.
