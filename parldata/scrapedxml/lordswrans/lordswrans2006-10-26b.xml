	<p pid="b.257.23/1">There are currently more than 50 community rail partnerships in England and Wales. A wide range of initiatives has been taken on the lines which they support, ranging from new uses for station buildings to improved fare and ticketing structures. Schemes currently under consideration on community rail lines include a passing loop to enable an improved pattern of services on the Abbey Line and the use of station buildings at Sandown on the Island Line for community services. A prime aim of the community rail strategy is to reduce the need for financial support from central government. For that reason, individual developments do not generally depend on specific government funding. Most are self-financing, locally funded or funded through mechanisms such as the local transport plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.257.50/1">An as yet unpublished study, which has just been completed on behalf of Defra, estimates textile waste in the UK at 1.1 million tonnes in 2003. This has increased and is thought to be increasing further as sales of new clothing rise. An additional estimated 303,000 tonnes of textiles were collected by the secondary textiles industry (including charity shops) for reuse and recycling. Of this, an estimated 262,000 tonnes (14 per cent) of consumption were diverted from the UK waste stream in 2003. As part of its ongoing work on the review of the waste strategy, Defra is considering how to increase this figure.</p>
