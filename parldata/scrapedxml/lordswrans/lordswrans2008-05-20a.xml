In this way potential legal obligations can be taken into account in the conception of new products and services.</p>

With regard to TSE infectivity in the environment, recent studies have suggested TSE-associated prion protein adheres to soil minerals and remains infectious, even after a number of years. Defra-funded scientific research investigating the persistence of TSE infectivity in the environment is ongoing and details can be found on the Defra website.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.3/1">Subject to their legal duties, including the duty of best value and public procurement law, local authorities are responsible for taking their own procurement decisions. The DCMS has not issued guidance to local authorities which opt to use a leisure trust model for the management of local leisure facilities. However, every local authority is under a statutory duty to establish an adequate and effective system of financial management and arrangements for the management of risk. The authority's chief finance officer also has duties to report to the council on proposed decisions or actions that would be unlawful or likely to cause a loss.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.3/2">The duty of best value, as laid down in legislation, requires authorities to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which they exercise their functions, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It is for them to decide, in the first place, whether the duty of best value can only be met by conducting a tendering exercise. Following the recent consultation exercise, current best-value guidance set out in ODPM Circular 03/2003 will be replaced by the new <I>Creating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communities</I> guidance. The draft consultation guidance made clear that local authorities should adopt practices that are fair and open&mdash;that is, neutral between different types of providers&mdash;and should ensure that any procurement decision, including retaining services in-house, is undertaken and justified in an open and transparent way. Any specific complaints that best value is not being met in a particular set of circumstances would need to be addressed in the first instance to the authority's external auditor.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.2/1">(a) This statement provides information about the Secretary of State for Transport's planned approach to exercising her existing powers under franchise agreements. The Department for Transport did not seek the views of any organisation on this contractual matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/2">(b) The administration fee (which is separate from the facilitation fee) will represent the costs of processing the application for consent to the change of control. This will vary from case to case.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/3">(c) Under the franchise agreements between the Secretary of State and train operating companies, the Secretary of State's power to grant or refuse permission for a change of control is essentially unfettered. Therefore, as a matter of private law rights and by reason of the statutory duties imposed on the Secretary of State, including the duty to promote improvements in railway service performance, the Secretary of State, acting in the public interest, is entitled to require a payment in return for her consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/4">(d) The purpose of the facilitation fee is to allow the public to benefit from a change of control. The value of franchises is often a product of substantial public subsidy or investment. It is therefore reasonable that the Secretary of State should have the opportunity to ensure that passengers and the public purse receive some benefit when franchises change hands.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.0/1">The removal of the 10p tax rate was part of a package of reforms announced in Budget 2007. The exact effect of the reforms will depend both on individual incomes, and on the circumstances of the household in which people live&mdash;for example, whether they have children, and their age.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/2">In 2008-09 all 31 million taxpayers are affected by the removal of the 10p rate of income tax. Some 28 million of these taxpayers stand to gain from the cut in the basic rate of income tax to 20p.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/3">The Chancellor announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-13">13 May</phrase> an increase in the individual personal tax allowance by &pound;600 to &pound;6,035 for this financial year, benefiting all basic-rate taxpayers under 65 and removing 600,000 low-income individuals from tax. Around 22 million basic-rate taxpayers will gain an additional &pound;120 this year, fully compensating 80 per cent of households that lose from the Budget 2007 reforms, with the remainder seeing their loss at least halved.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/4">The Government will set out their plans for future years in the 2008 Pre-Budget Report.</p>
