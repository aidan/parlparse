The fifth annual SHOT report (published April 2002) showed an increase in participation to 92 per cent of eligible hospitals. Participation in the scheme has been encouraged by guidance to the National Health Service, most recently in HSC 2002/009&mdash;Better Blood Transfusion&mdash;Appropriate use of blood (<a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/bbt2/009hsc2002">http://www.doh.gov.uk/bbt2/009hsc2002</a>).
