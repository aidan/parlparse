The information gathered is used to support the efforts of the Afghan authorities in frustrating the drug trade. The annual United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime opium survey also contains information on trafficking. Traffickers have been known to use a range of different methods, primarily those raised in the noble Lord's Question, to transport opium and related products from poppy fields. The methods vary within and between provinces.</p>
