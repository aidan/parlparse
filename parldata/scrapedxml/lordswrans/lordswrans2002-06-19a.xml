	<p pid="a.85.5/1">Good progess is being made with the Watchkeeper project. Proposals from potential contractors for detailed assessment phase work were received in May and are being assessed. The Watchkeeper system, comprising unmanned aerial vehicles, their sensor packages and associated exploitation facilities on the ground is a new capability. It will meet a significant proportion of the intelligence and information requirements, principally of land commanders, by providing accurate, timely and high quality imagery and intelligence information in all weathers, day and night. It will be complemented by other programmes and existing capabilities. The in-service date for Watchkeeper will be finalised as part of the current assessment work but the working assumption is for an initial operating capability in 2007. The project is on schedule to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/1">I have today published the first stage report of the joint quinquennial review of the Museum of London, the Horniman Museum and the Geffrye Museum. The report examines the roles and functions of the museums and how these functions contribute to the delivery of wider DCMS and governmental objectives. It confirms that the three museums are contributing strongly to the delivery of the Government's educational and social policy objectives. All three museums have potential to perform a regional or sub-regional role.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">The publication of the report marks the end of the first stage of the review. The second stage will take forward the recommendations of the first stage and consider how the museums' services and functions could be provided more efficiently and effectively in the future.</p>
