	<p pid="a.148.5/1">In his Written Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-22">22 July 2010</phrase>, the Secretary of State for International Development set out four conditions for the approval of the airport on St Helena. Good progress is being made in addressing these conditions. My right honourable friend will make a further announcement once we are satisfied that the conditions can be met.</p>
