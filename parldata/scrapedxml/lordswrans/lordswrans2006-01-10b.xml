	<p pid="b.32.5/1">During the recruit selection process the staffs at the Armed Forces Careers Offices (AFCO) provide comprehensive written and verbal guidance to all potential recruits, in particular those under 18 years of age and their parents, regarding their terms of service and rights to discharge. Parents/guardians of applicants aged under 18 are required to complete a formal written consent form which has to be witnessed by someone of standing in the community, before the applicant can enter service. In addition:</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/2">After arrival at HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot; each naval recruit is again briefed on the terms of the engagement and conditions of service. They are also required to make a declaration that they understand that they have the right to claim discharge, giving 14 days' notice, during the first six months of service, before being asked to enlist by signing the engagement form.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/3">The Army is currently in the process of producing a publication aimed at parents/guardians which aims to answer concerns in relation to their child joining the Army. The publication is due to be available by the end of March 2006. Also, job profiles given to new recruits explain the nature of their employment group in operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/4">Twice during the enquiry/application process, RAF applicants receive a RAF form which sets out the terms and conditions of enlistment, their right to terminate their service and a statement that they may be required to serve worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/5">The Tri-Service AFCO Form 5, <i>Application Form Information and Guidance Booklet</i>, outlines the Armed Forces attitude towards bullying and harassment and the areas in which the service way of life differs from that of civilian society. These messages are reinforced during Armed Forces recruiting presentations which are open to applicants and their parents/guardians.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.0/1">Further to my reply of <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase>, in which I listed the judgments against the United Kingdom being supervised at that time by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe pursuant to Article 46(2) ECHR (as listed by the Council of Europe Secretariat), I am pleased to provide to the noble Lord detailed information on each judgment still under supervision, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/2" class="italic">Steel and Morris (Application no. 68416/01)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/3">The Government have submitted information to the Committee of Ministers explaining how the Access to Justice Act 1999 provides a discretion to provide legal aid in defamation proceedings; and how existing provisions in the law are sufficient to enable the courts, in assessing general damages for defamation, to ensure account is taken of the defendant's means and the proportionality of the award. The information provided is under review. The Government will provide further information relating to the situation in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/4" class="italic">Bubbins (Application no. 50196/99)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/5">The Government have submitted information to the Committee of Ministers regarding implementation of the judgment. The court's judgment referred to a lack of provision in law, in the particular circumstances of the application, for the judicial determination of the civil liability in damages, if any, of the police. Since the application, the Human Rights Act 1998 has entered into force. A person in the situation of the applicant could bring a claim against the police under Section 7 of the Act in respect of allegations of a breach of Article 2 of the convention. Such proceedings would provide a forum in which a claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damages in respect of any civil liability of the police could be assessed. Information on that remedy will be communicated to the Committee of Ministers for assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/6" class="italic">Lloyd (Application no. 29798/96) and Beet (Application no. 47675/99)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/7">The Government have paid the sum awarded as just satisfaction and have submitted the acknowledgement of receipt from the applicant's solicitors to the Committee of Ministers in the Lloyd case. In the Beet case, the Government have paid the sum awarded as just satisfaction and are awaiting an acknowledgement of receipt from the applicant's solicitors, which will be submitted to the Committee of Ministers. All necessary general measures have been taken in the context of earlier cases. Information on the publication and dissemination of the judgment has, however, been requested and will be communicated to the committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/8" class="italic">Crowther (Application no. 53741/00)</p>
