	<p pid="b.32.5/1">During the recruit selection process the staffs at the Armed Forces Careers Offices (AFCO) provide comprehensive written and verbal guidance to all potential recruits, in particular those under 18 years of age and their parents, regarding their terms of service and rights to discharge. Parents/guardians of applicants aged under 18 are required to complete a formal written consent form which has to be witnessed by someone of standing in the community, before the applicant can enter service. In addition:</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/2">After arrival at HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot; each naval recruit is again briefed on the terms of the engagement and conditions of service. They are also required to make a declaration that they understand that they have the right to claim discharge, giving 14 days' notice, during the first six months of service, before being asked to enlist by signing the engagement form.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/3">The Army is currently in the process of producing a publication aimed at parents/guardians which aims to answer concerns in relation to their child joining the Army. The publication is due to be available by the end of March 2006. Also, job profiles given to new recruits explain the nature of their employment group in operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/4">Twice during the enquiry/application process, RAF applicants receive a RAF form which sets out the terms and conditions of enlistment, their right to terminate their service and a statement that they may be required to serve worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.5/5">The Tri-Service AFCO Form 5, <i>Application Form Information and Guidance Booklet</i>, outlines the Armed Forces attitude towards bullying and harassment and the areas in which the service way of life differs from that of civilian society. These messages are reinforced during Armed Forces recruiting presentations which are open to applicants and their parents/guardians.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.0/1">Further to my reply of <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase>, in which I listed the judgments against the United Kingdom being supervised at that time by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe pursuant to Article 46(2) ECHR (as listed by the Council of Europe Secretariat), I am pleased to provide to the noble Lord detailed information on each judgment still under supervision, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/2" class="italic">Steel and Morris (Application no. 68416/01)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/3">The Government have submitted information to the Committee of Ministers explaining how the Access to Justice Act 1999 provides a discretion to provide legal aid in defamation proceedings; and how existing provisions in the law are sufficient to enable the courts, in assessing general damages for defamation, to ensure account is taken of the defendant's means and the proportionality of the award. The information provided is under review. The Government will provide further information relating to the situation in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/4" class="italic">Bubbins (Application no. 50196/99)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/5">The Government have submitted information to the Committee of Ministers regarding implementation of the judgment. The court's judgment referred to a lack of provision in law, in the particular circumstances of the application, for the judicial determination of the civil liability in damages, if any, of the police. Since the application, the Human Rights Act 1998 has entered into force. A person in the situation of the applicant could bring a claim against the police under Section 7 of the Act in respect of allegations of a breach of Article 2 of the convention. Such proceedings would provide a forum in which a claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damages in respect of any civil liability of the police could be assessed. Information on that remedy will be communicated to the Committee of Ministers for assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/6" class="italic">Lloyd (Application no. 29798/96) and Beet (Application no. 47675/99)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/7">The Government have paid the sum awarded as just satisfaction and have submitted the acknowledgement of receipt from the applicant's solicitors to the Committee of Ministers in the Lloyd case. In the Beet case, the Government have paid the sum awarded as just satisfaction and are awaiting an acknowledgement of receipt from the applicant's solicitors, which will be submitted to the Committee of Ministers. All necessary general measures have been taken in the context of earlier cases. Information on the publication and dissemination of the judgment has, however, been requested and will be communicated to the committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/8" class="italic">Crowther (Application no. 53741/00)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/9">The Government have submitted information to the Committee of Ministers on measures that have been introduced to improve the enforcement of confiscation orders since the judgment in October 1998, including: formation of the Concerted Inter-Agency Criminal Finance Action Group in June 2002; establishment of the Joint Asset Recovery Database in April 2004; incentivisation through distributing a proportion of criminal assets recovered to the police since April 2004; publication of the <i>National Best Practice Guide to Confiscation Order Enforcement</i> in August 2003; establishment of an enforcement task force; and establishment of an independent Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office in April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/10" class="italic">Whitfield and Others (Application no. 46387/99)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/11">The Government are following up on issues on payment of just satisfaction. The law on prison discipline has already been changed as a result of the judgment in the prior case of Ezeh &amp; Connors.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/12" class="italic">Blackstock (Application no. 59512/00)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/13">The Government have paid the sum awarded as just satisfaction and have submitted the acknowledgement of receipt from the applicant's solicitors to the Committee of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/14" class="italic">Kolanis (Application no. 517/02)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/15">Judgment became final on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-21">21 September 2005</phrase>. The Government have now paid the just satisfaction awarded by the court. The domestic courts have already given guidance as to how effect should be given to legislation to avoid breaches in future. The Government will be submitting further information in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/16" class="italic">Hirst (Application no. 74025/01)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/17">The Government are considering what general measures, both in terms of possible legislation and practice, are needed to implement this recent judgment on the voting rights of prisoners. Proposals will be brought forward in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/18" class="italic">Glass (Application no. 61827/00)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/19">The Government have submitted information to the Committee of Ministers concerning payment of the sums awarded by the court. The Government have also submitted information to the committee concerning the Department of Health's proposed review of the consent reference guidance and will follow up further requests in this respect.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.0/25">The Government are following up issues on the payment of just satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/26" class="italic">A (Application no. 25599/94)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/27">Since the judgment the Human Rights Act 1998 has entered into force. Domestic case law makes it clear that the &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; defence now has to be implemented in the light of ECHR standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/28">Section 58 of the Children Act 2004 has now also entered into force, which abolishes the defence in England and Wales in relation to all charges apart from common (minor) assault. The Committee of Ministers has now accepted that the law in England and Wales appears to be compliant with the convention; however, the issue of ensuring effective deterrence is still under review. Similar provisions are to be put in place in Northern Ireland at the earliest legislative opportunity. The law in Scotland, which was changed by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003, remains under review by the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/29" class="italic">Keenan (Application no. 27229/95)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/30">The Prison Discipline Manual has been revised to reflect changes introduced with respect to segregation policy in prisons.

	<p pid="b.35.0/32">The Government have been working closely with the Council of Europe Secretariat in elaborating a comprehensive package of measures aimed at addressing the shortcomings referred to in these judgments.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/33">Five sections of the general measures required to comply with the judgments have now been closed by the Committee of Ministers. Further information is being provided, including on changes to the coroners system, and it is hoped that a number of further sections can be closed shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/34">Further information will be provided to the committee on the personal situation of the applicants.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/35" class="italic">Stafford (Application no. 46295/99), Wynne (Application no. 67385/01), Von Bulow (Application no. 75362/01), and Hill (Application no. 19365/02)</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/36">Legislative changes have been made through Part 12, Chapter 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and Schedules 21 and 22 to that Act, on the powers of the parole board to rule on the release of all mandatory life sentence prisoners.

This information is under review by the Committee of Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.0/40">Under the Employment Relations Act 2004, Part 3 workers now have a right not to have an offer made to them for the sole or main purpose of inducing them to renounce union membership or activities.

	<p pid="b.35.0/58">The Government have submitted information to the Committee of Ministers about a consultation process begun in March 2005 that sought views on the approach to be taken to implement this judgment in England and Wales. It commits the Government to introducing additional procedural safeguards for incapacitated patients of unsound mind who are not subject to mental health legislation but whose treatment nonetheless involves a deprivation of liberty. The Government intend to publish policy proposals in light of this consultation with a view to introducing the necessary legislation for England and Wales at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.0/62">The one remaining point is that statutory amendments made to the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 will be commenced on completion of the current review of police and criminal evidence legislation and codes of practice in Northern Ireland. This review is expected to be completed in summer 2006. Administrative guidance issued to the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland and by the Attorney-General to prosecutors will continue to apply until the review has been completed, and will ensure that practice is consistent and already complies with the convention across the UK.</p>

Procedures are ongoing for the enactment of a statutory scheme for civil legal aid as envisaged under this friendly settlement. It is hoped that this can be put in place in due course. In the mean time, the extra-statutory procedures ensure that the Government's obligations under the ECHR are already being met.</p>
