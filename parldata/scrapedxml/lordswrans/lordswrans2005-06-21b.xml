The latest UN <i>Nutrition in Crisis Situations</i> report published in May 2005 showed average to precarious malnutrition levels in a number of locations: in south Darfur, 15.6 per cent of the assessed population of the Gereida internally displaced people (IDP) camp were found to be suffering from global acute malnutrion (GAM) with 4 per cent suffering severe acute malnutrition (SAM); in Kalma IDP camp, south Darfur, the GAM rate was 9.9 per cent and the SAM rate was 2.6 per cent; in west Darfur across three camps in the Jebel Mara area, the GAM rate was 16.2 per cent and the SAM rate 1.5 per cent GAM rates of 20 per cent or above or SAM rates of 5 per cent or above would denote a very serious situation.</p>

Estimates from the previous WHO study conducted in August 2004 showed that there had been between 1.5 and 3.3 deaths per 10,000 people per day. This study only surveyed people in accessible internally displaced people (IDPs) camps, and had very little coverage of south Darfur. The new survey is sampling IDPs in camps and settlements, and affected resident populations, and will allow the UN to make more up-to-date estimates.</p>

We support fully all of the aims of the convention and we too want to see widespread action to tackle this abhorrent trade at source, to protect and support the victims and bring those responsible to justice. During the UK's forthcoming presidency of the EU the, Government intend to treat combating trafficking in human beings as one of their Justice and Home Affairs priorities. We are committed to agreeing a wide-ranging EU action plan before the end of 2005 and will jointly host with Eurojust a conference focusing on investigating and prosecuting traffickers. We are considering other ways of highlighting this issue during our presidencies of the G8 and EU, both at ministerial and official levels. The Government are committed to tackling trafficking in human beings, domestically and internationally, and are determined that the measures we take bring the criminals responsible for it to justice, while protecting the victims of trafficking, but without undermining our ability to control our borders.</p>

These regulations were drafted in consultation with the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association. The primary legislation, which provided the powers under which these regulations were made, was subjected to a wide-ranging formal consultation in 2003. The Explanatory Memorandum, which accompanied the order, included the conclusion that, following an equality screening exercise, there were no differential impacts under equality legislation so no formal equality impact assessment was required.</p>

	<p pid="b.166.6/2">In 2003, the last year for which we have published statistics, the averaged load factor across all turbines was 24.1 per cent Load factors vary from year to year and the average for the five years from 1999 to 2003 was 27.4 per cent 2004 figures will be available at the end of July 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.168.0/97">The Sports Cabinet is a forum for discussion by home country Sports Ministers of issues of common interest affecting the UK and the identification and sharing of best practice. The meeting in June 2002 discussed a number of issues including the Commonwealth Games, the work of the coaching task force and major events. At the January 2003 meeting the main discussion was on maintaining funding for UK Sport's World Class Performance Programme and it was agreed that funding should be maintained at the same level in the run-up to the Athens Olympics as it had been in the run-up to the Sydney Olympics. At the October 2003 meeting, Ministers discussed and agreed the key strands of reform of UK Sport and the criteria and the sports to be included in the one-stop planning process. At the April 2004 meeting Ministers discussed and agreed, subject to some further work, for example on anti-doping&mdash;the recommendations of the UK Sport reform process.</p>
