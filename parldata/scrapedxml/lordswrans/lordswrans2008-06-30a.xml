	<p pid="a.1.2/1">Game birds reared for sporting purposes are currently covered by the Animal Welfare Act 2006. This Act makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal, and also contains a duty of care so that people responsible for an animal must take such steps as are reasonable to ensure its welfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">In addition, the Government are proposing to use powers under the Act to produce a code of practice, which will provide guidance on accommodation and management methods, including aggression reduction. Any code would be subject to public consultation and endorsement by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">In preparation for the introduction of a code, a Defra-commissioned study into the welfare implications of using bits and spectacles is currently underway and is expected to be completed in November 2008. The results of the research will then be subject to peer review and will inform members of the working group tasked with writing the code.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">We are aware that there are also concerns about the use of cages for the breeding of game birds, and Defra has asked the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to assess this system of management and report back on its findings. It is anticipated that the report will be ready by autumn 2008 and it will inform the working group about this type of breeding system, and the extent to which any identified problems can be addressed through a code of practice.</p>

This said that that young people want to see more mainstreaming of activities for deaf children and young people. The Youth Opportunity and Youth Capital Funds which we introduced in 2006 give young people a direct say over activities and facilities in their area. It is a universal programme with a focus on reaching disadvantaged young people including those with disabilities. Young people can participate in three ways: as an applicant for funding: as a grant giver; and as a beneficiary of the activity or facility provided through the programme.</p>

The National Core Offer is a statement of the standards which families with disabled children can expect across the country from local services. It is concerned mainly with early years, education, youth, social care and health services, but is also relevant for those delivering housing, leisure and transport services.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/3">The core offer will ensure that parents of disabled children are involved in determining provision; have a single assessment of need where possible; are clear what they are entitled to and how to access the service; give disabled children and young people the option of being fully involved in the development of local services and designing their package of care; and are not subject to multiple assessments before services are provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) charges &pound;31.00 for a standard disclosure and &pound;36.00 for an enhanced disclosure. The CRB continues to process disclosure applications for volunteers free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/2">Payment is required for each CRB check, regardless of whether an individual has had a previous disclosure. All applications are processed individually and the fee was last prescribed in 2006. This is in accordance with Part V of the Police Act 1997 (Criminal Record) Regulations 2002 which states that a disclosure shall be issued to any individual who makes an application in the prescribed format and pays the prescribed fee, which was last prescribed in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/3">Disclosures are primarily designed to be used by an employer at the point of recruitment for a particular position. Ultimately it is for each employer, and not the CRB, to decide whether a new disclosure should be applied for, bearing in mind their legal and other responsibilities and subject to any statutory requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/4">There are a number of reasons why an employer may not wish to accept a disclosure that has been processed for a previous employment position, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/5">the disclosure may not be at the right level (there are two different levels of CRIB check; standard and enhanced);the older a disclosure is the less reliant the information is, because the information it contains may not be up to date; andinformation revealed through a CRB check reflects the information that was available at the time of its issue&mdash;a person may have committed a crime in the intervening period.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/6">The disclosure process may also include a search to establish whether an individual is subject to a direction under Section 142 of the Education Act 2002, or a check against them, Protection of Children Act and Protection of Vulnerable Adults (PoCA 2and PoVA) lists.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/7">Each disclosure is specific to the circumstances of a particular job application and any decision to disclose any non-conviction information held by individual police forces is unique to that position.</p>

RDAs are also responsible for the delivery of part of Defra's Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE), which was agreed by the European Commission last year. Support is available under this programme for improving the competitiveness of a wide range of rural businesses, which could include farmers' markets.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.8/1">At present, genetically modified (GM) maize, soya and oilseed rape crops are being grown in various countries, mainly for animal feed use. These crops have been modified for resistance to certain insect pests or weedkillers. They have not been modified to confer an intrinsic yield benefit, although they may increase production indirectly, by, for example, reducing the level of pest damage relative to that experienced with the equivalent conventional crop. They may also reduce production costs by facilitating lower pesticide usage. The same thinking applies to other GM crops under development with new traits like drought-tolerance and disease-resistance. If successful, these could increase production in areas with difficult growing conditions and therefore be part of the solution to meeting future challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/2">It is not possible to give precise estimates for the likely effect that the cultivation of GM crops would have in the UK or European Union (EU) on the level and cost of food production. The impact would vary depending on the type of crop in question and the specific context in which it was used. Consistent with this, the available evidence on current GM production outside the EU reports variable impacts in different regions and growing seasons.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.2/1">Following the <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-04">4 June</phrase> statement about planned juvenile executions in Iran, the EU presidency issued a further statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-10">10 June</phrase> calling for the Iranian authorities to halt the execution of juvenile offenders Mohammad Fadaei, Behnood Shojaee and Saeed Jazee. The embassy of the Republic of Slovenia in Tehran also spoke to an official from the Iranian Judiciary to make further representations and draw attention to the EU's statement. The executions of Fadaei and Shojaee, which had been scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-11">11 June</phrase>, were subsequently stayed for one month to allow time for further negotiations with the respective families. However, a 17 year-old juvenile offender, Mohammad Hassanzadeh, was executed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-10">10 June</phrase> and Saeed Jazee's execution remains scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/2">The position of the EU and the Government on the death penalty is clear, and the execution of juveniles is against all international human rights standards. The EU issued a further statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-13">13 June</phrase> which strongly condemned the execution of Mohammad Hassanzadeh in direct contravention of international law and Iran's obligations as set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The statement reiterated that there is &quot;absolutely no justification for the use of the death penalty by the Iranian authorities in the case of juvenile offenders&quot; and called for an end to all executions of juvenile offenders, a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in all instances and for Iran to bring her own legislation in line with the international human rights conventions into which she entered freely and indeed ratified.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/3">We will continue to make representations to the Government of Iran regarding their obligations on these matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The Government remain very concerned by the treatment of the Iranian Baha'i community at the hands of the Iranian regime and the ongoing detention of all members of the informal Baha'i leadership in Tehran who were arrested in May. These concerns have been raised both bilaterally and through the EU at least five times this year. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May</phrase>, following a recommendation from the UK, the EU presidency declared its concern about the systematic discrimination and harassment of the Baha'is and called on Iran to uphold the right to practise a religion of choice and to release the six members who were arrested on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-14">14 May</phrase>. At the last session of the UN Human Rights Council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-06">6 June</phrase>, the UK and the EU issued statements about specific issues of concern. Both statements referred to the Baha'is detained in Iran and called for their release. The December 2007 resolution on Iran's human rights situation adopted by the UN General Assembly also secured a strong message of international concern at the situation of the Baha'is in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/2">Regrettably, there has been no response from the Iranian Government regarding this issue yet. However, we will continue to raise our concerns and to call for their release.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.2/1">The Government do not hold records of the number of cases of detriment caused to British Muslim pilgrims arising from the actions of United Kingdom-based pilgrimage arrangers. Indeed there seems to be a reticence among pilgrims to bring complaints to the attention of the relevant authorities and this is one of the issues we are aiming to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">Nevertheless the Government are well aware that there are serious problems in this sector and my department, in conjunction with other government departments, the Civil Aviation Authority and local authority trading standards officers are working to improve compliance with UK regulations on package travel, to inform pilgrims of their consumer rights, and to whom they should complain.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/3">Last year we began an information campaign to inform pilgrims of their rights and my honourable friend the Minister for Trade and Consumer Affairs wrote to all MPs to ask for their help at the constituency level. There is evidence, in terms of a rise in complaints to the appropriate authorities, that this met with some success. We shall build on that this year by better targeting consumer information and publicity via a further pilgrim awareness campaign later in the year, and by seeking ways of ensuring that Hajj and Umrah travel organisers meet their statutory obligations. To begin this process, my honourable friend the Minister for Trade and Consumers Affairs will be holding a meeting in July to which have been invited Hajj travel organisers and we expect Muslim representative organisations to attend. We shall inform them of their responsibilities to their customers and explore with them their ideas on how the Hajj travel industry can improve.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.0/2">Due to the large number of variables involved, it is not possible to anticipate the numbers of individuals that may fall under the early removal scheme for so long a period or whether they can be removed directly from a prison or move to be detained within the UK Border Agency detention estate. However eligible foreign national prisoners will typically spend a maximum of 24 hours in a UK Border Agency detention centre. In the event that removal cannot proceed due to unforeseen issues then they are returned to prison to continue serving their sentence until removal may recommence.</p>
