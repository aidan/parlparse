Where a board wishes to make a replacement scheme or make a significant variation of a previous scheme, it must consult the board of governors of every school covered by its existing scheme and the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) before finalising the replacement or variation scheme. Following consultation, it must be submitted to the department for approval.</p>

The UK is working through its transfer controls initiative to build global consensus on such controls for small arms and with key states on concrete improvements to their controls. We are engaged with Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union on this issue in intergovernmental fora including the UN, G8, the Wassenaar arrangement and the OSCE, as well as bilaterally.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.8/2">Russia has signed up to the OSCE's small arms and light weapons (SALW) document which requires the adoption of a series of principles to improve national controls over the export of SALW and for states to exchange information on legislation and current practice on export policy and procedures. Russia is also party to the Wassenaar arrangement's Best Practice Guidelines in the Exports of SALW that the UK was instrumental in securing in December 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.8/3">The 2003 report, Beyond the Kalashnikov is a balanced report and has been a helpful development in SALW transparency for the region. The report is available on the Small Arms Survey website: <a href="http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/OPs/OP10RussianFederation.pdf">www.smallarmssurvey.org/OPs/OP10RussianFederation.pdf</a>.</p>

In addition to the approach favoured by the Shannon Trust, other initiatives include the Link Up project (funded by the DfES and delivered by the Basic Skills Agency) which trains prisoners, prison officers and staff from other agencies to become adult learner supporters and the Reading Champions scheme (run by the National Literacy Trust) which has also been extremely popular among prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/2">Information on the number of prisoners applying for parole and who deny their guilt is not centrally recorded by the Prison Service and to provide it would incur disproportionate cost. However, as from January 2003, the Parole Board began to collate such data and for the period January to June 2003, in 34 per cent of cases, where prisoners maintained their innocence, parole was granted. Information is not held centrally on how many of these prisoners undertook interventions to address their offending behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">In 1996, based on information provided by the United States authorities, it was initially concluded that no British units would have been affected by the demolition of chemical agents at Khamisiyah. From July 1997, following more detailed analysis by the US authorities, it became clear that British forces could have been exposed to low levels of chemical agents. As a result, the Ministry of Defence reviewed the US modelling work and published a paper in December 1999 titled, Review of Events Concerning 32 Field Hospital and the Release of Nerve Agent Arising From US Demolition of Iraqi Munitions at the Khamisiyah Depot In March 1991 which can be found at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/medical/khamisiyah.htm">www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/medical/khamisiyah.htm</a>. The paper concluded that up to 9,000 British troops could have been within the modelled plume but that the possible level of nerve agent exposure would have no detectable effect on human health, in either the short or long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/2">Further modelling work has been carried out in the US and was published in 2002. The US General Accounting Office is publishing a report on the modelling work later this year and once the US Department of Defence has responded to this, the MoD will undertake a further assessment and make the results public.</p>
