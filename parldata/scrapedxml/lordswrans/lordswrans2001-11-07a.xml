	<p pid="a.15.2/1">Yes. Only three members of the EU, Ireland, Portugal and Greece, have yet to ratify the statute. We are confident that they will do so soon in line with the commitments agreed in the EU Common Position on the International Criminal Court in June 2001. Fourteen Commonwealth countries have ratified to date. We shall continue our policy of lobbying the remainder at every opportunity.</p>

Representatives from EU member state missions also maintain close interest in UNFPA's programme.

	<p pid="a.20.2/1">The United Kingdom Passport Service has been issuing machine-readable passports since 1988. As a result, almost all United Kingdom-issued passports are machine-readable.

A small number of non-machine readable passports are issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at posts overseas. It is not possible to provide details of the numbers of passports this involves.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">All arriving passengers subject to immigration control are checked against the computerised warning index (WI) which automatically reads personal details from machine readable passports.

	<p pid="a.26.0/1">In July, the Secretary of State asked the English Tourism Council (ETC) to consult senior tourism industry leaders and propose a clear programme for modernising and restructuring the industry which the Department for Culture, Media and Sport could then consider as a basis for entering into partnership and investing in reform. The ETC then set up the Tourism Initiative Group to take this work forward and sent its report to the department on <phrase class="date" code="">10 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/2">The Tourism Initiative Group's report was part of an ongoing process to push ahead with the modernisation of the tourism sector. This report was discussed when my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, together with my honourable friend the Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting, met leading figures from the tourism industry on 10 and <phrase class="date" code="">11 October</phrase> at Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire. This meeting was convened to discuss the immediate difficulties facing the industry in the wake of the foot and mouth outbreak and the terrorist attacks of <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> but also to agree the necessary programme for long-term strategic reform of the industry to achieve more consistent high standards and better value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/3">The main conclusions for action from the meeting include the urgent need for tourism bodies to review their programmes so as best to meet the needs of the current difficulties; the importance of acting in the new spirit of partnership between industry and government; the creation of the CBI chaired voice for tourism, the Tourism Alliance; the need to focus public sector resources on improving co-ordination of marketing, rationalising tourism data collection so that it is more useful, improving the quality of product, strengthening service through improved training and skills and developing better tourist information, including through the use of the Internet. The outcomes of the meeting build on the Government's strategy for tourism, Tomorrow's Tourism, and the work commissioned from the Tourism Initiative Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/4">The following table sets these conclusions out in more detail. Tourism Industry Seminar&mdash;Outcomes Immediate short-term action</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/5">Our approach will be to ensure government and industry understands and appraises the impact of current challenges, co-ordinate public sector and private sector responses to those challenges, and for the public sector to make a direct contribution where that is justified.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.5/1">The Government are keen to open up civil employment under the crown regardless of nationality, while reserving the right, enjoyed by all EC member states, to reserve posts for their own nationals where strictly necessary. Although it has not been possible to secure a slot in the legislative programme to address civil employment under the crown generally, the Police Bill contains a provision which will enable a person of any nationality who is living in the UK free of conditions and who meets the required standards to be appointed to the office of constable.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">We are learning from the experience in Northern Ireland of creating a unified single Equality Commission. It covers a range of practical and financial matters, as well as issues relating to the functions, structure, balance, focus and accountability of the commission. Further lessons will no doubt be learnt as the commission beds down. Equality and human rights issues, including the setting up of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, were key factors in the Good Friday Agreement. The situation in Northern Ireland is unique. However, we are continuing to watch developments there so that we can consider whether, and, if so, the extent to which, lessons learnt might be applied throughout the rest of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.5/1">The Government's priority is to achieve coherence and, where desirable and appropriate, consistency between the different anti-discrimination statutes in Great Britain. We also need to ensure we effectively meet our European obligations. Our actions will be focused on the steps necessary to provide individuals, business and other organisations with a clear understanding of their respective rights and responsibilities under these laws. There are a number of options for achieving this. We intend to issue a consultation document setting out our plans on equality legislation within the next three months.</p>
