	<p pid="a.121.2/1">Child and family well-being and quality of life are at the heart of the Government's child poverty strategy. The Government have taken measures to promote parental employment as the best route out of poverty, because there is clear evidence that moving into and progressing in work offers benefits to parents and children alike, including but not restricted to, additional income from earnings&mdash;a child's risk of poverty is 61 per cent in a workless household and reduces to 15 per cent if at least one parent is working. Work is also associated with wider benefits, for example in terms of health, well-being and autonomy, aspirations and self-esteem. The introduction of the national minimum wage, as well as working tax credits, has ensured that the minimum income guarantee has increased by almost 30 per cent since April 1999 in real terms. Also Train to Gain, the Government's flagship training service for employers, has enabled employees to develop their skills, which will help them to progress in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">The Government's position is that it aims to help parents into work, and acquire the skills and training they need for well-paid jobs that support children and families, whilst also ensuring that work is family-friendly so that parents can combine employment and parental responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/3">To support families, the Government have taken action to increase and extend maternity leave and pay, and introduce paid paternity leave. A new right to request flexible working for those with parental responsibility for children under 16 (or 18, if disabled) has been introduced to help parents combine work and family responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/4">The Government have also taken substantial steps to support parents in work by increasing the number of childcare places that are available&mdash;at March 2009, the stock of registered childcare places stood at over 1.5 million places (more than double the 1997 level). Over &pound;25 billion has been invested on early years and childcare in England since 1997, and there are over 3,000 Sure Start Children's Centres now open, providing integrated early years' services (including childcare) to over 2.4 million young children under 5 and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/5">These and other measures put in place by the Government have lifted 500,000 children out of poverty since 1997. However, 2.9 million children remain in poverty, 1.5 million of which live in households with at least one person working. The Government are looking at ways to reduce in-work poverty by helping parents move into higher paid work, through skills and training for individuals and promoting the uptake of skills by employers, and also by promoting the availability of high-quality, affordable childcare. Increased working hours can help lift children out of poverty&mdash;either by the primary earner increasing hours from part-time to full-time hours, or with the introduction of a second earner into the household. However, the Government's approach is to support and incentivise parents into work, whilst respecting family preferences.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/6">By promoting flexible, family-friendly work opportunities and putting in place sufficient, high-quality childcare that supports children's development, we are helping parents make an informed choice about their working arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/7">The Government introduced the Child Poverty Bill into Parliament in June which will enshrine in law the commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020. The Bill will ensure that all levels of government, now and in the future, play a role in tackling child poverty. The Bill also requires the Government to prepare a strategy, to be refreshed every three years, which will set out the policies that will be put in place to meet the child poverty targets. The issue of tackling in-work poverty whilst maintaining a high quality of life for the child and the family will be addressed in the strategy.</p>

The department's strong recommendation relating to volunteers who are in unsupervised contact with children, including those accompanying pupils on school trips, and new host families who provide care for students from overseas should be CRB checked. We cannot impose this requirement on host families in other countries who provide care for British children. However schools should satisfy themselves that adequate safeguarding arrangements have been put in place to protect children. Under the new vetting and barring scheme those who provide care and accommodation for children under 18 for reward or by arrangement made outside the family will be engaged in &quot;regulated activity&quot;, and this is made clear in interim guidance the Government issued on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-12">12 October 2009</phrase> about the new scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.3/1">We would expect local authorities in England to be guided by the advice issued by the Local Government Association in May 2009. The guidance from the LGA is intended to avoid bias or the perception of bias in decisions on planning applications while reflecting local authorities' roles as place shapers. The guidance therefore recognises councillors' ability to participate in discussions prior to the receipt of a planning application on behalf of their communities and engage in spatial planning policy formulation. Planning elsewhere in the UK is a matter for the devolved Administrations.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-10-27a.125.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="125"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91027w0003.htm#09102779000225">
	<p pid="a.125.6/1">The Ministry of Justice was formed in May 2007 to take forward the work of the Department for Constitutional Affairs together with significant additional responsibilities transferring from the Home Office. These included the National Offender Management Service, which covers the Prison Service and probation service and the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. The figures below therefore relate to the Department for Constitutional Affairs where the financial years fall prior to 2007-08 and the Ministry of Justice on or after the 2007-08 year.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/2">The nature of the Ministry of Justice's activities is such that it does not engage in significant levels of advertising on initiatives. More than 95 per cent of departmental advertising spend is on recruitment, mainly by human resources (HQ and NOMS). To provide information for individual recruitment advertising campaigns would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/3"><I>National Offender Management Service (NOMS)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/4">NOMS, which has responsibility for the prison and probation systems, has spent the following non-recruitment-related amounts on advertising, external publicity and broadcasting. Amounts relating to specific advertising initiatives cannot be separately quantified.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.125.6/15" class="indent">*The figure for 2008-09 is for NOMS HQ and HMPS but excludes the 42 local probation boards and trusts within NOMS as this information is held locally and could only be collated at disproportionate cost. The figures obtained for the financial years 2004-05 to 2007-08 are for HM Prison Service (HMPS) agency only. They exclude NOMS HQ (previously a directorate within the parent department, the Home Office) and the National Probation Service (NPS), which are now part of the NOMS agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/16" class="indent">** The 2008-09 figures are therefore not comparable to previous years. It would be disproportionate cost to obtain figures for both NOMS and the NPS for 2004-05 to 2007-08. Furthermore, it would incur disproportionate cost to investigate what advertising initiatives make up the figures in the above table.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/17">The expenditure on recruitment for the NOMS agency in 2008-09 is &pound;3,409,968, mainly on recruitment of prison officers. This figure may include other recruitment expenditure not considered to be publicity and advertising. Work to split out publicity and advertising spend from the total recruitment amount would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/18">The stated figure for NOMS excludes expenditure by the 42 local probation boards and trusts whose records are held locally and could only be collated at disproportionate cost. A one-off exercise undertaken in 2007-08 found that expenditure on advertising and promotion by local probation boards and trusts was &pound;58,264. There are no current plans to repeat this information-gathering exercise for 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/19"><I>Headquarters and other agencies</I></p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/20">For the rest of the department, the ministry's central accounting records do not distinguish different types of advertising expenditure. To determine what expenditure relates to requires retrieval and examination of individual invoices and records held locally across the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/21">Advertising, publicity and communications expenditure over the last five years is set out below with some of the expenditure for advertising in recruitment. However, not all the expenditure on recruitment advertising is included since it is not separately quantifiable from the accounts. The Criminal Justice Group, which is part of the ministry's headquarters, was formed from various Home Office functions transferred to the ministry in April 2007. It is not possible to extract historical information for the Criminal Justice Group from the Home Office's records prior to 2008-09, meaning that the figures for headquarters below are not directly comparable between the financial years<sup>***</sup>.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.5/2"><I>Letter from Jil Matheson, National Statistician, to Lord Berkeley, dated October 2009.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.138.5/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what is the total number of life years lost in England and Wales in each of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 for those dying prematurely of: (a) short-, medium- or long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM10), (b) alcohol abuse, (c) drug abuse, (d) road traffic accidents, (e) obesity, and (f) smoking. (HL5773)</p>
	<p pid="a.138.5/4">The accurate reporting of deaths by specific causes depends on the complete recording of all relevant causes of death by medical practitioners and coroners. Medical practitioners are required to complete the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) to the best of their knowledge and belief. Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to death to be recorded. The MCCD is not designed to collect information on risk factors or exposures related to the development of disease, such as exposure to particulate matter or smoking behaviour. It is therefore not possible to provide answers to parts (a) or (f) of the question above, based on information collected at death registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.5/5">Calculations done for the review of the Air Quality Strategy<sup>1</sup> estimated that, if all man-made fine particulate matter (PM2.5) present in the UK in 2005 were removed for the lifetime of people born in 2005, the average life-expectancy per person would be 7-8 months greater than if the level of man-made PM2.5 had remained at 2005 levels for a lifetime. This calculation represents the effect of long-term exposure to fine particles. A similar calculation has not been done for PM10 since the evidence that it is a good metric for representing the effect of long-term exposure is much weaker<sup>2</sup> than for PM2.5.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.5/6">Studies of short-term exposure to PM10 do suggest a link with increased mortality but the studies do not give direct information on the life lost per person. It is thought that those affected are already seriously ill but that many of the deaths are brought forward by several months rather than just days or weeks. There are too few studies of the effects of medium term exposure for calculations such as those above to be made. All information on the estimated impact of particulate matter on life expectancy and mortality has been provided by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Neither ONS nor the HPA are aware of comparable figures to those provided above for 2006-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.5/7">ONS publishes annual figures on the number of years of life lost due to a selection of specific causes of death<sup>3</sup> , including land transport accidents. Table 1 below presents figures for years of life lost due to land transport accidents, including the number of deaths, mean age at death and years of total life (to age 75) lost, by sex, for 2005 to 2007 (the latest year available). Figures are not readily available for years of life lost due to alcohol abuse, drug abuse or obesity.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.5/8">Figures are available for the number of premature deaths, defined as deaths under the age of 75, for (i) deaths with an alcohol-related cause, (ii) drug misuse deaths, where the underlying cause was drug poisoning and where any drug controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was mentioned on the death certificate, and (iii) deaths with obesity as the underlying cause of death, for England and Wales, for 2005 to 2008 (the latest year available), and are provided in Table 2 below. These figures are presented to offer some information on the scale of premature deaths from these conditions, in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.5/9">The figures provided in Table 2 relating to obesity reflect the number of deaths certified as due to obesity conditions. However, these figures are likely to underestimate the actual number of deaths in which this factor is involved since obesity may play an important role in deaths due to other conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, but it is rarely recorded on the death certificate.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.5/1">Negotiations on revisions to the working time directive collapsed after conciliation failed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">27 April</phrase> this year. This meant that we were successful in retaining the opt-out as the proposal to amend the directive was withdrawn and with it any suggestion of phasing it out.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/2">It is now for the Commission to decide how they wish to proceed. Several member states are keen to see a solution to specific problems caused by ECJ judgments on the treatment of on-call time and compensatory rest, and we would be happy to engage on negotiations on these issues. But 15 member states use the opt-out and we will strongly oppose any future proposal that draws into question the freedom of member states and individuals to use the opt-out. We have made this very clear to the Commission and other member states.</p>
