It would not be helpful to speculate on the consequences of a failure by Israel to withdraw fully. But recent Israeli actions can only be harmful to Israel's reputation abroad. Its partial withdrawal to date should be completed immediately. Both sides must step back from the brink. We welcome US diplomatic efforts to secure a full withdrawal and to resume negotiations on a political settlement, and we stand ready to help in whatever way we can.</p>

Implementation of these interventions is prone to social and political risk given the continuing instability in the region. The European Commission is still committed to programming 60 million euro in the CHT from 2002&ndash;06 but is likely to work up new initiatives carefully in the light of political developments and progress with the peace accord. Further details will be in its National Indicative Programme for Bangladesh, which should be approved by October.

	<p pid="a.137.5/1">The Court of Appeal confirmed in the Lindsay case that Customs vehicle seizure and non-restoration policy in relation to those who smuggle alcohol and tobacco for profit was justified and proportionate. It also confirmed that vehicles used to smuggle on a non-profit basis were similarly liable to seizure. However, the court considered that in not-for-profit cases a proportionate response, depending on the individual circumstances, would be to offer to restore such seized vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/2">Accordingly when Customs detects commercial for profit smugglers, any vehicles used in such smuggling will remain subject to the existing tough seizure and non-restoration policy. However, Customs has now further developed its vehicle seizure policy taking into account the clarification provided by the Court of Appeal. When Customs detects not-for-profit smugglers, their goods and vehicles will be seized but vehicle restoration will ordinarily be offered in the first instance for a sum equivalent to the revenue evaded. There will be a rising scale for any subsequent offences up to non-restoration. Customs will reserve the right to vary its restoration terms according to the aggravating or mitigating circumstances of any individual case.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/3">This policy will allow Customs to continue its successful approach of hitting those who smuggle for profit with tough sanctions that strike at their illicit trade and also provides a real and proportionate penalty for those who break the law, albeit without such profit-making motivation. It represents a fair and balanced policy.</p>

In the marketplace, unless your product can be differentiated and consumers are prepared to pay a premium, all other things being equal they will purchase at the lowest price they need to pay for the quality of product they wish to consume. That applies both within countries and in international trade. Of course controls are necessary in international trade to protect animal health and to ensure that foodstuffs imported into our market meet our standards.</p>

This is later than previously envisaged but will allow the agency thoroughly to examine all the comments made on the draft map.

Parts of four Army training areas and part of one research and development establishment were shown on those maps as either open country or registered common land. The agency expects to issue further draft maps for the remaining mapping regions over the next 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/2">Land which is shown on a draft map, and which is subsequently shown on the conclusive map, may be land to which there will be no right of access because it is excepted land. Excepted land includes land the use of which is regulated by by-laws made under the Military Lands Acts of 1892 or 1900. However, military by-laws often provide for a right of access to training lands when it is safe to do so (for example, when training is not taking place), and in these cases access under those provisions will continue. Where defence training lands which are not subject to by-laws are mapped as open country or registered common land, then my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence may make directions restricting or excluding access where necessary for the purposes of defence.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.3/1">The Government are committed to tackling the rising trend in childhood obesity and action to encourage children to eat a balanced diet. We have put in place major cross-government programmes of work to improve healthy eating and increase physical activity. This includes the National School Fruit Scheme, where over 80,000 children in 27 areas and over 500 schools now receive a free piece of fruit each school day. Additional funding of &pound;42 million from the New Opportunities Fund will enable the scheme to expand to cover over 1 million children from 2002 to 2004. From 2004 all four to six year-olds will be entitled to a free piece of fruit each school day. This is part of a wider Five-a-day Programme to increase access to, and awareness of, fruit and vegetables.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/2">Secondly, there is work with industry to improve the overall balance of diet, including the reduction of salt, sugar and fat in food.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/3">We already have a National Healthy School Programme, a joint initiative between the Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills, which has as one of its themes healthy eating. Schools are encouraged to provide, promote and monitor healthier food at lunch and break times and in any breakfast clubs. This will be complemented by the Food in Schools Programme which aims to bring together under one umbrella all food-related initiatives in schools and after school clubs to improve health and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/4">Physical activity is also important. We are working across government to ensure that children have opportunities to participate in a wide range of physical and sporting activities. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-11">11 January 2001</phrase> the Prime Minister announced that all children will be entitled to a minimum of two hours a week of high quality physical education and school sport both within and beyond the school curriculum. This was followed by a commitment in the White Paper Schools&mdash;achieving success. Significant funding is also being provided to enhance PE and sports facilities in schools, including &pound;541 million from the New Opportunities Fund for a PE and Sports Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">Although there is no direct evidence that the BSE prion is infectious to humans, obtaining such evidence could not be justified ethically as this would require humans to be inoculated with BSE. A judgment on the link between BSE and vCJD inevitably depends on an assessment of a range of clinical, pathological, epidemiological and laboratory based evidence. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee considers that there is now convincing evidence that BSE is the cause of vCJD, although there remains uncertainty about the future number of cases and the mechanism of transmission of BSE to humans.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">The association between BSE and variant vCJD has been discussed in a number of published scientific articles. Details of those of particular significance are as follows: 1.

	<p pid="a.145.2/3">The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, the independent expert group that advises the Government on all aspects of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, regularly reviews relevant published articles.

	<p pid="a.147.0/1">Healthcare resource groups (HRGs) are one of a series of activity measures used as the basis of reference costs. In the 2000&ndash;01 financial year, reference costs covered &pound;21 billion of National Health Service expenditure, accounting for approximately 83 per cent. of hospital and community health services expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/2">HRGs are used primarily for inpatient and day case activity, a limited range of outpatient activity and accident and emergency services. HRGs are also available for some specialised services, for example radiotherapy, but with the development of specialist commissioning some of the HRGs have been superseded to reflect changes in clinical practice, for example bone marrow transplantation. Where these refinements have been introduced, the aim is better to reflect the differences in cost due to casemix.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/3">Overall, 53 per cent. of hospital and community health services and 64 per cent. of reference costs were covered by HRGs and these refinements in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/4">Although HRGs have not been introduced for a range of non-acute services, some non-HRG refinements are planned better to reflect differences in caseload and casemix (for example nursing services for children in 2003).</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/5">As with any initiative, the level of coverage is iterative and reference costs are expected to cover 100 per cent. of all hospital and community health services by 2004, although some elements will not be fully casemix adjusted by this date.</p>

Partly because experience showed that such machines were often sited without a permit or were of a type not allowed; and that the problem would remain and enforcment would in practice be difficult.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.9/1">In July 2001 the Victims Liaison Unit commissioned Clio Evaluation Consortium (CEC) to carry out an independent evaluation of the Core Funding Scheme for Victims and Survivors Groups. The evaluation, which cost &pound;65k, was recently completed and the CEC's report was published and distributed to groups on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-27">27 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/2">The evaluation measures the impact and effectiveness of the Core Funding Programme for Victims and Survivors Groups, highlights innovative approaches adopted by the projects, identifies the longer-term organisational requirements of groups and describes the potential synergies between the core funding programme and the New Peace 11 Measures for Victims. The evaluation also makes recommendations regarding the targeting of future funding. The key recommendations from the report are listed below.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/3">The Government are currently considering the report and will use CEC's findings to inform the work they are doing to set criteria for a new core funding scheme, for which Des Browne, Victims Minister, has announced funding of a further &pound;3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/4">A seminar has been arranged at which CEC will present their findings and recommendations to victims' and survivors' groups. The seminar will provide groups with an opportunity to input their views on how the recommendations can best be taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/5">The key recommendations from the Clio evaluation report are:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/6" class="indent">Recommendation 1: that funding for the development of victim-related work be continued and the funding base broadened.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/7" class="indent">Recommendation 2: that the core funding programme be continued as it is complementary to the Peace 11 measures for victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/8" class="indent">Recommendation 3: that a more strategic, long-term and reflective approach be taken to funding in this area of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/9" class="indent">Recommendation 4: that current core funding be more targeted and developed with the recognition that decisions taken now affect the long term; ideally long term funds are needed if needs are to be adequately met.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/10" class="indent">Recommendation 5: that new criteria be drawn up for the core funding programme which reflect strategic targeting and are aimed at meeting long term needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/11" class="indent">Recommendation 6: that the administration systems of the current and any future IFB be sound and efficient; experience should be gleaned and used from NIVT's administration of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/12" class="indent">Recommendation 7: that the IFB should provide improved and ongoing support to programme staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/13" class="indent">Recommendation 8: that the IFB should ensure that there is appropriate support, training and communication systems for groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.9/14" class="indent">Recommendation 9: that both the IFB and the groups should build in monitoring and evaluation practice.</p>
