	Police Service: Retirement

	<p pid="a.1.1/2" qnum="HL427">What studies the Home Office is carrying out into patterns of retirement from police force to police force and as to the reasons why police officers are leaving (a) early or (b) after 30 years' service.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.2/1">A number of Home Office studies in the 1990s looked at the reasons why people leave the police service early other than on medical grounds. These studies identified particular difficulties in retaining officers who are female, graduates or from minority ethnic groups. The need for further research on all aspects of retention will be considered in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">The importance of ensuring that the medical retirement rates for all forces are more consistent has been recognised for some time and we are currently considering how best to tackle the divergence in performance between forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">As most police officers are entitled to retire with an immediate--and maximum--pension after completion of 30 years' service it is to be expected that the majority of officers would choose to retire at this stage. We are, however, considering how suitable officers might be encouraged to delay their retirement as part of our plans to boost police numbers to record levels. This clearly requires an understanding of the motivations of officers who retire with 30 years' service.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.3/1">The only establishment that is designated as a remand centre is Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution/Remand Centre Northallerton. This is because the majority of the prison's population are remand prisoners, compared with other establishments whose population consists of only a minority of remand prisoners. Remand prisoners spend, on average, less time out of cell because they have not been found guilty of any offence and therefore cannot be required to undertake any activity. Their time in prison is frequently interrupted by court appearances so they cannot engage on courses. Therefore, most of their time is spent on recreational activities or in their cells. Category B and C prisons hold sentenced prisoners who would be required to work, take part in education and undertake offending behaviour programmes. They will therefore spend, on average, more time out of cell than remand prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/2">The Prison Service is making efforts to increase the amount of purposeful activity available for remand prisoners to participate in and so increase their time out of cell.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="">13 August</phrase> this year, Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution/Remand Centre Northallerton will be introducing a new activity programme that will greatly increase the time remand prisoners spend out of cell to levels more comparable to Category C and B prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/4">Most young offender institutions hold a mixture of sentenced and remand prisoners. Therefore, the average figure for time spent out of cell will again be lower than most Category B and C prisons which hold only sentenced prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/5">The conditions and regimes for juvenile offenders have, however, been transformed by the Prison Service in partnership with the Youth Justice Board. One effect of these improvements has been to highlight that young adult offenders have not fared so well. We are committed to building upon reforms of the youth justice system to improve the standards of custodial accommodation and offending programmes for this latter age group. We are currently considering how best to give effect to this commitment.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">The Prison Service does not collect centrally the time out of cell for individual prisoners. The figures quoted for the 'average weekday time out of cell May 2001' are averages based on the time out of cell for all prisoners within a given establishment, regardless of the category of the prisoner.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">When figures are aggregated by function of establishment, prisons are categorised by their main function only. This means that in establishments with multiple functions the time out of cell for different types of prisoners are contained within the average. For example, the female wing at Her Majesty's Prison Winchester is included within the average for that establishment and appears in the table as part of the male local estate. For that reason the averages quoted for categories of prison are not necessarily representative of the average times for which different categories of prisoner are allowed out of their cell.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.2/1">The Government are committed to increasing educational attainment by prisoners and linking this to employment and learning opportunities on release. The Prison Service provides a range of training to equip prisoners with the relevant skills and qualifications. This includes provision of basic skills, such as literacy and numeracy, and vocational training for particular trades and other occupations. In 2000-01, more than 50,000 nationally recognised qualifications were achieved by prisoners, including around 12,500 literacy and numeracy qualifications at level two, often helping to make them employable for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/2">The delivery of this training involves Prison Service instructional officers, further education colleges, learning and skills councils, businesses, industry bodies and others. Since April 2001 this work has been taken forward within a new partnership between the Prison Service and the Department for Education and Skills to improve the education and training of prisoners. It is also connected to the Prison Service's Custody to Work programme, which aims to double the number of prisoners getting jobs on release by April 2004. Better equipped prisoners for available jobs is an important element of that programme, together with a more effective engagement with the business and voluntary sectors and with other agencies, including the Employment Service and the National Probation Service.</p>

This upgrade is essential for the continued daily operation of PNC, which might otherwise be prejudiced, and should be completed in March 2002 and advised that the firearms certificate holders register will go live as soon as possible after that; timing is dependent on rework necessary to ensure existing applications run on the upgraded software.

	<p pid="a.11.2/2">It remains the responsibility of local statutory authorities to determine the precise pattern of services to be developed in their area as they are best placed to make such decisions in the light of the Department of Health's guidance and their local knowledge of needs and resources. This could include the development of village communities on suitable hospital sites.</p>

We are currently consulting on the guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.3/1">Clinical governance provides National Health Service organisations and health care professionals with a framework for quality improvement which, over time, will develop into a single, coherent local programme for assuring and improving the quality of clinical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/2">National Health Service organisations are using a number of different tools to help them implement their own local arrangements to achieve the key components of clinical governance. Some organisations have found the generic quality management schemes (for example ISO 9000, the Excellence Model, Charter Mark and Investors in People) to be useful ways into this process, recognising that these schemes share general management principles with the aims of clinical governance and the Government's overall NHS quality strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/3">The Cabinet Office document Getting it Together--A Guide to Quality Schemes and the Delivery of Public Services, published March 2001, sets out this work in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/4">The Commission for Health Improvement's (CHI's) rolling programme of clinical governance reviews of all NHS bodies is under way. These local reviews evaluate the implementation and adequacy of clinical governance arrangements in NHS organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/5">The commission also has the capacity for rapid investigation and intervention to help the NHS identify and tackle serious or persistent clinical problems. In addition, CHI is conducting national reviews to evaluate the implementation of national standards set in national service frameworks (on topics such as mental health) and the take up of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/6">The Commission for Health Improvement has now assessed acute and mental health trusts and health authorities (covering primary care). Further reports have been published, including a review of Bedford Hospital NHS Trust, and these routine review reports will now be published on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/7">We are creating a national patient safety agency in response to the Chief Medical Officer's report An organisation with a memory. This new agency will manage and evaluate the results from the new NHS-wide mandatory reporting scheme for adverse healthcare events to learn and share lessons across the NHS, to help minimise patient risk and improve the quality and safety of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/8">The existence of the agency will, we believe, through its work, very significantly reduce the likelihood of major issues like Shipman and Bristol. It will do this in large part through helping promote a reporting culture throughout the NHS that benefits patient safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/9">An ongoing research project is evaluating the impact of the NHS Modernisation Agency's clinical governance support programme on participating NHS clinical teams. This project is due to finish at the end of 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">Quality is the heart of the Government's agenda for modernising the National Health Service. Quality of care is increasingly being taken into account when judging the performance of NHS organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">The basic elements of the NHS quality management system--as set out in A First Class Service-Quality in the new NHS, published in 1998--are all now in place; these are: clear national standards to help raise standards of care and reduce unacceptable variations for specific treatments, conditions and for patient safety, through routes including the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, national service frameworks and a National Cancer Plan; modern organisational delivery mechanisms to implement national standards effectively, dependably and safely--coordinated through comprehensive clinical governance arrangements; and strong monitoring mechanisms--including the Commission for Health Improvement, the NHS Performance Assessment Framework, national and local patient surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/3">This agenda is underpinned by the Health Act 1999, which places a statutory duty of quality on NHS organisations continuously to monitor and improve the quality of the health care that they provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/4">The NHS Plan, published July 2000, takes this quality agenda further to cover improving customer service and patient/citizen representation and also sets out plans for a new mandatory reporting scheme for adverse healthcare events, to help minimise risks to patients and improve the quality and safety of patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/5">This is a substantial agenda of reform, requiring major changes to culture and working practices throughout the NHS. However, we have made a good start towards implementing this agenda--increasingly NHS systems and practices are beginning to be re-focused on improving quality and people are beginning to get better care as a result.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.0/1">No work has been done at this stage to explain the recent trends in prescribing of anti-psychotic medication although the figures are monitored. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is expected to issue guidance on the use of atypical anti-psychotic drugs in December. The available information relates to anti-psychotic medicines dispensed in the community for 1999 and 2000 only; these are set out in the table and are estimates derived from a 1 in 20 sample of prescription items.</p>

The likely eventual net effect of measures such as those contained in the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill would be to decrease tobacco consumption, and the size of the decrease could lie in a range up to about 5 per cent. It is reasonable to use the mid-point of this range (2.5 per cent.) to indicate the likely effects of a ban and on this basis we estimate that in the longer term up to 3,000 lives a year could be saved.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.2/1">The Royal College of Surgeons' recommendation outlined in the Better Care for the Severely Injured Report advocates a requirement for oral and maxillo-facial trauma services to provide 24 hours cover. However the facilities need not be on site and can be derived from network arrangements between adjacent hospitals. The Royal Free Hospital has complied with this recommendation. Following the retirement of the previous postholder, and after unsuccessfully trying to recruit to this post, it was concluded that without senior staff the service was no longer viable. It was therefore agreed that the Eastman Dental Hospital, part of University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, should provide cover for facial trauma for the Royal Free. A protocol was agreed with the accident and emergency department at the Royal Free Hospital and the arrangement has been running satisfactorily since April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">After the Royal Free Hospital failed to recruit a consultant, an attempt was made to create a joint oral surgery post between University College London NHS Trust and the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/3">At a late stage in the process, University College London indicated that it did not have sufficient funding for its element of the post and had to withdraw. It was subsequently agreed that the Eastman Dental Hospital should provide facial trauma cover for the Royal Free. This arrangement has been running satisfactorily since April 2001 and as a result there are no current plans to create another joint oral surgery post.</p>

The administration and enforcement of public entertainment licensing law remain the statutory responsibility of the local authorities. The department offers advice where it can be helpful to inquirers; but the interpretation of public entertainment licensing law is ultimately a matter for the courts. Whenever it has been considered necessary to issue guidance to local authorities for the promotion of consistency in good practice, the Home Office approach has been to issue circulars to local authorities, thus ensuring that the same guidance reaches all. Where possible circulars have been issued jointly with the Local Government Association. We expect to adopt a similar practice.</p>

Early years development and childcare partnerships in each local authority area are responsible for ensuring that particular attention is paid to the development and maintenance of childcare services in rural and disadvantaged areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">Research carried out by the London School of Economics calculated that between 1994-98 the average annual rate increase in GCSE A*-C performance in specialist schools was half as much again as in non-specialist maintained schools. On the same measure, specialist schools continued to improve faster than the national average for all other schools between 1997 and 2000 when the percentage point improvement for pupils gaining 5+ A*-C grades at GCSE in specialist schools throughout this period was 6.1 compared with 4.1 in other maintained schools. Research carried out by Professor David Jesson of York University also shows that specialist schools are performing very well on value added scores. Comparing results of 1995 key stage 2 tests with GCSE results in 2000, comprehensive specialist schools achieved a value added of +5.4 percentage points compared to -1.1 for all other comprehensive schools. Last year the percentage of pupils gaining 5 or more GCSEs at A*-C grades was 54 per cent in specialist schools compared with 45 per cent in other maintained schools.</p>

Childcare targets for each local authority are agreed with early years development and childcare partnerships (EYDCPs).

A wide range of targets for the development of childcare is set.</p>
