<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-04-30a.105.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="105"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030430/text/30430w02.htm#30430w02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.105.2/1">Research shows that 16 to 30 year-olds are the least prepared of all British travellers. Today, therefore, the Government is launching a special campaign aimed at younger travellers. It will offer vital information to help young Britons avoid getting into difficulties overseas by making them aware of some simple precautions they can take before heading off. The campaign will offer advice to those taking a range of trips, from weekend breaks, gap years, or summer package holidays to those going off on adventure sports trips or on honeymoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/2">Overseas travel is an important opportunity for young people, but we need to ensure that the experience is not spoilt by unnecessary problems or accidents. Time spent on research and preparation in advance of a trip can save a great deal of trouble and heartache later. Every year people have distressing experiences. Most think that it could never happen to them. Sadly, it can and it does. That is why the Government are launching this campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/3">This &quot;youth&quot; mini-campaign forms part of the FCO's ongoing Know Before You Go campaign which, working with over 160 travel industry partners, encourages travellers to be better prepared before travelling overseas. The FCO website <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/knowbeforeyougo">www.fco.gov. uk/knowbeforeyougo</a> provides tips for travel overseas including guidance on taking out travel insurance, travel advice and checklists for specific groups such as backpackers and independent travellers, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender travellers, women travellers and those visiting friends and relatives overseas.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The Government recognise the important role that courts can play in the rehabilitation of drug misusing offenders, particularly where sentencers play an active part in the review and monitoring of an offender's progress and there is continuity through the stages of the court process.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">We are currently looking to build on best court practice in the management of the court review process for the drug treatment and testing order (DTTO), the nearest comparable arrangement we have in England and Wales to drug courts in other jurisdictions. Preparation work is under way in three court areas in England to pilot and evaluate good practice approaches, including the use of selected magistrates trained in drug misuse issues. We will give further consideration to the role the courts have to play in the rehabilitation of drug misusing offenders in the light of the outcome of these pilots and other initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.2/2">Decisive combat operations in Iraq are now complete, and coalition forces are increasingly focusing on stabilisation tasks.

The RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;, &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; and &quot;Bayleaf&quot; are undertaking a rolling programme of maintenance in Singapore to allow them to return to the Gulf to continue to provide support to the humanitarian assistance effort. Further vessels will remain there for the time being to conduct mine clearance operations and force protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/4">As the need for offensive air operations and close air support has significantly diminished, we can bring back further air assets. We have withdrawn around 45 aircraft from the Gulf region, both fixed and rotary wing, including Tornado F3 and GR4, Harrier GR7, Nimrod MR2, VC10 and E3-D aircraft as well as Chinook and Sea King helicopters. A further 26 helicopters will be withdrawn at the same time as HMS &quot;Ocean&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/5">For land forces, conditions now allow for the return of a further 3,500 personnel to the UK. This will include 2nd Royal Tank Regiment and 1st Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment, with elements of 26 Regiment Royal Artillery, 38 Engineer Regiment and 1st Battalion the Light Infantry. It will also include a number of individuals who were attached to a wide variety of ground units and formations to perform specific augmenting roles. Returning forces are due a period of post-operational tour leave to which they are entitled, following which they will begin to prepare for training and then redeployment on other important operational taskings. In some cases, this will mean a return to Iraq to take part in continuing operations. In addition, we intend to withdraw 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, who were the first of the land formations to be deployed, during the course of May.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/6">We will now begin to prepare 19 Mechanised Brigade to take over from forces previously involved in combat operations in Iraq, allowing us to meet the continuing task of providing a stabilisation force within the UK area of operations. We would expect them to start this new task in July, commencing preparations immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/7">In spite of these changes significant pressures remain on the Armed Forces if they are to meet the full range of their commitments. In order to meet our continuing obligations in Iraq, we have authorised the issuing of further call-out notices, against the order made in January under Section 54(1) of the Reserve Forces Act 1996, sufficient to generate up to 1,200 reservists. There will be a requirement to call out further reservists as the operation proceeds, and we will keep the House informed of our plans. In parallel, we will be starting to demobilise those Reserves who are returning home. In time, the overall numbers of Reserves required in Iraq will reduce significantly. We have also decided to extend the tour of the 1st Battalion the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, enabling them to continue in their key role of ensuring security in the region of Az Zubayr.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/8">While details continue to be clarified, we envisage that by mid-May between 25,000 and 30,000 UK service personnel will remain deployed in the Gulf region, continuing to fulfil our responsibilities towards the Iraqi people. The planned replacement of forces is clear evidence of our commitment to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/9">Our aim is to leave an Iraq that is confident, secure and fully integrated with the international community. The planning process to establish the precise level of the continuing UK presence needed to achieve this aim is a dynamic one, and is kept under review. We will also need to take account of the contributions of coalition partners. We will continue to withdraw assets and personnel from the region where possible, but we will maintain an appropriate military presence for as long as necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">The position expressed with regard to abstinence education in the Chief Medical Officer's update is informed by high quality reviews of the international evidence. The most recent of these (Swann, C, Bowe, K, McCormick, G and Kosmin, M (2003) Evidence-Based briefing paper on teenage pregnancy and parenthood. Health Development Agency) considered the evidence from all high quality systematic and other reviews and meta-analyses published since 1996. Their findings reinforced the evidence base for the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. They concluded that &quot;on the whole, our findings indicate that abstinence approaches (despite heavy funding provision in the US) do not work&quot;. There is therefore no basis on which to revise the January 2003 Chief Medical Officer's Update 35.</p>

I understand that, if accepted, the papers are unlikely to be published before September. The main phase of the public debate is being conducted between June and July and the steering board is due to report in September.

Ten applications for commercial cultivation are currently being considered. These include two of the GM crops in the farm scale evaluations. Final decisions on any of these are unlikely to be taken at EU level before the end of the year, by which time we will have the report of the public debate and the first set of results from the crop trials.</p>
