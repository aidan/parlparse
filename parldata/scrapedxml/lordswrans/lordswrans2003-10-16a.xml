	<p pid="a.126.2/1">The refurbishment of test centres was undertaken over a two-year period following the award of a major contract to a private sector consortium in March 2001. However, the project, which was necessary to ensure that the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency could continue to deliver a high quality testing service, was in the planning stage for a considerable period before that.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/2">Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland has had an ongoing campaign to tackle vehicle excise duty evasion (VED) for some time. The introduction of wheel clamping in January 1998 and camera detection in January 2002 were a direct response to the relatively high evasion rate in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/3">VED campaigns do not increase the number of vehicles requiring an MoT, but they help to persuade those who need to get their vehicles tested to do so. Both are important elements in the department's road safety strategy. However, both involve lengthy lead times, and despite extensive planning it is impossible to keep them entirely separate or to predict the precise impact of a particular campaign.</p>

We expect to channel a substantial proportion of this spending through Multi-Donor Trust Fund arrangements being established by the World Bank and the United Nations, and to continue to support bilateral and multilateral programmes in Iraq. This funding does not include the costs of maintaining security in Iraq, towards which we are making a major contribution. Nor will it involve any reduction in DfID's planned development expenditure for low income countries. We remain committed to deliver &pound;1 billion of bilateral assistance for Africa in 2005&ndash;06, and to increase the proportion of bilateral spending on low income countries to 90 per cent by the same time.</p>

In the European Court of Justice case of Akrich, the court was asked to determine whether a member state could refuse to apply the Surinder Singh judgment to a British citizen who had deliberately moved to another member state with the express intention of creating an initial right of residence in the UK for their third country national spouse.</p>
