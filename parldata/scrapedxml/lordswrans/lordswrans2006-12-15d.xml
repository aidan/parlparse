	<p pid="d.227.2/1">At 19:13 GMT on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase> a British Airways flight was directed by Gibraltar Air Traffic Control to abort its approach to Gibraltar Airport due to a vehicle on the runway. The vehicle in question was a Defence Fire Services vehicle carrying out a routine check for debris following the closure of the road which crosses the runway. The vehicle responded late to the request to check the runway and thus was still conducting its inspection as the aircraft arrived. An occurrence report has been submitted to the civil authorities regarding this event and the fire crew have been re-briefed on their response time. However, no further action is necessary as air traffic control procedures worked correctly and ensured the safety of the aircraft.</p>

The discussions have been summarised in conclusions, which can be found on the website www.mintc.fi/english. The conclusions include the following points: a need for a new programme, going beyond the <I>European Road Safety Action Programme: Halving the number of road safety accident victims in the European Union by 2010&mdash;A shared responsibility</I>; the European road safety charter as a tool to involve stakeholders in sharing responsibility for reaching the target; and the necessity for new innovations, including new technology.</p>

	<p pid="d.228.5/1">Further to my Answer to QWA HL7624, I am pleased to report that progress has been made in solving problems with searching <I>Hansard</I> on the internet by name. Investigations revealed that the problem was not caused by any defect in the search engine. The actual source of the difficulty was an incompatibility between the mark-up of the electronic feed of <I>Hansard</I>, as output by the new system introduced this year for generating <I>Hansard</I> for both Houses in-house, and the mark-up of the feed previously used by the search engine. Those involved have been co-operating energetically to ensure that full functionality is restored. I am pleased to say that all new data and all data relating to the current session are now fully compatible with the search engine. A small amount of data relating to Lords <I>Hansard</I> from July 2006 to the end of the last Session in November, and to Commons <I>Hansard</I> from May 2006 to the end of the last Session, will be upgraded when the Bound Volumes of <I>Hansard</I> appear online, beginning during the Christmas Recess.</p>

	<p pid="d.230.0/1">Digital switchover is expected to have an impact on both transmitter power usage and consumer power usage.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/2">Digital transmission is more efficient than analogue in terms of power usage. Replacing the analogue terrestrial transmission network with a nationwide digital terrestrial television network will lead to a significant net reduction in energy usage by the transmission networks, estimated to be 186 GWh per year.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/3">Consumer power usage is expected to rise as a result of switchover, primarily because of the rapid increase in the take-up of set-top boxes, particularly for second sets, which would not be otherwise converted until replaced. The predicted level of the increase is dependent on a number of assumptions about usage and design of equipment in the market at the time of switchover. DCMS, DTI and Defra economists have estimated that the increase in consumer energy use of completing digital switchover in 2012 is likely to be between 966GWh and 2,816GWh per annum above that predicted for market take-up in the absence of a set switchover timetable. The increase is equivalent to a 0.37 per cent increase in domestic electricity consumption.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/4">The central estimate for the total impact of switchover is a net increase of 1,705GWh per year, but this would be reduced if industry can be encouraged to make more energy-efficient products. Work on this is being taken forward as part of the DTI usability action plan.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/5">Further details are contained in the <I>Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment: The timing of digital switchover</I>, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September 2005</phrase>. This was placed in the Library of the House of Commons at the time of publication, and is also available at <a href="http://www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk/consultations/con_ria_timingods.html">http://www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk/consultations/con_ria_timingods.html</a>. There are currently no plans to switch from analogue to digital radio.</p>
