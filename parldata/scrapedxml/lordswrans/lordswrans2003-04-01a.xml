	<p pid="a.113.2/2">A few states attending the conference could not agree the proposed consensus communique, despite a clear majority in favour of the recommendations and great efforts by the chair to find common ground. Therefore, the chairman, having consulted the participants, decided to issue a chairman's summary that outlined the key findings of the conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">Her Majesty's Government are keen to build on the notable gains and momentum of the conference. In addition to a follow-up meeting, under UK auspices, to exchange information in the margins of the UN biennial meeting in July, we are also supportive of other efforts in this field, such as the Dutch-Norwegian conference on brokering in Oslo in April. Over the next few years, the UK aims to forge partnerships across regions, promoting common understanding and widening and building support for the UN process in this important area.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.2/1">The Ministry of Defence's vaccines interactions research programme is studying whether the combination of vaccines and nerve agent pre-treatment (NAPS) tablets used to protect United Kingdom personnel during the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict can give rise to adverse health effects. The study involves four groups of 12 marmosets. One group was given the full range of vaccines which could have been administered during the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict (anthrax, plague, pertussis, yellow fever, cholera, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B, typhoid and meningitis); one was given pyridostigmine bromide, which is the active ingredient of NAPS; one was given both vaccines and pyridostigmine bromide, and the last was the control group, which received neither. The marmosets are being monitored over a period of 18 months and a number of indices, such as cognitive performance, EEG, sleep, endocrine functioning and immune responsiveness, are measured at regular intervals.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.2/2">Preliminary results from the first three months of the study are now available and are being presented by means of scientific poster at the British Toxicological Society's annual conference at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh. These preliminary results provide data on behaviour, sleep, EEG, body weight, cholinesterase inhibition and muscle function and indicate no apparent adverse health consequences three months following the administration of vaccine and/or pyridostigmine bromide. We have placed copies of the abstract and poster in the Library of the House. They will also be available on the Ministry of Defence's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.2/3">In addition, preliminary immunology results will be reported at the 3rd international meeting of the Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccines Research from 12 to <phrase class="date" code="">16 April</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.119.0/1">A new call-out order has been made under section 56 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to allow reservists to continue to be called out into permanent service to support operations in the former Yugoslavia. This replaces the existing order that expired on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase>. The new order is effective until <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/2">Since 1995 when NATO operations commenced in the former Yugoslavia, the reserve forces have historically provided around 10 per cent of the total UK manpower in theatre. At present, there are around 230 reservists from all three services serving in Bosnia and Kosovo. They are providing specialist skills in fields such as logistics, signals and medical support.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/3">I am also announcing two compulsory mobilisations under the new order. One is an extension of the existing deployment of small numbers of specialist medical personnel (anaesthetists and surgeons) to provide critical support to our forces in theatre. Since April 2002, we have called out 17 personnel to serve three-month tours. This will continue for another 12 months. We anticipate a requirement for around six personnel at any one time. Given the small numbers involved and our intention to spread the burden across the NHS, we are confident that the impact on patients in the UK will be minimal.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/4">The second compulsory mobilisation will be of further specialist medical and logistics personnel from the Territorial Army. They will provide general practice, ambulance, and postal and courier capabilities in theatre. In total, we will call out 150 personnel from 251 and 253 Field Ambulance (Volunteers) and up to 20 personnel from 87 and 88 Regiments Postal and Courier Services. Personnel will serve for up to seven months, with the first deployments in June.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.3/1">Defence Estates (DE) is being relaunched today as an agency of the Ministry of Defence with new responsibilities. This follows consideration, within Project Alexander, of how the defence estate should best be managed as a corporate asset. In particular, the new arrangements will clarify customer/supplier relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/2">The changes are in line with the overarching and comprehensive strategy for the defence estate set out in In Trust and On Trust in June 2000 and also represent a further application of the principles of Smart acquisition within the department.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/3">In future, Defence Estates will be responsible and accountable, through its chief executive, for managing the delivery of estate maintenance and new works to meet internal customers' requirements. This will be achieved by: managing the defence estate as a corporate asset; developing, maintaining and implementing an estate strategy, consistent with policies and standards (including environmental sustainability criteria); devising and implementing an agreed programme with customers that provides a corporate and long-term view of requirements consistent with the estate strategy; delivering the solutions and estate management services to meet the agreed estates programme to time, cost and quality; developing and maintaining an agreed core sites strategy; focusing MoD's activities onto fewer, larger sites; the management, maintenance and improvement of land, buildings and facilities to standards delivered, where appropriate, through robust and well-managed contracts with service providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/4">In parallel, and working closely with DE, six customer estate organisations (CEstOs) are being established to specify estate requirements in output terms for each of the main areas of the department (Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force, Defence Logistics Organisation, the Centre/Defence Procurement Agency, and the Permanent Joint Headquarters).</p>

	<p pid="a.120.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-07">7 October 2002</phrase> my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced the ending of the routine granting of exceptional leave on a country basis and a review of its use and scope to focus it on those who really need special humanitarian protection but do not qualify as refugees.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/2">In the past, exceptional leave has been used far too widely. It was only ever intended to be granted to those able to demonstrate compelling compassionate or humanitarian reasons for staying in the United Kingdom. Instead, the widespread use of exceptional leave has acted as a pull factor, encouraging economic migrants to apply for asylum in the United Kingdom in the belief that they will be given exceptional leave when their claim is rejected.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/3">That is why we have decided to replace the exceptional leave system with a new humanitarian protection system. From now on the UK will only offer international protection to those who really need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/4">From today humanitarian protection will be granted only to those who, though not refugees would, if removed, face in the country of return a serious risk to life or person arising from the death penalty, unlawful killing or torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/5">Under the new system those who qualify for humanitarian protection will be granted leave for three years, at which point a person with a continuing need for protection will be eligible to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom. A person with no continuing need will not get any further leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/6">The Secretary of State will also retain the discretion to grant limited leave to those who do not qualify for humanitarian protection or leave under the Immigration Rules. The circumstances in which discretionary leave will be granted will be defined and tightly focused. This leave will normally be granted for two periods of three years, but there is scope to grant shorter periods depending on the individual circumstances. Again, it will not be renewed unless a person continues to qualify for such leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/7">Both the humanitarian protection and discretionary leave systems will be far more focused and clearly defined than the exceptional leave system. Failed asylum seekers who do not fall into one of these categories will not be granted any leave and will be removed. We are determined that the asylum system will no longer be a short-cut to work or settlement in the UK. I believe that these measures, when taken alongside the provisions in the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, will take us even further forward in our efforts to reduce the number of unfounded asylum applicants seeking to abuse our immigration system.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.5/1">To date, there is no evidence worldwide that variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD) has ever been transmitted through blood. As a precautionary measure, all fresh frozen plasma (FFP) produced by the United Kingdom blood service uses single unit plasma from UK blood donors which has been leucodepleted to remove the white cells which evidence suggests may carry the greatest risk of transmitting vCJD. Although most UK FFP is not virally inactivated, high levels of safety are achieved by using single unit, as opposed to pooled plasma, by screening out potential high risk donors and by testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C before it is released to hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/2">The decision taken to import FFP from the United States for young babies and children born after <phrase class="date" code="1996-01-01">1 January 1996</phrase> will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable group who will not have been exposed to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy through the food chain. The National Blood Service is currently involved in negotiating for supplies of FFP for this group of patients and plans to have it available later this year. A commercially produced FFP product, sourced from the United States, is also available for the National Health Service to purchase.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.0/1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published its guidance on the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the treatment of dyspepsia in July 2000. The guidance made a number of recommendations intended to achieve the most clinically and cost-effectiveness use of PPIs. NICE estimated that its advice, if fully implemented, could lead to a reduction in the use of PPIs. Such a reduction has not yet occurred. We anticipate that the impetus better to target these treatments will increase when NICE publishes its clinical guideline on the primary management of dyspepsia, due later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.3/1">We are today publishing Making Change Happen, the Government's annual report on learning disability services. The report describes progress made in implementing the programme of action set out in the White Paper Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century (Cm 5086) and contains a response to Making Things Happen, the first annual report of the Learning Disability Task Force, published in January this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/2">People with learning disabilities are among the most socially excluded and vulnerable groups in society. In March 2001 we published Valuing People, which set out an ambitious and challenging cross-government programme to improve the services they use. Over the last year we have been able to report good progress with the Valuing People programme and are now pleased to be able to report that progress is continuing. Since Valuing People was published: more advocacy groups are receiving funding and councils are spending more on advocacy; more people with learning disabilities are receiving direct payments; more people with learning disabilities are in employment; more families with severely disabled children are receiving family support; the National Forum of People with Learning Difficulties has been set up to give people with learning disabilities a national voice. The forum has members on the Learning Disability Task Force, which is itself co-chaired by someone with a learning disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/3">Today's report describes the setting up of the basic framework for the implementation programme&mdash;the Valuing People support team, learning disability partnership boards, the National Forum of People with Learning Disabilities and the Learning Disability Task Force. We are now building on that framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/4">Earlier this year we were pleased to welcome the task force's first annual report. The report we are publishing today includes a response to the task force and confirms our readiness to work with it as it continues to monitor the implementation of the whole Valuing People programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/5">Today's report is written in an accessible form, using pictures and straightforward, jargon-free language. It is important that people with learning disabilities can see for themselves what is being done to improve the services they use.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/6">The Valuing People Support Team has made an excellent start in developing links with learning disability partnership boards and supporting them as they implement the White Paper's proposals at local council level. We can confirm that the support team will continue its work until 2006. We can also confirm the continuation of the Implementation Support Fund and the Learning Disability Development Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/7">Valuing People said that it would take a minimum of five years for its programme to be implemented. We have made good progress towards that target in the two years since its publication.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.5/1">I refer the noble Lord to the letter written to him by Mr Nick Matheson, chief executive of the Government Car and Despatch Agency, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Nick Matheson, Chief Executive of the Government Car and Despatch Agency, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/3">The right honourable Lord Macdonald of Tradeston, Minister for the Cabinet Office, has asked me in my capacity as the chief executive responsible for the Government Car and Despatch Agency to reply to your Parliamentary Question about the number of Cabinet Office vehicles converted to use both petrol and liquid petroleum gas (LPG); the cost of these conversions; the amount of each type of fuel used; and the average cost per mile of the fuel used by each vehicle before and after conversion.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/4">There are three vehicles provided to Cabinet Office, a car and two light vans, that run on both petrol and LPG. The car came into service in 2000 and the vans in June 2002. These vehicles were purchased already converted by the manufacturer to run on dual fuel so there were no after-purchase conversion costs incurred by this agency. A before and after comparison of running costs would be unhelpful and misleading because the vehicles did not replace similar models.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/5">All dual fuel vehicles switch automatically between petrol and LPG during their use as determined by their fuel management systems. It is impossible therefore to say with any accuracy what consumption against each type of fuel is. However since February 2002 I have spent &pound;2,461 on petrol and &pound;2,105 on LPG. There are two reasons for the apparently high petrol costs. Firstly, the two LPG vans were introduced in the summer of 2002 and had to run on petrol only for the first 3,000 miles for technical reasons and secondly, a litre of petrol costs roughly twice as much as a litre of LPG at the pump.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/6">I am constantly looking at ways to lessen the impact of our operations on the environment. In addition to the three vehicles mentioned above I also provide two electric-powered light vans and a hybrid petrol/electric car to the Cabinet Office. All our electric and duel fuel light vans are registered with the City of Westminster's environmentally friendly vehicle scheme. This agency also participates in the THINK @bout London electric car project. This vehicle also operates from the Cabinet Office.</p>
