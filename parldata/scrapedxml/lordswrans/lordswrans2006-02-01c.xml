	<p pid="c.54.9/1">The Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) was established in 1997 as a successor body to the Resource Allocation Group. ACRA is an independent committee comprising National Health Service management, general practitioners and academics. A list of ACRA members is shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.54.9/2">ACRA's role is to ensure equity in resource allocation by continuously overseeing the development of the weighted capitation formula. ACRA's membership is kept under continuous review. There is no set limit on the length of time someone can remain a member. New members are selected on the basis of their expertise and experience, or their position within the NHS. The appointment of members is approved by the Department of Health's director of finance, and the chair of ACRA. Membership is withdrawn either when people are no longer holding an appropriate position, or when they resign from ACRA.</p>

It did not condone the actions taken and said that it could breach its code of conduct. It is going to look into it.

The group is due to meet again in February 2006 and is expected to meet bi-monthly thereafter. Meetings will be chaired jointly by the lead Home Office Minister and by the Solicitor-General with secretariat functions provided jointly by officials from the Home Office and the office of the Solicitor-General. The primary function of the group is to advise ministers on policy; as such it has no allocated financial resources for specific programmes of work. The stakeholder group was established prior to the launch of the draft UK Action Plan on Human Trafficking but was not set up specifically to advise on the consultation. It will continue to meet to discuss a range of issues relating to trafficking in human beings after the end of the consultation period. We believe these arrangements are adequate and appropriate to the remit of the group.</p>

	<p pid="c.60.2/1">There is no reliable estimate of the red squirrel population anywhere in the UK because it is very difficult to carry out an accurate census. Numbers are also subject to significant fluctuation depending on environmental factors and breeding success, but our estimate is 140,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.2/2">At present those working on red squirrel conservation in England believe that the population in England may be somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000. A large proportion of these are in Kielder Forest.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.2/3">The species action plan for red squirrel does not include an estimate of the existing population or a target population figure.</p>

	<p pid="c.60.5/1">The Student Loans Company (SLC) does not borrow to make loans to students. Money is paid to students by SLC on behalf of the Secretary of State, and the Department for Education and Skills makes appropriate funds available to SLC for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.5/2">The planned resource cost to the Government of providing up-front loans for fees for (a) English domiciled students attending UK HEIs will be &pound;131 million in financial year 2006&ndash;07, rising to &pound;324 million in financial year 2007&ndash;08; and for (b) students from other European Union countries attending English and Welsh HEIs will be &pound;10 million in financial year 2006&ndash;07, rising to &pound;25 million in financial year 2007&ndash;08. The assumptions for fee loans for these estimates are that 25 per cent of new students in 2006&ndash;07 are charged the standard rate fee and 75 per cent charged the maximum fee, producing an average fee of &pound;2,550. The figures also assume 80 per cent take-up of fee deferral by both new and continuing students and 50 per cent of academic year expenditure in the same financial year, 50 per cent in the next. The resource figures are calculated at a fee loan RAB charge of 33 per cent</p>

	<p pid="c.61.2/1">Financial markets react on an ongoing basis to a wide range of factors including announcements providing new information. Markets can sometimes move noticeably in the short term in response to specific events or announcements, particularly where these were unanticipated by the market. However, it is very difficult to isolate the longer-term impact on financial markets from any one announcement.</p>
