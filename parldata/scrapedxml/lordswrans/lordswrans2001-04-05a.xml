Our approach in tackling both forms of crime as set out in the publication Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead is to encourage a co-ordinated inter-agency effort and the additional funding will be allocated to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the security and intelligence agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-30">30 March</phrase>, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) considered the independent assessment from DNV Consulting of the public health risk due to BSE infectivity from burning cattle during the present foot and mouth disease outbreak. This assessment was placed in the Libraries of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-15">15 March</phrase>. Taking account of comments from SEAC and the Environment Agency, this assessment has been revised to include the possible BSE risks from burying cattle carcasses on farm and in landfill.

	<p pid="a.129.3/1">The Government's Green Paper, Towards full employment in a modern society, sets out the modern definition of full employment as employment opportunity for all, all over the UK. The Government have set ambitious targets for the end of the decade: a higher percentage of people in employment than ever before; an increase in the lone parent employment rate to 70 per cent; and a narrower gap in the employment rates for minority ethnic groups, disabled people and other disadvantaged groups and areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/2">However, this is only a start. Full employment is not a fixed number. Higher, sustainable, levels of employment can be achieved by continuing to run a strong, stable economy; reforming tax and benefits to make work pay; improving education and skills; and opening up jobs to all sections of society by offering more help and more choices to those facing the greatest disadvantage--especially young people, the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities, lone parents and people from minority ethnic groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.2/2">Letter to Lord Willoughby de Broke from the National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales, Office for National Statistics, Mr Len Cook, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-05">5 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question on why the Office for National Statistics (ONS) now requires monthly rather than quarterly returns from companies in the service sector and whether this is consistent with the Government's stated aim of reducing the administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.[HL1464]</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/4">There is strong demand for users for more frequent and timely information on changes in the output of the service industry, which now represents two-thirds of the economy. To meet this demand, ONS is developing a monthly index of services which requires the collection of monthly data. This index will match the index of industrial production, which is also a monthly indicator.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/5">The ONS is extremely conscious of its responsibility to bear down on the costs to business of complying with its surveys. Minimising the burden on suppliers of data is one of the ONS's five key values. The ONS produces, as part of its Business Plan, an Annual Compliance Plan which charts the compliance costs by inquiry; contains details of compliance reducing initiatives that are either being undertaken, or are in the pipeline; contains the compliance target for the current year and shows the profile of compliance costs over a four-year timescale.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/6">Regular reviews of surveys are carried out to examine whether there is a continuing need for them. An integral part of the review process is to seek respondents' views and to ascertain whether changes to either the forms or sample can be made which reduce the burden on respondents whilst at the same time maintaining the quality of data.</p>
