	<p pid="a.79.2/1">Two new pieces of European legislation, part of the EU thematic strategy on pesticides, were adopted and published by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-24">24 November 2009</phrase>. These were:</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market; andDirective 2009/128/EC establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">The regulation will apply directly in all EU member states from <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-14">14 June 2011</phrase>. The regulation introduces hazard criteria that will assess plant protection product active substances on their intrinsic hazard rather than their risks in use. Only substances passing these criteria will then enter the process of risk assessment. The transitional arrangements mean that these criteria will apply either when new active substances enter the regulatory system or when existing active substances are considered for renewal. It will therefore be some years before these hazard criteria have an impact on the availability of existing active substances.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/4">EU member states are required to implement the directive into national legislation by <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-25">25 November 2011</phrase>. One of the aims of this directive is to facilitate the further reduction of risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment. The directive provides member states with discretion on how this might be achieved. The Government will be consulting shortly on the approach to be taken when implementing the directive into national law. The new legislation does not apply to fertilisers.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.5/1">Defra funds a wide-ranging research programme on alternatives to conventional pesticides as part of its long-standing pesticides research programme. This has included work on the potential use of semiochemicals in pest control for a number of years. Collaborative Government research with industry has included using semiochemicals for integrated pest management (IPM), in combination with resistant varieties, biological control and more targeted or reduced use of pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/2">This applied work is complemented by more fundamental research funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Department for International Development on other target species at UK institutes and universities.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/3">In terms of performance alone it is unlikely that direct use of semiochemicals as individual control tools for specific targets will match that of conventional crop protection. Their role is more likely to be as part of an integrated strategy (eg as successful monitoring tools) with any wider commercial uptake being more limited where highly effective pest control and minimal cost input is required to meet market demands.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/4">The Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive is the government body responsible for authorising plant protection products. CRD operates a biopesticides (including semiochemicals) scheme that has reduced fees for dealing with these types of substances. CRD also has a biopesticides champion who is able to help companies understand the regulatory system.</p>

The design, number of exemptions and whether or not a carbon tax is applied to companies in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme are just a few of the many variables that would have a significant impact on the carbon price required to raise &#8364;50 billion of additional revenue by 2020. Raising such a tax would also have second order impacts on receipts from other taxes that would differ widely across the EU.

	<p pid="a.81.6/5">There are currently no plans to make programmes mandatory for all perpetrators of domestic violence. Domestic abuse offenders have diverse needs, some of which can be met by other interventions. As such, not all perpetrators of domestic violence will be suitable for or benefit from the range of programmes that are available. However, there are a number of requirements which can be attached to community sentences or custodial licences, in addition to a supervision requirement, which may be effective for domestic abuse offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.6/6">Domestic abuse issues can also be addressed on a structured individual basis as well as within a domestic abuse programme. Any intervention with an offender should be completed within a framework of inter-agency collaboration and protection of known victims.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.5/1">Prior to being given a marketing authorisation, all veterinary medicines, including those containing antibiotics, have to be carefully assessed to ensure that they are safe for the consumer when used in food-producing animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.5/2">The supply of antibiotic veterinary medicinal products in the UK is controlled by veterinary prescription. Like all veterinary medicines used to treat animals raised for food, maximum residue levels (MRL) are determined internationally and farmers are required to withhold animal products from the market for a period of time determined by scientific data to ensure that any residue is below the MRL. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) carries out wide-ranging surveillance of food-producing animals for residues of veterinary medicinal products including antibiotics and other substances in accordance with EU legislation to check that the MRL is not exceeded. Results of all tests are published on the VMD website. Non-compliant samples are rarely found. The Food Standards Agency is consulted when high concentrations of residues are found but has not expressed concern about the risks to human health.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.5/3">Furthermore, the Suspected Adverse Reaction Surveillance Scheme (SARSS) is a national pharmacovigilance scheme run by the VMD. The scheme aims to record and monitor reports of suspected adverse reactions to veterinary medicines in both animals (any species) and humans. The VMD publishes UK SARSS reports annually in the <I>Veterinary Record</I>. There are no suspected adverse reactions reported as a result of antibiotics occurring in food from farmed animals.</p>

Consequently, the costs recorded in any one year may reflect in large part redundancy activity from earlier years.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.5/1">The inspection fees listed in Schedule 2 to the Plant Health (Import Inspection Fees) (England) (Amendment) Regulations (SI 2009/2053) are set according to the level of checks required under the plant health directive (2000/29 EC) to provide assurance that the imported plants or plant produce are free from quarantine plant pests and diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.5/2">An annual review by the European Commission determines the trades eligible for levels of inspection below 100 per cent, based on records of inspections and interceptions over the previous three years. A working group held in June this year agreed the addition of one new trade, the removal of two trades, and changes to the levels of inspection on 11 trades to take account of new data on compliance. Member states reported an increase in the number of interceptions of quarantine pests and diseases associated with imports of dianthus from Israel and Kenya and roses from India, Uganda and Zambia, resulting in an increase in the level of inspection on those trades and a corresponding increase to the fees. Conversely, there was a reduction in the number of interceptions associated with some other trades (eg citrus fruit from Honduras and Israel) which resulted in a reduction in the level of inspection and fees for those trades.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.5/3">These inspections are undertaken by the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), which supports the risk-based approach to such inspections adopted by the Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.3/1">The Ministry of Justice has confirmed that the Coroners and Justice Bill that would allow for prosecution in the UK for cases of genocide perpetrated overseas has been enacted and is scheduled to come in to force on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-01">1 February 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.3/2">Whilst I am unable to go into the details of individual cases, I can confirm that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) Counter Terrorism Division is responsible for national prosecutions of war crimes and crimes against humanity and the Crimes against Humanity Unit of the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has the national mandate to investigate these types of crime. When the evidence is passed to the CPS Counter Terrorism Division, it is reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. If there is sufficient evidence of a war crime or crime against humanity, it is highly likely that a prosecution would meet the public interest test. In anticipation of retrospective legislation introduced in the Coroners and Justice Bill, the MPS continues to consult with the Crown Prosecution Service and partnership agencies in respect of any alleged perpetrator that could potentially be prosecuted under this new legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/1">The Sea Fishing (Landing and Weighing of Herring, Mackerel and Horse Mackerel) Order 2009 (SI 2009/1850) implements the provisions of Commission Regulation 1542/2007 on landing and weighing procedures for herring, mackerel and horse mackerel. That regulation sets out special measures necessary for the effective monitoring and control of high volume landings of pelagic species. It applies only to landings in excess of 10 tonnes. The use of designated ports is a crucial part of the control arrangements. The decision on which ports to designate took into account existing industry practice, whether the port had the necessary infrastructure in place to be able to comply with the requirements of the regulation and the potential impact of designating a port on the overall levels of control needed to monitor pelagic landings effectively. Landings of quantities of less than 10 tonnes of herring, mackerel and horse mackerel may continue to be made at any other port, subject to any further limitations in the vessel's fishing licence.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.3/1">It is not possible to compare the two bridges as they have different characteristics which need to be considered when setting the toll levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/2">The Severn is run by a private sector consortium and the legislation seeks to apply a clear structure to give the concessionaire confidence that it would be able to meet its liabilities in relation to the large risk it took on board. The legislation requires an increase in the tolls each year calculated in line with the retail price index (RPI). The Secretary of State does not have the power to set an increase at a different rate without the agreement of the concessionaire.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/3">The Humber Bridge is run by a company made up of the four relevant local authorities who borrowed significant public money to enable the bridge to be built. The legislation is concerned with ensuring the Bridge Board meets its obligations for managing the bridge and repaying the debt, but because of the different risks does not restrict the Secretary of State to annual RPI increases.</p>
