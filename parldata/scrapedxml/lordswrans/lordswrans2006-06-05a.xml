Complaints about the medical treatment, including the treatment of mental health problems, of two detainees at Yarl's Wood were received in 2005. At IND's request, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons subsequently carried out a review of healthcare provision at Yarl's Wood with particular reference to the support and treatment of detainees with mental and traumatic stress disorders.

	<p pid="a.141.5/1">The results of the Irish four-area badger culling trial were published in <i>Preventive Veterinary Medicine</i> in January 2005. The authors reported a 60-90 per cent. reduction in the rate at which herds were becoming subject to confirmed restrictions. The total number of herd restrictions in the removal areas for the study period was almost 58 per cent. lower than in the reference area. Therefore, the study showed that badger removal can be effective in reducing the incidence of bovine tuberculosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/2">However, caution needs to be exercised in directly applying these results to England due to differences in badger densities, ecology and cattle husbandry techniques.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/3">The results from the Republic of Ireland will be considered alongside other evidence when making a decision on badger culling in England.</p>

They are currently developing their preferred operating models for re-contracting the delivery of the service from April 2007. Some RDAs will move to a single regional contract, others to a sub-regional model. All RDAs are clear that local contact with the business community and local delivery of services is vital to the continuing success and development of Business Link. Each RDA is developing its operational strategy to ensure that local contact with the business community and service delivery is retained and enhanced. The nature of the contractual model should make no difference to the level of contact achieved.</p>

In this regard we note that the European Commission has issued a letter of formal complaint to the Irish Government about the effects of drift netting on the conservation status of salmon. This is the first step towards a possible action in the European Court of Justice against Ireland in respect of its failure to meet obligations towards salmon under the EC Habitats Directive. Unless and until the Commission formally institutes such action, its case against the Irish Government is not a matter of public record, nor is the UK Government given the opportunity to comment.</p>

IID may be caused by a number of agents including campylobacter and salmonella. It is also estimated that for every report to national surveillance for salmonella spp. (from all sources), there are approximately three cases in the community. In addition, the ratio of infection in the community to reports to national surveillance for campylobacter spp. (from all sources) is approximately eight to one.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.5/1">Malnutrition among Iraqi children, which has been a serious concern since the early 1990s, appears to have steadily increased since the UN Children's Fund's (UNICEF) Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, undertaken in 2000. This survey reported an acute malnutrition rate of 5.9 per cent. among children under five years old. The latest report on child malnutrition in Iraq is the Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis, produced by the Iraqi Central Office of Statistics and Information Technology with support from UNICEF and the World Food Programme. This survey found an acute malnutrition rate of 9 per cent. among children under five years old.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/2">UNICEF considers that this increase in malnutrition is the result of a range of factors. These include the lingering effects of war and sanctions in the 1990s, plus ongoing conflict and insecurity.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/3">To tackle levels of acute malnutrition, the Iraqi Government need to ensure that adequate supplies of food reach the poorest families, while also working to tackle poverty and ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth in the long term. The Department for International Development (DfID) helped to ensure that Iraq's public distribution system (PDS) for food was re-established quickly after the conflict in 2003. DfID is now supporting the Iraqi Government to develop economic policies:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/4" class="indent">to protect the poorest in Iraq who are dependent on the PDS, by designing safety net support programmes targeted at those who really need state assistance;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/5" class="indent">at the same time, to reduce the economic distortions created by distributing food, virtually free, to the entire population. Reform of the subsidy system will help to encourage economic growth and job creation, so that more Iraqi families can buy their own food.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.8/1">I am advised that the murders which took place at Darkley Church, and that of Margaret Hearst, come within the remit of the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) which was set up to review unresolved deaths, relating to the security situation, from 1168 to April 1998. One of the aims of the HET is to consider such cases to identify any potential investigative leads which may result in possible prosecutions. As part of the review process, the HET will liaise with the families of victims to keep them advised of progress with the aim of providing resolution, where possible, either by judicial or non-judicial means. Until such reviews commence, it is too early to comment on the strength of any investigative leads and what the outcome will be. However, I understand that in the Darkley cases no one has been made amenable to date and as such there may be outstanding suspects. In the case of Margaret Hearst, I understand that four persons have been convicted and a review of this case will determine whether or not there are any outstanding offenders in relation to this offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.2/1">The guidance framework on the withholding of National Health Service treatment from violent and abusive patients was issued by the Department of Health in 2001 following on from the cross-government Zero Tolerance campaign introduced in 2000, to tackle violence in the NHS. The guidance highlighted that the withholding of NHS treatment from violent and abusive patients will always be a last resort, but should be an option available to managers and staff working in all NHS trusts, with certain exemptions including those requiring urgent medical treatment or under the age of 16. The guidance made explicit that all NHS trusts develop local policies on withholding treatment from violent and abusive patients in consultation with independent legal advice on the terms and application of such a policy; and trusts must also have in place clear defensible policies and procedures outlining the circumstances where the withholding of treatment is justifiable.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/2">Since then the Government created the NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS) in April 2003. The NHS SMS has launched a comprehensive strategy, which has replaced work previously undertaken under the NHS Zero Tolerance campaign. The NHS SMS strategy places a particular emphasis on the introduction of preventive measures to stop violent incidents occurring in the first place. In 2004, the NHS SMS issued guidance covering the application of this strategy in the context of tackling the whole issue of non-physical assaults on NHS staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.0/1">The application from Altnaveigh House was assessed as not meeting the reconciliation criteria under the Peace II Programme as it was not perceived as contributing to building positive relationships with other communities. This application is currently going through a review process and it would be inappropriate to comment on the outcome of the application until that review process is complete.

This has five strands:</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/3" class="indent">building positive relationships;</p>

On the reconciliation criterion, each application must satisfy the first strand and at least two further strands contained in the definition.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.5/1">Information on the period of delay between notification that bail conditions have been met and the time of release of the prisoner is not collected centrally and could not be provided except at disproportionate cost. However, it is normal practice for prisons to release a prisoner on the day of notification unless the notification is received very late in the day. When notified of a bail decision by a court, prisons will release a prisoner held on remand as soon as possible once conditions, if any, have been met and checks have been made that there are no other outstanding warrants applying to the prisoner. Prisons and courts have arrangements in place to allow governors to receive recognisances and sureties in respect of defendants remanded in custody and to ensure that governors are informed when such recognisances and sureties are received by others authorised to receive them. The requirement to release is set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 at paragraph 19.7. Prison Service Order 6100 sets out guidance for governors on the handling of bail issues.</p>

Staff will also question the prisoner to ascertain what establishment he or she was last discharged from, and will also confirm this from the Prison Service inmate database. When a prisoner leaves at the end of his sentence his record is held at the discharge prison. The time lapse before the records reach the receiving prison is about seven days as they are sent through the postal system. There was a proposal to hold the records in a central area, but this was rejected by the Prison Service Management Board 2000.</p>

The department has also recently supported an Ofsted survey of effective fieldwork practice in schools and how this supports pupils' motivation and learning in geography. The results of both surveys will be published in the autumn. As part of the emerging education-outside-the-classroom manifesto, 10 working groups of leading organisations from different out-of-classroom learning sectors (including field studies) submitted reports to the department on the benefits of out-of-classroom learning, barriers to participation and practical recommendations to remove those barriers.</p>
