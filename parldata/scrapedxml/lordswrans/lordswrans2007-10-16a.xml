	<p pid="a.39.2/1">Since April 2004, the UK aerospace industry has won &pound;15.3 million of government funding through the technology programme under the key technology area of advanced materials calls. The split for each of the three financial years is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/2">FY 2004-05 &pound;3.98 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/3">FY 2005-06 &pound;9.16 million; and</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/4">FY 2006-07 &pound;2.16 million</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/5">In addition, there are two large collaborative aerospace projects that include advanced materials technology development activity: integrated wing and environmentally friendly engine. Integrated wing is a &pound;34 million programme over three years with just under 50 per cent funded through the technology programme. Of that amount, &pound;11.3 million will come from the TSB and &pound;5.7 million from regional development agencies in the south-west and south-east, Invest Northern Ireland and the Welsh Assembly Government. Industry will make up the remainder of the funding. The environmentally friendly engine is a &pound;95 million programme over five years, with around 50 per cent funding from the technology programme, &pound;30 million from the TSB, and over &pound;13 million from the regional development agencies in the south-west, north-west, East Midlands, Invest Northern Ireland and the Ministry of Defence; with the rest from industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/6">Aerospace also benefits substantially from the support for the National Composites Network, a node of the Materials Knowledge Transfer Network, for which the TSB is funding &pound;4.75 million and the regions are providing &pound;12.3 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">If the Government confirm their preliminary view that industry should be allowed the option of investing in new nuclear power stations, we have proposed to carry out a strategic siting assessment (SSA) to assess potential locations for new nuclear build. BERR is currently consulting on a proposed SSA process, alongside the main &quot;in principle&quot; nuclear consultation. We have proposed that the SSA would be based on robust and transparent criteria, on which we would consult publicly, and would be used as the basis to assess any potential locations for new nuclear power stations nominated by interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/2">With regard to the possible future use of existing sites owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), NDA has received queries from a number of energy companies about the potential use of these sites for future new nuclear build and will pass on any information requested about the sites that is already in the public domain on a without prejudice basis. We have not received any proposals for new nuclear power stations in the vicinity of these or any other sites but would expect to receive proposals at the time in the proposed SSA process when the Government invite nominations based on agreed SSA criteria. The SSA itself would be undertaken only if the Government confirm their preliminary view on the question of new nuclear build following the current nuclear consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/3">An indicative timetable for the SSA process is set out within the Government's SSA consultation document and suggests that the nominations process could begin in mid-2008. Any nominations for the building of new nuclear power stations at existing NDA sites would be assessed in accordance with the SSA criteria. Additionally, any future alternative uses of existing NDA sites would need to comply with the Nuclear Installations Act and other relevant safety, security, environmental and planning regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.0/1">The ruling made by Mrs Justice Dobbs dismissed five out of six counts of the judicial review. On the count that was upheld, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has now issued revised guidance on drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease making clear its compliance with equality legislation. NICE is currently conducting a review of the methods which underpin its health technology appraisal process and will be carrying out a consultation on its findings later this year. The department, along with other stakeholders, will be participating in that consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.3/1">The Government recognise the importance of specialist foot services for people with diabetes and believe they are a key component of a comprehensive diabetes service. The <I>Diabetes Commissioning Toolkit</I>, published in November 2006, sets out a best practice specification for diabetes care. This includes a range of specialist services for the prevention and management of complications in a number of areas, including foot care, and suggests a number of key outcomes to measure progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/2">The Diabetes UK survey has highlighted areas where there may be gaps in provision and we hope that National Health Service organisations will use this information, together with the <I>Diabetes Commissioning Toolkit</I> and the National Diabetes Support Team's diabetic foot guide, to plan their services in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.2/1">Libraries play an important role in a democratic society by promoting access to a wide range of knowledge, ideas and literature. By its nature this includes controversial as well as moderate views, and library staff have great experience in both selecting their stock and managing that which contains radical views.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">Public libraries are run by local authorities, and it is right that the 149 library authorities in England retain the local autonomy to make management decisions themselves, such as on issues of stock selection. As such the Government will not be requesting all authorities to review their collections.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/3">However, there is a significant amount of good work already going on in libraries across the country to manage controversial stock&mdash;including placing it in the context of a broad range of views&mdash;engage communities and support community cohesion. In order to make use of this existing expertise and bet practice, the Government have commissioned the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) to work with the public library sector&mdash;primarily through the Society of Chief Librarians&mdash;to prepare guidance for library authorities on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/4">The primary objectives of the guidance will be to raise awareness in the library sector of the legislation in this area, including the Terrorism Act 2006; to provide advice on management and operational activity regarding the selection of controversial stock; and to share best practice in promoting social cohesion.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.5/1">An investigation by the UK and the US led to two Libyan nationals being charged with the Lockerbie bombing. The Libyan Government's initial refusal to hand the suspects over for trial resulted in international diplomatic pressure being brought to bear on Libya, led by the UK, US and French Governments. Action took the form of a number of UN Security Council Resolutions and European Union measures imposing economic and other sanctions. In 1999, Libya handed over the two suspects for trial. One was convicted and the other acquitted. Sanctions were formally lifted in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/1">The main skills shortages reported by employers in the most recent National Employers Skills Survey (2005) are: technical and practical, customer-handling, oral communication, problem-solving, team working, written communication, literacy management, office/admin, foreign languages, general IT and IT professional skills. It is not feasible to collect from employers highly specific details of the technical or practical skills which are in short supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/2">The Government's 14 to 19 reform programme is focused on ensuring that every young person&mdash;regardless of their background or learning style&mdash;is equipped with the skills they need for work and life, and that employers need. From September 2008 diplomas will be introduced which will offer 14 to 19 year-olds an integrated programme that uniquely combines essential skills and knowledge, hands on experience and employer focused learning that will prepare young people for work or further study.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/3">Diplomas will give young people first-hand experience and insight into the working life and a broad-based understanding of one or more business/industry sectors of employment&mdash;preparing them to make informed choices of career and further education.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/4">Through the package of reforms set out in World Class Skills, the Government are giving employers the opportunity to exert real leverage and decision-making over both the content and delivery of skills and employment programmes. The new UK Commission for Employment and Skills will strengthen the employer voice at the heart of the system. It will provide vigorous, expert, external challenge to the skills and employment system at all levels to ensure it is delivering the services that employers and individuals need. We expect the UK commission to be fully operational by April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/5">The network of 25 sector skills councils play a vital role in ensuring that the future skills needs of their sector are met. We are now in the process of reforming and relicensing sector skills councils with a remit sharply focused on: raising employer investment, articulating the future skills needs of their sector, and ensuring that the supply of skills and qualifications is driven by employers. Through their sector skills councils, employers have a leading role in the reform and development of vocational qualifications for their sector, and the QCA is now piloting approaches to make it easier for employers to have their own training programmes nationally recognised and accredited.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/6">In addition, we are improving and expanding Train to Gain to help employers identify and address their skills needs. Skills brokers help employers to identify their skills needs and source the provision that will suit them best. Skills for Life and first full level 2 training is free to the employer. The Skills Pledge gives employers an opportunity to publicly demonstrate their commitment to investing not only in their businesses by investing in the skills of their employees. Over 250 employers, covering more than 2.5 million employees have now made the Skills Pledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/7">FE colleges and providers also have a crucial part to play. The system will be more streamlined, focused on delivering a market-oriented service, and we will be allocating public funds according to customer choice. The Framework for Excellence, the new employer standard and the review of the national Improvement Strategy will ensure colleges and providers thrive and succeed in a new demand-led environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/10">The majority of public service schemes are unfunded schemes, which means that they do not have pension funds to invest. The Local Government Pension Scheme is a funded scheme: investment decisions taken by local authorities with responsibilities for the management and investment of pension funds within this scheme are a matter for those individual authorities acting within a statutory framework&mdash;the Local Government Pension Scheme (Management and Investment of Funds) Regulations 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">Ministers have not held discussions with the Universities and Colleges Admission Service (UCAS) regarding the requirement for students to take United Kingdom clinical aptitude tests as part of the selection process for certain medical courses. Admissions policies are rightly a matter for the institutions themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/2">Where these tests are used, it will usually form part of a broader process of selection designed to ensure that candidates have the full range of skills required to work in these professions. Test fees will often be waived for eligible candidates.</p>
