	<p pid="a.201.8/1">It is for abattoirs to determine how best to recoup any increases in any of their costs, including those that might arise from charging for some of the costs incurred by MHS in enforcing controls on cattle aged over 30 months. Abattoirs could pass costs to their customers, absorb them themselves, pass them back to farmers or share them among all three parties. The way in which costs are handled will depend on trading conditions and the nature of the product. In order to gain an indication of the potential impact on producers and abattoirs of the responsibility and cost-sharing proposals, we assumed that farmers would bear two thirds and abattoirs would bear one third of the costs of the three proposals affecting abattoirs (see impact assessment, section 2.1.1). Producers could expect to bear less than this when abattoirs were actively seeking supplies of cattle aged over 30 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.6/1">In May 2007, the Government introduced a revised impact assessment process to improve clarity and transparency of new regulations. This has increased the focus on the costs and benefits associated with regulations, supported by a strengthened ministerial declaration that has helped bolster the quality of this analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.6/2">The revised impact assessment process has placed greater weight on post implementation reviews, with the central guidance stating this should be carried out after three years (depending on the nature of the policy).

	<p pid="a.207.6/3">These revisions complement new arrangements introduced by the Office of the Leader of the House to carry out standardised post-legislative scrutiny.

	<p pid="a.215.2/1">The Government and other international partners consider that the Juba peace process was a success, resulting in agreement between the Lord's Resistance Army and Ugandan Government delegations on a number of important issues. Despite the failure of the two sides to sign a final peace agreement, it is important that the gains made by the Juba process are not lost. The UK and its partners in the international community are committed to improving the situation in the north through continued financial assistance and support to the Ugandan Government's Peace, Recovery and Development Plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.5/1">The End-of-Life Vehicles Regulations 2003 place an obligation on vehicle manufacturers and professional importers to provide dismantling and other environmental information for each type of new vehicle put on the market. The regulations apply to passenger cars and light vans, and are enforced on behalf of BERR by the Vehicle Certification Agency. No such obligation applies in respect of other vehicles. However, I understand that the International Dismantling Information System (IDIS), established by manufacturers, is prepared to consider any approach from the dismantling sector to include treatment data on heavy commercial vehicles in its database.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.2/1">The End-of-Life Vehicles Regulations 2003 require all vehicles to be treated at authorised treatment facilities (ATFs), and for vehicles to be depolluted prior to further treatment, whether at the same facility or elsewhere. The majority of shredder operators are also ATFs. Shredding of undepolluted vehicles is not permissible under the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.5/1">Yes we do. Now that the Commission's assessment of the block exemption is public, officials have been in discussion with representative groups from all areas of the industry, including the aftermarket. We recognise the potential difficulties highlighted by the &quot;Right to Repair Campaign&quot; and will address these with the Commission. These meetings are very helpful in forming our final policy position.</p>
