	<p pid="a.222.2/1">No individual or body in Government monitors the pricing of telephone use. Ofcom, the independent national regulator, has duties to monitor and report on communications markets, including telecommunications. It publishes a number of such reports annually that can be found via its website. These include reporting on prices, consumer satisfaction, choice and value in those markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/2">In addition, Ofcom has powers under the significant market power framework to impose charges following a finding of market dominance. Over the past few years, it has deregulated virtually all retail markets and hence focuses on the regulation of wholesale services. With the implementation of the new EU framework, Ofcom now also has powers to impose maximum charges on specific telephone number ranges for the purposes of consumer protection, as well as having Competition Act powers to deal with abuse of dominance issues.</p>
