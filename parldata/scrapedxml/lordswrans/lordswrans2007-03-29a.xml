	<p pid="a.291.8/1">Farming gives rise to a range of complex impacts relating to the environment and health. These impacts can be positive as well as negative and many of them are external to farming so that the costs or benefits are met by other sectors or the general public</p>
	<p pid="a.291.8/2">Defra and the devolved Administrations commissioned research by Eftec to develop <I>A Framework for Environmental Accounts for Agriculture</I>. Published in July 2004, the study provided initial evidence on significant positive and negative environmental externalities of UK agriculture. The costs of externalities, including water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, were estimated at &pound;1.4 billion and the positive impacts, including biodiversity and landscape, were valued at &pound;1 billion. This study was seen as a first step in a long-term development process, and a further independent study has now been commissioned by Defra. This study, to be completed in summer 2007, will aim to refine and develop environmental accounts. As more reliable estimates are developed, the accounts will have a valuable role in setting priorities for agricultural policy and as an evidence base for measuring the sustainability of agriculture. The study will also consider the feasibility of developing sector valuations to provide evidence in terms of different types of agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.8/3">As part of an ongoing research project, Cranfield University has used life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the resource use and environmental burdens arising from the production of key agricultural commodities. The research has modelled organic and non-organic (contemporary conventional) production in the UK, and thus explicitly sets out the resource use and burdens arising from the relevant systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.8/4">Farming also gives rise to externalities relatingto animal health and welfare. By way of illustration, Defra commissioned the Scottish Agricultural College to undertake research into the benefits of tighter welfare standards in the production of meat chickens, measured by the public's willingness to pay for lower stocking densities.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.8/1">Entry-level stewardship (ELS) is open to all farmers and land managers. Acceptance into the scheme is guaranteed, provided applicants include a sufficient number of management options to meet a points target based on the size of their holding.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.8/2">Higher-level stewardship (HLS) is a discretionary scheme and applications are expected to contributeto one or more of the five primary objectives ofthe scheme. The key characteristics of the English countryside have been outlined in the definition of over 150 joint character areas, each of which has priority targets for the management of a variety of features. All HLS applications are scored directly against these targets, and those applications which meet or exceed a pre-determined threshold may be offered an agreement. Applications which do not address the relevant priority targets for their area will be rejected.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.8/3">The number of HLS applications which may be rejected in the future will depend very much on the volume of applications received and the available budget. This is difficult to predict accurately as the potential for further uptake will depend on the outcome of discussions with the European Commission about the budget for the Rural Development Programme (2007-13).</p>

	<p pid="a.294.2/1">The current financial year, 2006-07, saw the transition between the current and newRural Development Programme for England occuron <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>. Funding arrangements from 2007 onwards depend on the outcome of discussions with the European Commission. However, as applicants under entry-level stewardship (ELS) are guaranteed an agreement provided they meet a points target based on the area of their holding, I can confirm that no ELS applications have been rejected due to a lack of available budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/2">Higher-level stewardship (HLS), however, is a competitive scheme and submitting an application does not guarantee an offer of an agreement. Because funds for HLS are limited, agreements have hadto be allocated where they are likely to achieve the most environmental benefit for the countryside. Unfortunately, while some applications have scored highly, they have fallen short of the current thresholds established within Natural England regions. In some areas, the volume of applications has increased markedly in recent months, exceeding expectations. This has meant that the target score required for an application to be successful has had to be adjusted upwards to ensure that the agreements created represent the best possible value for money. Good-quality applications which just fail to meet the target score are not rejected out of hand, but are deferred until the next application period, at which point they are re-assessed against all the other applications received.</p>

	<p pid="a.297.0/1">My Lords, the department's view is that it would be disproportionate to write to each miner and widow. We continue to work with the Legal Complaints Service (LCS) to bring the issue to claimants' attention, and the forthcoming edition of the <I>Compensation for Miners</I> newsletter will feature an article on the role of the LCS and its contact details. Some 45,000 copies of the newsletter are printed and distributed to doctors' surgeries, citizens advice bureaux and MPs, and a copy is placed on the DTI website.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.0/25" class="indent">1. Figures are presented in &pound; million, 2006-07 price terms and include overseas cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/26" class="indent">2. Figures in Table 1 refer to the estimated expenditure associated with introducing a national insurance credit for basic state pension and state second pension, from 2010, for people caring for at least 20 hours per week for those in receipt of attendance allowance, constant attendance allowance or the middle or higher rate care component of disability living allowance. Figures presented are consistent with the policy detail and the estimated costs of reform set out in the regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Pensions Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/27" class="indent">3. Figures in Table 2 refer to the estimated additional expenditure associated with extending the national insurance credit described in part (i) to all people who are estimated to be caring for more than 20 hours and who are not otherwise qualifying for state pension. Estimates are less than &pound;5 million for basic state pension, since the single contribution condition will mean that people reaching state pension age on or after <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase> will need only 30 qualifying years for a full basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/28" class="indent">4. Estimates of the cost of a particular element of the reform package, such as the carer's credit, depend on the order in which they are modelled. Following the approach used in the regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Pensions Bill, gross costs presented in this Answer refer to the estimated expenditure on the carer's credit as part of the reforms to coverage set out in the Pensions Bill. They take into account, for example, the reduction in qualifying years required for a full basic state pension. They do not include other reforms that affect basic state pension, such as earnings uprating.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/29" class="indent">5. Net costs include savings seen from reduced expenditure on income-related benefits (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) and from changes to state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/30" class="indent">6. Figures have been rounded, according to the scale of the figure. Figures below &pound;5 million are shown as &pound;0-5 million.</p>

In December 2006, we and European partners raised our concerns that Mme Nlandu's human rights, particularly her access to legal representation, were not being respected. Subsequently Mme Nlandu was granted access toa lawyer. But her trial continues to be delayed. Following our most recent representations, in February and March, President Kabila has promised to look into the case. Embassy officials in Kinshasa have attended some of Mme Nlandu's court hearings and visited her in prison last month. We continue to monitor her situation and treatment closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.311.0/1">The protected food name (PFN) scheme of the European Union (EU) provides farmers and producers with a way to add value to their product and to meet consumers' demand for more regional and local food. To date, 36 UK products, including Stilton cheese, Scotch beef, Welsh lamb, Cornish clotted cream and Arbroath smokies, have been registered under the EU PFN scheme as either protected geographical indication (PGI), protected designation of origin (PDO) or traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG). A number of other products, including traditionally grown indoor Yorkshire rhubarb and Cornish sardines, are seeking protection.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.2/1">All eggs, except those sold at the farm gate to the final consumer, must be stamped with a code that identifies the method of production (that is, organic, free range, barn or eggs from caged hens), country of origin, and producer identification. In the case of eggs from third countries, it may be possible to use the term &quot;farming method not specified&quot; where equivalence has not been established by the EC.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.2/2">In November 2006, Defra called on the egg industry and retailers to ensure that the eggs theyare selling are correctly labelled. This followed investigations by Defra into the alleged illegal practice in the egg industry involving the incorrect labelling of eggs, including the labelling of non-free range as free range. This investigation is aimed at stopping fraud that misleads the consumer and can be damaging to the egg industry. Two people have been arrested as a result of these investigations and this is now a matter for the police.</p>
