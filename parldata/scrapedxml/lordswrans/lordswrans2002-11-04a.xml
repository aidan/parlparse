Its offer of normalisation of relations with Israel in the context of a final settlement is important. It strengthens the international consensus on the broad outlines of a settlement based on the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. This means two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side within secure and recognised borders.

	<p pid="a.54.3/2">We regret that the parties have yet to resume negotiations to reach a final settlement. Continuing violence, the absence of trust between the parties, and the lack of a clear commitment by both parties to a negotiated solution have prevented real progress. Both parties must recognise that lasting security can not be achieved through force. We will continue to do all we can to help the parties break the cycle of violence and restart political negotiations. We support the efforts of the Quartet to agree a roadmap which sets out a series of steps, leading to a final and comprehensive settlement by 2005. The priority now is to agree and implement the roadmap.</p>

As the understanding required for different intervention will vary considerably, a child under 16 may have the capacity to consent to some interventions but not to others. It is good practice to encourage a child to inform his or her parents of a particular decision unless it would clearly not be in the chlid's best interests to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.0/1">We do not agree with the conclusions reached in the report by the Scottish Council on Bioethics. Levonelle-2, containing levonorgestrel 0.75mg (the morning-after pill), is authorised in the United Kingdom as a prescription only medicine for emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse or failure of a contraceptive method. This followed advice from the independent expert scientific advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), which was satisfied as to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product in this indication. Substantial independent evidence reviewed by CSM included two World Health Organisation sponsored pivotal studies. One study involving approximately 2,000 women in 14 countries, including the UK, has been published in The Lancet (1998). The other, published in Human Reproduction (1993), involved 880 women. CSM has also considered evidence from a study of the effects of self-administering emergency contraception (New England Journal of Medicine, 1998). Copies are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/2">There is considerable experience of worldwide use with levonorgestrel. It has been available in the UK in other contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy products for 30 years, although only more recently for emergency hormonal contraception. It has been used for emergency contraception in other parts of the world since the 1980s and between 9 and 23 million women have taken it. No major safety issues have been identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/3">The safety of all newly licensed medicines in the UK is monitored closely by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the CSM through the yellow card scheme. This was extended to community pharmacists in November 1999 in order to improve safety monitoring of over-the-counter medicines. The MCA continues to moinitor the safety of levonorgestrel 0.75mg and will review any potential safety issues in the light of any new evidence which may emerge.</p>

To assist the commission in doing so, a change assessment group is being set up for each strategic health authority area. It will comprise stakeholders such as the National Health Service, community health councils, local government and local voluntary organisations; and will consider issues such as:</p>

Applied properly, these checks should ensure that a manager who had been previously dismissed, made redundant or resigned for disciplinary reasons is not re-employed as a manager in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.0/1">Restrictions on most footpaths in England were lifted progressively in accordance with the successively revised veterinary risk assessment during the period from March 2001 to February 2002. Action to reopen footpaths was a matter for local authorities in the affected areas, most of which acted to reopen footpaths as soon as it was safe to do so in the light of the damage caused by closure to the rural economy locally. Blanket closures in a small number of areas were revoked by ministerial declaration in July 2001. As a result, by February 2002 99.9 per cent of footpaths were open. The only remaining restrictions related to a small number of paths crossing farms that had suffered infection and full cleansing and disinfection had not been carried out, where veterinary advice was that closure for 12 months from the date of infection was required. The last of these restrictions was lifted on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>. There is no reason for any local authority not to have lifted all restrictions some time ago and I am not aware of any outstanding restrictions in any part of England.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">We believe that the Charter of the United Nations already contains the necessary powers to deal with intra-state conflicts. Much of the agenda of the Security Council already covers conflicts of this type, e.g. Sierra Leone. We do not believe that amending the charter is necessary or feasible in this context. Nor do we have proposals for new conventions; there is already a well-established body of international humanitarian law which is applicable to intra-state conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/2">We also believe that the international community must be able to take effective and appropriate action when faced with overwhelming humanitarian crises and massive violations of human rights, and have proposed guidelines on when it would be appropriate for the UN Security Council to act. But progress in promoting these ideas has been difficult, not least because some states fear that their sovereignty could be undermined.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/3">We therefore welcomed the establishment and work of the Canadian-sponsored International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) as an attempt to develop common ground on the circumstances when the international community should act. We welcome many of the recommendations of the ICISS, which are contained in its report The Responsibility to Protect, published in December 2001. The report attempts to move the debate from an unproductive discussion of intervention towards a new focus on the responsibilities held by states to protect their own citizens from avoidable catastrophes&mdash;from mass murder, rape and from starvation. The report goes on to emphasise, however, that when states are unwilling or unable to fulfil their responsibilities, these responsibilities must be borne by the broader community of states.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">The immediate cause of the current violence in Cote d'Ivoire was a mutiny by factions of the military unhappy at the Government's proposed terms for their discharge. The underlying causes are not yet fully apparent, but it seems clear that divisions between those of Ivorian descent and immigrants explain, in part, the popular support the rebels have received in parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/2">These divisions have existed for a number of years and were the cause of a coup in 1999 and attempted coups in 2000 and 2001. Since 2001 the Government of Cote d'Ivoire have sought to address them through a process of national reconciliation.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.4/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.79.4/2" qnum="HL6113">Whether the market-driven model for broadband roll-out will achieve adequate, if not complete, coverage for the whole of the United Kingdom, with particular reference to those areas of the country where it is currently perceived that no commercial market exists.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.5/1">The Government believe that the roll-out and take-up of broadband must be market-driven in order to ensure the high levels of competition needed to produce sustainable low prices and consumers interest. This approach has meant that the UK currently has better levels of competition in the broadband market than any of its European G7 neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/2">To help stimulate the market in those areas where broadband is not currently available, we are establishing a new regional broadband unit, due to be launched in November. The unit's broadband experts, to be located in the English regions and the devolved administrations, will work to promote the development of broadband, including extending its availability.</p>

We have no proposals to regulate this area and believe that business will rise to the challenge of integrating security into its products and services.</p>
