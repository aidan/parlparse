	<p pid="a.94.2/1">As a result of the suspension of the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) beef and dairy producers have had to retain eligible cattle longer than they would wish, incurring feeding and other costs and without income from the scheme. It has been the policy of successive governments that compensation should not be paid for consequential losses arising from animal disease controls. Nevertheless the Government appreciate that producers of clean cattle which cannot be marketed at under 30 months of age by virtue of foot and mouth disease movement restrictions will suffer a significant loss of return when such cattle are eventually sold into the OTMS. We are alive to this problem and are considering what action might be appropriate in the context of further measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">Our first priority must, however, be to isolate and eradicate the disease, so that normal patterns of marketing can be restored. Once this has been done, we will be in a better position to determine the extent to which producers have been obliged to retain cattle which would have been sold at under 30 months of age but which had subsequently to go into the OTMS, and the extent of resultant losses.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.2/1">(a) In the last 12 months we have been notified of 107 GM crop trial sites in England. This figure includes sites in the Farm Scale Evaluations programme, sites for National Seed List trials and small plots of land for biotechnology industry research and development trials. Locations of three of the evaluation sites were originally notified to us with an incorrect grid reference which was subsequently corrected.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/2">(b) All sites in which trials of GM crops have been set up can be considered as being adjacent to villages or towns.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/3">(c) There is no requirement in the current legislation to notify parish councils of GM crop trial sites in their areas. For research trials, which includes Farm Scale Evaluations, National Seed List trials and small research and development plots, there is a requirement to advertise a release in a local newspaper circulating in the area. Where this had been done incorrectly we asked the biotechnology company to readvertise with the correct grid reference. As a matter of policy we write to parish councils in whose areas Farm Scale Evaluations are to take place. We are aware of two cases this spring where, despite using the best information available, we wrote to parish councils adjoining the parish council in which the FSE was sited. Information was sent to the correct parishes as soon as we were aware of the mistake.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/4">(d) None of the GM crop trials has been specifically set up to study the effects on worms, soil bacteria and fungi. However, in the Farm Scale Evaluations, worm activity will be included as one of the measurements of biodiversity indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/5">(e) All the GM crop trials have begun after the scientific capture of baseline data. However, the independent Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE), which advises the Government on releases of GM crops, rigorously assessed all GM crops before release, and considers the trials to pose a very low risk to human health and the environment. ACRE's decisions are based on current scientific knowledge and baseline data collected over many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/6">The FSE programme has been formulated so that it is self-contained, with no need for baseline data from outside the design of the experiment. In the FSEs, the GM crop and its conventional non-GM equivalent crop are grown on two separate halves of the same field. Apart from herbicide use, both halves of the crop are managed in a similar way. The scientists are sampling both parts of the fields to investigate the diversity and abundance of seeds, plants, insects and larger animals. The form of comparison between the crops is direct, and consequently no information is required on changes in biodiversity before and after sowing.</p>

As in the past, it covers annual budgetary matters and includes details of recent developments in European Community financial management and in countering fraud against the Community Budget. It also describes the Community Budget for 2001 as adopted by the European Parliament, and the United Kingdom's gross and net contributions to the Community Budget between 1996 and 2001.</p>

I would expect the quality of rail services to reflect these variations. The Government recognises that there has been under investment in the railways over many years and the 10 Year Plan provides for &pound;60 billion worth of investment which will enable the capacity and quality of Britain's railways to be improved.</p>
