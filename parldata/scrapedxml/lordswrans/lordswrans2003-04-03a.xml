	<p pid="a.141.2/1">There are no statutory requirements in the Courts Bill as to grade, qualification or experience of fines officers. However it is expected that fines officers will largely be drawn from existing MCC staff, many of whom have long experience in dealing with defaulters.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/2">The precise role of fines officers will be piloted alongside other measures in the fines collection scheme. Once pilot areas have been identified, discussions about the specifics of the fines officer's role will begin with justices chief executives, including the provision of training.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/3">The specific training a fines officer will require may be further developed throughout the pilots and guidelines may then be given to all courts prior to a national roll-out of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/4">Regulations, which will be developed after Royal Assent to the Courts Bill, will provide details about the fines collection scheme and guidance will also be provided for the fines officers to help them in their work; this may be further developed during the running of the pilots.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.5/1">There are two significant differences in the law governing homosexual offences in Northern Ireland and in England and Wales. First, the age of consent is 17 in Northern Ireland where it is 16 in England and Wales, although this applies to all types of sexual activity. Secondly, where in Northern Ireland a man would be charged with buggery for the non-consensual anal penetration of another man, in England and Wales this would be rape. This second situation will be addressed in the Criminal Justice Order (Northern Ireland) 2003. The order will amend the definition of rape in Northern Ireland to include anal penetration.</p>

An equality impact assessment focuses on what is being done rather than what is not. The Government have not, therefore, undertaken an impact assessment of the effect of not extending these provisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-11">11 July 2002</phrase>, in answer to a Parliamentary Question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/875" name="Louise Ellman">my honourable friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Louise Ellman)</phrase> Official Report, Commons, col. 1194W, the Home Secretary announced that he had instructed the director of National Asylum Support Service (NASS) to arrange for an independent inquiry to be carried out into issues arising from NASS' dealings with the Landmark Company. We are today publishing a summary of the report of that inquiry and a copy of that summary is being placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.8/2">The inquiry confirmed that there were serious problems in the way accommodation for asylum seekers was being run in Liverpool. Its main recommendations have been accepted and are being implemented. Although the report concludes that there has been no material breach of contract by Landmark, it is clear that what happened in Liverpool is completely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.8/3">We are therefore also announcing today the action which has been put in hand. A new contract manager has been appointed and will hold Landmark closely to account: the future of the contract will be reviewed after six months in the light of performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.8/4">The new deputy director-general of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, responsible for NASS, has been asked to make clear to Landmark that significant improvements will be needed&mdash;both in its general performance and in the standard of its properties. In the meantime, no further dispersal will be made to Landmark properties.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.4/2" qnum="HL2273">Whether they will review existing legislation on asylum seekers and amend or repeal Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as proposed by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission; and whether they accept the commission's view that the claims of asylum seekers in Northern Ireland are not assessed in a fair and timely manner.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.5/1">The Government have noted the comments of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.5/2">On the first point, the Court of Appeal judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-18">18 March</phrase> reinforced the key legal points in relation to Section 55 and confirmed that the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. This has enabled the Government to continue to implement the robust but fair system of asylum support for which Parliament has legislated.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.5/3">On the second point, the Government have increased the resources targeted at reducing both the number of cases awaiting an initial decision and the time taken to reach a decision with positive results. The Government's strategy for tackling asylum decisions in a fair and timely manner has been implemented on a nation-wide basis: the place of residence of an asylum seeker in the United Kingdom has no bearing on either the timeliness or the substance of the decision. All decisions are made fairly, with due regard to the evidence presented and in accordance with policy advice relating to the country in question.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.5/1">Changing strategic priorities require the Foreign and Commonwealth Office constantly to adapt and amend its pattern of representation overseas. In order to free resources to strengthen the UK's diplomatic network in other parts of the world now more critical for UK interests, Her Majesty's Government have decided to make the following adjustments to our diplomatic representation in West Africa. With effect from early summer, the embassy in Bamako will be closed. We intend to retain a UK office there. Given the importance the UK attaches to stability and peace in the Mano River region, we intend to open a one-person office in Monrovia later this year, and upgrade our office in Conakry to an embassy.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.0/1">Her Majesty's Government are gravely concerned at reports that Northbridge Services Group, a UK company, is recruiting British, South African, French and other ex-servicemen as military units to work in Cote d'Ivoire. The crisis in Cote d'Ivoire has caused enormous suffering for the people of that country, and threatens the stability of the wider region. The Linas-Marcoussis Agreement offers Ivorians the opportunity of a peaceful, political settlement, which addresses the key issue underlying the crisis. Ivorians are now making progress in setting up a broad-based government of national reconciliation, under the terms of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. Any deployment of foreign military units at this time would seriously undermine the peace process and the efforts of the UK and wider international community to support a durable, political settlement. We have made it clear to Northbridge Services Group that the UK Government would deplore any intervention of this sort.</p>

An exercise in December 2002 to establish a snapshot of the level of compliance provided a figure of 92 per cent. We will keep this under six-monthly review and strive not only to maintain this level of compliance but to improve it. In addition, we recognise the need to increase the quality of RIAs and the value they add to the policy-making process. We are working closely with departments to identify ways of achieving this.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.0/1">In response to information received from the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the first reported cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Department of Health, along with the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has continually monitored the threat to the United Kingdom from this as yet unidentified virus.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March</phrase>, the department issued an alert to all general practitioners, National Health Service trusts, and public health professionals, with detailed information on the symptoms of this illness and advice on the management and reporting of probable cases. The Public Health Laboratory Service (as it was at the time) also issued information to professionals through its alert system. Further information has subsequently been made available to the profession and public on infection control, surveillance, management of patients, microbiological sampling and investigation and advice for travellers to affected areas and is updated on a daily basis via the department's and the PHLS's websites.</p>
