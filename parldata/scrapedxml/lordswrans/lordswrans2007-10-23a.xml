	<p pid="a.93.5/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and the Minister for Tourism, have discussed the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak with the Tourism Industry Emergency Response Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/2">The localised nature of the outbreak, which has so far been successfully contained within a small area of Surrey, has meant that there has no significant impact on the national visitor economy. However, it is too early to make a definitive assessment, and longer term work will be necessary to assess the full effects of the outbreak alongside such other factors as the poor summer weather, the strong pound and the increase in visa fees for inbound visitors earlier this year. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport will be working to that end over the next few months with the tourism industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/3">Bluetongue is a very different disease from foot and mouth. It cannot be transmitted directly between animals, or by human agents. There is therefore no reason to close any parts of the countryside, and no significant impact on tourism businesses is expected.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/4">However, the Government fully recognise that the farming community is suffering as a result of both forms of outbreak, and that many rural businesses are based on both farming and tourism. The impacts of the outbreaks will, therefore, continue to be monitored carefully.</p>

In its consultation on this subject&mdash;the digital dividend review&mdash;Ofcom outlined its framework for assessing the value of the released spectrum to society. This framework includes an assessment of broader social values, such as &quot;access and inclusion&quot;, &quot;quality of life&quot;, &quot;cultural understanding&quot; and &quot;informed democracy&quot;. The regulator has conducted market research looking at the value of potential uses of the digital dividend spectrum to consumers, citizens and the UK as a whole.

	<p pid="a.97.2/1">Data relating to the number of sex offenders reported are not available. It is possible to provide only the number of sexual offences recorded by the police or the number of offenders prosecuted and convicted for sexual offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.2/2">Table 1 gives the number of sexual offences recorded by the police for the period requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.2/3">Data for 2006 are not available for prosecutions and convictions and therefore table 2 gives the number prosecuted and convicted for indictable sexual offences for the calendar years 2004 to 2005, the latest available years. These figures are collated on the principal offence rule; so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.2/4">Figures for recorded crime and prosecutions and convictions cannot be directly compared. Recorded crime figures relate to the number of notifiable crimes reported whereas prosecutions and convictions refer to the number of offenders who have been subsequently tried for offences. In addition, recorded crime figures incorporate each offence as initially recorded and these may differ from the offence for which a suspect or suspects are subsequently proceeded against.</p>
