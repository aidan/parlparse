	<p pid="a.238.2/1">It is standard practice for fire and rescue services, in liaison with the police, to consider setting up an initial hazard zone, extending to a maximum of 200 metres from a cylinder that has been involved in a fire. Identification of the type of cylinder is then undertaken and an appropriate operational plan put in place. If the cylinder cannot be identified or it is confirmed to be an acetylene cylinder, the following action is recommended.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.2/2">A 200-metre hazard zone should be introduced and the cylinders should be left in situ for a minimum period of 24 hours following removal from any heat source. Cooling water should be applied to the cylinder for the whole 24 hours where the situation permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.2/3">The incident commander, following a dynamic risk assessment, may reduce the size of the hazard zone within this 24-hour period. The assessment will take account of:</p>
	<p pid="a.238.2/4">the nature of the incident;the nature of the surrounding/adjacent risks;the risks to firefighters providing cooling water sprays;the adequacy of any shielding;the nature and effects of any cooling water;the environmental impact;whether the cylinder walls are cool; and specialist advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.2/5">Currently there are no other methods in use within the UK to render acetylene cylinders safe that have been involved in fire. However, research is being undertaken by stakeholders to assess methods utilised in other countries. These stakeholders include Her Majesty's Government, the Chief Fire Officers' Association, the Highways Agency and the British Compressed Gas Association.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.6/1">Recruitment to specialty and general practitioner training programmes this year is, for the first time, through the online Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) and to a nationally agreed timetable. This process consists of two recruitment rounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/2">The independent review group led by Professor Neil Douglas has recommended that applicants who have not been invited to an interview should be given the opportunity to have their application form reviewed by a trained medical adviser.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/3">The review group has also recommended that further advice and information should be made available as quickly as possible for applicants. The department has accepted that this will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/4">information about competition ratios by specialty, entry level and geography;the process and timetable for making applications in the second round plus generic guidance about what panels will be looking for;generic feedback on how applicants can improve their applications for the second round; information about sources of support for applicants; andenhanced frequently asked questions on the MTAS website, building on feedback from the first round.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/5">The next stage of the review will consider what further arrangements might be needed for the support and care of applicants. Applicants who believe that they have been disadvantaged by the way their application has been managed can lodge a complaint at the end of the second round.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.0/1">The Design for Manufacture competition was opened on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. Its purpose is to provide a showcase of how to build cost-effectively across a range of housing types without sacrificing quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/2">It aims to stimulate fresh thinking on a scale that will help the industry break out of the research and development cycle, facilitating the mainstreaming of modem construction for volume developments in a way that others can follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/3">The target for the competition is that a minimum of 30 per cent of housing units should be high-quality 76.5 square metre homes built at a construction cost of &pound;60,000 or less, with larger and smaller homes built at a similar cost-efficiency. To identify what might be a challenging but achievable figure for the core costs of constructing a home, a series of data sets, such as those produced by the RICS Building Costs Information Service and the Tender Price Index of Social Housing, were used as well as real-life case studies. The sale prices of homes will include the cost of the land as well as the construction cost and associated new infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/4">Prices in different neighbourhoods can be very variable, depending on particular characteristics of the location, the local market and the individual properties to be sold. They will be determined by the developers at the time the homes go on sale.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.3/1">Previous estimates have projected demand for home inspectors (HIs) and domestic energy assessors (DEAs) from June 2007 to fall within a range between 1,600 and 4,300. Further analysis has been completed, informed by the HIPs area trials and other survey work. We now estimate that around 2,500 assessors will be needed from June, rising to around 3,000 by the autumn and 4,000 to 4500 by the end of the year. More assessors will be needed during 2008 to produce EPCs for commercial buildings and for those in the private and social rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.3/2">Home inspectors and domestic energy assessors will be able to produce energy performance certificates. Currently, 1,085 HIs have completed their HI examinations, with several hundred more nearing the end of their training.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.3/3">Since training courses for new domestic energy assessors (DEAs) became available in late January, more than 2,700 candidates have registered for or begun training. The DEA diploma course takes eight to 12 weeks, so the first candidates are now completing their courses. Eighty-six have completed the course and hundreds more will do so in the next few weeks. We estimate that between 2,500 and 3,000 assessors and inspectors will be available to undertake assessments from l June.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.5/1">In the past year, the computer systems at the Department for Work and Pensions have been compromised by malicious programs on two separate occasions. On the first occasion a significant number of Jobpoints were found to have no anti-virus software installed and a number of these machines were infected with a virus. On the second occasion a web server was found to have been compromised with malicious software. The malicious programs were removed in both cases as soon as practicable, and all Jobpoints now have up-to-date anti-virus software installed. Neither incident had a significant detrimental impact on the day-to-day running of the Department for Work and Pensions operations. Further to this, there are a number of instances where malicious software has been automatically cleansed (by the anti-virus software) from Department for Work and Pensions systems; however, in these instances no impact was experienced. Collection of further information on these instances would require a disproportionate allocation of resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.5/1">Workforce jobs in UK manufacturing fell by 53,000 to 3.26 million between December 2005 and December 2006; the UK's trade in goods deficit increased from &pound;68.8 billion to &pound;83.7 billion between 2005 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.5/2">It is inappropriate to draw a direct link between the balance of trade in goods and manufacturing employment, given that the relationship can be affected by a number of differing factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.5/3">Our main competitors, France, Germany and the US, have experienced a downward trend in manufacturing employment in recent years. Sometimes these countries had a balance of trade in goods surplus; sometimes they had a deficit, at the same time as falling manufacturing employment.</p>
