	<p pid="a.3.8/1">The UK sees Israel's plan to withdraw all settlements from Gaza and some from the West Bank as a positive step. We also believe both Israel and the Palestinian Authority should implement their obligations under the road map. The road map requires that Israel freeze all settlement activity including the naural growth of existing settlements, and dismantle all outposts built since 2001. At their <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-11">11 October</phrase> meeting, EU Foreign Ministers reiterated their view that Israeli withdrawal must be implemented in accordance with the five elements laid down by the European Council in March 2004. One of these elements is that any withdrawal should not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank. The UK has repeatedly pressed its concerns about continued settlement construction with the Israeli Government, and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.5/1">Comprehensive records of faith-based offending-related courses in prisons are not currently held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, Sycamore Tree, a Christian-based course on victim awareness accredited by the Open College Network, is delivered through the chaplaincy in 37 prisons. Two prisons, Swaleside and the Verne, operate Kainos Communities, which are Christian-based and incorporate rehabilitative and therapeutic programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.5/2">Sycamore Tree is a restorative justice programme developed by Prison Fellowship, a registered charity, to help prisoners to accept responsibility for personal action towards their victims and the community. It is based on Christian values such as truth, integrity and responsibility but does not explicitly promote faith and is open to adherents of any or no faith tradition. The aim of the programme is to change prisoners' behaviour and attitudes. Two types of evaluation are used. CRIME-PICS II is used at the beginning and end of the programme to monitor attitudinal change and prisoners also complete a Prison Fellowship end of programme evaluation form. Prison Fellowship advises that approximately 500 prisoners have attended the programme since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. Alternative victim awareness courses are available at some prisons. Improved information will become available centrally from a database being established under Prison Service Order (PSO) 4350 on effective regime interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.5/3">Kainos Communities involve prisoners living for between six and 18 months as part of a supportive community with group work, where they can discuss their current and offending-related behaviour and learn to take responsibility for their own actions and deal with conflict without violence, as well as having access to other courses. Kainos accepts applications from any prisoner regardless of race or religion. The objectives are to create a safe living environment where prisoners can improve their social functioning and employability. Data are collected to determine whether a prisoner is making progress or if he is violating community standards and staff complete evaluation reports on each course attended. There have been 52 Kainos completions at Swaleside in 2004 and 40 at the Verne. Kainos at both prisons are seeking validation through their respective area managers under PSO 4350.</p>

The jury stated that, on the evidence presented, the care given to Joseph at Stoke Heath by medical, nursing and other prison staff was appropriate, but that they considered unsuitable the safer clothing provided for Joseph.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">Prison Service policy is that normal clothing must not be removed from at-risk prisoners as a matter of course, but as necessary for the immediate safety of the prisoner, and then for the shortest time possible. During his first four days at Stoke Heath, while Joseph was located in the healthcare centre in a cell that had elements of safer cell design and was covered by CCTV, it was considered necessary, for his own protection, for Joseph to wear safer (or protective) clothing. He was not wearing such clothing at the time of his death.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/3">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Paul Goggins), announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September</phrase> (Hansard col. 159WS) measures taken to ensure that matters raised by the coroner in this case received further consideration. These included the appointment of David Lambert, a former Chief Inspector of Social Services, to examine operational issues on the inquest identified. Mr Lambert's remit includes the appropriateness of safer cell clothing for young offenders at risk of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/4">There have been a number of key improvements in the care of juveniles in prisons and my honourable friend has made clear his intention to share with Mrs Scholes the learning from this tragic case.</p>

	Prison Suicides: Unfurnished and Safer Cells
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.6.1/3" qnum="HL4529">Whether they consider the use of (a) strip cells; and (b) safe cells is compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights; and, if so, what are their reasons.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-11-01a.6.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="6"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo041101/text/41101w02.htm#41101w02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.6.2/1">The Government do not believe that the use of unfurnished cells (the preferred term) or safer cells (the term used) violates Article 3. An unfurnished (or special) cell is a cell from which the usual furniture has been removed and which is either totally unfurnished or does not contain basic items of furniture such as a table and chair. Its use is carefully circumscribed and regulated, with safeguards in place. This accommodation is not used as a punishment but for the temporary confinement of a violent or refractory prisoner if it is judged necessary to try to prevent the prisoner injuring another prisoner or staff, damaging property, creating a disturbance, or from self-injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">Prison Service policy is that prisoners identified as being at risk of suicide or self-harm should not be placed in an unfurnished cell, unless in exceptional circumstances they are additionally identified as violent or refractory. In such cases, prisons are required to decide on the appropriate supervision measures to be in place to ensure the safety of the prisoner during the period they remain in that accommodation. Guidelines are being developed to reinforce the need to exhaust all alternative methods of care in such cases before resorting to the use of an unfurnished cell.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">Safer cells are cells which have specially designed furniture and fixtures which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult, and access to window bars prevented via non-opening windows with integral ventilation grills. The design of these cells can help prisoners and assist staff to manage those distressed prisoners at particular risk of attempting to kill themselves through impulsive acts.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/4">All prisoners identified at risk of suicide or self-harm are cared for through the use of a care planning system (currently being reviewed with piloted changes) that aims to provide each prisoner with an individual support plan to meet their needs. This occurs regardless of the type of accommodation they are located in. Such plans might include the utilisation of special support for any mental health and/or drugs/alcohol problems, use of regime activities, problem solving around any personal safety issues, strengthening ties with or re-engaging with family, peer support, or help with resettlement issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">I have assumed that the noble Lord is referring to all landowners rather than farmers specifically in his question. Information on the approximate total area of land on which landowners permit military training to take place and the total number of sites involved is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. I can, however, provide estimates of the approximate number of landowners and general location of sites where military training is permitted to take place in the table below. It should be noted that arrangements for military training are covered by a variety of means ranging from formal leases to periodic ad hoc agreements with landowners and are liable to change on an annual basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/2">The impact of the loss of opportunities for training on private land is being considered. We would seek to mitigate any major potential adverse effects by relocating a significant amount of this training to MoD-owned land. However, it is too early to assess the full effects of withdrawal of landowners' permissions to the MoD as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.2/1">Our approach continues to be guided by the balance of scientific evidence available. No case of acute organophosphate poisoning was recorded in UK troops in the Gulf in 1990&ndash;91. The current balance of evidence does not support the existence of adverse health effects arising from long-term low dose organophosphate exposure.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/2">The published peer-reviewed scientific evidence confirms that there can be short-term effects associated with pyridostigmine, and these were identified in personnel in the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict. However, the adverse effects reduce and disappear when the use of pyridostigmine bromide is discontinued. Pyridostigmine bromide in the form of nerve agent pre-treatment set (NAPS) tablets was last issued to Service personnel deployed during OP TELIC in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.8/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.10.8/2" qnum="0">How much diabetes types 1 and 2 cost the National Health Service annually; whether they will institute a universal screening programme for type 2 diabetes; and whether they will provide funding for the self-monitoring of blood glucose for those with type 2 diabetes.[HL4575] The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Warner): The recent report by Wanless <i>Securing good health for the whole population: Final report&mdash;February 2004 states that the total cost of treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes is &pound;1.3 billion per year.</i></p>
	<p pid="a.10.8/3" qnum="0">The evidence does not support general population screening for type 2 diabetes. There is emerging evidence to suggest that it may be clinically and cost effective to screen specific sub-groups of the population who are at high risk of developing diabetes. The National Service Framework for Diabetes: Delivery Strategy committed the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) to advise the Department of Health by 2005 on the most effective policy for screening for type 2 diabetes. The NSC is undertaking a project to assess the feasibility of screening in primary care those at greatest risk of diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.8/4" qnum="0">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance of management of type 2 diabetes&mdash;blood glucose in September 2002. Funding to meet recommendations of the NICE has been included in the allocations made to primary care trusts for the period 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. However, this funding is not separately identified. The total of PCT allocations is &pound;45 billion for 2003&ndash;04, &pound;49.3 billion for 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;53.9 billion for 2005&ndash;06. This represents an increase of &pound;12.7 billion or an average of 30.8 per cent over the three years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. Therefore the Secretary of State for Health expects patients treated under the criteria in the NICE guidance to have their therapy funded by the PCT trust.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.10/1">The Government are aware that people of south Asian origin are up to six times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.10/2">The explicit objectives of the National Service Framework for Diabetes include the provision of services that are person centred, enabling people with diabetes to adopt a healthier lifestyle and to manage their own diabetes through education and support that recognises the importance of lifestyle, culture and religion, and where necessary, tackles the adverse impact of material disadvantage and social exclusion. Services should be equitable, planned to meet the needs of the population, including specific groups within the population, and appropriate to needs of the individual. Therefore, primary care trusts will need to develop services that reflect these principles by looking at diversity and need in their own populations.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/1">The UK has led the world in having Internet service industries (both fixed and mobile), government and law enforcement agencies working together to reduce child pornography on the Internet. According to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), less then 1 per cent of child pornography on the Internet is hosted in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/2">The Government encourage any measure which BT or any other Internet service providers can take to reduce the availability of child abuse images. However, the Government do not have a list of companies that have chosen to follow BT's lead in the blocking of Internet material containing child pornography.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/3">DTI and Home Office Ministers have met with representatives of Internet service providers to discuss how to further reduce access to child abuse images online and this dialogue continues. I understand that, like BT, Vodafone blocks access to sites listed by the IWF and that other service providers are considering similar measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.14/1">The Government provide grant aid for flood and coastal defence improvement projects promoted by the operating authorities&mdash;the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards&mdash;subject to eligibility criteria which includes meeting a set threshold priority score. A revised scoring system took effect from April 2003, to apply equally to coastal and inland projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.14/2">Proposed projects are allocated a score based on a combination of three elements&mdash;(i) benefits as compared to cost, (ii) the number of people protected as measured by the number of households at risk and (iii) protection and enhancement of environmental assets. Both (ii) and (iii) are measured per unit of project cost. Additionally, the score can be modified slightly to reflect (a) risk, (b) vulnerability of people in the area and (c) protection of heritage assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.14/3">Estimation of project benefits and scores is a matter for the relevant operating authority using the Government's appraisal guidance which is published on the Defra website. Authorities are encouraged to quantify benefits arising from protection of all assets as far as possible, including heritage assets. Higher benefits will tend to increase a project's priority score.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-11-01a.18.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="18"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo041101/text/41101w05.htm#41101w05_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.18.0/1">In line with all employers in the public and private sector, the Government believe that the Civil Service should be allowed to determine retirement age policy with regard to its business needs while giving staff as much choice as possible about when they retire. Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with an unreduced pension is currently 60.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/2">Against this background, 80 per cent of the Civil Service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent has the option to remain in work on short service concessions. Those departments and agencies which have decided that there is a strong case for retaining a retirement age of 60 in the current circumstances will be expected to continue to re-examine the issue and look positively at offering more flexibility to older staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/3">The normal retirement age for the senior Civil Service is 60. However, heads of departments and agency chief executives have the flexibility to retain members of the senior Civil Service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/4">Once the Department of Trade and Industry announces the consequences for retirement age in the UK of implementing the EU Directive on Equal Treatment, the Civil Service will need to review its arrangements to ensure compliance with any revision to the legal framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/5">While retirement age and pension age are not necessarily the same, they are linked. The Government's Green Paper, <i>Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement</i> (Cm 5677), issued in December 2002, proposed that the rules of public service pension schemes should be changed to make an unreduced pension payable from age 65 rather than 60. Our intention to proceed with the proposal through reviews of public service schemes in consultation with employers and employee representatives was confirmed in our action plan, <i>Action on occupational pensions</i> (Cm 5835), issued in June 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/6">Notices were issued to all civil servants to inform them of the Government's intentions. These said that a pension age of 65 would apply to new entrants to the Civil Service by the end of 2006, and gave commitments that those existing staff aged over 50 at the time of the announcements would be only minimally affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/7">More detailed proposals for the implementation of the increase in pension age are being worked up, and we expect further information to be provided to existing staff later this year.</p>
