	<p pid="b.1.2/1">In 2003&ndash;05 the Department for International Development (DfID) spent a total of &pound;79.6 million in Afghanistan bilaterally. The bilateral programme budget for Afghanistan in 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;100 million. This has been fully committed and over &pound;75 million has already been disbursed. By the end of 2005&ndash;06 DfID will have spent approximately &pound;390 million in Afghanistan bilaterally, since beginning its reconstruction programme in 2000&ndash;01 (this includes humanitarian spending).</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/2">In addition to its bilateral programmes in Afghanistan, DfID provides 19 per cent. of the European Commission's commitment of &euro;1 billion (2002&ndash;07), and 10.4 per cent. of the World Bank's commitment, currently some $270 million a year. DfID also contributes globally to UN programmes active in Afghanistan, including those of the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Food Programme, and through the Asian Development Bank.</p>

We understand that vitamin D was removed from Cornflakes in 1998, in order to standardise the product across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/2">The Committee on Medical Aspects of Nutrition Policy advised in 1998 on the health benefits of vitamin D in relation to bone health. The relationship between vitamin D and cancer and other chronic medical conditions is less clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/3">Most of the population are able to make sufficient vitamin D through the action of sunlight on the skin. The Food Standards Agency advises pregnant and breastfeeding women, older people, those of Asian origin, those who always cover up their skin when outside, rarely get outdoors or eat no meat or oily fish to take vitamin D supplements. Some ethnic minority groups, especially if they have pigmented skin and choose diets which exclude meat and fish, may also be vulnerable to low vitamin D status. This may include some individuals of Afro-Caribbean descent.</p>

	<p pid="b.19.5/1">The Executive Board of the World Health Organisation is due to meet from 23&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-01-28">28 January 2006</phrase>. At this meeting members will agree on the agenda for the forthcoming World Health Assembly (WHA), which is to be held 22&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">27 May 2006</phrase>. The United Kingdom delegations for both meetings are still to be finalised but the UK is traditionally led by a Health Minister and/or the Chief Medical Officer.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.5/2">The Government have a clear understanding of Taiwan's desire for membership of the WHO and integration into the world healthcare community. However, there are difficulties over Taiwanese involvement in a United Nation forum where statehood is a prerequisite for full membership.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.5/3">The UK, along with other European Union member states, strongly supports the principle enshrined in the WHO constitution that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being. The EU has, on a prior occasion, expressed its hope that &quot;the Secretariat, and others organising meetings and working groups under WHO auspices, will show flexibility in finding mechanisms to allow Taiwanese medical and public health officials to participate in these activities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.5/4">However, observer status, of and by itself, does not automatically confer any rights or benefits on the holder; these have to be negotiated separately. The EU has therefore chosen instead to press for practical measures to allow Taiwan to participate in the activities of the WHO.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.5/5">Immediately prior to the 2005 WHA meeting, it was announced that the WHO Secretariat and China had agreed a confidential Memorandum of Understanding covering Taiwan's participation in the activities of the WHO. There are signs that it is having a practical effect. For example, health officials from Taiwan attended a WHO conference on avian flu in Geneva in mid-November and representatives from Taiwan attended an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation avian flu conference in Australia from <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>&ndash; <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.5/6">We shall continue to watch developments closely, in particular to make sure that the MoU continues to enable Taiwan's participation in relevant activities. With EU partners, we will push for further action if necessary.</p>
