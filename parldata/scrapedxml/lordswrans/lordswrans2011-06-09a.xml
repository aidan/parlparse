	<p pid="a.145.2/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) consulted across the United Kingdom on proposals for full cost recovery for meat official controls by removal of current discounts, with options for a phased introduction and a reduction in charges for low throughput businesses, and is committed to further reducing its costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">In response to comments received during the consultation, the FSA revised its proposals, deciding that full cost recovery should be introduced over a three-year period, beginning in April 2012, and that increased support should be provided for a greater number of low throughput meat establishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/3">In addition, following discussions between the FSA and HM Treasury, it has been agreed that industry in Great Britain will not bear the cost relating to the deficit in the Local Government Pension Scheme, which would have totalled &#163;4.7 million. Therefore the FSA costs chargeable to industry will be reduced by this amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/4">The FSA is currently finalising a detailed impact assessment of its revised policy on the basis of the most recent data, and this will include a financial assessment of the impact on small and medium-sized abattoirs.</p>

Complementary to this activity, Defra has commissioned a pilot project on improving the integration of advisory messages to farmers.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.0/1">There is already a legal duty on schools to promote the well-being of their pupils. Within that, it is for school governing bodies and local authorities, rather than central government, to determine their policies on supporting pupils with medical needs. Good schools and local authorities will work with parents and local health services so that the medical needs of children, such as those with chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), are met while they are at school.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/2">As the Department for Education said in the Schools White Paper, entitled <I>The Importance of Teaching</I>, good schools have a vital role as promoters of health and well-being in the local community, and have always had good pastoral systems. They understand well the connections between pupils' physical and mental health and their educational achievement. The Government believe that much of the important work that schools do is not as a result of central prescription and so have no plans to change the existing arrangements or to bring forward new legislative proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/3">This department, together with the Department of Health, provides guidance for schools in <I>Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years</I> (published in 2005). This recommends, among other things, that there should be a clear policy in each school, an individual health care plan for any child with medical needs, and training for staff. The guidance can be found at: <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/">www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/</a> publicationdetail/pagel/DFES-1448-2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.3/1">We need to recall that there are considerable constraints on public spending across the EU, as well as at home. At 43 per cent of the EU budget, CAP cannot be immune to the hard choices being made elsewhere. There must, therefore, be a very substantial cut to the CAP budget during the next financial framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/2">We are working constructively with all EU partners to progress genuine and farsighted reform. In a smaller overall budget, future CAP expenditure should tackle the key objectives of encouraging a competitive, sustainable EU agriculture sector able to respond to climate change challenges, reducing reliance on subsidies and focusing resources on the provision of environmental public goods.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.0/1">The Red Tape Challenge aims to take a comprehensive approach, looking widely at regulation, whether introduced through primary or secondary legislation or other means. It seeks views on where regulation is working well, as well as where they are imposing unnecessary burdens on businesses, members of the public or voluntary organisations or restricting personal freedoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/2">The Equality Act 2010 is included as part of that overall legislation and the same standard questions are asked as for other sections on the website. It is not the Government's intention to abolish the Equality Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/3">The Government want to hear from members of the public, business and voluntary and community organisations about how the Act is working in practice. We want to know whether the Act could be simplified, better implemented, if certain provisions should be dropped or amended or whether it should be kept exactly as it is.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.5/1">The Home Secretary's request to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, supported by the Prime Minister, asking that the Metropolitan Police bring its expertise to the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is based on the sincere hope that Madeleine is still alive.

	<p pid="a.155.0/1">The Government are publishing shortly on the Department for Education's website the list of all sponsored academy projects in development. In addition to covering projects that replace predecessor schools with GCSE results below 40 per cent 5 A* to C, including English and Maths, the list will also include projects in relation to primary schools and projects which constitute new provision where there is no predecessor school. The list will cover projects with an approved statement of intent or which are at a more advanced stage of development, and will include both the sponsor of each project and the stage of development that the project has reached. In addition, the department publishes on its website a copy of the expression of interest and the funding agreement for each project once they are approved. The department will keep the list updated on a monthly basis.</p>
