	<p pid="a.141.5/1">The publication of the Belfast metropolitan area plan draft has been postponed on three occasions. When work began on the plan in January 2001, publication was programmed for December 2002. Publication was initially postponed until March 2003 to allow the research to be informed by the release of the 2001 Census data. Following further discussion with the six councils covered by the plan, it was agreed that publication should be delayed until September 2003 to allow them longer to consider and respond to the research which has been carried out. The third postponement was necessary to ensure that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive was given time to prepare a housing needs assessment to meet a new plan requirement introduced by draft Planning Policy Statement 12 Housing In Settlements.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.0/1">It has been the view of successive governments that prisoners convicted of a crime serious enough to warrant imprisonment have lost the moral authority to vote. The working party on electoral procedures, which examined and reviewed all electoral arrangements after the general election held in 1997, published its findings on <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-19">19 October 1999</phrase>. It could find no reason to change the existing system in which convicted prisoners found guilty of a crime serious enough to warrant imprisonment are denied the right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/2">Prisoners have a variety of ways in which they can express their views about conditions in prison, including by writing to their Member of Parliament&mdash;and many do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/3">Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights covers the rights of the individual to be involved in public affairs and to vote in periodic free elections without unreasonable restrictions. The covenant has not been incorporated into English law, but the UK is signed up to the covenant.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/4">Parliament has decided that convicted prisoners have forfeited their right to have a say in the way the country is governed for the period during which they are in custody. This temporary disenfranchisement pursues a legitimate aim and is proportionate, and is considered a reasonable restriction within the terms of Article 25. It does not, in our view, affect the substance of Article 25, which is concerned with universal franchise and the free expression of the people in the choice of legislature. Long-standing precedent set by the European Court of Human Rights upholds that certain sections of society, including convicted prisoners, can be excluded from voting.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.3/1">The requested information on the levels of violent attacks on people who work in convenience stores and the time taken by police to respond to these is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/2">The Government do take crime against the retail sector very seriously and the Business Crime Section within the Home Office is focusing on this issue. Advice on reducing violent crime has been provided by the Home Office in a booklet for retailers entitled Don't discount crime, which covers all aspects of crime prevention and includes a section on keeping safe. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) published Work-related violence: managing the risk in smaller businesses on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-09">9 July 2002</phrase>. The publication includes 10 case studies on how some businesses have reduced the risk of violence to staff. It has also published specific guidance for the retail sector, called Preventing Violence to Retail Staff. This provides practical guidance for retailers and their staff on how the problems and causes of violence might be tackled. It sets out an approach that can be adopted as everyday practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/3">These issues can only be addressed by a joint approach and the Government are committed to working with the retail industry to combat all types of crime against the industry. An example of this is the DTI-sponsored Retail Strategy Group, comprising members from both the public and private sectors, which has a specific sub-group that includes officials from the Home Office, DTI and Small Business Service to look at crime issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/4">Retail crime reduction partnerships, which exist in many town and shopping centres, enable members to share information and exclude offenders, including potentially violent offenders, from their stores. The Home Office paid for a consultant to work with the British Retail Consortium over a two-year period to develop these partnerships, many of which are supported by the government offices in the regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/5">The Home Office has also provided &pound;15 million over three years to help small shops in deprived areas, many of which are convenience stores, with security.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.3/2" class="indent">&quot;Politeness and tolerance</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/3" class="indent">Officers should treat members of the public and colleagues with courtesy and respect, avoiding abusive or deriding attitudes or behaviour. In particular, officers must avoid: favouritism of an individual or group; all forms of harassment, victimisation or unreasonable discrimination; and overbearing conduct to a colleague, particularly to one junior in rank or service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/4">Any breach of the principles in the code of conduct may result in an officer facing misconduct proceedings under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999, which, in the most serious cases, could involve dismissal.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/5">Under the new complaints system, which will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, it is more likely for conduct of this nature, whether or not a complaint is made, to fall to be recorded and referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and, in the more serious cases, can be investigated by the IPCC.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/6">Furthermore, the Home Office is working very closely with the Women's National Commission and the Association of Chief Police Officers on a number of projects designed to discourage sexually discriminatory behaviour by male police officers towards women police officers and members of the public. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/7" class="indent">The Gender Agenda&mdash;This document, to which the Home Office is a signatory, was produced two years ago by a number of groups with a stake in women's issues in the Police Service. It contains suggestions on what the police and individuals can do to improve the current situation. Advances have been made in a number of areas, including training methods, delivery and recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/8" class="indent">Seen but not heard: Women's Experience of the Police report&mdash;This report was partially funded by the Home Office and was designed to look at gender issues, particularly how the police engage with different communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">Securing a sustained improvement in fine enforcement and increasing confidence in the criminal justice system are key government priorities. That is why back in June this year we announced a seven-point plan to secure the level of enforcement improvement required.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/2">The Department for Constitutional Affairs is taking forward a wide-ranging programme of change to deliver the seven-point plan. As part of this we have undertaken a review of the existing fine enforcement payment rate target to test whether it provides the right focus for those involved in enforcement activity and are now making changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/3">As well as criminal fines properly due, the existing target includes, among other things, civil payments and judicially remitted fines. We have now reviewed it so that the target is to collect a set proportion of fines which are properly due. This will provide a clearer focus for magistrates' courts committees and enable relative performance to be more easily assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/4">The effect of the revised form of measurement is to change the existing target of 68 per cent. to a value of 75 per cent. Performance data under the new measure will first be available from January 2004 and information under both the old and the new measure will be available for at least the remainder of 2003&ndash;04. Performance in areas no longer captured by the payment rate target will be monitored and managed separately.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/30">Note:</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/31">In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high-risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.0/1">Biofuels offer an opportunity for diversification of agricultural activities and the development of new markets. Traditional technologies for producing biodiesel and bioethanol use crops including oilseed rape, suger beet and potatoes, which are well known to farmers and use the same crop management drivers as for food crops.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/2">In order to produce a significant percentage of the UK's fuel requirements, a large amount of land would need to be dedicated to biofuel crops. To meet the 5.75 per cent reference target for use of biofuels in the EU Biofuels Directive, if entirely provided from virgin crops ie excluding recycled oil or forestry by-products etc, would require up to 1 million hectares of land: about 10 per cent of available land. For UK farmers to produce fuel crops on this scale, the market return to the farmer would need to be sufficient to motivate diversion from production for established food and animal feed markets.</p>
