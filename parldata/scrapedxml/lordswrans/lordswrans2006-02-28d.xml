	<p pid="d.38.5/1">Free personal care for people aged 65 or over was introduced in Scotland from I July 2002. We do not have a figure for the numbers of people receiving attendance allowance in Scotland at that date. I can, however, supply the figure for May 2002, which, to the nearest hundred, was 142,300.</p>
	<p pid="d.38.5/2">The requested information regarding the net saving to the responsible government department from the elimination of eligibility to claim attendance allowance is not available. I can, however, provide some general information about the position.</p>
	<p pid="d.38.5/3">The rules governing the payment of attendance allowance and the care component of disability living allowance preclude the payment of these benefits to people in care homes who have been receiving help with their care home costs from public funds for more than four weeks. Such help includes the &pound;145 per week payments that local authorities in Scotland make to people aged 65 or over in care homes under the free personal care arrangements introduced by the Scottish Executive in July 2002.</p>
	<p pid="d.38.5/4">We estimate that since that date, receipt of those payments has resulted in the withdrawal of attendance allowance or the care component of disability living allowance from some 6,400 care home residents in Scotland. At current benefit rates, we estimate that the maximum annual cost of continuing to pay the benefits to those residents would be about &pound;20 million.</p>

	<p pid="d.40.0/1">We would prefer not to base our policy on the application of notional registration dates and it seems unnecessary to do so. Most of those about whom the noble Lord expresses concern will have acquired British overseas citizenship at birth on the basis that their parents were British nationals (overseas) and the children would otherwise have been stateless. Such British overseas citizens are likely to have an entitlement to registration as a British citizen under Section 4B of the 1981 Act.</p>

	<p pid="d.40.3/1">There has not been an error on the part of the British authorities in applying the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997. The decisions in question refer to applicants who were deemed not to be solely British nationals on the basis of information provided by the Indian Government in 1997-98 under Indian citizenship law. Under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997, possession of another citizenship immediately before <phrase class="date" code="1997-02-04">4 February 1997</phrase> rendered individuals ineligible for British citizenship. Consequently, the applicants in question were deemed not to have met the criteria, as set out in the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997, and therefore could not be registered as British citizens.</p>
	<p pid="d.40.3/2">The British Consul General referred not to a change in Indian nationality law but to the change in the Indian authorities' interpretation of its law which the Home Office received on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase>. The change in interpretation contradicted the advice we had previously received from the Indian authorities in 1997-98. This change in Indian interpretation means that many of the applicants, previously deemed not to be solely British nationals, may now be considered as solely British nationals. They therefore may now meet the criteria as set out in the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 to become British citizens.</p>

The advice from the British Consul General in Hong Kong in his interview with a Hong Kong journalist on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase>, referring to the Consulate General's website, was that applications for British citizenship can take up to 18 months or longer to be processed.</p>

We rely on other governments for advice on the matter of possession of another citizenship.

While a very low proportion of schools are providing childcare from 8 am to 6 pm all year round, 87 per cent of primary and 95 per cent of secondary schools provide some form of childcare or activities outside of normal school hours; 69 per cent of primary and 66 per cent of secondary schools provide some form of parenting support; and 75 per cent of primary schools and 97 per cent of secondary schools provide wider community access to their facilities such as sports, arts and ICT facilities. This is a very strong baseline to build on and we will continue to monitor progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.47.11/2">We have committed &pound;840 million to developing extended services, including high quality 8 am to 6 pm all-year-round childcare, study support and before-and-after school clubs so that they are accessible through all our schools by 2010. We have also appointed the national remodelling team to provide support to schools and local authorities in developing extended services.

	<p pid="d.50.3/1">Since 1996-97, information on non-completion rates for higher education students has been published annually by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and, latterly, by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) in <i>Performance Indicators in Higher Education</i>. This report includes a table showing the non-continuation rates of young entrants following their year on entry for each subject group, and the latest version (covering entrants in 2002&ndash;3) is available from the HESA website at <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/pi/0304/continuation.htm">www.hesa.ac.uk/pi/0304/continuation.htm</a>. Figures for previous years are available from the HESA website (for 2001&ndash;02) and the HEFCE website <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk">www.hefce.ac.uk</a> (for earlier years).</p>

	<p pid="d.50.6/1">Works of art that are traded domestically within the United Kingdom are subject to standard rate of 17.5 per cent VAT, introduced in 1991. Works of art imported into the United Kingdom from places outside the European Union are taxed an effective reduced rate of 5 per cent, introduced in 1999. Works of art removed to the United Kingdom from other EC member states are, where VAT falls due, taxed at the standard rate of 17.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.51.0/1">I believe that the noble Lord's Question refers to a recent judgment by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) involving a dispute between the United Kingdom and the European Commission. The dispute did not concern the rate of VAT payable on works of art imported from outside the European Union into the United Kingdom. The effective rate of VAT on such imports remains 5 per cent. The case concerned the United Kingdom's treatment of fees charged by auctioneers in connection with the sales of those works of art in cases where the goods were held within temporary importation arrangements. The United Kingdom took the view that the fees charged in such cases were also subject to the effective reduced rate of VAT. The European Commission challenged this view.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.0/2">The ECJ ruled that auctioneers' fees relating to sales of works of art within the temporary import regime must be taxed at the standard rate of VAT. The ruling applies only to auctioneers' fees, the rate of VAT charged in respect of the goods themselves is unaffected. The legal basis for the ECJ's ruling decision is rather complex, and is detailed in its published decision.</p>
