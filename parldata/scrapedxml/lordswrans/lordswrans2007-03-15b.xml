	<p pid="b.145.47/1">The accession chapters being negotiated between the EU and Turkey are aimed at aligning Turkey with EU norms. The chapters do not include the question of Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus. This issue is likely to be resolved only through a comprehensive settlement supported by both communities on the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.47/2">Confidence-building measures have an important role to play in creating a favourable environment for a final settlement. For example, the opening of a crossing point at Ledra Street would be an important and symbolic confidence-building measure. In this context, we have welcomed the removal of both the bridge and the wall at Ledra Street, and hope that these moves will lead to an agreement on the opening of the crossing as soon as possible and reunification of the centre of Nicosia. We have encouraged the two communities to build upon the recent demolition of the wall and to commit themselves in good faith and without delay to making early substantive progress on solving the Cyprus problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.59/1">All Written Parliamentary Questions are currently subject to a cost limit of &pound;600. It would exceed this limit for Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials to provide the information of which legal instruments with Article 308 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community (TEC) as their legal base have been passed since 1997&mdash;thus incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.59/2">Article 308 of the TEC has been in force since 1999. The Government have given an undertaking that where the Commission puts forward a legislative proposal, citing Article 308 as its legal base, the Commission's justification of this choice of legal base will be provided to the scrutiny committees. We could revert to every Explanatory Memorandum provided to the scrutiny committees since then to determine if Article 308 of the TEC was the legal base cited. However, Explanatory Memoranda have been held centrally only since 2004. In order to compile the list requested, as well as checking three years of centrally held Explanatory Memoranda, each government department would need to check every Explanatory Memorandum issued between 1999 and 2004. We estimate that to do so would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

That database can be consulted at <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm</a>.

	<p pid="b.145.86/1">Under Section 11(1) and (3) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 (&quot;the 1992 Act&quot;), a 25 per cent discount (&quot;the discount&quot;) applies in respect of a chargeable dwelling and a particular day if on that day:</p>
	<p pid="b.145.86/2">there is only one resident of the dwelling and that person does not fall to be disregarded for the purposes of the discount; orthere are two or more residents of the dwelling and each of them except one falls to be disregarded for those purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.86/3">Schedule 1 to the 1992 Act has effect for determining who must be disregarded and paragraph 11 of that schedule provides that a person must be disregarded on a particular day if on that day:</p>
	<p pid="b.145.86/4">the person falls within such description as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State by regulations; andsuch conditions as may be prescribed by the regulations are fulfilled.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.86/5">Depending on the precise circumstances, it may be possible to use the power in paragraph 11 to extend the discount. If that is not possible, any extension in the operation of the discount is likely to require primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.86/6">There are also other powers in the 1992 Act which it may be possible to use to achieve a very similar result. For example, under Section 13 of the 1992 Act the Secretary of State may by regulations prescribe conditions which, if met, would result in a person liable to council tax paying a reduced amount of tax. In addition, under Section 13A of the 1992 Act, a billing authority may reduce to such extent as it sees fit the amount of council tax which a person is liable to pay in respect of a chargeable dwelling situated in the authority's area. The power in Section 13A may be exercised in relation to particular cases, or by determining a class of case in which liability is to be reduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.86/7">Any changes to the present council tax system will be made only in the light of the recommendations of the final report of Sir Michael Lyons' independent inquiry, which will be published around the time of the Budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.92/1">The return of people to their homes in Sudan is a major priority for the international community in 2007, particularly in the first half of the year, before the rains make movement difficult. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) predicts 100,000 refugees will return to the south in 2007, in addition to 500,000 internally displace people. The majority of the refugees will come from Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, with Egypt making up a very small percentage.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.92/2">Since 2004, an estimated 1 million people have returned to their homes in the south. The UNHCR has provided some of these with assistance but the majority are spontaneous returnees. DfID has channelled all its funding for the returns process through the UN-administered Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). Of the $133 million allocated so far by the CHF in 2007 (of which the DfID contribution makes up 60 per cent), $12.4 million was given to support the returns process. The majority went to the UNHCR.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.92/3">A considerable amount of the CHF funding for other sectors (for example, water and sanitation, health and nutrition) in the south ($50 million) and the three areas ($17.8 million) is also targeted at areas of return for refugees and the internally displaced.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.92/4">Of the $63 million that the UNHCR received last year for similar operations, the CHF provided $14 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.95/1">In January 2006, our ambassador in Cairo raised with the Egyptian Foreign Ministry our concerns about the death of Sudanese refugees during a police operation to disperse a demonstration by refugees in December 2005.

We understand that the Egyptian public prosecutor subsequently began an investigation into the incident; we continue to press for news about its progress.</p>
