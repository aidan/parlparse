	<p pid="c.168.2/1">The Air Navigation (General) Regulations 1993 prescribe the mandatory reporting to the Civil Aviation Authority of any hazardous, or potentially hazardous, defects encountered during aircraft operations or maintenance. Specifically Article 17(c) requires the reporting of any occurrence involving the impairment during a flight of the capacity of a member of the flight crew properly to undertake his or her functions. The fact that the CAA receives more than 1,000 mandatory occurrence reports from aircrew each year demonstrates that it understands the need for occurrence reporting and the nature of mandatory reports. The CAA is not aware of any under-reporting of oil fume exposures by aircrew. Indeed since all UK aircrew take aviation safety very seriously, there is no reason to believe that they would deliberately under-report occurrences involving impairment.</p>

	<p pid="c.170.8/5">The Welsh Assembly Government and the Countryside Council for Wales have undertaken a similar approach in ensuring that the public in Wales are aware of the extent of the new right of access and their responsibilities while visiting the countryside. The Countryside Council for Wales has established a website that shows the extent of the land (<a href="http://www.ccw.gov.uk">www.ccw.gov.uk</a>) and has published a number of leaflets explaining the new right of access.</p>
	<p pid="c.170.8/6">The Countryside Agency launched an educational campaign in April 2005 aimed at primary and secondary school teachers and youth group leaders in England. It is estimated that 2.1 million young people will be reached in this way.</p>
	<p pid="c.170.8/7">We have established a programme to monitor the effects of access and we will consider the need for more information or other measures if this highlights significant problems.</p>

The national minimum standards for fostering services require that each carer receives an allowance which covers the cost of caring for the looked after child.

This entitles them, for the first time, to a state pension for the years when they are working as foster carers. Foster carers will also be covered for periods when they are awaiting a placement.</p>

	<p pid="c.176.5/1">The <i>Cost of Foster Care</i> report identifies the key elements of an effective fostering service and costs these, but it does not consider whether existing resources are used to best effect. Nor does it consider the impact on fostering budgets of spending in other areas of children's social services. It is essential that local authorities ensure they have effective strategies in place for planning and delivering provision for all their children and young people, and that they make effective use of available resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.5/2">We have already announced that significant additional funding is being made available for children's social services in England. Formula spending is set to rise significantly by 2007&ndash;08; an increase of &pound;500 million in comparison from 2005&ndash;06. This funding will not be ring fenced&mdash;local authorities will be able to plan to meet their own priorities, including those related to fostering.</p>

We are, however, continuing to focus on ways in which we can help improve support for foster carers at local level&mdash;including through the development of proposals for a national minimum allowance for foster carers&mdash;as well as encouraging local authorities to develop more strategic approaches to planning and delivering provision for all looked-after children.</p>

	<p pid="c.177.2/1">Between 1976 and the early 1990s the UK carried out a major geothermal research programme at a cost in excess of &pound;50 million. The key conclusions from the programme were that the UK is unlikely to see major developments based upon geothermal aquifers or the hot dry rock (HDR) method due to a limited resource, poor economics and limited scope for their application.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.2/2">Specifically, a review <sup>1</sup> of the HDR programme carried out in 1990 estimated the cost of energy (in 1990 prices) at around 19p/kWh for the very best potential UK sites. Geothermal aquifer water temperatures in the UK are too low for electricity generation <sup>2</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="c.177.2/3">By comparison modelling <sup>3</sup> carried out to support the Renewables Innovation Review put the cost of onshore wind generation at -3.1p/kWh and offshore wind generation at -5.5p/kWh with both expected to fall further by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.2/4">Unless the technical, practical and economic constraints identified under the previous geothermal programme can be addressed, the prospects for geothermal power in the UK and therefore any subsequent job creation would appear to be limited.</p>

	<p pid="c.178.5/1">The Government take very seriously the need to respect Iraq's cultural heritage. As United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 of June 2004 stressed, all parties need to respect and protect Iraq's archaeological, historical, cultural and religious heritage. The Iraqi Ministry of Culture has begun implementation of an Archaeological Site Protection Plan and the Iraq State Board of Antiquities and Heritage is working to build an archaeological site patrol force to provide a guard force for cultural heritage sites.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.5/2">The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict directs that combatants must avoid directing attacks against protected sites, unless there is a military imperative to do so. The UK is in the process of ratifying the convention and its two protocols. This process is still at an early stage and there have been no discussions with the Iraqi authorities relating to the convention. However, UK troops are already acting in accordance with the spirit of the convention.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.5/3">The UK is a signatory to the 1977 Additional Protocol (AP 1) of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which requires that civilian objects are to be protected from attack, unless that object is being used for military purposes; in which case it may lose its special protected status. UK forces in Iraq have strict instructions not to fire on cultural sites such as mosques and heritage sites, as well as important economic and social infrastructure properties, unless these sites are being used for militarily offensive purposes.</p>

Under current planning, the AU expects to deploy this full force size by the end of October, although this date may be delayed due to other commitments in troop contributing countries, especially for civilian police.</p>

	<p pid="c.181.6/1">The Government are satisfied that the United Kingdom (UK) is fully compliant with Articles 37(a), (b) and (d) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. When ratifying the convention in 1991, the UK entered a reservation against Article 37(c). The reservation concerns the separation of under- and over 18 year-olds and states: &quot;Where at any time there is a lack of suitable accommodation or adequate facilities for a particular individual in any institution in which young offenders are detained, or where the mixing of adults and children is deemed to be mutually beneficial, the United, Kingdom reserves the right not to apply Article 37(c) in so far as those provisions require children who are detained to be accommodated separately from adults&quot;. In recent years, a series of measures have been taken to make the secure estate for under 18s completely separate from that for older offenders. A separate estate for boys was established in 2000. Since the end of 2003, girls under 17 who are sentenced to custody have routinely been placed in secure training centres or secure children's homes. Two special units for 17 year-old girls have been opened and two more are due to open shortly. This will enable all girls under 18 to be held completely apart from over 18 year-olds. There may continue to be particular circumstances where an under 18 year-old may need to be placed in the young adult estate, but we believe the above measures not only meet our obligations under the convention, but accord with the intention underlying Article 37(c). We are also satisfied that we are meeting our obligations under the other provisions of Article 37(c).</p>
