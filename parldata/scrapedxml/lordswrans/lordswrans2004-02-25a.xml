	<p pid="a.64.2/1">Sustainability is difficult to define for a cockle fishery, since wind conditions, storms and other environmental factors combine to cause cockle stocks to vary from year to year even in the absence of fishing. This natural variability may sometimes be of a magnitude that does not permit sustainable fishing. Nevertheless, the existence of sustained, large-scale commercial fisheries for cockles clearly demonstrates that sustainable harvesting is possible under good management. Local sea fisheries committees are responsible for managing fisheries, including cockle fisheries, out to six miles in England and Wales and seek to ensure sustainable exploitation of local stocks within this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.4/2" qnum="HL1290">Why the consultation on the draft framework and guidance on local signage required to implement the new access rights, which was issued in December 2003, had a closing date of 30 January 2004; and</p>
	<p pid="a.64.4/3" qnum="HL1291">How many meetings of local access fora were held between the issue of the draft framework and guidance on local signage for new access rights and the closure of the consultation on 30 January 2004; and whether the consultation period was sufficient for all access fora to fulfill their statutory duty to advise on the development and implementation of recreation and access strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.5/1">The Countryside Agency is working hard to ensure that all processes are in place before the commencement of the new open access rights this September. The agency has been working proactively with a diverse range of stakeholders, including the Ramblers Association, the MoD, the Forestry Commission, English Nature, the National Trust, national park authorities and the Country Land and Business Association to develop the draft local signage framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/2">The agency recognises the valuable contribution which local access forums can make to the signage framework and their important role in advising on recreation and access strategies. However, the agency is also concerned that national guidance on signage is available to access authorities in the lead regions by May 2004, so that they have time to prepare for commencement. A full consultation period of three months would not have allowed the agency to meet this deadline.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/3">The agency appreciates that not every local access forum would have been able to comment on the proposals. However, it is pleased that some local access forums were able to comment and their feedback has been very useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/4">The signage proposals give access authorities the lead role in planning for signage on the ground and suggest they consult local access forums in doing so. This will provide local access forums with further opportunities to fulfil their remit by providing advice at a local level.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.0/1">Movements of captive birds between member states of the European Community, or into the Community from third countries, are subject to conditions and controls laid down in Community law. These import conditions ensure that only animals which are officially certified as being free from serious disease can be traded within or into the Community.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/2">Animals which are traded between member states must be checked before they leave to ensure that only those complying with EC rules move from one member state to another.</p>

There is also a requirement for captive birds to complete a 30-day post-import quarantine period which includes two veterinary visits for clinical examinations (visits are more frequent if the disease situation requires it) and testing for avian influenza and Newcastle disease.</p>
