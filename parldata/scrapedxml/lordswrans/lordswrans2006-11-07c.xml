	<p pid="c.101.20/1">Regulations to address claimants who are in a polygamous marriage have been in force for some time. For instance, in relation to income support, current regulations were introduced in 1987.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.20/2">For contributory benefits, no dependants' increases are payable for any wives where a polygamous household exists, and British law recognisesthose marriages. Where we recognise one of the marriages, any dependants' increases in contributory benefits would be paid only in respect of that one marriage.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.20/3">Income-related benefits can be paid for more than one wife in a polygamous marriage where British law recognises the marriage and where the general conditions of entitlement for those benefits are met. This would apply where the marriages were conducted in a country that recognises polygamy and in which the parties to each marriage were domiciled at the time of their marriage. The amount of benefit payable includes personal allowances for the male spouse and one partner at the appropriate couple rate. For each other partner, benefit is payable at the difference between the couple rate and the higher rate for a single person. In general, therefore, there is no financial advantage to claiming for those in polygamous marriages.</p>

There have been no prosecutions under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, nor were there any under the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 which it replaced. But the success of the Act cannot be measured only by the number of prosecutions. Prosecution after the fact does not relieve the victim of a lifetime of pain and discomfort. We want to prevent female genital mutilation from happening in the first place. The 2003 Act, with its increased maximum penalty, from five to 14 years' imprisonment, is designed to deter this unacceptable practice.</p>

The response from the United Kingdom authorities was sent on <phrase class="date" code="">23 October</phrase>, and itis under consideration by the Commission.

We know, however, that low allowance rates, a lack of transparency about entitlements, and inefficiency in payment systems can impact on foster carers' morale. For that reason, we announced a national minimum allowance for foster carers in July 2006, alongside good practice guidance on payment systems. We expect all fostering providers to work towards meeting the national minimum allowance rates from April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.146/1">We do not collect information centrally on the number of foster carers. However, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) has recently finalised an annual data collection which will provide a range of information about foster carers in England. The return, which will be completed by local authority and independent providers in England, will include information about the number of approved fostering households. We anticipate that data from the returns will be available for analysis in early 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.146/2">With regard to training and support, evidence from the inspection of fostering services shows that local authorities' performance is improving, particularly with regard to the management and support ofcarers. However, the Green Paper <I>Care Matters: Transforming the Lives of Children and Young People in Care</I>, published in October 2006, makes clear that more needs to be done to improve support for foster carers. The document outlines proposals for a &quot;tiered&quot; model of placement types, underpinned by a national qualifications framework for foster carers. The proposed model would be structured around the needs of children, with carers trained and skilled to a level matching children's individual requirements, and would offer a ladder of career progression for carers. The proposals in the Green Paper are subject to consultation.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.176/2">Of these, 278 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder; that represents around 0.3 per cent of service personnel deployed to Iraq in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.176/3">Some 829 others were diagnosed with an adjustment disorder. This figure will include some personnel who have post-traumatic symptoms not amounting to full PTSD but with some symptoms of post-traumatic stress.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.176/4">These figures do not include any personnel who have received treatment for a mental health condition since leaving the Armed Forces. This is because, on leaving the Armed Forces, or on demobilisation for Reservists, it is the long-established practice that responsibility for medical care passes to the NHS. This has been the case since 1948 under successive Governments. To collate figures on medical treatment received by every veteran would therefore require an examination of the records of every NHS trust (and every independent healthcare provider) in the country and could therefore only be done at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.176/5">At a time when personnel have been deployed to other operational theatres before or after deployment to Iraq, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attribute a subsequent mental health condition&mdash;which in many cases may not present itself until months or even years later&mdash;to service on a specific deployment. The department is therefore reviewing its methods of collating figures on service personnel diagnosed with a mental health condition.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.197/1">Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs) were set up following the decision taken over a decade ago to close military hospitals. It had become clear that our existing military hospitals did not have a sufficient patient volume or range of cases to develop and maintain the skills of our medical personnel. This would, over time, impact upon the level of care we would be able to provide to our military patients. The same rationale lies behind the MoD's decision in 1998 to withdraw from the Royal Hospital Haslar.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.197/2">The principal rationale behind MDHUs, located as they are within NHS hospital trusts, is to enable military medical personnel to maintain their clinical skills in an active, up-to-date hospital environment. Our medical personnel are fully integrated within the host trusts, thus ensuring that they retain the essential qualifications allowing them to deploy quickly to areas of conflict, providing the essential medical support to frontline forces. Working with the NHS allows our patients the best possible care from treatment in specialist areas of NHS hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.197/3">Service patients can, and do, receive treatment from any NHS hospital, not just those hosting MDHUs; the question of being unable to meet the projected &quot;patient volumes&quot; would not arise. In addition, it should be noted that the current requirement for hospital in-patient beds for military patients still barely represents two full wards nationwide.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.221/2">Most of the consequences of the losses are contingent on future events. The loss of the scientific records could make replacement of some future international standards more demanding on the NIBSC and collaborating laboratories, although only one of the 15 standards concerned is likely to be replaced in the foreseeable future. The loss of the staff health records might hinder the institute's response to any future legal action by a past employee. The institute is not aware of any such action being considered by any former staff member whose records were affected.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.227/2">The ex-service organisations had been briefed in 2005 on the late inclusion of temporary awards into the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Compensation Scheme Order 2005 and of our intention not to extend appeal rights to such decisions. These groups had already accepted the absence of appeal rights on interim awards, which are in principle similar to temporary awards.</p>

It was therefore felt that temporary awards would similarly not attract any adverse comment.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.299/1">High marginal deduction rates from tax and benefit withdrawal do not affect an individual's decision to work although they can influence decisions to increase their earnings. Changes in marginal deduction rates cause people in different circumstances to respond in different ways. It is therefore difficult to draw general conclusions about behaviour, but there is no evidence to suggest that there is a particular rate above which people's incentives to work are affected.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.299/2">However, the Government have aimed to ensure that the number of people facing very high rates is minimised. Since 1997 the number of families facing rates of over 70 per cent has fallen by half a million.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.308/1">The chief executive of the Roads Service (Dr Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the noble Lord in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/2"><I>Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird dated November 2006.</I></p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question about whether an assessment had been made of the need for traffic-calming measures for the Ballyhackamore area of east Belfast. As this issue falls within my responsibility as Roads Service chief executive, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/4">First, I should explain that the Roads Service is committed to play its part in achieving the targets set by the Northern Ireland Road Safety Strategy through the implementation of road safety engineering measures, and in this context we give a high priority to the introduction of traffic-calming schemes in residential areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/5">However, the Roads Service receives many requests for traffic-calming measures and, although the funding allocated to this type of work has significantly increased in recent years, demand still outstrips our capacity to meet all such requests, and priorities have to be established. The prioritisation of work within any particular area is never easy; however, I can assure you that the Roads Service does attempt to prioritise all schemes in a fair and equitable manner concentrating the available finance in those areas where the need is greatest.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/6">In helping to prioritise areas for the provision of traffic-calming measures, Roads Service officials take account of a number of factors including: collision history, volume and speed of vehicles, and environmental factors such as the presence of schools, playgrounds, shops et cetera. Of these factors, the highest priority is given to safety, resulting in those sites with an accident history being treated before those with a reasonably good safety record. Implicitly, this assessment process takes cognisance of the overall cost of road traffic collisions to society in general. This approach has led to a substantial reduction in collisions and personal injuries at treated sites over a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/7">With regard to the Ballyhackamore area of Belfast, I can advise that Roads Service has carried out a number of traffic-calming assessments, although the only site treated to date has been Wilgar Street.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/8">Our local officials have also recently carried out consultations on proposals to provide traffic calming features in the following streets located in the Ballyhackamore area:</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/9">Earlswood Road</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/10">Belmont Church Road</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/11">Sydenham Avenue</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/12">Holland Drive</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/13">Kirkliston Park</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/14">Hewitt Parade</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/15">Enid Drive</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/16">Enid Parade</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/17">I understand that a number of objections have been received, and these will have to be considered fully before a decision is taken to proceed with the traffic-calming measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/18">In addition, preliminary assessments have also been carried out on the following streets, with a view to possible inclusion within our three-year programme of works, subject to their being favourably prioritised against competing locations:</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/19">Dundela Avenue</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/20">Dundela Gardens</p>
	<p pid="c.101.308/21">Belmont Avenue</p>

The BMTP sets out transport proposals for the Belfast Metropolitan Area to be implemented or commenced by 2015 and also supports the development proposals contained in the draft Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan (BMAP) published by the Department of the Environment (DoE) in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.311/3" class="indent">Within the Transport Plan there is a high priority given to public transport, walking and cycling, as large urban areas like the Belfast Metropolitan Area offer the best opportunities to reduce reliance on the private car. Measures to improve rail frequencies and bus services, effective parking controls, better walking and cycling networks and options for rapid transit should all help in this regard. The BMTP sets out a range of proposals to tackle these problems, under the headings of Walking and Cycling, Public Transport, Highway Network and Management. Key features include: improvements in facilities for walking and cycling; step-change in quality of public transport provision, including an ambitious Park and Ride programme, Quality Bus Corridor programme, improvements to rail services and the commencement of a Rapid Transit network; Highway improvements focused on improving the efficiency and safety of the main strategic network; Better management of the transport systems through parking controls, the application of technology; and Measures to change travel attitudes.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.311/4" class="indent">Whilst a modal shift from private car to more sustainable modes of travel is unlikely to take effect until towards the end of the Plan period, there are a number of road improvement schemes identified in the Transport Plan that are necessary to remove existing bottlenecks and improve traffic flows on the road network. These include: Ml/Westlink; A55 Outer Ring Road; A2 Sydenham Bypass; M2 widening between Sandyknowes and Greencastle; and completion of south section of the City Centre Ring Road (Bankmore Link).</p>
	<p pid="c.101.311/5" class="indent">As you may be aware, the highest profile scheme, the Ml/Westlink/M2 project, is under way and programmed for completion by Spring 2009. This will significantly improve traffic flows on the main strategic route connecting the Ml and M2 motorways through Belfast. As outlined above, road improvement schemes are not the only element of the Plan that will help to improve traffic flows. This week the Department took over responsibility for the enforcement of parking offences in NI and this will also make a contribution to improved traffic flows on Belfast's local road network.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.311/6" class="indent">Further details of the proposals in the Transport Plan can be obtained from the BMTP website https://pronet.wsatkins.co.uk/bmtp/. A copy of the BMTP Transport Plan is also available in the House Libraries&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.317/1">Vehicle excise duty (VED) for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) is banded by revenue weight. This is the confirmed maximum weight (ie, gross weight or gross train weight) for vehicles which are subject to plating and testing. For non-testable vehicles, this will be the maximum weight at which a vehicle can lawfully operate under construction and use limits (ie, the design weight).</p>
	<p pid="c.101.317/2">HGV VED rates were revised in 2001 to reduce the total burden of lorry VED on the haulage industry and, at the same time, to improve the environmental signals that hauliers face to use lorries which cause less road damage and pollution.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.317/3">The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA), an executive agency of the Department for Transport, stops and checks vehicles at the roadside. VOSA can issue a prohibition to any vehicle found to be overloaded, which prevents the vehicle being further used until the excess weight has been removed. VOSA can also prosecute serial offenders or those that have grossly overloaded their vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.317/4">The recent installation of more in-road weigh-in-motion sensors (WIMS) enables VOSA examiners to more easily identify overweight vehicles.</p>
