	<p pid="a.105.8/1">The running costs for Ofsted in 2003&ndash;04 were &pound;208.6 million. The Education Bill makes changes to school inspections and the inspection of early years education provision. Ofsted anticipates direct savings of at least &pound;10 million per annum in the cost of school inspections and &pound;4.7 million per annum in the cost of early years inspections as a consequence of these changes. In addition, Ofsted expects to make substantial savings in running costs as a result of structural changes to the organisation, facilitated by the provisions in the Bill. In total, these changes will deliver reductions of 20 per cent in the overall costs of Ofsted by March 2008.</p>
