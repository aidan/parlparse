	<p pid="a.1.5/1">Authoritative reviews of scientific advances in the field of HIV and the development of an effective vaccine have recently been published by the Global HIV AIDS Vaccine Enterprise (1) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2). The former is based upon discussions among 100 of the world's leading scientists working in the field of HIV. The latter&mdash;from an organisation which the UK has funded with grants totalling &pound;18 million since 2000&mdash;summarises current progress in the co-ordination of scientific research and product development.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">A joint World Health Organisation-United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (WHO-UNAIDS) meeting to be held on 2-<phrase class="date" code="2005-02-03">3 February 2005</phrase>, is reviewing scientific progress across HIV vaccine development research in the US, Europe, Africa and the Far East. DfID is fully engaged with these initiatives seeking to co-ordinate work on HIV vaccine development, and will continue to encourage dissemination of their findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3">The nature of scientific advance is not readily predictable in terms of timescale, particularly with such a complex challenge as posed by the HIV virus. However, recent advances in the field (an increased number of available candidate vaccines, improvements in animal models, a growing database from clinical trials, the availability of new laboratory tools etc.) give cause for cautious confidence that wise investment will result in acceleration of progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.2/1">There is no statutory obligation on landlords to monitor the behaviour of their tenants and visitors. However, when problems relating to anti-social behaviour are reported all landlords have powers to apply for injunctions against tenants or visitors and, in order to support such applications, landlords would be expected to monitor the behaviour of those concerned to produce evidence of their anti-social behaviour. The Housing Executive's Statutory Registration Scheme for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) includes special control provisions designed to prevent HMOs from adversely affecting the amenity or character of the area in which they are situated. If the person having control of or managing an HMO does not take such steps as are reasonably practicable to prevent the behaviour of its residents from adversely affecting the amenity or character of the area, then the Housing Executive can treat this as a &quot;relevant management failure&quot; which can lead to the revocation of the registration or a refusal to register the property.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">It is expected that landlords use their own discretion, taking cognisance of the views of the police, district councils and local communities and the evidence gathered as a result of their own monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/3">Under the terms of the Housing (NI) Order 2003 public sector landlords, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and registered housing associations, have powers to seek repossession of a property from a tenant if that tenant fails to ensure that any individual residing with them, or visiting the property, behaves in a reasonable and appropriate manner. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has additional powers under the Anti-social Behaviour (NI) Order 2004 which permits it to seek an anti-social behaviour order against any individual over the age of 10 years of age who causes harassment, alarm or distress in housing executive estates.</p>

That guidance superseded any earlier guidance. No separate guidance has been issued to the judiciary on membership of specific organisations or involvement in specific campaigns. The guidance provides that judges must ensure that while holding full-time office they conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the authority and standing of a judge. They must not, in any capacity, engage in any activity which might, undermine, or be reasonably thought to undermine, their judicial independence or impartiality. Where a judicial office holder has any doubt about the application of the principles contained within the guidance he or she is advised to seek advice from a senior colleague, head of division, the Lord Chancellor or his Permanent Secretary.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.8/1">Local authorities receive funding for their homelessness responsibilities through formula grant which is distributed through formula spending shares (FSS). The local government finance settlement 2005&ndash;06 provides for an increase of 2.5 per cent in the environmental, protective and cultural services FSS block (which covers homelessness services). Formula grant is unhypothecated and spending priorities are a matter for individual local authorities. Authorities use their powers under Section 180 of the Housing Act 1996 to pay grants to voluntary sector agencies to help tackle homelessness from these and other resources available to them.</p>

We are providing &pound;60 million in 2004&ndash;05, rising to &pound;74 million in 2007&ndash;08, to help local authorities and voluntary sector agencies take action to prevent homelessness. Our strategy on homelessness builds on successes in reducing rough sleeping by two-thirds, ending the long-term use of bed and breakfast hotels as accommodation for homeless families with children, and more recent reductions in the number of new cases of homelessness. More effective prevention of homelessness will be coupled with new action and increased investment in social and other affordable housing to improve the supply of, and access to, settled homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/1">The Department for Education and Skills does not have information on the proportion of truanting pupils who are involved in some form of criminal activity. The 2004 MORI Youth Survey for the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales found that of the young people in mainstream education who admitted committing an offence, 45 per cent of them said that they had played truant from school.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/2">However, while there is a link between truancy and crime, not all truants are drawn into crime and there is no conclusive evidence about which comes first, truancy or offending.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.8/1">The Licensing Act 2003 imposes no new burdens on the National Health Service. The cost to health of alcohol misuse was estimated in the alcohol harm reduction strategy as up to &pound;1.7 billion per annum and we do not anticipate that the implementation of the 2003 Act will fundamentally alter these figures. The implementation of the 2003 Act is expected to help reduce levels of binge-drinking which currently occur as a result of fixed closing times for on-licensed premises. We are also confident that the measures in the alcohol harm reduction strategy, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-15">15 March 2004</phrase>, will significantly reduce alcohol-related harm. The regulatory impact assessment presented to Parliament when the Licensing Bill entered the House of Commons in March 2003 indicated that there should be no additional costs to the police in terms of enforcing licensing law generated by the reforms. Once the Act becomes fully operational, the saving to the police in respect of administrative activity is estimated to be &pound;15 million annually, which can be redeployed to frontline police work. The 2003 Act does not introduce unrestricted opening hours for 24 hours a day. An applicant's proposal for any variation of his hours will be subject to scrutiny by a range of responsible authorities such as the police and interested parties such as local residents and the hours may be restricted if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">This issue is being dealt with through clauses in the clean neighbourhoods Bill, currently being considered by a Standing Committee in another place. The aim is to prevent the activities of commercial businesses that sell vehicles on the street thus reducing parking opportunities, causing nuisance to ordinary people and significantly blighting an area</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">These clauses are needed because currently there is no specific law against selling cars on the street. Some local authorities tackle this through existing highways or street trading legislation but consultation has told us that this is very difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">In response to this, we are proposing to introduce a new offence of exposing or advertising two or more vehicles for sale on a road as part of a business; this is included in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill. The offence will be punishable through the courts or through fixed penalty notices.</p>
