	<p pid="a.242.2/1">The defence logistics transformation programme continues to deliver significant benefits to the UK's Armed Forces. It is not only driving improvements in the effectiveness of the logistics support provided to the front line commands, but also reducing the costs associated with providing that support.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.2/2">Against the Defence Logistics Organisation's (DLO's) strategic goal of reducing output costs by 20 per cent, the programme had delivered audited savings of &pound;755 million by the end of 2005-06. This enabled the DLO to exceed its strategic goal target by &pound;100 million. In 2005-06, the programme also contributed a further &pound;660 million of audited savings against an in-year efficiency target of &pound;538 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.2/3">The principles of logistics transformation instigated by the programme are becoming increasingly embedded throughout the MoD including the front line commands. They will also be at the heart of Defence Equipment and Support, the new integrated procurement and support organisation that forms in April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.2/1">There are 33 children within a 10-mile radius of the proposed Middletown Centre for Autism who have had a health assessment of autism. There are 67 children with an educational assessment of autism attending schools which are within a 10-mile radius of the centre and three pre-school children with an educational assessment of autism living within a 10-mile radius of the centre. It is not possible to provide the actual number of all school age children with an educational assessment of autism who live within a 10-mile radius of the centre.

The vice chairman has accepted an invitation to discuss these and other issues with the Minister for Veterans. The Minister has offered a number of dates and we hope that a meeting will take place shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.257.3/1">Operation Sinbad is a joint multinational force (MNF)/Iraqi operation to improve security in Basra City. When the operation began in September 2006, Iraqi forces were employed in a supporting role but, as Op Sinbad has progressed, they have gained valuable experience and expertise, which has seen them taking on the lead role. As a consequence, the number of UK troops involved reduced from approximately 650 in the early phases of the operation to fewer than 150 troops in the latter phases of the operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/2">Over the course of Op Sinbad, more than $70 million is being invested in a host of reconstruction activities including water and electricity infrastructure projects, hospital and school refurbishments and resupply and road network improvements. In order to achieve this, security forces &quot;pulse&quot; into a particular focus area for 36 hours to allow civilian and military engineers, and Iraqi civilian workers to carry out a variety of immediate impact reconstruction activities and to initiate a number of medium and longer-term projects. Following the initial pulses the medium and long-term projects are carried forward by Iraqis. There are currently more than 100 Op Sinbad medium/long-term projects, worth tens of millions of dollars, still ongoing and it is estimated that the majority of the medium-term projects will be completed in the next two months while the longer-term projects are likely to remain ongoing for three to six months. In addition to the reconstruction work, a MNF police training team visits local police stations during Op Sinbad to assess the abilities of the police services and provide training and mentoring.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/3">Op Sinbad will continue to be conducted in other parts of Basra province, including more rural and provincial areas, with Iraqi forces taking the lead for delivering the operation in these areas. The projects for these focus areas are still being developed and it is not possible to say accurately at this stage what further investment will be made in these areas. However, outwith Op Sinbad, five major projects are planned to improve roads, water and sewage treatment in the multinational division (south east) area. It is estimated that the total cost of this investment will be some $23 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.5/1">The noble Lord will be aware of paragraph 19 of Annex A of the St Andrews agreement which provides for a restored North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) to appoint a review group to examine the efficiency and value for money of existing implementation bodies; and the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation within the NSMC where mutual benefit would be derived.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.5/2">That group would also input into the work commissioned by the NSMC, prior to suspension in 2002, on the identification of a suitable substitute for the proposed Lights Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission. When such a substitute is identified and agreed by NSMC, the name of the implementation body as defined in the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 could be amended, though I would have to stress that any such amendment to the body's functions or title would require the specific endorsement of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.0/1">The ODA's sustainable development strategy, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-23">23 January</phrase>, sets out its aim to maximise the environmental and health benefits of its transportation and logistics planning for materials during the enabling works and construction phases of the Olympic programme. It aspires for at least 50 per cent of materials, by weight, to be transported to the Olympic park by water or rail during construction, minimising the impact on the surrounding community and road networks. Where road transportation is used, the ODA will facilitate full journeys, palletised deliveries and routine road shipments during off peak travel times.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.2/1">The Government have introduced or strengthened a number of safeguards to protect scheme members where their company is sold on or broken up.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/2">Where a defined benefit occupational pension scheme pension continues to run on and the new sponsoring employer remains solvent, the employer would need to meet the new scheme funding requirements applicable to pension scheme valuations completed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase> which are based on an effective valuation date on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-22">22 September 2005</phrase>. Under the new regime trustees must develop prudent funding strategies, and the new requirements can be expected to lead to improvements in scheme funding levels generally over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/3">Where such a pension scheme commences wind-up, any deficit in the scheme becomes a debt on the employer. The Government have strengthened this requirement so that the debt is calculated on the basis that the scheme should be able to meet the full costs of winding up and the full benefits that scheme members have accrued and expect to receive (the &quot;full buy-out&quot; level).</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/4">The law also specifies a priority order so that, where a defined benefit occupational pension scheme is wound up with insufficient assets to meet all liabilities, the assets are shared as fairly as possible among scheme members.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/5">Where the sponsoring employer of a defined benefit occupational pension scheme becomes insolvent and the scheme cannot pay the benefits members were expecting, members may be eligible for compensation from the Pension Protection Fund, which was set up in April 2005</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/6">The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may make payments out of the National Insurance Fund into an occupational pension scheme if he is satisfied that an employer has become insolvent and that at the time it became insolvent there remained unpaid employee or employee contributions falling to be paid to the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/7">In addition to these measures, the Government introduced the financial assistance scheme, which was recently extended substantially. The financial assistance scheme provides assistance funded by the taxpayer to qualifying members of qualifying schemes who face pension losses because their scheme started to wind up underfunded, between <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>, where the employer is insolvent or no longer exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/8">The Government are currently considering the implications of the recent ruling of the European Court of Justice on article 8 of the 1980 insolvency directive, as explained by the right honourable John Hutton in his Written Statement laid in both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-26">26 January 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.5/2">The Police Rehabilitation and Retraining Trust (PRRT) provide a range of psychological therapies and physiotherapy treatments. They also provide a comprehensive service of career and personal development guidance, as well as training and education. These services as well as being available to ex officers are also available (and promoted) to members of the RUC GC Widows Association and the RUC GC Parents Association. Children of deceased officers can receive psychological support through the PRRT Children and Young People's Service.</p>

The PSNI Employee Support Service is happy to provide advice about the range of external organisations that are available to assist.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.2/1">The health and safety statistics for ill health and injuries by industry sector are based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The statistics by sector do include people working on road maintenance and construction but they are classified under the construction sector, not the transport and communications sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/2">Injuries from road traffic accidents are not included in these LFS statistics. This is in order to be consistent with the scope of the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 1995, which forms the basis for the statistics published by HSC and does not require the majority of road accidents to be reported to the health and safety enforcing authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/3">However, ill health reporting requirements in RIDDOR do not exclude work-related driving. Any cases of work-related illness ascribed by respondents to driving as part of their employment are included under the appropriate industry sector for that employment, including transport and communications, but they are not separately identifiable.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/4">The standard industry classification does not allow road and rail transport to be clearly separated within the transport and communication section code.</p>
