	<p pid="b.171.2/1">The housing market renewal programme is not based on demolition and dispersal. The Government do not have plans to demolish 400,000 homes as often misquoted. The nine market renewal Pathfinders plan to fund the demolition of 10,000 homes by March 2006, compared with refurbishing 20,000 homes and building 3,000 new ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.2/2">The programme is based on giving people an option to stay in an area when their circumstances change, by providing more choice of good quality housing through a mix of refurbishment, demolition and new build. The Pathfinders are expected to ensure replacement housing enables anyone affected by demolition to stay nearby.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.2/3">Each Pathfinder is developing programmes for the period up to 2008 and as part of that they are expected to demonstrate how they are engaging communities and ensuring that residents have a role. These proposals will be scrutinised by the Audit Commission. For example, in Liverpool, the number of demolitions proposed in the Anfield area was increased in response to community demand, and 72 per cent of residents in the &quot;Welsh Streets&quot; area supported the need for radical change, including demolition.</p>

	<p pid="b.174.2/1">Information about compensation payments made for compulsory purchase of land is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The level of compensation payable in an individual case is a matter for negotiation between the acquiring authority and the land owner.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.2/2">Compensation for residential home owners is generally payable under three heads: the open market value of the property disregarding the effect of the scheme underlying the compulsory acquisition; disturbance costs in respect of the losses sustained as a direct consequence of having to move out of the property; and a home-loss payment payable in recognition of the distress and discomfort of being compelled to move, based on 10 per cent of the open market value of the land subject to a minimum payment of &pound;3,400 and a maximum payment of &pound;34,000 (these thresholds are currently the subject of an annual review).</p>

	<p pid="b.175.0/1">To date, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received five ministerial letters from residents via their MP and one from a non-governmental body, the Merseyside Civic Trust, opposing the housing market renewal programme. In other correspondence we have received approximately 25 letters and e-mails voicing similar opposition or concerns. One of these letters was from the Spital Hill Local Voice group based in Sheffield.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/2">The Ancient Monuments Society, the Victorian Society, the Council for British Archaeology, the Heritage Trust for the Northwest and the Prince's Trust have not expressed a formal view to the Government on the HMR programme. Save Britain's Heritage gave evidence in the recent Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Select Committee on Empty Homes and Low Demand Pathfinders, which can be found at <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmodpm/295/295we02.htm">www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmodpm/295/295we02.htm</a>.

	<p pid="b.175.0/3">English Heritage has recently produced a policy position statement on housing market renewal in which it recommended that Pathfinders should undertake an assessment of the historic environment to help to inform the regeneration of their areas. The Government agree with this. English Heritage accepts that a reduction of the housing stock is necessary and that some demolition is inevitable.</p>

	<p pid="b.178.6/1">The reforms introduced in April 2004 addressed serious concerns about increasing costs and poor quality work. They were designed to target resources on cases with merit and to drive up the quality of publicly funded legal services in the field of asylum and immigration. Since the changes were introduced the number of firms and organisations undertaking this work has fallen but during 2004&ndash;05 the net reduction was less than 10 per cent. This is in the context of a significant fall in asylum numbers from a peak of 84,000 to 32,000 in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.6/2">In most areas of the country there is an adequate number of suppliers and the Legal Services Commission (LSC) acts to ensure that any local gaps in supply are addressed as quickly as possible. The measures introduced last year are essential to achieve and maintain control of costs and the LSC has worked closely with suppliers to ensure that the procedures are as effective as possible. In 2004&ndash;05 89 per cent of applications from suppliers were dealt with by the LSC within one day and 97 per cent within two days. The merits test used by the LSC in determining applications is contained in the Funding Code approved by Parliament in 2000. Good quality law firms and advice agencies with a proven record of success are entitled to work to higher thresholds under devolved powers. The LSC is committed to ensuring the majority of suppliers obtain devolved powers status.</p>

	<p pid="b.182.6/3">I have been asked to provide you with information requested in the above Parliamentary Question.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.6/4">Two general concerns were raised with the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People regarding possible child prostitution involving children's homes in the Sperrin Lakeland and Foyle Trust. The commissioner took steps to ensure that these concerns were raised with the trust, the Health and Social Services Board and the PSNI.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.6/5">The commissioner wrote to every children's home in Northern Ireland to identify that the Sexual Offences Act &quot;Risk of Sexual Harm Order&quot; was a new legal resource to tackle this problem and to offer help and support if there was a problem with child prostitution. The commissioner has also proposed multi-agency training about the use of Risk of Sexual Harm Orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.6/6">In the Armagh and Dungannon area we were told about the possible prostitution of an individual young person who is being looked after by the local Trust. Although it was alleged that there was evidence of child prostitution that evidence was not passed to us, the trust or the PSNI. To address the specific concerns raised about the individual, the commissioner appointed an independent social worker to investigate the young person's care by the Trust. There has been no suggestion that the young person is currently being abused in this way and the report concluded that the care plans were both adequate and effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.6/7">The Commissioner has written to all the Area Child Protection Committees drawing their attention to the issue and suggesting multi-agency training to raise awareness and develop ways to tackle the problem. There has been a positive response to this which is currently being following up.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.6/8">The abuse of young people in care by those who target them for sexual exploitation is an issue the commissioner takes very seriously. The commissioner has raised the profile of this issue in the media and continues to work in partnership with the trusts, the PSNI and other voluntary children's bodies to find ways to promote this serious issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.8/39">It is possible to provide figures for the number of salmon caught per annum, whether retained or released. However that figure will only be a representation of the actual stocks and is likely to fluctuate due to fishing practices and demand. The migratory aspect of the species renders it very difficult to come up with accurate figures for the stocks at any one time.</p>

The MTP broadly divides standby power consumption for appliances into the following categories:</p>
	<p pid="b.188.2/3" class="indent">Consumer electronics (e.g. televisions, digital set-top boxes and video recording equipment)&mdash;approximately 420 Gwh per month;</p>

	<p pid="b.188.2/7">There is also further energy consumption from white goods such as washing machines and dishwashers which are switched on awaiting use or after they have completed their wash cycles; consumer electronic equipment using external power supplies (e.g. domestic portable telephones) that continue to consume energy when plugged in but not in use; and domestic personal computer equipment where the stand-by facilities are not properly enabled.

	<p pid="b.189.2/1">The most recent estimate by the Government's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) is that taken together consumer electronics, home computing equipment, domestic cooking equipment and office equipment in the UK consumed approximately 580&ndash;600 GWh per month while in standby mode.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/2">We are also aware that there is further energy consumption from white goods such as washing machines and dishwashers which are switched on awaiting use or after they have completed their wash cycles; consumer electronic equipment using external power supplies (e.g. domestic portable telephones) that continue to consume energy when plugged in but not in use; and domestic personal computer equipment where the stand-by facilities are not properly enabled. Taken together, these sources of consumption may bring the overall figure to around 760 GWh per month.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/3">In order to try to tackle this problem the Market Transformation Programme (<a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the &quot;on&quot; and the stand-by power consumption of household appliances through the adoption of design improvements, voluntary codes of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets. This approach has been fairly successful in respect of televisions: an EU-wide voluntary agreement will mean that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK now consume around 1 watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3 to 8 watts consumed by older models. This agreement is currently being extended to cover other consumer electronics.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/4">A similar agreement for external power supplies aims to encourage new power supplies consuming around half a watt in stand-by mode compared to the present average of just over 2 watts.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/5">The recently agreed Framework Directive for the Eco-design of Energy Using Products (EUP), which is expected to come into force later this year, will provide a streamlined and effective route for setting EU-wide environmental requirements for traded goods. EUP requires the Commission and member states to treat the issue of standby energy consumption as a priority area for consideration. The UK will work proactively with the Commission and other member states to influence and speed the delivery of measures under EUP</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/6">In addition, the Government's initiative on sustainable procurement, announced in the autumn of 2003, includes a requirement for government departments which purchase computers and televisions to specify low stand by power requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.192.0/1">While the Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely ratified of all the core human rights treaties, implementation remains varied. The UK has a number of concerns, which are reflected in the rights of the child resolutions which we sponsor with EU and Latin American partners at the UN General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights every year. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child considers implementation of the Convention and its Optional Protocols by States Parties. Its conclusions and recommendations, including on specific countries, can be found at <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/index.htm">www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/2">The Government continue to talk to the internet industry about how best to use technology to block, reduce access to and remove exploitative images of children wherever possible, Less than 1 per cent of potentially illegal content reported to the Internet Watch Foundation is hosted by internet service providers in the UK. The UK also co-operates with other governments and supports their efforts to detect, prevent and punish on-line exploitation of children.</p>

	<p pid="b.192.3/1">The Government take very seriously the need to respect Iraq's cultural heritage. As United Nations Security Council resolution 1546 (June 2004) stressed, all parties need to respect and protect Iraq's archaeological, historical, cultural, and religious heritage. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials are in regular contact with the Iraqi Ministry of Culture. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, (Tessa Jowell), spoke to the former Iraqi Minister of Culture on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January</phrase> and is kept closely informed of key cultural issues in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.3/2">In early 2005 the Government funded a capacity-building visit to the UK by three Iraqi interns from Babylon. They received training on site management techniques and museology and were based at the British Museum. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will give careful consideration to any further proposals designed to help the cultural reconstruction of Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="b.193.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-12">12 June</phrase> the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) ruled that in the case of <i>Ocalan </i>v <i>Turkey </i>the general conditions in which the applicant was being detained at Imrali Prison did not constitute inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the ECHR, and consequently there was no violation of Article 3. The Council of Europe's Commission for Prevention of Torture (CPT) visited Ocalan on Imrali in February 2003 to assess his prison conditions and their report was published along with the Turkish Government's response in February 2004. We have discussed the CPT report and Turkey's response with the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Embassy staff discuss Mr Ocalan's situation with his lawyers as developments arise. We do not intend to ask the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture to re-examine his prison conditions and report at this time.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.0/2">Improving the security situation is key if those who have been displaced are to return to their homes.

	<p pid="b.194.0/3">We welcome the planned expansion of the AU mission to over 7,700 personnel and have allocated &pound;19 million in support of this. Where AU troops are deployed, they have helped to create the necessary conditions for some internally displaced persons returns. For example, in Labado and Khor Abeche the AU presence has, according to the UN, enabled 15,000 and 4,500 people respectively to return to their homes. The additional troops will enable the AU to provide greater geographical coverage in Darfur, and a more permanent presence in areas where it is already deployed.</p>
