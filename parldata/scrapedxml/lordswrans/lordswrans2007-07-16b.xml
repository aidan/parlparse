	<p pid="b.3.3/1">Border and Immigration Agency staff at ports and asylum screening units refer all children to local authority children's services if they have arrived alone or where there are concerns that a child may be at risk of harm. If there is a suspicion that a child has been trafficked, this will be reported to the appropriate authorities. The local authority will assess the care and support required under Sections 17 and 20 of the Children Act 1989. If the child becomes the responsibility of the local authority, it acts as the corporate parent through the appointed social worker. The Government do not believe, therefore, that the appointment of a guardian specifically for trafficked children is necessary or desirable.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/2">Unaccompanied children who then go on to apply for asylum are referred to the Refugee Council children's panel of advisors, which helps find legal representatives for the child.

	<p pid="b.3.6/1">The Met Office has not proposed that the United Kingdom renounce its membership of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The UK is supportive of the work of the centre and is committed to ensuring it has appropriate levels of funding to maintain its scientific eminence in medium-range weather forecasting. But under proposed budget increases the UK's contribution will grow, in real terms, by more than a third over the next five years. This equates to a rise of approximately &pound;2 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.6/2">The Government are committed to promoting robust governance and sound management in all international organisations where the UK is a stakeholder. Through better financial management and procurement, improved transparency and accountability, we believe the ECMWF can continue to deliver its core medium-range weather forecasting mission to a high standard without large budget increases.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.6/3">The ECMWF council recently considered proposals from the Met Office aimed at improving management and procurement practices at the ECMWF which, if accepted, would resolve UK concerns over ECMWF governance and value for money. However, without such acceptance, the UK would need to reconsider its membership of the centre.</p>

In circumstances of a complaint, the complainant is allowed to attend and, at the discretion of the presiding officer, may be accompanied by a friend or relative.

Many local authorities ensure that the naming of any new roads preserves some historic local connection to the area. In many cases, the council will carry out a consultation exercise with the Royal Mail, the appropriate local town or parish council and the relevant highway authority before any new name is decided.</p>

It has developed new training models for technicians and a fast-track graduate development programme for those wanting to enter careers as technologists. More broadly, the science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) programme promotes technology careers to young people and raises the profile of opportunities available in the manufacturing and process industries. In addition, the Government expect to announce shortly plans for the implementation of the recommendations in the Leitch report on skills.</p>
