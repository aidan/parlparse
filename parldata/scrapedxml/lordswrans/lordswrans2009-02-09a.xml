Although applicants for British passports are asked for details of any other passport held at the time of application, any system of recording passports obtained or renewed during the validity of the UK passport would be costly and difficult to enforce where a person with dual nationality chose not to notify the acquisition of a passport in their other nationality.</p>

Currently, the Public Prosecution Service requires the police to submit a file in every case in which an investigation has produced evidence that an identifiable person has committed a criminal offence. What is required to be included in the file depends upon the nature of the police recommendation and a full file is required only where that recommendation is for prosecution. These arrangements are currently under review and consideration is being given to a number of options that may improve delivery of criminal justice without undermining the integrity and fairness of the process that is essential for public confidence to be maintained.</p>
