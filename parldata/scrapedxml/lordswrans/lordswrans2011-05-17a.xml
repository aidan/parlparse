	<p pid="a.292.2/1">The Department for Transport's approach to improving bus punctuality is based on effective local partnerships. Working with local authority and operator representatives, the Senior Traffic Commissioner, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and Passenger Focus, the Department for Transport (DfT) developed and agreed a new approach to bus punctuality, including its enforcement, based on the development of punctuality partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/2">DfT asked VOSA to consider how the bus punctuality work it undertakes could be changed to support the new approach. Rather than a small team focusing on the road-side monitoring of services to prepare for possible sanctions against operators in response to complaints, VOSA will take a more proactive role working with both operators and local authorities to facilitate improvements. VOSA has determined that the most effective and efficient way to deliver this within the resources available is through frontline traffic examiner work. This will form around 25 per cent of an examiner's workload, with between 80 to 100 examiners trained (around 4 to 5 per VOSA enforcement office) giving a much greater physical presence on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/3">The traffic examiners will be fully trained in this new area of work and will bring their broader investigative skills to the function. VOSA has ensured that sufficient resource is available so that other examiner activities around the country are not impacted by this change. The new system will be introduced gradually from June 2011 with full roll out by end of 2011-12. During this period there will be some joint running with the existing Bus Compliance team until the transition is completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/4">With VOSA having a more proactive approach it is envisaged that passengers should see swifter improvements to services following the identification of problems. However, the traffic commissioners will continue to decide whether an operator and/or local authority should be brought before a public inquiry when there is evidence of poor levels of punctuality performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/5">The Passenger Transport Executive Group and the senior traffic commissioner have already signalled their support for the new approach and traffic commissioners, local government, the bus industry and passenger groups have been informed.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.2/3">NHS commissioners have also provided increased access to testing for hepatitis C and other BBVs in prisons through provision of primary care and sexual health services. The department anticipates that levels of testing for hepatitis C and other BBVs among prisoners will continue to grow. The department's Offender Health team aims to continue health promotion campaigns to support increased awareness and health-seeking behaviour. Offender Health is also working with third sector organisations like the National AIDS Trust and the BLT to develop resources to guide prisoners, prison staff and healthcare providers and commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/4">NHS acute trusts' laboratories and regional and national reference laboratories charge standard tariffs for testing of samples for hepatitis C and other BBVs. NHS commissioners have provided appropriate services in public prisons to ensure that prisoners can be tested for BBVs if they choose to do so. Costs for such tests are as per standard tariffs. The department does not have specific information on the expenditure by NHS organisations on the testing of prisoners specifically for hepatitis C. Such costs would be included in the costs for provision of testing to the wider community and not disaggregated based on whether a person is a prisoner at the time of testing.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.0/1">The Government are pleased that both the British Bankers' Association and a number of individual banks have decided against appealing the recent judicial review judgment on payment protection insurance (PPI). This will allow consumers to secure redress swiftly and will avoid protracted legal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/2">The Government support the work that the Financial Services Authority, the Competition Commission, the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Office of Fair Trading are undertaking to recompense customers who have been mis-sold PPI policies; and to prevent such cases of mis-selling in the future. We will continue to encourage them to combat consumer detriment in all of its forms.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/3">As a result of regulatory action, industry will no longer be able to sell single premium PPI alongside unsecured loans. Firms representing a significant proportion of the market have agreed to review sales and redress consumers identified as mis-sold. In addition, sales, marketing materials and contract terms for PPI have all been improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/4">The Competition Commission has also recently confirmed its proposed point-of-sale prohibition, intended to give more time to consumers to consider their need for the product and to shop around for best value.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.2/1">The UK's financial share of the European Union development assistance programmes is approximately 15 per cent of the cost of those programmes. They are financed from a number of instruments, all of which are managed by the European Commission. These include the European Development Fund (EDF), a member states' voluntary fund for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries as well as a number of EU budget instruments such as the Development Co-operation Instrument and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. In 2009, the European Union's total aid disbursements were &#8364;9.8 billion (&#163;8.7 billion). The UK's share of this was approximately &#8364;1.3 billion (&#163;1.2 billion).</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/2">There is no international definition for emerging economies. However, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are often brought together under the acronym BRICS. Other emerging economies, from a development perspective and as actors with a global agenda, could include Indonesia, Mexico and some Gulf countries. The EDF, the most poverty-focused of the EU's development instruments, does not support any emerging economies. The latest European Commission annual report on development assistance was produced in 2010, covering commitments and spending for 2009. The full report, which includes data on all regions, countries and sectors, is available in the Library of the House and on the European Commission website at: <a href="http://www.ec.europa.eu/europeaid/multimedia/publications/publications/annualreports/2010_en.htm">www.ec.europa.eu/europeaid/multimedia/publications/publications/annualreports/2010_en.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/3">Some examples from this report: in 2009, the European Commission disbursed &#8364;13.6 million (&#163;1.2 million) to Brazil, &#8364;110.0 million (&#163;97.8 million) to South Africa, &#8364;32.0 million (&#163;28.4 million) to China and &#8364;54.0 million (&#163;48.0 million) to India. Indonesia received &#8364;81.0 million (&#163;72.0 million) and Mexico &#8364;4.4 million (&#163;3.9 million).

	<p pid="a.309.2/1">In 2009, the European Commission spent almost 40 per cent (&#8364;3.8 billion, which is approximately &#163;3.2 billion) out of a total aid spend of &#8364;9.8 billion (approximately &#163;8.2 billion) on social infrastructure and services, including health and population. Approximately &#8364;600 million (approximately &#163;500 million) or some 6 per cent was spent directly on health and population, which includes reproductive health assistance, contributing to reducing maternal mortality. Other support to education, water and sanitation and other social infrastructure also contributes to MDG 5 indirectly. Further details on spending, regions and sectors can be found in the 2010 annual report on the European Union's Development and External Assistance Policies and their Implementation, which is available in the Library of the House and on the European Commission website at: <a href="http://www.europa.eu/europeaid/multimedialpuhlications/publications/annualreports/2010en.htrn">www.europa.eu/europeaid/multimedialpuhlications/publications/annualreports/2010en.htrn</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.2/1">The Representation of the People Act 1918 provided that only British subjects could register as electors. In 1918 the whole of Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The term &quot;British subject&quot; then included any person who owed allegiance to the Crown, regardless of the Crown territory in which he or she was born. In general terms, this included citizens who became Commonwealth citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.2/2">Following the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and the consequent partition of the island of Ireland, the then Irish Free State remained part of the Commonwealth and so Irish citizens, like the citizens of other Commonwealth countries, were able to vote when resident in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.2/3">Following the declaration of a Republic of Ireland, the Ireland Act 1949 recognised that the state had &quot;ceased to be part ... of His Majesty's dominions&quot; and so was no longer part of the Commonwealth. However, the Act also stipulates that the Republic of Ireland is &quot;not a foreign country for the purposes of any law&quot; in the United Kingdom and its territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.2/4">The Ireland Act 1949 therefore has the effect that citizens of the Republic of Ireland are not to be treated as &quot;aliens&quot;, and preserved their voting rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.2/5">The entitlement of Irish citizens to vote is currently set out in the Representation of People Act 1983. Section 4(l)(c) and (3)(c) of the Act provide that citizens of the Republic of Ireland are entitled to register as parliamentary and local government electors provided that they fulfil the age and residence requirements and are not subject to any other legal incapacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.2/6">This position reflects the historical ties which exist between Ireland and the United Kingdom. Since 1985 British citizens resident in the Republic of Ireland have been entitled to vote in elections to the D&#224;il.</p>
