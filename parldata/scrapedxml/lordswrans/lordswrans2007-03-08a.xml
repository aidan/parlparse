	<p pid="a.61.2/1">DfID generally supports the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) in delivering their messages about reconstruction and development to the Afghan population, rather than promoting DfID's work directly. It is the GoA that is accountable to the people of Afghanistan for delivering reconstruction and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">An example of DfID's support for this approach is our &pound;1.5 million funding of UNDP to support the office of the spokesperson in the Office of the President from January 2004 to January 2007. This project helped the GoA improve public information on and understanding of reconstruction and development by developing and implementing a communications strategy, providing public information through press releases and establishing provincial outreach offices. It also supported the production of public information programmes, and a well known radio programme called, &quot;You and Your President&quot;, on which Afghans can ask President Karzai questions about reconstruction and development. A project evaluation found that presidential communications had improved dramatically over the life of the project, and Afghan journalists fed back that the presidency is now very accessible to the media and the quality of presidential communications is generally good. A permanent communications unit will be housed in the Office of the President to continue this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/3">DfID also plans to hold an exhibition in Kabul entitled &quot;Afghan Lives: Development in Action&quot; which tells the stories of real Afghans whose lives have been changed by DfID's programmes in the past five years. This exhibition is currently touring the UK. We also make many of DfID's publications available on the internet and in our office, and are working with the World Bank to explain the successes of programmes that we co-fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.0/14">Studies have included: assessment of the waste mass; human health studies, to assess the potential impact through direct exposure or via any vapour or dust generated from the site; and surveys to assess the impact on groundwater and surface water.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/15">Current studies relate to the significant pollutant linkages on the Record of Determination (ground and surface waters), and an assessment of appropriate remedial options for the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/16"><I>Maendy, Rhondda Cynon Taf</I>: I understand from Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council that no health studies have been conducted at this site. However, in 1975, the Department of the Environment carried out a study on possible water contamination by leachates. The site has been identified as warranting further investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/17"><I>Penrhos, Caerphilly: </I>According to Caerphilly county borough council, risk assessments and other studies were carried out in 1996, 1997, 2001, 2003 and 2005, by various consultants.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/18"><I>Ruabon and Wrexham:</I> I assume the noble Countess refers to the Monsanto chemical waste tip to the north of Rhosllanerchrugog, and the adjacent Llwyneinion acid tar lagoon. The regulator, Wrexham county borough council, has advised that it only has records for the first of these sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/19">Investigations in 1995 into the first site's potential impacts on groundwater, surface water and human health, resulted in remedial work being carried out. Following new legislation and guidance, further studies are under way. All relevant pathways are being considered, such as inhalation, dermal contact, ingestion, and leaching through permeable ground strata. No scientific studies are known to have been carried out at the second site.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/20"><I>Newport, South Wales: </I>I assume the noble Countess refers to the Solutia site at this location. Solutia UK has conducted environmental risk assessment of Polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) releases to the Severn Estuary. These are fugitive releases to water from historic contamination (spillage at the site rather than any waste deposits) underneath the site. It included assessment of the opportunities for bio-accumulation within the food chain and the potential for human health risks. The Food Standards Agency reviewed the assessment and concluded that &quot;the operation is unlikely to have any unacceptable effects on the human food chain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/21"><I>Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria:</I> The Environment Agency (EA) is not aware of any studies on the impact of the site on human or animal health and has not been alerted by the local health authority or State Veterinary Service of any evidence of such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/22"><I>Rayleigh, Essex: </I>The Environment Agency (EA) holds limited information for historic landfill sites in the Rayleigh area.

This general information was originally obtained from Rochford district council, which may hold further details.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/23">There is no record of any toxic chemical waste being disposed at these sites. The EA has not conducted any scientific studies in the area and is not aware of any such studies conducted by others.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/24">During June 2002 and February 2003, the EA received reports of an orange coloured discharge from a broken pipe running from the historic landfill site at Hambro Hill, to the main sewer. Samples of this were found to contain mild pollution.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.5/1"><I>Brofiskin, Rhondda Cynon Taf: </I>I understand from the Environment Agency (EA) that consent to deposit wastes on the Brofiskin site was given to Industrial Waste Disposal (South Wales) Ltd in August 1965. Reports indicate that deposition continued until the early 1970s.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/2">Waste types are understood to include: barium-based, calcium-based and zinc-based petroleum additives; chlorinated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, methylene chloride (dichloromethane), and ethylene dichloride (1,2-dichloroethane); phenols; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); white spirits; plastic manufacturing wastes; organophosphorous compounds; and distillation residues containing aniline and surfactants. Other wastes contain metals (arsenic, mercury, lead, copper, vanadium, chromium VI, zinc, manganese, barium, calcium and aluminium).</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/3">Investigations are ongoing as to which companies and/or individuals made these deposits.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/4"><I>Maendy, Rhondda Cynon Taf</I>: I understand from Rhondda Cynon Taf county borough council that tipping occurred at this site from 1966 until early in 1970.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/5">Wastes originated mainly from Monsanto, BP, ICI and Pyrene Ltd. Monsanto records indicate 6100 tonnes per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/6">Chemicals specifically identified as having been tipped at the site are: barium-based, calcium-based, and zinc-based petroleum additives; chlorinated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, methylene chloride and ethylene dichloride); phenols; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); white spirit; wastes from plastic manufacture; organophosphorus compounds; and distillation residues, containing aniline and surfactants (alkylbenzenesulphonates). Wastes containing arsenic, mercury, lead, copper, vanadium, hexavalent chromium, zinc, manganese, iron, magnesium, barium, calcium and aluminium have also been tipped at the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/7"><I>Penrhos, Caerphilly</I>: Caerphilly county borough council advises that hazardous waste was deposited at this site between 1960 and 1968. No detailed records are available, as no licensing regime was in place at that time. However, tests have identified a wide range of chemicals, including volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/8"><I>Ruabon and Wrexham</I>: I assume the noble Countess refers to the Monsanto chemical waste tip to the north of Rhosllanerchrugog, and the adjacent Llwyneinion acid tar lagoon. The regulator, Wrexham county borough council, has advised that it only has records for the first of these sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/9">I understand that Monsanto chemicals were deposited between 1964 and 1965, and that these comprised mainly phenol-bearing sulphite cake, pitch (from phthalic anhydride) and sublimed phthalic acid.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/10">Specific chemicals that have been identified are: phenol; aniline; naphthalene; o-hydroxybiphenyl; p-hydroxyphenyl, benzothiazole; phthalic anhydride; diphylguanidine; and mercaptobenzothiazole.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/11"><I>Newport, South Wales</I>: No details of tipping at the Solutia site are available from the lead regulator (the EA).</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/12"><I>Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria</I>: The EA has no records for this site prior to 1972, but its records show that wastes, including some toxic chemicals, have been deposited from 1972 to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/13">The toxic chemicals deposited were sulphuric acid, plasticised nitro-cellulose, sodium hydroxide (during the period 1972 to 1977), wastes notifiable under the Poisonous Wastes Act and special wastes (during the period 1977 to 2005).</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/14">From 1972 to 2005, Cumbria Land Reclamation Ltd (1977-89, Caird Environmental (Northern) Ltd (1989-93), Caird Environmental Ltd (1993-2005) deposited such wastes. British Cellophane Ltd deposited waste on site from 1972 to 1977.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/15"><I>Rayleigh, Essex</I>: There are a number of historic landfill sites in and around Rayleigh, Essex. The EA records indicate that these do not contain hazardous waste. The largest of these is Hambro Hill (National Grid reference TQ 80471 90973). The site received household waste between 1960 and 1966, however, the EA's records indicate that no toxic chemicals were ever buried there.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/16">Hambro Hill ceased taking waste before there was a requirement to hold a waste disposal licence under the Control of Pollution Act 1974. This Act was the first piece of environmental legislation for regulating waste disposal sites. Such historic landfills were usually authorised by way of planning permission and therefore further details may be available from Rochford District Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.2/1"><I>Brofiskin, Rhondda Cvnon Taf</I>: The Environment Agency (EA) is the lead regulator for this site, which occupies an area of approximately 1.5 hectares. Waste is confined to the western end of the quarry. Below ground, the waste mass is &quot;wedge&quot;-shaped, extending to a maximum depth of six metres at the deepest point, in the far western end of the quarry.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/2">The full depth and extent of groundwater contamination beneath the quarry is currently being investigated and a report is due in the spring. The extent of surface water contamination is limited to the wetter winter months, when groundwater levels within the quarry rise and flow along drainage ditches. Current investigations are monitoring surface water quality in the vicinity. There is currently no measurable impact in the surface water of the nearest main watercourse.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/3"><I>Maendy, Rhondda Cvnon Taf</I>: The area of this tip is approximately 3.5 hectares and the maximum depth is approximately 5 metres. Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council has no up-to-date information on the contamination of land, ground water and surface water resulting from toxic chemical deposits.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/4"><I>Penrhos, Caerphilly</I>: I understand from Caerphilly county borough council that this 26-hectare site has already undergone extensive remediation&mdash;140,000 tonnes of waste and contaminated soil have been removed and 6 million litres of contaminated groundwater and leachate treated. Protective measures are now in place against any possible remaining contamination that may be present.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/5"><I>Ruabon and Wrexham</I>: I assume the noble Countess refers to the Monsanto chemical waste tip to the north of Rhosllanerchrugog, and the adjacent Llwyneinion acid tar lagoon.

	<p pid="a.75.2/6">The area of chemical waste in the first site is approximately 250 square metres and its depth is approximately four metres. The existence and extent of groundwater and surface water contamination are not yet fully understood, since investigations are still on going.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/7"><I>Newport, South Wales:</I> The lead regulator, the EA, has no details of contamination at the Solutia site.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/8"><I>Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria:</I> The EA confirms that land contamination at this site is limited to the licensed area of the landfill and that neither groundwater nor surface water contamination has occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/9"><I>Rayleigh, Essex: </I>The EA holds limited information for historic landfill sites in the Rayleigh area. This includes details of the landowner, the site location, the size and the waste category. This general information was originally obtained from Rochford District Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/10">There is no record of any toxic chemical waste being disposed at this site.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/11">London clay predominantly underlies the Rayleigh area. This effectively limits the presence of an aquifer containing a water table. As a result, the EA has no monitoring of groundwater quality in the vicinity of the Hambro Hill landfill.</p>
