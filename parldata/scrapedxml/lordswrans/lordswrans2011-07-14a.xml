The full cost is budgeted at &#163;50.3 million for 2011-12. The difference between the costs and charges of &#163;23.4 million-ie, the discount-may also be termed an undercharge as discounts are given against the full cost. The discount is 47 per cent of the full cost and 87 per cent of the charges. Costs and charges are not the same at present, they will not be during the transitional period from 2012-13 to 2013-14 and nor will they be in 2014-15.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.2/1">We have not made a specific assessment of the advantages of enabling the United Kingdom meat and dairy industry to reduce its reliance on grain feedstuffs but we are commissioning research in partnership with industry into ways the livestock industry can reduce its reliance on grain.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/2">The mix of feedstuffs for livestock is a commercial decision made by farmers based on nutritional requirements, the production system used, available forage and relative costs of different elements of the feed.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/3">Data from the farm business survey in England show that feed costs vary widely both between and within livestock sectors and much of this variation is due to differences in the efficiency of feed use. For example in 2009-10, on dairy farms ranked by gross margin performance, the bottom 25 per cent of farms incurred concentrate feed costs of around 8 pence per litre compared to nearer 6 pence per litre for the high performers. Beef, sheep and milk producers can reduce their reliance on feed grains by boosting the forage component in the diet, but weather can be an important factor impacting on forage availability as will the economic return from competing enterprises for land. Pig and poultry producers are more limited in their ability to vary the grain content of feedstuffs, but high performers will have better feed conversion rates and the average across the sectors as a whole are continuing to improve over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/4">The environmental impacts of different livestock production systems are complex. For example, more intensive grain-fed beef production systems see cattle slaughtered at a younger age than more extensive grass based systems, with potentially less methane emissions over the lifetime of the animal. But for any given system, more efficient feed use will improve both economic and environmental performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/5">In partnership with industry, Defra is funding research (Project LK687) on genetic improvement of perennial ryegrass to develop varieties with enhancement of sugar levels 8 per cent beyond that seen in material currently available to farmers. Increases in readily available forage carbohydrates should offset grain inputs to beef and dairy systems on an equivalent feed energy basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/6">Defra is also funding work, in partnership with industry (Project LK694), to develop reliable prediction equations of the energy content and degradability characteristics of maize silage for use by the UK dairy and beef industries. Better knowledge of the nutritional value of maize silage will help to improve the efficiency of nutrient use in balanced rations, including resource-efficient grain inputs.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.2/1">The contract for the evaluation of the free school meals pilots was amended in April 2010 in response to the 2010 Pre-Budget Report, where it had been announced that free school meal eligibility would be extended for reception to year 2 children in primary schools from September 2010. As a consequence of the announcement it was necessary to bring forward certain parent surveys by one year so that they would take place in June and July 2010 instead of in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">However, in July 2010 Ministers decided not to extend FSM eligibility as planned by the previous Administration, because implementation costs had been significantly underestimated. This meant that it was no longer necessary to carry out the parent surveys early. The timing of these surveys therefore reverted to 2011; the surveys are currently in the field. Consequently, there have been no changes to the evaluation's original objectives or methodology.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.3/1">All road users must comply with speed limits. The setting of speed limits on local roads is the responsibility of local highway authorities and the enforcement of these is for local police forces. In line with the localism agenda, all local authorities have the autonomy to decide whether to introduce traffic-calming measures such as speed humps or shared space to reduce all vehicle speeds, including motor cyclists. The Government THINK! Campaign on motor cycle safety includes messages to motor cyclists encouraging further training and responsible riding: <a href="http://think">http://think</a>. direct.gov.uk/motorcycles.html.</p>
