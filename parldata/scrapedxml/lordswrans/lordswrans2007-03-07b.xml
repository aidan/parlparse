	<p pid="b.47.5/1">There is no EU requirement for member states to charge operators for the permits they require under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive. Some EU member states have elected not to charge for IPPC permit applications and recover regulatory costs from general taxation revenue. Others, including the UK, have elected to recover varying proportions of the costs from the regulated industry. This is a political decision for each national government. The UK's position is in line with the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle and guidance from Her Majesty's Treasury. The differing practices which are in place make it difficult to make comparisons of the costs to producers across the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.32/1">The tender process for the framework agreement was competitive and transparent, in line with EU procedures. For each technology supported under Low Carbon Buildings Programme phase 2, there are three suppliers, ensuring that there is still an element of competition within the framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.32/2">Public and charitable organisations remain at liberty to purchase microgeneration technologies from any company, and may be eligible to apply for grants under Low Carbon Buildings Programme phase 1.

	<p pid="b.47.35/1">The microgeneration industry has consistently informed us that lack of certainty regarding future volumes is prohibiting the investments in the supply chain that are required to drive costs down. After consultation with industry representatives, we determined that to get the investment in the supply chain required to drive costs down and the microgeneration industry forward, greater certainty about future demand is required. A framework agreement was developed whereby customers would receive grants where installations were undertaken by specific suppliers. The aim is that investments made in the supply chain by those companies will benefit the industry as a whole and lower prices will filter across to all.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.35/2">Tenders from prospective framework suppliers were chosen on the basis of offering best value for money and we consider that the approach taken should ensure that the programme will lower the costs of microgeneration to the public sector in the short term, with those price reductions hopefully spreading to the wider market over the long term. The DTI will be monitoring the price of installations undertaken throughout the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.38/1">The aim of phase 2 of the Low Carbon Building Programme is to achieve reductions in the costs of microgeneration products, against a 2005 baseline, by stimulating the industry through the guaranteed demand provided by the &pound;50 million of capital grant funding announced in Budget 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.38/2">A key barrier to widespread uptake of microgeneration products is the up-front cost of installations. The industry has consistently informed us that lack of certainty regarding future volumes is prohibiting the investments in the supply chain that are required to drive costs down. After consultation with industry representatives, we determined that to get the investment in the supply chain required to drive costs down and the microgeneration industry forward, greater certainty about future demand is required.

	<p pid="b.47.68/1">The MoD identifies the costs of operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. Included in these costs is the damage and destruction of major items of equipment, such as aircraft, which are reviewed individually and are only replaced or repaired if there is a continuing and ongoing future requirement for them within the MoD plans. Operational costs are funded from the Treasury reserve and no distinction is made between the loss of assets due to enemy or friendly fire.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.71/1">When the divisional temporary detention facility (DTDF) at Shaibah logistics base closes it will be replaced by a divisional internment facility at Basra air station. Iraqi security forces have been assisting in the detention of individuals since mid-December 2006. Their assistance has been predominantly in the provision of cordons and the securing of the area of operation. The Iraqis do not have the power to intern individuals, so are only able to conduct strike operations against criminals for prosecution in Iraqi courts. As they have no powers to intern, there is no scope for a joint internment facility.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.86/1">The projected growth in passenger numbers is still being evaluated as part of the preparation of the forthcoming high-level output specification and longer term rail strategy. The evaluation looks more widely at the growth on long distance routes between major cities, rather than at the growth on the former British Rail InterCity network. The forecast demand varies considerably by route. An annual passenger km growth rate of between 2.3 per cent and 3.2 per cent is currently forecast across the long distance network over the next 10 years.</p>
