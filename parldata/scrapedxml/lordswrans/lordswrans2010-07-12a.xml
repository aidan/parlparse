	<p pid="a.94.0/1">The overall situation in the Kivus in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is significantly more stable than 18 months ago. The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) have been weakened through Congolese military action and ongoing UN efforts to demobilise them. But they are not defeated and are still carrying out pillaging, killing and kidnapping. The Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) are also guilty of human rights abuses. However there is evidence to suggest that the FARDC carry out fewer abuses when they are working closely with the UN peacekeeping force to DRC (MONUSCO), and receiving regular pay and rations.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/2">The political and military integration process for the ex-National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) and former armed groups is fragile. Regular and accurate pay (appropriate to rank) is still a problem. We will continue to monitor the situation and encourage all parties to remain committed to the full implementation of the peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/3">In Orientale Province North Eastern DRC, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) continues to carry out regular killings and abduction of civilians. UN Security Council Resolution 1925 provides MONUSCO with an increased focus on targeting the LRA, including the co-ordination of strategies with other UN missions and providing logistical support for military operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.2/1">There is broad agreement across the EU about the case for reform, including the need to decentralise and simplify the current complex regulations. Few, if any, member states support the status quo, though views vary as to the changes needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.2/2">Ordinary legislative procedure would apply to a legislative decision on reform, meaning that both the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament, would need to approve reform proposals, according to the voting rules and procedures in the relevant treaty provisions; most particularly Articles 231, 238, 289 and 294 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and Article 16 (and the attached protocol on transitional provisions) of the Treaty on the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.5/1">The physical redevelopment of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) main building was completed under a private finance initiative project in July 2004 at a cost of &#163;323 million (VAT exclusive). The project as a whole included the provision and operation of decant accommodation for the duration of the main building works and for the ongoing provision of serviced office accommodation in both the main building and Old War Office building until 2030. The original forecast outturn cost of the entire project was &#163;2.25 billion; the current estimate is &#163;2.46 billion and as at June 2010, &#163;576 million has been spent on the project. The MoD now plans to dispose of the Old War Office building after it becomes fully surplus to requirements in 2013, which should reduce the final outturn.</p>

It is possible that land contamination at individual parks could pose sufficient risk to justify actions that might affect public access to and enjoyment of such parks.

	<p pid="a.109.2/1">The Government share the concerns about disproportionality in the use of stop-and-search powers. We are working with the police service to help ensure that stop-and-search powers are used appropriately. There is, however, no single cause of disproportionality. It is important, therefore, to look at levels of disproportionality, and any specific demographic or other factors, in individual forces.</p>

NPIA will support forces to implement Next Steps and will target forces with high levels of disproportionality. We are about to start the roll out of Next Steps in Dorset, Merseyside and one borough of the Metropolitan Police.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/3">Detailed guidance on the appropriate use of stop-and-search powers are contained in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Code of Practice A. This includes the fundamental principles governing stop and search, which are that the powers must be used fairly, responsibly, with respect for people being searched and without unlawful discrimination. In 2005 the national <I>Stop and Search Manual</I> was published jointly by the Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities. The manual gives further detailed good practice, training packages and supervision techniques and looks at what should be done to address issues around the disproportionate use of stop-and-search powers.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.6/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> all timber and timber-derived products purchased by UK Government departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies must comply with the UK Government's timber procurement policy. Only legal and sustainable or FLEGT licensed timber and wood products should be purchased.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.6/2">The UK Government are committed to reporting better on their timber purchases and in July 2009 Defra published a study looking at this aspect. The report is available on the Central Point of Expertise on Timber (CPET) website with the recommendations. <a href="http://www.proforest.net/cpet/files/CPET%20Reporting%">www.proforest.net/cpet/files/CPET%20Reporting%</a> 20pilot%20study%<phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20July</phrase>%2009.pdf/view.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.6/3">The report showed that implementation of reporting requirements across mandated bodies is not currently possible, as data are not held centrally. Assurance of implementation and compliance with the policy should, however, be a first step towards achieving meaningful data.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.0/1">The big society vision is that more power and opportunity are shifted to individuals and communities. The voluntary and community sector will have a fundamental part in making this a reality.</p>

For example, we will create an independent big society bank to unlock hundreds of millions of pounds of new finance for social enterprises, charities and voluntary organisations. We will also set up the community organisers' programme which will identify, train and support 5,000 people who want to make a difference to their community over the lifetime of this Parliament. Complementing this, the community first programme is a new fund that will encourage more social action by new and existing neighbourhood groups.</p>
