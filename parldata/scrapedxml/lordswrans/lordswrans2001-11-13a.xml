	<p pid="a.63.2/1">Religious leaders of all the main world faiths in the United Kingdom have been prominent in their condemnation both of terrorism and the perversion of religious belief by alleged adherents of any faith. If religious leaders believe that a national convocation would strengthen their unequivocal message or their efforts to get their congregations to understand it, it would be for them in the first instance to call such a convocation together. The Government would however readily consider any request to play an active role in the deliberations of a national convocation.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/3">This is the first increase in passport fees for two years. In relation to the cost of travel abroad, a fee of &pound;30 for a standard 10-year passport still represents very good value for money.</p>

The Council conclusions of <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-26">26 October 1999</phrase> remained the basis for EU efforts to launch a new global round of multilateral trade negotiations, but the Council acknowledged that the final stages of negotiations would call for flexibility on the part of all participants.

	<p pid="a.69.9/1">The statement from the Disability Rights Commission highlighted the importance of ensuring that the context in which parents choose whether to have a child should be one in which disability and non-disability are valued equally and that parents receive comprehensive balanced information and guidance on disability, the rights of disabled people and on the support available. We are supportive of these aims and understand that the Disability Rights Commission plans to discuss this matter further with the Government, the medical professions and other relevant organisations. The statement indicates that addressing these issues should be given priority over any consideration of amendment to the Abortion Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.9/2">It is important to note that under Section 1(1) of the Abortion Act 1967 disability is not the only grounds for permitting abortion up to birth. The Act also authorises abortion up to birth if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman greater than if the pregnancy were terminated.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.9/3">It is accepted parliamentary practice that proposals for changes in the law on abortion have come from Back-Bench Members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes. The Government have no plans to change the law on abortion.</p>

All learning providers were re-registered, blank application forms were withdrawn, all new provider registrations were suspended, a revised learning provider agreement was introduced that made it harder for providers to act against the ethos of the programme and we made changes to the applications process for the same purpose. Everyone who opened an ILA received a copy of Choosing Your Learning, explaining the full range of options in using their ILA. However, it became clear that these changes were not sufficient by themselves to prevent the mis-selling of ILAs. At that point we decided we had no option other than to withdraw the programme.</p>

At the end of October, taking account of complaints received direct by the department, the total number of complaints was 8,448 against a backdrop of 2,529,609 individual learning accounts opened. Around a quarter (2,314) of these related to learning providers not following the rules of the programme correctly. It is important to note that the complaints recorded are wide ranging and include issues such as the ending of the &pound;150 opening offer as well as service provision and providers. The October figure relates to those received at the ILA Centre and by the department.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.11/1">Raising &pound;50,000 sponsorship is part of the process of becoming a specialist school. Sponsors can contribute to the development of specialist schools in a range of ways, including through the contribution they make in partnership with government to the initial capital costs of equipping the school to enhance teaching in specialist subjects; in providing work experience opportunities to pupils and teachers; and in encouraging a culture of enterprise in the direction and management of the school. The main challenge of becoming a specialist school is in submitting a rigorous development plan to extend opportunities and raise standards through a focus on the specialism. Raising sponsorship is more difficult for some schools than others but we grant-aid the Technology Colleges Trust and Youth Sport Trust to help ensure that all schools have the opportunity to meet the requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.5/1">The phrase &quot;items of historic interest&quot; covers a very wide range of objects, and it is impossible to answer the noble Lord's question exhaustively. Works of art are cared for by the curator and his staff. However, the Palace of Westminster is a working building and therefore cannot offer the ideal conditions, entailing strict control of temperature, humidity and light, that are to be found in some museums or art galleries. Frescoes are intrinsically part of the fabric of the building and are subject to variations of dryness or moisture, as well as some movement. Much historic furniture and silver is in daily use within the Palace and is inevitably subject to wear and tear.</p>
