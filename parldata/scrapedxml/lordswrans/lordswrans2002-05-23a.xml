	<p pid="a.111.8/1">Section 62 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000 provides for the electronic monitoring of prisoners released on licence. By virtue of Section 62(5)(a), this includes young people during the community element of a detention and training order (DTO).</p>
	<p pid="a.111.8/2">Electronic monitoring of those released from detention and training orders is already available in 84 youth offending team areas as part of the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme overseen by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.8/3">Section 102(4) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 empowers the Secretary of State to release an offender, in the case of an order of eight months or more but less than 18 months, one month before the half-way point; and, in the case of an order of 18 months or more, one month or two months before that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.8/4">The availability of electronic monitoring enables us to consider how we can make further use of the powers in Section 102(4) to provide a useful transitional phase in the reintegration of trainees from custody back into the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.8/5">We therefore propose to use electronic monitoring as a condition of the release of trainees serving a DTO of eight months or more for a period of one or two months prior to their current release at the half-way point. This form of release will be a normal feature of DTOs except in the case of trainees convicted of sex offences or serious violent offences. The possibility of release on electronic monitoring at this stage in the DTO will not be available to trainees who have exhibited violent or destructive behaviour to people or property within the secure facility or made exceptionally bad progress against the training plan as a result of consistent failure to co-operate or failure to take responsibility for their behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.5/1">My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr Moonie) made clear on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-26">26 February 2002</phrase> (Official Report, col. 1139W) to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/996" name="Bernard Jenkin">the honourable Member for North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase> in another place that the June 2002 in-service date for Eurofighter was becoming increasingly challenging to achieve. Although good progress has been made by industry, with the first three instrumented production aircraft achieving successful first flights in early April, delays in bringing the detailed design to full maturity in some areas prevented the flight test programme from starting on time.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/2">Following a thorough review of the programme involving the partner nations, the NATO agency responsible for undertaking the procurement and industry, we have jointly concluded that acceptance of the first aircraft into service should be delayed, to take place by the end of this year, and we shall plan on that basis. We shall now be working hard with industry to recover lost time and achieve the planned operational employment date in the second half of the decade, thus avoiding any gap in front-line capability or extra costs to the Ministry of Defence. The delays are disappointing but reflect the complexity of the project and the major advance in technology it represents. Initial flights of the instrumented production aircraft have been impressive and the Government remain fully committed to this contribution to the United Kingdom's military capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.8/4">The criteria for the installation of traffic signals at trunk road intersections are set out in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, published jointly by the Highways Agency, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. They involve the collection of a considerable amount of background data, including the performance of the junction, traffic volumes and accident details.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.8/5">In order to investigate whether the intersections of the A6/B5023 at Duffield and the A6/B5057 at Darley Dale meet the criteria, detailed investigations would be required, which would take some time to complete. As you may be aware, the A6 is due to be de-trunked with effect from 1st July, when responsibility for its management will transfer to Derbyshire County Council, and negotiations are currently in progress with the County Council about the handover. We have therefore alerted the County Council to your question.</p>
