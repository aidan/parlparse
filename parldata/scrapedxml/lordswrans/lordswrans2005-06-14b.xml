	<p pid="b.115.2/1">The UK Government fully recognise the significance of water in the Middle East and the need for co-operation within the region over shared water sources. The joint FCO, MoD and DfID Global Conflict Prevention Pool is funding a water resource management project with Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority which will promote regional co-operation and best practice in water management. DfID is also funding a regional study on transboundary water and conflict and how international assistance can most effectively help address these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/2">DfID provides significant support towards the improvement of water supplies in the West Bank and Gaza and in Iraq. DfID assistance to the Palestinians has helped to improve water and sanitation facilities for over 9,000 people in isolated rural communities in the southern West Bank. DfID also provides advice to the Palestinian Water Authority on the management of water resources, and to the Palestinian Authority Negotiation Affairs Department on negotiations over water with the Israeli Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/3">In Iraq, DfID has committed more than &pound;70 million to infrastructure programmes in the south which are helping to improve water and other essential services for over 5 million people. DfID provided funding for a senior adviser and two water and sanitation advisers to support the Iraqi Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works in 2003 and 2004. The Government are fully aware of the importance of international watercourses to the Iraqi people. The World Bank and United States are providing advice to the Iraqi Government on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.5/1">The police can only claim exemption from speed limits in restricted circumstances which are defined by statute. Section 87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 provides that speed limits do not apply to motor vehicles being used for police, fire brigade or ambulance purposes, but only if observance of the limit would hinder the vehicle in its purpose. The enforcement of road traffic law is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police. Action in any particular case where an officer was associated with the possible commission of a criminal offence but not himself directly responsible is a management matter for the chief officer.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.3/1">The Government are making significant investment in ICT in schools and always look to ensure schools get the best value for money from this investment. In order to support schools in making effective strategic investments for their ICT the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (Becta) report on open source software (OSS) in schools investigated whether the findings from the OGC trials that open source solutions are viable and credible alternatives to proprietary software were applicable to the education sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/2">The project report is based on a very small opportunity sample of 15 schools which varied greatly both in size and the extent to which they used open source software. Although the project findings report significant savings these are not consistent in all areas for the schools and further research would need to be done to confirm that these savings relate to the OSS elements and are achievable in all schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/3">Schools can choose how to develop their ICT and are in no way compelled to take Microsoft software. They are perfectly free to use whatever software they feel meets their needs best and is most cost effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/4">Becta, at the request of the Secretary of State, signed a new agreement with Microsoft Ltd in relation to their licensing framework for schools. Savings to schools from this agreement in England should reach &pound;46 million over three years. Schools are likely to spend 20 to 37 per cent less over three years than might have been expected in the absence of this new agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/5">Building on the success of the agreement with Microsoft, Becta has introduced a software licensing framework agreement for operating systems and office productivity software. This framework agreement will introduce further improvement in value for money and will provide easier access by schools to as wide a range of products as possible, including open source products.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.2/1">The levels of resources which are, and are to be, devoted to dealing with applications under the 2003 Act are matters for local licensing authorities. However, the Government are mindful of the potential for high numbers of applicants delaying their applications until shortly before the deadlines set, and of the possible effects of this on local resources. Safeguards have therefore been written into the 2003 Act, and the associated guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/2">Where a licensing authority is unable to complete its consideration of an application to convert an existing licence after two months, the application is deemed to have been granted. This is not unreasonable as all these licences have been approved previously by either the licensing justices, the magistrates' courts or the local authority. Where an applicant seeks a variation of a converted licence, for example, involving an extension of its trading hours, and the licensing authority is unable to complete its consideration within two months, the application is deemed rejected. It would, however, be open to an aggrieved applicant to appeal against the deemed rejection in the magistrates' courts.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-06-14b.123.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="123"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050614/text/50614w03.htm#50614w03_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.123.5/1">The additional measures taken include: issuing and widely publicising the availability of the Crossrail environmental statement (ES) through press notices and on both the Department for Transport and Cross London Rail Link (CLRL) websites. Newspaper notices have also been issued alerting people to the publication of the supplementary ES (SES) published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-26">26 May</phrase>, and inviting comments on the SES by <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-08">8 July</phrase>. CLRL also issued a newsletter to some 8,500 consultees announcing the extension of the consultation period on the main ES and the consultation on the SES.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.5/2">The EIA Directive requires for projects that are likely to have significant effects upon the environment that, &quot;when a decision to grant or refuse consent has been taken the body taking the decision must make available . . . the main reasons and considerations on which the decision is based, and a description, where necessary, of the main mitigation measures&quot;. This will be done during the passage of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.5/3">The convention applicable to the House of Commons is that Second Reading establishes the principle of the Bill, and that principle is not considered by the Select Committee. However, since the Select Committee determines what it will treat as the principle of the Bill (and therefore beyond its remit to consider), it is not possible to be definitive at this stage on what this will be. The House of Lords Select Committee will reach its own decisions on what aspects it will not consider.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.0/1">Adrian Montague was asked to assess the proposals contained in Cross London Rail Link's July 2003 Crossrail business case. The Montague report, while indicating scope for important improvements, broadly confirmed CLRL's proposals. In his <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-20">20 July 2004</phrase> statement, the Secretary of State for Transport made clear that, in the light of the Montague report and the Government's analysis of what needed to be done to give effect to the report's recommendations, he was confident that Crossrail should proceed. In particular, powers should be sought by means of a hybrid Bill at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/2">The Secretary of State's <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-20">20 July 2004</phrase> Statement acknowledged that a major funding challenge remains. Work on this is being taken forward by the Department for Transport and HM Treasury, together with Transport for London, and funding proposals for Crossrail will be brought forward during the passage of the Bill.</p>
