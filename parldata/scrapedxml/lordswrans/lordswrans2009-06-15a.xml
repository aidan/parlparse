A similar indicator for London Buses does not exist, as the majority of bus incidents are reported directly to Transport for London Bus Control Room which has seen a reduction in the number of reports of alcohol-related disturbances over the last six months. Reductions flow from a range of initiatives, including more visible policing, in addition to the alcohol ban.</p>

Vehicle excise is an exception to this, as exemption depends on the specific organisation using the vehicle or keeping it on the road.</p>

The use of mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs are defined by the Use of Invalid Carriages on Highways Regulations 1988 (Statutory Instrument No 2268) and there are currently no plans for reclassification.

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised that where donated gametes are used for the purpose of research, the authority's code of practice requires the treatment centre to ensure that aspects of the clinical and research roles are separated. When eggs are being donated to research through an egg-sharing agreement, the centre must ensure that the eggs are divided between the egg donor and the recipient, in this case the research project, by someone not directly involved in that project.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/2">The HFEA also advises that it is up to individual centres to decide exactly how they meet these requirements and to ensure that personnel giving medication and carrying out egg collection are qualified and competent to perform such tasks. When centres licensed to carry out research and treatment are inspected, patient records are reviewed to ensure compliance with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, licence conditions and the guidance in the HFEA's code of practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.11/1">As my noble friend the Minister for Africa, Asia and the UN, Lord Malloch-Brown, stated in his previous Answer, the Commission does not routinely publish minutes of meetings attended by its officials. However, all official meetings of the European Commission (the College) are minuted. These records are available to the public by searching for the document type &quot;minutes&quot; in language &quot;EN&quot; on the Commission's document register at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/recherche.cfm?CL=en">http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/recherche.cfm?CL=en</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.11/2">The Commission's provisions for document management, and which records it keeps (including minutes), are clearly spelt out on its website at <a href="http://europa.eu/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2002/1_021/1_02120020124en00230027.pdf">http://europa.eu/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2002/1_021/1_02120020124en00230027.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">No discussions have taken place between Department of Health officials and the European Commission Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry, or Health Ministers and the European Commissioner for Health, on the impact of setting maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements because no specific levels have yet been proposed by the European Commission, or discussed in Commission-led working group meetings with member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">Officials of the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs met the Health Food Manufacturers' Association (HFMA) on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-25">25 March 2009</phrase> to discuss possible approaches to assessing the potential impact on small- and medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) of the setting of maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The HFMA is currently working with industry colleagues to assess the potential impact on SMEs against a number of hypothetical scenarios to inform discussions with the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/3">A European Commission-sponsored analysis of the economic, social and environmental impact of the policy options for the establishment of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements was undertaken in summer 2008. Seven member states were used as case studies, including the United Kingdom. The UK food supplements industry, including organisations representing SMEs, engaged fully in this work and provided relevant data. The European Commission has indicated that this assessment will accompany its proposals on maximum levels when they are issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/4">The timing for finalising the proposals on maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements is uncertain due to European Parliamentary elections during June and European Commission college changes in October. At the last working group meeting with all member states on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-04">4 December 2008</phrase>, the European Commission advised that draft proposals outlining maximum levels for vitamins and minerals would be discussed at the next full working group meeting, a date for which has not been set.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/5">Regarding Regulation (EC) No 764/2008 on mutual recognition, decisions on whether products should be classified as herbal medicinal products, and on the authorisation of herbal medicinal products, are the subject of harmonisation measures at Community level and so are not subject to the requirements of Mutual Recognition Regulation (EC) No 764/2008. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency does not therefore expect the regulation to have a significant impact on the trade in herbal remedies.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/6">The FSA has advised that measures taken by the authorities of member states pursuant to provisions of food law of general application are explicitly exempted from the requirements of the Mutual Recognition Regulation. These exemptions relate to measures taken under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 (General Food Law) in relation to risks to health arising from food, and measures taken under Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 (official feed and food controls) in ensuring that food business operators remedy non-compliance with food law.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) works closely with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Commission to ensure the safety of food contact products containing bisphenol A (BPA), and to ensure it is kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/2">The health impact of BPA was assessed by EFSA in 2006 and after a comprehensive review of the scientific data, a tolerable daily intake of 0.05 milligrams per kilogram of body weight was established. This is the amount that can be eaten every day, over a whole lifetime, without causing appreciable harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/3">In July and October 2008 EFSA confirmed that this evaluation would also apply to infants and pregnant women. Dietary exposures of age groups from three months to adults have been found to be less than 30 per cent of the tolerable daily intake.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/4">The Government's policy is to maintain the stricter level for BPA that currently applies in the law governing food contact materials, including baby feeding bottles, which is based on an earlier precautionary tolerable daily intake of 0.01 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight per day. I am advised that the FSA sees no basis, on the evidence we have, to press for tighter controls on the use of BPA, or for a ban on its use. Limits in place throughout the European Union, which the FSA has played a full part in establishing and maintaining, provide a precautionary margin of safety beyond expert assessment of the scientific evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.3/1">The determining factors that contribute to defining security at a licensed civil nuclear site are: the threat, the consequences of the loss or dispersal of nuclear material, and the UK's international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/2">Security in the civil nuclear industry is subject to regulation which reflects the international obligations and best practice. The Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) regulates the civil nuclear industry by means of the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (NISR). The NISR requires nuclear licensed sites to have approved site security plans (SSPs). SSPs are protectively marked and they detail the standards, procedures and specific arrangements that must be kept in place to ensure the security of the nuclear premises, nuclear material in whatever category, form or quantity and sensitive nuclear information against the malicious capabilities posed by the Nuclear Industries Malicious Capabilities Planning Assumptions. This document allows a judgment to be made with regard to the malicious capabilities that could be deployed against a licensed site or transporters, and against which security measures should provide protection. It draws on intelligence provided by the national intelligence agencies particularly the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre of which OCNS is a member.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/3">Operators submit their SSPs to OCNS for approval before they are adopted and thereafter, they become the basis against which they are judged to be compliant with the regulations. Once approved SSPs are regarded as live documents and subject to constant review, scrutiny and amendment as necessary by the operator concerned and by OCNS through regulatory activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/4">Security measures in the civil nuclear industry are applied in a graduated manner in accordance with the severity of the threat and the level of consequence of a successful attack in a manner that provides defence in depth.

	<p pid="a.188.6/1">Generally civil legal aid funding is available if the case is within the scope of the scheme and the statutory tests of means and merits are met. Legal aid for representation is not normally available for employment tribunals, although it can be authorised by the Lord Chancellor in exceptional circumstances. This is because employment tribunal procedures have been designed to allow people to prepare and present their own cases. Legal help (the advice and assistance level of legal aid) is available, subject to the means test. This provides advice to clients on tribunal procedures and assists them to prepare case papers and obtain counsel's opinion if appropriate. Legal aid for representation is available for the employment appeal tribunal.</p>
