	<p pid="a.24.5/1">The information requested falls with the responsibility of the national statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/2">Letter to Lord Skidelsky from the executive director of the Office for National Statistics, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-27">27 November 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/3">The Registrar General for England and Wales has been asked to reply to your recent question asking whether the current policy which prevents public inspection of the 1911 decennial census because censuses for England and Wales are closed for 100 years, will be reviewed. I am replying in his absence. (HL1398)</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/4">There are no plans to review the current policy covering public inspection of the 1911 Census records. A closure period of 100 years for census records is specified in legislation in Instrument No 12 dated 1966 made under the Public Records Act 1958. The Lord Chancellor in conjunction with the Minister of Health, who at that time was responsible for the Census, prescribed the closure period.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/5">Under the Public Records Act, there is provision for a record held by the Public Record Office to be inspected if special authority is given by the department responsible for the record. In 1993 it was announced in Parliament that the Registrar General would be willing to consider particular applications for information to be extracted from the 1911 returns if it would enable the applicant to establish a legal entitlement such as an inheritance.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/6">Such authority would be given only where the information is not available from any other source and is clearly requisite for establishing the entitlement in question. The Registrar General would wish to be fully satisfied from documentary evidence as to the identity of the applicant. Where the desired information from the Census form relates to a living person other than the applicant, that person's consent would be required before the information would be released.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/7">At the time of the 1911 Census, assurance was given that the contents of the Schedule would be treated as strictly confidential. To amend retrospectively the rule would jeopardise public confidence in assurances about recent and future censuses. It may put at risk public trust in other guarantees given about confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/8">I appreciate that information from census returns would be of value to those people researching their family history, but maintaining the public's confidence in the protection of census information is paramount.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.0/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of Hastings Borough Council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/2">Inspectors found that the council is working towards the verification framework but needs to improve consistency in gathering evidence before they will be able to implement the framework effectively. The report also noted that Hastings Borough Council did not consistently comply with the requirement to confirm national insurance numbers and the linked identity of claimants.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/3">The council's efforts to ensure that only valid claims enter the system are hampered by a claim form that does not meet the standards of the BFI model form.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/4">The report notes that before the inspection took place the council implemented major organisational changes. The benefits section introduced new procedures and initiatives that should bring improvements, but insufficient staff resources meant that the gains have yet to be fully realised.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/5">Inspectors report that the council pays 90 per cent of rent allowance claims to landlords direct. The council recognises the benefits of maintaining close liaison with landlords, supported by clear procedures for the 'fit and proper person' test. Further improvement is needed in the areas of IT security and management checks.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/6">The report finds that the council has effective systems for recovering housing benefit (HB) overpayments. The general lack of resource is having a major impact on the performance of the Benefits Investigation Service causing a shortfall against the weekly benefit saving threshold. Internal Audit's provision of a robust and effective audit service gives some assurance as to the security of the benefits system.</p>

This will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase>, when it will be published in Health and Safety Executive (HSE) guidance note EH40/2002, Occupational Exposure Limits. Employers must control exposure of employees by inhalation to any substance with a MEL as far as is reasonably practicable, and in any event below the limit. This new limit replaces former occupational exposure standards that had higher values and less stringent control duties, and reflects the latest scientific appraisal of the health effects of phenol. The new limit has been announced in an HSE press notice, and the intention to introduce it was subject to consultation in 2001.</p>

A copy of their decision is in the Library, including a summary of some of the main considerations taken into account. Paragraphs 67&ndash;69 of the decision document and paragraphs 25&ndash;33 of Annex 1 describe these issues in detail. The Secretaries of State sought the advice of agencies responsible for safety and security issues, including the Office for Civil Nuclear Security which, as the decision document makes clear, took account of the terrorist attacks on <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>.</p>
