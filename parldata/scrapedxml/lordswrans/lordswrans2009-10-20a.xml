	<p pid="a.56.3/1">There is no entitlement for service personnel to reclaim excess baggage charges when travelling on leave. Service personnel are not expected to take their military kit and equipment home on leave with them; they should either leave it on base, or transfer it between bases using the military facilities available to them. However, if they do take their kit home, this is done as a matter of personal choice and convenience rather than service need. Therefore, any excess baggage charges incurred will be at personal expense, with payment being made directly by the passenger to the carrier.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/2">When personnel are travelling on official duty&mdash;for example, when returning to a home unit following duty elsewhere&mdash;excess baggage can, in some circumstances, be permitted if authorised in advance of travel. At the time of booking, an annotation is made on the ticket confirming that excess baggage is authorised and the MoD can then be billed accordingly without the passenger incurring any charges. But if it is not agreed in advance, the individual will be liable for excess baggage charges at check-in. Refunds may be permitted through the unit administrative staff if circumstances are such that arrangements could not be made in advance of travel or an administrative error has occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/3">When any service person feels that their circumstances have fallen outside current policy and that they are being unfairly disadvantaged, they may always submit casework to the pay and allowance casework and complaints cell in accordance with established service procedures, requesting exceptional consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">The issue of withdrawal reactions following use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been under close review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and its predecessor, the Medicines Control Agency, since the early 1990s. Any new data have been carefully evaluated as they become available and updated advice issued as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">Warnings about the risk of withdrawal reactions upon stopping treatment with SSRIs have been included in the patient information leaflets (PILs) for SSRIs for many years. Following a comprehensive review by an expert working group on the safety of SSRIs, established by the Committee on Safety of Medicines, the warnings in the product information for prescribers and the PILs were updated to include clear and detailed advice on the management of withdrawal. A thorough evaluation of all available data coupled with feedback from patients and patient organisations informed the updates.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">Current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance recommends clearly that all patients prescribed antidepressants should be informed about the risk of withdrawal reactions and the importance of gradual withdrawal over several weeks. The British National Formulary (BNF), which is distributed by the Department of Health to doctors and community pharmacies, also contains information on withdrawal reactions following stopping treatment with SSRIs. The MHRA is in discussion with the BNF over whether there is scope for further updates to this information to aid discussions between prescribers and patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.3/1">Specific regulations are in place which provide for the operation of disciplinary procedures by the chief constable. It is not for Government to carry out an assessment of the chief constable's handling of any individual discipline case. However, on conclusion of internal misconduct proceedings, including the chief constable's review, an officer will be notified of his right to appeal to the Northern Ireland Policing Board.</p>

A basic postal receipt and dispatch facility will be maintained and the BFPO numbers, which are useful for administrative purposes such as banking and internet shopping, will be retained.
