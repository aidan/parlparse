	<p pid="a.46.2/1">The Government plan to auction 7 per cent of allowances in phase II of EU ETS, amounting to approximately 85 million allowances, plus those allowances from installations that close during phase II and any unused surplus from the new entrant reserve (NER). Under the terms of the EU ETS Directive 2003/87/EC the total number of allowances auctioned cannot exceed 10 per cent of the number allocated during phase II. The auctioning levels for the EU ETS post-2012 have not yet been determined. However, the Chancellor recently announced that the UK will auction 100 per cent of allowances to the large electricity producers. The amount of revenue will be influenced by the market price at the time of the auctions.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/2">We will not be hypothecating the revenues from the auction. The Government's spending priorities are not, in general, determined by the way in which the money is raised. Hypothecating revenues to particular-spending programmes imparts inflexibility in spending decisions and can lead to a misallocation of resources, with reduced value for money for taxpayers. The spending review process ensures that resources are allocated efficiently to deliver government objectives and ensures priorities, such as education and health, receive the increased levels of funding, as set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR).</p>

	<p pid="a.51.0/1">The Farriers' Qualifications (European Recognition) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/646) amend the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975. The amendments made were necessary in order to implement fully directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, the main provisions of which were implemented by the European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 (SI 2008/2781) which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-19">19 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/2">The Farriers' Qualifications (European Recognition) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/646) amend the Farriers (Registration) Act to provide for the registration of those intending and entitled to provide farriery on a temporary basis in the UK as well as those farriers wanting to do so on a permanent basis. No formal assessment of the impact of these regulations on animal welfare has been carried out. Provisions on the formalities that competent authorities and EU migrants must comply with, and the evidence as to qualifications that migrants must submit to demonstrate entitlement to pursue farriery in the UK in accordance with the directive, are dealt with in the European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 (SI 2008/2781). The Farriers' Qualifications (European Recognition) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/646) cross-refer to those regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/3">The amendment to the Farriers Registration Act, providing for registration of temporary providers of farriery services in Part V of the Farriers Register, will have a positive impact on animal welfare because it will enable the Farriers Registration Council to take disciplinary action against those registrants, should this be necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">The Government have previously submitted to the Committee of Ministers a timetable based on a two-stage consultation process aimed at establishing the views of the public, electoral administrators and others on how the franchise should be extended and on the wealth of detailed questions about how this would be achieved in practical terms. The first consultation exercise concluded in March 2007. However, since that point the context for the debate about the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, and in particular the exercise of the franchise, in the United Kingdom has changed very significantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">In July 2007 the Government published <I>The Governance of Britain</I>, a Green Paper setting out a range of proposals to reinvigorate democracy and rebuild public trust and engagement in politics. At the core of the Green Paper is a proposal for a national debate on citizenship, and the rights and responsibilities that attach to the concept of being a citizen. The Government committed to taking action to ensure a clearer definition and understanding of the rights and responsibilities that attach to British citizenship. In addition, the Goldsmith review published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-11">11 March 2008</phrase> made recommendations about the right to vote being linked to citizenship.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">The Government remain committed to carrying out a second, more detailed public consultation on how voting rights might be granted to serving prisoners, and how far those rights should be extended. In light of <I>T</I><I>he Governance of Britain</I> Green Paper and the Goldsmith review, the Government consider it essential that changes to the law to extend the franchise to those held in custody are considered in the context of the wider development of policy on the franchise and the rights that attach to British citizenship, in order that reform in this fundamental area can proceed in a holistic way.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/4">The Committee of Ministers is next due to sit from 4 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-06">6 June 2008</phrase> and the Government have submitted details of our intended course of action. We intended to submit further information to the Committee of Ministers in due course on the form and timing of a further consultation in the light of the wider debate which is now taking place. Following consideration of the outcome of consultation, legislation to implement the Government's final approach will be brought forward as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights found that in the case of Hirst the UK's current policy of a blanket ban on all sentenced prisoners from voting is in contravention of Article 3 of Protocol No.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Therefore it is anticipated that Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 will need to be amended either by primary legislation or remedial order to comply with the judgment.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.0/1">The Government fully support the work of the European Court of Human Rights and are a strong advocate of reform measures to improve its effectiveness. An efficient court is essential for the promotion and protection of human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/2">Both the UK and Russia agree on the need for reform of the court to ensure it functions more effectively and can address the backlog of cases. The UK believes that Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights must be implemented to achieve this goal and allow the court to address its increasing backlog. We are disappointed that Russia is the only Council of Europe member state not to have ratified the protocol. We, in concert with the majority of Council of Europe member states, the EU presidency and other EU member states, have called on Russia to ratify Protocol 14 swiftly.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.3/1">We believe that all local authorities should have in place a strategy for managing their municipal waste. In some circumstances this is a statutory requirement. Government must also give local authorities the help they need to deliver and we have therefore produced policy and practice guidance to help local authorities in developing their strategies. Both sets of guidance are online at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/localauth/planning.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/localauth/planning.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/2">Local authorities are best placed to plan and deliver necessary recycling infrastructure for their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/3">Additionally, the waste infrastructure capital grant is an unring-fenced capital grant that will be paid to upper tier authorities (unitary and county councils) in most of England between 2008-09 and 2010-11. The funding available has been increased from around &pound;105 million to &pound;185 million over the next three years. The grant will be paid to local authorities in recognition of the need to get front-end waste infrastructure, e.g. recycling and composting facilities, on the ground in time to help England meet landfill targets. The grant is front loaded, i.e. more in the first two years and less in the third year, to help local authorities that wish to invest to help meet the 2010 landfill target.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/4">The Defra-funded waste and resources action programme (WRAP) has provided advice on the design and management of and contracting with materials recovery facilities and will be continuing with work in this area. WRAP has also supported private companies in extending reprocessing capacity in paper and organics, so that there will in turn be greater demand for recyclables collected by councils. Additionally, local authority trials of food waste collections have been funded and infrastructure provided. Investment in home composting has also been supported by WRAP.</p>
