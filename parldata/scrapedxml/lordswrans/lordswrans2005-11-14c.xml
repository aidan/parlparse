	<p pid="c.115.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-28">28 October</phrase>, the EU introduced a ban on imports into the Community of all captive birds (wild birds), along with new restrictions on the importation of pet birds. UK import rules have been amended to reflect that. Therefore, given the safeguard measures taken, this risk remains negligible.</p>
	<p pid="c.115.5/2">Legal imports of all live poultry and their products from countries where H5N1 has been detected have been banned. Therefore the direct legal importation to the UK of live birds and products from a third country known to be affected or indirect importation to the UK of live birds and products from a third country known to be affected through another member state to the UK is highly unlikely to occur. Therefore, given the safeguard measures taken, this risk remains negligible.</p>
	<p pid="c.115.5/3">There is an increased&mdash;but still low&mdash;likelihood for the introduction of the H5N1 virus to the UK from the outbreaks in the known affected countries in eastern Europe. That is based on advice from UK experts on migration that there is no major migration of water birds from those countries to the UK. However, there is a possibility that the frequency of H5N1 virus detection in wild birds may increase in those countries. Should that be the case, experts consider that H5N1 virus may arrive in the UK at some point in the future because of the potential for limited &quot;mixing&quot; at some &quot;contact&quot; points between the existing water bird populations from this part of Europe with the populations in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.115.5/4">The likelihood of the H5N1 virus being introduced to the UK may escalate to high should outbreaks be detected in the northern part of European Russia. That conclusion is based on the fact that outbreaks of H5N1 virus in this area would be within the direct migratory routes between northern Russia and the UK and involve greater numbers of migratory waterfowl.</p>

Analysis by the Library of the House of UK statutory instruments implemented annually under the European Communities Act, suggests that on average, since 1998, around 9 per cent of statutory instruments originate from Brussels (Standard Note SN/IA/2888). The total volume of statutory instruments of course encompasses a wide range of instruments, including those, such as road closures, with purely local effect.</p>

	<p pid="c.117.5/2">The priorities are future financing, economic reform and social justice, including issues such as better regulation; Europe's role in the world, in areas such as the Doha Development Agenda, development and Africa, climate change, sugar reform and the Middle East; and security and stability, including counter-terrorism and enlargement.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.5/3">On future financing, the Government will work hard to reach a deal at the December European Council. A budget deal is part of putting Europe back on the right track, but it is easier to get the budget right in the context of a clear direction for Europe's economic and social policy for the future. At the informal summit at Hampton Court on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October</phrase>, EU leaders reached broad agreement on the direction outlined in the European Commission's paper <i>European values in a globalised world</i>. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister made a Written Statement on the Hampton Court informal summit on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-10-31.30"><i>Official Report</i>, Commons, cols. 30&ndash;32</phrase> WS).</p>
	<p pid="c.117.5/4">We have also already made real advances on these policy priorities. On better regulation, we have made major progress. Some 68 regulations have been withdrawn in the EU, and 100 have been simplified. The post-financial services action plan, which is intended to secure a much lighter touch over regulation, has been agreed. On development in Africa, there have been major improvements, with a doubling in the promises of aid to Africa. Sugar reforms should be agreed by the Agriculture Council in November. On enlargement, we were delighted that the European Union was able, under the United Kingdom presidency, to open accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia.</p>

	<p pid="c.118.5/1">Our food security policy ensures that consumers have access to a stable and adequate supply of food, and our domestic agriculture industry has an important contribution to make to the continuity of food supply by improving its ability to produce what the market requires. The reformed CAP, in breaking the link between subsidy and production, is encouraging farmers to produce what the market requires, rather than what subsidies dictate. Our farmers are well placed to produce foodstuffs that Europe's climate is suited to, but we cannot grow all the agricultural products our consumers might want to buy. The UK has long been a net importer of food, and national and international food security is best facilitated through improved trading relationships based on more open international markets and reductions in trade-distorting subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.5/2">Until the early 1990s, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (now Defra) maintained a strategic food stockpile for use in emergency situations, such as wartime. The food stockpiles were dispensed in the early 1990s and replaced by the food vulnerability model (FVM). The FVM is capable of providing Ministers with data on the availability of food supplies at all stages of the food chain. The FVM is a GIS-based tool that uses data collected from the agricultural census and from a survey carried out in the food industry for Defra by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD). The information collected would prove vital to the Government in their role of protecting the community from food shortages in any emergency, as it will inform our assessment of food supply chain capability and resilience. The current security climate has reinforced the need for such information.</p>

	<p pid="c.124.8/1">A survey conducted by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) in 2004 found that 9.4 per cent. of children under five were short for their age and that 1.9 per cent. of those children had low weight for their height. These indicators can be interpreted as measures of chronic and acute malnutrition, respectively. However, they also suggest that the nutritional situation in the West Bank and Gaza is similar to that of other countries in the region. DfID is providing &pound;1 million over six years as part of a multi-donor project to strengthen the capacity of the PCBS and enable it to carry out its work.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.8/2">A previous nutritional assessment carried out by the John Hopkins and Al Quds Universities in 2002 concluded that the figures for chronic malnutrition (stunting) and acute malnutrition (wasting) among children under five were 11.7 per cent. and 7.8 per cent. respectively. When the Gaza Strip was considered alone, the figures rose to 17.5 per cent. and 13.3 per cent. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has observed that &quot;while malnutrition has been eliminated, mild to moderate iron deficiency anaemia is still highly prevalent among pre-school children&quot;. DfID is providing &pound;15 million to UNRWA's work with Palestinian refugees this financial year and has provided a total of &pound;117 million over the past six years.</p>

	<p pid="c.128.3/1">St Lucia's national development policy is reflected in general policy statements and the policies of sectoral ministries. The preparation of a medium term national development strategy paper for 2005&ndash;08 is under way.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.3/2">The Government of St Lucia are committed to poverty reduction and meeting the millennium development goals and clearly acknowledge the importance of sustainable economic growth and development in that context. The Government have in the past prioritised poverty reduction through various policies and programmes, for example through overall support to the agriculture and tourism sectors, as well as the provision of social safety nets. Donor support to St Lucia supports those broad priorities as detailed below.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.3/3">The Department for International Development (DfID) continues to engage in St Lucia through its regional assistance programme for the Caribbean, which covers public sector reform, economic and fiscal management, education and HIV/AIDS. DfID's programme in the Caribbean is worth &pound;10.5 million per annum, of which &pound;3.5 million is assigned to regional issues. While some funds are available for particular strategic issues that may arise in-country, the main focus of the regional programme is to improve the effectiveness of other regional and international assistance, particularly through institutional strengthening. DfID has a number of regional projects of which St Lucia is a beneficiary, including in the areas of education, microfinance, civil society development, international trade negotiations, and combating HIV/AIDS. Two companies in St Lucia also receive support under the Business Linkages Challenge Fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.3/4">The European Union (EU) has been the largest provider of grant assistance to St Lucia in recent years. The funds are drawn from a number of EU aid instruments including the 10-year special framework for assistance (SFA), which helps countries adjust to changes in the EU's banana regime. Projects under the SFA have focused on rural development and covered irrigation and rural credit facilities, as well as private sector development and social safety nets. Under the European Development Fund (EDF) health is the focal sector for the programme in St Lucia. This is worth just over &pound;3 million for the period from 2002 to 2007, the UK share of which is 12.7 per cent. The major activity to be undertaken under this support is the construction of a new hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.3/5">The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) is also a key donor in St Lucia, and its planned concessional assistance over the next three years amounts to a programme of &pound;62.5 million. The UK's share of the CDB's concessional funds following the recent replenishment stands at 24 per cent. That assistance will cover activities under three broad objectives: sustainable economic growth, good governance and inclusive social development. Priority will be given to the water and sewage sector, hazard mitigation and tourism infrastructure and development.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.3/6">Assistance from the World Bank has focused on reducing environmental vulnerability (including disaster mitigation), human resource development and poverty reduction. The UK share of World Bank funding is approximately 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.3/7">Other development partners active in St Lucia include the French Government, and the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development, both of which are involved in transport issues. The Government of the People's Republic of China are committed to assisting with the construction of a new psychiatric hospital. The United Nations Development Programme and the Government of Japan have focused on the fisheries sector. Besides the World Bank, several other development partners also provide support for combating HIV/AIDS in St Lucia. They include the Pan-American Health Organisation, the United Nations Population Fund, and the Clinton Foundation.</p>

	<p pid="c.129.2/1">The DTI and UKTI take any allegations of impropriety or misuse of taxpayers' money seriously, and investigate them. Action is taken where necessary. Where government departments find evidence of improper expenditure, there are procedures set out under government accounting rules and in the Civil Service management code that departments follow. They can include recovery in appropriate circumstances where it is reasonable to do so. Specific cases are subject to internal processes, and it would be wholly inappropriate to comment on them.</p>

	<p pid="c.130.2/1">The Government are committed to tackling work-related violence. Over the past 10 years, there has been a significant drop in the number of reported incidents from 1.3 million to 655,000*. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has been working hard to help employers tackle the problem. In the past five years, HSE has published free case study guidance for small businesses and lone workers; supported new national occupational standards to help employers develop effective policies on work related violence; and undertaken a programme of targeted inspections in the healthcare sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.2/2">HSE is working with its stakeholder group, the Partnership on Work-Related Violence, to address the problem of work-related violence in the sectors most at risk. The group will continue to share knowledge and promote good practice and develop ways to make the information more accessible to those who need it.</p>

	<p pid="c.130.5/1">The World Trade Organisation (WTO) normally takes decisions by consensus. However, in limited circumstances, the WTO agreement envisages that, where consensus cannot be obtained, a decision may be taken by a lesser number of the WTO membership. For example, the granting of a waiver of certain WTO obligations to a WTO member under Article IX.3 of the WTO agreement may be taken by three-quarters of the WTO membership. Similarly, a decision on accession of a new member under Article XII(2) of the WTO agreement must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the members of the WTO.</p>
