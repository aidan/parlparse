In the first instance, staff are encouraged to raise such concerns with their line manager. Alternatively they may raise the matter with the human resource director or directly with the FSA board's appointed complaints investigator. The complaints investigator, who is independent, reports his findings to the FSA chair and a report is made annually to the FSA board.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.8/2">In addition, if staff do not receive what they consider to be a reasonable response they are able to report the matter to the Civil Service Commissioners. Staff have access to the FSA's accounts and the disclosure information contained within them. The FSA's internal auditors have recently conducted a counter-fraud testing audit and concluded that procedures were generally sound.</p>

The task group has made progress in analysing the competitive position of the industry, and its findings will inform future decisions on how to ensure that haulage continues to fulfil its important role in the UK economy.</p>
