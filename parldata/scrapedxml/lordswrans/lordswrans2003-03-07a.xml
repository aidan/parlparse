	<p pid="a.132.6/1">Numbers of medically downgraded personnel include those who are permanently medically downgraded as well as those who are pregnant or have recently given birth. Of the just over 17,000 personnel who were medically downgraded in October 2002, more than 40 per cent would have been deployable on military operations albeit not at the front line. Priority for medical treatment is normally based on clinical need. However, mechanisms also exist for service patients to be fast-tracked in order to return them to operational duty more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. Fast-track diagnosis and treatment are undertaken either through Ministry of Defence hospital units or through private healthcare providers. Moreover, rehabilitation facilities at unit and regional level are being improved as part of the work to reduce the number of personnel unfit through injury.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.5/1">The operational welfare package (OWP) is in the process of being implemented in all Gulf locations where operational and environmental factors allow. In order to provide the degree of support appropriate to the different stages of the deployment the OWP is being implemented in phases.

	<p pid="a.140.3/1">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act received Royal Assent in November last year, and sections 145 and 146 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase>. Data on numbers of prosecutions under these sections will be collected in the usual way and published in Home Office Criminal Statistics. Given that the powers came into effect very recently there is not any information yet held centrally about numbers of prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.9/1">The Detention Centre Rules 2001 make provision for the regulation and management of removal centres. All removal centres are required to operate under the rules, which include provisions relating to the suitability of accommodation, freedom of movement and association, and visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.9/2">In addition to the Detention Centre Rules, we are currently in the process of establishing a comprehensive set of operating standards for removal centres. The operating standards will complement the rules and will provide measurable and auditable standards against which any removal centre will be assessed. Issues such as accommodation, free time and visiting hours will be included in these operating standards. That said, the matter of visiting hours remains under continuous review and we will be considering whether there may be room for improvement at certain centres, including Haslar.</p>
