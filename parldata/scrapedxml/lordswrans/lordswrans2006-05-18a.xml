	<p pid="a.59.2/1">In the past, our Hercules aircraft would not have been exposed to the type and level of threat that now prevails in today's operational environments. Hercules defensive systems have, however, been enhanced and modified considerably in recent years, with the emphasis on countering the greatest perceived threats, while also evolving tactics and improving force protection on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">Although the Ministry of Defence was aware that explosive-suppressant foam (ESF) was available as a possible upgrade for the Hercules, until the loss of Hercules XV 179 the Hercules aircraft was not judged vulnerable to the form of attack that caused XV 179 to crash, albeit that there had been some working-level correspondence on the subject within the RAF. The board of inquiry into the loss of Hercules XV 179 recommended that the MoD should consider the fitting of a fuel tank inerting system, and this was taken forward as a matter of urgency. As a result, we have recently decided to fit ESF to some of our Hercules aircraft, concentrating on those aircraft which operate at the highest threat. Subject to final contract negotiations, we expect to have the first aircraft fitted with ESF available for operations in the next few months. The initial programme will cost &pound;600,000 per aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">We are aware of the approach that the United States has taken, but we do not comment on the capability of other nations.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/1">We cannot arbitrarily change database information without actual evidence that the changes are accurate. We are not qualified to determine other countries' nationality laws and will not base changes to our records on a general determination of these laws. In addition, overseas posts do not determine an applicant's qualification to register as a British citizen under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997. Overseas posts, primarily our Consulate-General in Hong Kong, forward applications for registration as a British citizen to the Home Office where applicants show that they may meet the requirements of that Act, but it is the Home Office that is the determining registration authority. The Home Office could refuse an application.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/2">It therefore follows that a successful application for registration as a British citizen under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 means that an applicant has proved that they are solely British, and we will then amend the British national (overseas) records held in Hong Kong to reflect that fact.</p>

The skills required for these programmes were not available from civil servants. In addition, consultants have been engaged by ODPM to support the delivery of projects to enhance the ability of the fire and rescue service to respond to major incidents. The work undertaken by consultants includes providing radio engineering expertise for the fire and rescue service's new radio systems, and logistical support and design for responding to a chemical, biological, radioactive or nuclear incident and search and rescue incidents. Some 60 per cent. of expenditure has been in support of these projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.7/2" qnum="HL5558">What has been the practice of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate on detention of breastfeeding mothers without their infants; and what changes they have implemented as a result of the review by senior officials of the case of Mrs N (Home Office reference N1081177).</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-05-18a.63.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="63"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60518w02.htm#60518w02_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.63.8/1">The Immigration Service considers a wide range of factors when deciding whether to detain a person for removal who has children in this country. This includes the separation of a breastfeeding mother from her infant, although it would be uncommon for detention to take place in these circumstances. The decision to detain a person rests with the individual officer and is based on the individual circumstances of the case. If the officer considers that an individual is suitable for detention, they must relay the facts of the case to an officer of at least chief immigration officer rank for authorisation. The Immigration Service is reviewing all aspects of the process for effecting family removals, and the outcome will take the form of guidance, which will be made available to operational enforcement staff, through the operational enforcement manual. An in-depth review of the case of Mrs N. has now taken place and a series of recommendations made. That review has found that existing procedures for dealing with such cases were not followed in this case. I will be writing to the noble Lord shortly about the case of Mrs N.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">Since 1997 the Royal Air Force has provided a regular air service to the Falkland Islands, via Ascension Island. Since April 2003 this has been predominantly through the use of charter civilian aircraft. During this period 244 flights were made, of which records exist for 209. Based on these records, approximately 72 per cent. of flights departed on schedule and a further 18 per cent. were within six hours of the estimated time of departure. Approximately 6 per cent. of flights were delayed in excess of 24 hours. In cases where civilian aircraft were unable to support the service, outside the terms of the contract, appropriate military aircraft were substituted. This performance is considered acceptable, given the challenging nature of the route. Comparable records are not held for the period prior to April 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/2">The Ministry of Defence is not aware of any plans to upgrade the aircraft currently operating the schedule, although this is principally a matter for the commercial operator.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">Enforcement of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 is a matter for the Security Industry Authority and the police. The Association of Chief Police Officers wrote to police forces on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase> with advice on the enforcement policy that should be adopted, including advice with regard to sports stewards. This advice contains the following statements:</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2" class="indent">&quot;A few specific sectors of the industry (including some functions at sporting and other events and, at the date of circulation, some video monitoring centres) continue to dispute whether their activities fall within the scope of the legislation. . . . In respect of those sectors of the guarding industry that dispute whether they should be licensed, it is recommended that forces exercise particular caution when contemplating enforcement action against a failure to comply with the licensing regime. In sectors subject to dispute, forces should, if possible, defer enforcement action to the SIA's own teams. This need not however preclude planning to build licensing into safety and other long-term plans in respect of future sporting and other events&quot;.</p>
