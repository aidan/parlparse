	<p pid="a.158.5/3">The United Nations International Trade Centre and the United Nations Statistics Division have told us that their statistics are based on Sudanese reporting, and they would revert to the Sudanese authorities for clarification. We have as yet received no information to support the statistics Comtrade published. If we do, we will investigate further and action will be taken against any UK person or entity found to be in breach of UK legislation implementing the arms embargo against Sudan.</p>

While we would like to draw a line under this matter by settling all outstanding claims, we can only do so when the amount claimed is correct and has been justified. There are several different categories of claim against Defra arising as a result of the outbreaks that remain unsettled. These comprise:</p>

	<p pid="a.165.5/1">Research funded by the department suggests that a local temperature change in Greenland of 2.7 degrees (compared to 1990 levels), which roughly corresponds to a global temperature change of two degrees, could trigger melting of the Greenland ice sheet.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/2">Total melting of the ice sheet would depend on whether the temperature change was sustained or increasing. A sustained temperature change of 2.7 degrees would result in a slow decrease in the size of the ice sheet over millennia and, possibly, its eventual elimination. A further increase in the temperature change is likely to result in the elimination of the ice sheet, over a timescale of a thousand years or more, depending on the size of the temperature rise. Complete melting of the ice sheet would result in sea level rise of approximately seven metres.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.2/1">The potential release of methane from hydrates trapped under the ocean has not yet been quantified, but is the subject of research under the Defra-funded Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre. Warmer temperatures could trigger such a release, as they can destabilise the conditions under which the hydrates can exist. The Hadley Centre is investigating the conditions under which the hydrates could become unstable, and the temperatures that could initiate a release.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.5/1">The Government are promoting the production of bioethanol through the 20 pence per litre cut in the duty rate that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase> this year. Work is also being carried out on a feasibility study on a renewable transport fuel obligation, and consideration is being given to the application of enhanced capital allowances to biofuel processing plants. The UK's 2005 and 2010 targets under the biofuels directive for the use of biofuels should also help to stimulate the bioethanol industry. The directive does not require the target for 2010 to be set until 2007. But the Government will announce an ambitious but realistic 2010 target as soon as possible in 2005, once the feasibility study on the obligation has been completed and possible delivery mechanisms have been considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.0/1">English Nature has a statutory role in the selection and management of designated sites both at the coast and inland. There are around 380 coastal Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). English Nature is required to consult widely over the designation of SSSIs, and is continuing to improve the openness and transparency of the designation process for all stakeholders. These procedures are set out in the Government's <i>Sites of Special Scientific Interest: Encouraging Positive Partnership&mdash;Code of Guidance</i> published by my department in 2003. For each SSSI there is a list of operations where consultation is required. This consultation is either between English Nature and the owner-occupier, or, where another public body is the consenting authority, between that body and English Nature. English Nature is a statutory consultee in respect of plans and projects likely to affect SSSIs or internationally important sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/2">English Nature is currently in the process of producing its maritime strategy. This will inform the revision of English Nature's coastal policy and has been subject to a wide public consultation process in 2004. Communication is a key element of this strategy, in particular to improve the wider understanding of English Nature's approach to sustainable coastal management.</p>
