	<p pid="a.115.1/2" qnum="HL5974">Whether they have calculated the increase in carbon emissions the proposed additional runway at Stansted Airport would produce; and what the projected figures are for the first five years of the runway's operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/2">These suggest that a second runway at Stansted would cause the UK's annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to increase by 2.3 million tonnes per annum, when averaged over the period 2015 to 2075. Over the first five years of the runway's operation, the additional CO2 emissions are projected to rise from around zero to around 1 million tonnes per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/3">The Government are strongly committed to achieving reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and aim to do so in the most effective way. This is why we have led the debate within Europe to include all flights arriving at and departing from EU airports in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) from 2012 onwards. Any growth in aircraft emissions above the ETS cap will only be possible by the sector paying for commensurate carbon savings made elsewhere in the economy.</p>

In that signal he stressed the significance and importance of being able to give thanks for the safe return of those who had served overseas. Equally he emphasised the need for recognition that the Armed Forces did not have the undivided support of all sections within the wider community. He also outlined that he had taken a number of measures to ensure that the thanksgiving parade did not increase the potential for friction. These measures included that all on parade would be unarmed and the musical repertoire would reflect the thanksgiving and tri-service nature of the event, including regimental tunes, while also recognising that the parade was happening on a Sunday.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/3">In a further statement from the GOC NI on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-31">Friday 31 October</phrase> it was announced that he had decided that there would be no flypast, which further underpinned the appreciation of the sensitivities surrounding this element of the parade.</p>

These limitations are enforced by means of a formal notice of determination under Section 40(4) of the Inquiries Act 2005 in the Robert Hamill inquiry and Billy Wright inquiry. Furthermore, Section 17(3) of the Inquiries Act imposes a specific duty on the inquiry chairman to have regard to cost in procedural decisions:</p>

	<p pid="a.127.6/1">The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) conducts inspections of vehicles at operators' premises and at the roadside to check the roadworthiness of vehicles and that safety rules for vehicle use are complied with (including drivers' hours and vehicle weight).</p>
	<p pid="a.127.6/2">The GB operator licensing system provides a robust method of dealing with operators who systematically disregard the law. Problems that are found by VOSA at its checks are reported to the traffic commissioners, who are responsible for regulating GB operators. Traffic commissioners have the power to require certain undertakings from vehicle operators to provide confidence that they can operate safely. Where problems are reported the traffic commissioner has the power to issue warnings, suspend, curtail or revoke a licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.6/3">Where heavy goods vehicles (HGV) operators choose to operate unlawfully outside of the GB operator licensing system, VOSA has the power to impose a range of sanctions, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.6/4">impound vehicles which can then be sold by VOSA, the sale value being offset against the costs of the impounding and subsequent vehicle storage. It is intended that similar powers will be extended to public services vehicles (PSV) in 2009;prosecution action can be taken. In 2007-08 7,127 offences were reported for prosecution for HGVs and 747 for PSVs. Average fine levels for 2007-08 were &pound;247.56; and from spring 2009 it is intended that VOSA will have power to issue fixed penalties to drivers for offences they have committed. This will provide further deterrent to non-compliance. Powers will also be introduced to enable &quot;deposits&quot; to be taken from those unable to provide a satisfactory UK address.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/2" qnum="HL5549">Why they moved the place of issuing of visas to the United Kingdom for citizens of Equatorial Guinea from Abuja to Accra.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-11-11a.128.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="128"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81111w0004.htm#81111w0004.htm_spmin6">
	<p pid="a.128.2/1">Abuja was not specified as the visa issuing post for Equatorial Guinea citizens. Yaounde in Cameroon was, and remains, the designated post for such applications, though UKBA advises that applications may be made at our posts in Nigeria, Ghana, or indeed any full service visa post if it is more convenient.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/2">In July 2008 the visa office in Yaounde ceased to take decisions on visa applications with this work transferred to Accra. The office in Yaounde, however, remains open for the submission of visa applications. These are collected in Yaounde along with fees and biographic and biometric data, and are couriered to Accra where the application is considered. The decisions are returned to Yaounde for handing back to the applicant.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/3">The hub and spoke method of working is well established in the overseas visa network with the majority of posts in southern Africa, for example, already working this way. The decision to move decision-making work to Accra from Yaounde was taken in order to ensure consistency in our decision-making, to provide greater management oversight, and to achieve cost savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/4">No visa applicant is required to travel to Accra to lodge their application as decisions can be lodged in Yaounde or at any other convenient full service post.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/5">During the 12-month period to date, a worldwide total of 223 UK visa applications made by Equatorial Guinea nationals were lodged in 12 different countries. Among these, the top three were Yaounde (109), Madrid (68) and Abuja (12).</p>
