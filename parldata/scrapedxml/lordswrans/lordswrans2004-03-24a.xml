	<p pid="a.98.5/1">An EU-Belarus dialogue is still at an early stage. But the message already being delivered bilaterally by EU member states and by EU demarche is the need for more responsible arms exports. We encourage Belarus to sign up to and apply the criteria of the EU code of conduct to their arms exports and have welcomed their recent efforts at transparency in arms exports.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.5/2">Belarus has signed up to the OSCE's small arms and light weapons (SALW) document, which requires the adoption of a series of principles to improve national controls over the export of SALW and for states to exchange information on legislation and current practice on export policy and procedures. Belarus has provided this information. Belarus has also asked the OSCE for assistance with the destruction of large quantities of SALW and ammunition. An assessment visit is planned but before providing any destruction funds, we and other donors wish to see progress on Belarus' export controls as a demonstration of political will.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/2">The Health Protection Agency carries out a wide range of relevant research, some of which is in accordance with contracts placed and funded by pharmaceutical companies. The role of the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological medicines involves some contractual research work with pharmaceutical companies. The National Health Service also undertakes work for pharmaceutical companies under contract. The Department of Health is currently funding research at over 40 per cent of universities in England. Information on which of these universities also carry out work for agrochemical or pharmaceutical companies is not held.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is funding research in the current financial year at around 270 individual organisations. Of these, Defra's main contractors are mostly government-owned or sponsored (for example Defra's own science agencies, research council institutes, universities). As far as is known, all the research contractor base operate commercially as well as providing services to Defra, but information is not held on these commercial activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.5/1">We are aware that the numbers of cormorants breeding in Britain have risen over the past 25 years, particularly inland, albeit from a very low base. The number of cormorants wintering in Great Britain shows recent signs of stabilisation, following increases during the 1980s.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/2">Defra (then Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) carried out a three-year programme of research to ascertain the impact of fish-eating birds on fisheries. The research covered the population and movement of cormorants, their feeding ecology, case studies of the impact of cormorants on fisheries and management methods. Among other things, this work concluded that cormorants were a problem for specific fisheries rather than a general problem. The results were disseminated to the angling and conservation community through a seminar in 1999. Copies of the research reports are in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/3">Defra's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science is currently researching the potential use of fish refuges to reduce damage to inland fisheries by cormorants. The results should be known in September 2005.</p>
