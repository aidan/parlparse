Both types would therefore fall to be taxed in the Special Vehicles class with an annual rate of duty of &pound;165.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/2">For (c), a concrete pumping machine, the effect of the Appeal Court judgement in R v Reilly Concrete Pumping is that such a vehicle should be licensed in the goods vehicle tax class appropriate to its operating weight and axle configuration. This applies regardless of whether the vehicle was originally constructed as a concrete pump or adapted from a vehicle chassis originally used for other purposes.</p>

We regret that Iraq has refused to attend the meetings of the commission and its Technical Sub-Committee since January 1999, thereby hindering further progress. It is appalling that to date Iraq has provided information sufficient to close only three of the case files. We continue to work with the ICRC and other commission members to overcome these obstacles, and sent a delegation to consultations in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-21">21 June</phrase> for this purpose. We also support the work of Yuli Vorontsov, appointed under UNSCR 1284 (a UK initiative) as co-ordinator for this and other Kuwaiti issues. My honourable friend the Minister of State, Peter Hain, discussed with Mr Vorontsov last week his efforts to secure renewed Iraqi engagement.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.8/1">Since May 1993, vessels of 10 metres and under in overall length engaged in fishing for profit have been required to hold a valid fishing vessel licence issued by one of the Fisheries Departments in the UK. The catches made by such vessels count against the UK's allocations of quota.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.8/2">Last year, and in response to concerns about the scope for increased fishing effort, the Fisheries Departments invited comments on measures to improve the management of the under 10 metre fleet. More than 250 replies have been received from fishermen's organisations and individual fishermen. The majority of those commenting were opposed to further constraints being placed on this part of the industry such as a prohibition on weekend fishing, regional licensing or species specific licences.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.8/3">Although the Fisheries Departments have been successful in limiting the closure of fisheries, this may not be possible in future if fishing effort expands. In recent years there has been a sharp increase in the construction of vessels between 9 and 10 metres. This trend prompted the departments to introduce monthly catch limits for North Sea nephrops last Autumn and to extend these arrangements to Area VII and West of Scotland nephrops for the year 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.8/4">It is the view of the Fisheries Departments that it would be prudent to adopt further measures to constrain future growth in fishing effort within the under 10 metre fleet. Consequently, from <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>, the licences of vessels between 8 and 10 metres will be ring fenced and it will not be possible from that date to aggregate licences from vessels under 8 metres on to vessels between 8 and 10 metres. From the same date, a limit of 70 vessel capacity units will apply to the aggregation of licences on to vessels below 8 metres. Additionally, the Licensing Review Working Group, comprising representatives from industry and Fisheries Departments, has been asked to consider whether any changes should be made in the capacity penalties applying to the transfer or aggregation of licences within the under 10 metre fleet.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.8/5">The Fisheries Departments will continue to manage quota allocations for the under 10 metre fleet with the objective of providing fishing opportunities throughout the year. Quota allocations for the main stocks of interest to under 10 metre vessels have been underpinned for a number of years and in future any surplus that arises on these allocations will be utilised to acquire additional quota. Greater use will also be made of EU provisions on end year flexibility enabling quota to be borrowed from the following year and for certain stocks for any surplus to be banked. Where the quota available is not sufficient to provide for year-round fisheries, the Fisheries Departments will take action to close fisheries for limited periods or to impose monthly catch limits. Consideration will also be given to whether suitable arrangements might be possible that would enable producer organisations to manage quota in respect of under 10 metre vessels within their membership.</p>
