Some provisions came into force on Royal Assent, some will come into effect two months after Royal Assent and all of the remaining provisions will come into effect five years after Royal Assent or earlier as determined by the Secretary of State. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has begun discussions with the Information Commissioner designate about implementation of these provisions and he hopes to publish an implementation plan in March.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.5/1">The estimates made up to now of the number of dangerous people with severe personality disorder present in the wider population have been based in part on population information derived from the 1998 Office of National Statistics (ONS) survey of psychiatric morbidity among prisoners in England and Wales. The survey information does not make it possible to identify actual DSPD individuals currently in detention or to provide information about the nature of their offending behaviour to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/2">Based on estimates of reconviction rates (following release or discharge) of sentenced prisoners and hospital patients subject to restriction orders, the Government estimate that if the population currently estimated to be dangerous and severely personality disordered were to re-enter the community only when it is judged safe for them to do so, a reduction of nearly 200 violent or sexual crimes a year could be expected. This does not include offences committed but not detected or cleared up.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/3">It is estimated that approximately 200 of those released or discharged will be reconvicted for a sexual or violent crime in an average year. This represents over 50 per cent of the number of such people released from prison or special hospital in an average year.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.2/1">The term &quot;pornography&quot; is not recognised in legislation, which in England and Wales covers indecent material (particularly indecent photographs or computer generated images of children) and obscene material, There are separate common law and statutory offences in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/2">In England and Wales, obscenity legislation, such as the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and the Protection of Children Act 1978, applies equally to material placed on the Internet as to material published and distributed in other media; what is illegal off-line is illegal on-line.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/3">Under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 it is an offence to publish an &quot;obscene article&quot;, as defined in the Act. Under Section 2 of the Act a person who publishes (distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire) an obscene article, or transmits obscene data electronically may be guilty of an offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/4">Under the Protection of Children Act 1976, there is an absolute prohibition of the production, circulation and possession with a view to distribution of any indecent photograph of a child under 16. The simple possession of an indecent photograph of a child is also an offence under Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Section 84 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 updated these controls to include indecent computer-generated photographs of children, and they have been successfully applied to child pornography transmitted over the Internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/5">The Government support the work of the Internet Watch Foundation which was set up in 1996 by Internet service providers to enable members of the public, via a hotline, to report potentially illegal material in a newsgroup or website. If the material is considered illegal, the foundation passes details to the United Kingdom police to initiate action against the originators and asks British Internet service providers (ISPs) to close down links to the site. If the originators are abroad, the foundation passes the report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) which liaises with the enforcement agencies of the countries concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/6">The way in which records are held for those initially charged by the police and those convicted by the courts in England and Wales differs.

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The rail transfer equipment (RTE) manufactured by Klaus has been in service for some 10 years and a small number of trailers have shown signs of distortion within the main chassis. As a result, some trailers have been removed from service and a regular inspection programme has been introduced for the remaining trailers. A post design services (PDS) contract has been let to investigate the problem and develop potential design solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">Our records show that there has been only one serious incident involving Klaus RTE. This occurred in June 1999 during a training exercise in Poland when a combination of factors led to the equipment locking up while being operated. During action to recover the situation, the RTE trailer overbalanced and fell onto a rail wagon. No personnel sustained any injuries. The incident has been fully investigated and further work is being undertaken to examine certain design and operating aspects of the equipment. Operator training has also been reviewed and it is now mandatory that a training course is completed at the Defence School of Transport before personnel are allowed to operate the equipment.</p>

Further funding of &amp;&pound;163;650,000 was announced in January 2000 to support an additional number of small projects linking museums and galleries with schools.

	<p pid="a.108.2/1">Our priority in continuing European discussions on the proposed directive is to achieve a secure regulatory regime for traditional herbal remedies. We are aware that there are also some traditional medicines which consist wholly or partly of non-herbal ingredients. Our current position is that, once the directive goes beyond relatively discrete categories such as traditional herbal remedies, it may become more difficult to contain the wider public health and regulatory consequences. We therefore wish to continue to review the developing shape of the directive and the implications for overall medicines regulation before firmly committing ourselves to supporting the principle that coverage should extend more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/2">We are also considering carefully our detailed position on the definition of traditional use, including the qualifying time period, and on criteria which might apply in the case of combinations. One general consideration is that the normal regulatory requirements for medicines include demonstration of efficacy. While we have advocated in Europe the specific case for lifting the requirement for efficacy in the case of genuinely traditional herbal remedies, we would have concerns about the potential implications if the parameters for traditional use were set so loosely that a very wide range of medicinal products were no longer required to demonstrate efficacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/3">At this stage we do not yet know the views of other member states on specific issues relating to combination products. We would expect a clearer picture to emerge over the coming months as European discussions continue. The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has submitted our initial response to the European Commission on the preliminary draft of the proposed directive. Copies of the MCA's letter will be placed in the Library. We will continue our current consultative approach with herbal interest groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/1">I represented the United Kingdom at the Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/2">The Council unanimously adopted conclusions welcoming the Commission's proposals for a new European Aviation Safety Agency. The Commission welcomed the progress made and hoped that a Common Position would be reached by June 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/3">The Council took note of a progress report on a Commission proposal for transposing safety standards of the Joint Aviation Authorities into EC law. The Council also noted that a proposal for a directive creating generic training requirements for airline cabin crew was moving towards agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/4">The Commission set out the main conclusions of the High Level Group, set up following publication of the Commission Communication The Creation of a Single European Sky and chaired by the Commissioner. The conclusions focus on creating an independent regulator; managing civil and military airspace in Europe collectively; promoting technical interoperability; and improving the training and recruitment of air traffic controllers. The Commission said it would present a Communication to the Stockholm European Council and make legislative proposals soon after that. Member states all reacted positively. Most pointed to the need to fully involve Central European countries in this work. I stressed the need to separate the operation and regulation of air traffic management services.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/5">The Council discussed air passengers' rights. The Commission stressed the need for performance criteria for airlines. It hoped for new agreements with industry by the end of April. The Presidency noted that voluntary arrangements were preferable to legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/6">The Commission gave a progress report on negotiations on air services agreements with the Central and East European countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/7">The Presidency noted recent progress on the technical aspects of a Commission mandate for negotiating a Transatlantic Common Aviation Area with the US.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/8">The Commission presented its report on the definition phase of the Galileo satellite navigation project. During the debate, I joined other Ministers in recalling the Conclusions of the Cologne and Nice European Councils on the predominant role of private sector finance in the project. The Council did not reach agreement on how to proceed with the development and validation phase. The Commission will undertake further work on outstanding issues, and the project is likely to be discussed again by the Council in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/9">Proposals on maritime safety arising from the Erika disaster were further debated and common positions reached on two draft directives. The first of these enhances the supervision, and responsibilities and liabilities, of ship classification societies. The second improves the targeting and standards of port state control inspections, concentrating effort on those vessels which pose the greatest safety and/or pollution risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/10">The Commission gave a presentation on elements of the second package of post-Erika proposals: ship surveillance; increase in provision for oil pollution compensation payments; and a new European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). I underlined the need for the first two elements to be pursued internationally in the context of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and supported the establishment of the EMSA to the extent that it should provide for better quality technical support to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/11">Council Conclusions were adopted reaffirming a maritime safety policy aimed at reducing the risk of accidents and the avoidance of loss of life and pollution of the marine environment. In particular, the Conclusions undertook to continue negotiations with IMO on acceleration of the introduction of double-hulled tankers on the basis of an approach agreed by the Council in October and, if an agreement on those terms is reached at the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee session in April 2001, to adopt a text bringing the IMO agreement immediately into Community law; emphasised the need for an adequate regime, global if possible, for compensation in the event of damage caused by oil pollution at sea; expressed the aim that Voyage Data Recorders (VDRs--&quot;black boxes&quot;) should be compulsory within five years on all ships calling at EU ports and that member states should continue their efforts in the IMO to secure an international agreement making mandatory the fitting of VDRs to all vessels.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/12">There was a debate on an amended proposal to harmonise employment standards between EU and third country crew members on intra-EU regular passenger ferry services. I was joined by other Ministers in emphasising the need to protect seafarers' employment conditions and maintain an appropriate maritime skills base.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/13">Political agreement was reached on a directive to improve the safety of bulk carriers, which is now subject to the scrutiny of the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/14">Agreement with the European Parliament having been reached on the package of measures for opening up international rail freight in the EU, the Council unanimously adopted the package.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/15">Political agreement was reached by qualified majority on a directive on working time in the road transport sector. Self-employed drivers will not be covered by the directive immediately, but their exclusion will be reviewed two years after transposition of the directive, with the aim of drawing up specific provisions. The UK is content with much of the agreed text, and was pleased to see revised definitions of working time and night work incorporated. However, as the final text did not include satisfactory provision on an individual opt-out, or a temporary derogation permitting a 65 hour maximum working week, the United Kingdom abstained from the Council's agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/16">The Council agreed Conclusions on a proposal obliging international lorry drivers to carry an attestation showing that they were legally employed. The Conclusions stated that the draft regulation should apply only to third country drivers (subject to review), and that work should continue with a view to reaching agreement on the regulation at the Council in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/17">The Commission presented its proposals on weekend lorry bans, driver training and the amendment to Regulation 3820/85 on drivers' hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/18">There was a debate on proposals on public service obligations in the field of passenger transport by road, rail and inland waterway and on state aid granted for co-ordination of transport in those modes. I was among Ministers who spoke in support of the proposals. The Presidency concluded that public services were of general interest and needed particular treatment to safeguard them, and that there was a general desire for progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/19">The Commission presented its Green Paper on security of energy supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/20">The Council adopted a directive continuing indefinitely the harmonised start and end dates for summertime in the EU (last Sunday of March and October respectively). There will be review after five years.</p>
