	<p pid="a.207.2/1">At their meetings in November last year both the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) of the IMF and the Development Committee of the IMF and the World Bank recognised that lower global growth prospects and declining terms of trade are likely to adversely affect many low-income countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/2">The IMFC, chaired by the Chancellor, called on the IMF, in close collaboration with the World Bank, to respond flexibly and proactively to the needs of heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), including through additional concessional financing and debt relief where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/3">For all countries qualifying under the enhanced HIPC initiative, the UK is already providing complete debt relief at decision point under its 100 per cent policy. The UK continues to work hard to ensure that HIPC delivers an exit from unsustainable debt for all eligible countries. We also call on other countries to follow our leads on bilateral policies, such as 100 per cent relief at decision point, and in holding payments in trust for those countries yet to receive debt relief. Already 24 countries have qualified for debt relief, and they will benefit from over 56 billion dollars in debt reduction, which will bring their debts to below the developing countries average.</p>

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has investigated the provenance of these items and, as there is no evidence of the original date or place of finding, is advised that it would not be possible to demonstrate that the items might be treasure trove; nor is there any evidence that the original discovery of the items was concealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">The temporary bar on export provides an opportunity for interest to be expressed in acquiring items of national importance so that they may be retained within the UK. As with every case, if, by the end of the initial deferral period (<phrase class="date" code="2002-02-22">22 February 2002</phrase>) an expression of interest has been received, the Minister can take this into account when deciding whether or not to extend the deferral period for a further month.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">Acquisitions are the responsibility of the governing bodies of national institutions and are considered in line with the policies of that institution. It is possible that an institution may on occasion decide to act as a repository of last resort for an item which lacks a full documented provenance.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.5/1">We are satisfied with the arrangements made at Her Majesty's (HM) Prison Maghaberry for the detention of asylum seekers and others but would accept that it is not an ideal situation. As a result, and following our review of immigration detention in Northern Ireland, we have instituted a policy of transferring persons detained in Northern Ireland to immigration removal centres on the mainland unless a specific request is made to stay in Northern Ireland, in which case the detainee in question will continue to be held at HM Prison Maghaberry. There remain no plans to establish a dedicated immigration detention facility in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.0/1">We have today placed a report of a review which my right honourable friend the former Home Secretary (Jack Straw) asked Patrick Carter, a non-executive member of the Strategy Board for Correctional Services, to carry out on the future role of the private sector in the prison system.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/2">We believe that a mixed economy of provision is essential in achieving a modern, dynamic Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/3">We are grateful to Patrick Carter for his report, which shows how much the private sector has achieved to date in providing high quality prison services at lower cost. The report also shows how well the public sector prison service has responded to the challenge of private sector competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/4">Both the public and the private sectors are important to the future of the Prision Service. Both can show big successes that benefit prisoners and the public. We want to create conditions in which both can flourish but in which both have to continually prove themselves. We believe the overall thrust of the recommendations of the report will achieve this. Some can be implemented straightaway but others need further work or will have to be subject to discussions in the current spending review and our wider vision for modernising the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/5">The proposal that under-performing prisons should be required to show how they will meet tough benchmarked standards or face contracting out or closure offers the potential for big improvements in performance and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/6">The report also provides a welcome contribution to finding ways of bringing the ageing prison estate into the 21st century. We will consider this as part of our current assessment of the options for providing a range of carefully targeted new approaches to dealing with offenders and the spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/7">We note the recommendation for a limited programme of market testing. For the moment, we believe the performance testing process we have announced offers a better, faster and cheaper means of improvement. But we do not rule out using market testing again in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/8">The private sector has demonstrated that it can make a valuable contribution to the delivery of a high quality service by prisons. This report outlines a way ahead for their continued involvement.</p>

The increase in the resource element of the DEL arises from speeding up the reform of the CPS to allow it to contribute fully to criminal justice targets, implementation of extended court sitting hours and the provision of resources for the CPS prosecutor recovered assets training project. The decrease in DEL arises from the transfer of &pound;120,000 to the Home Office in respect of the CPS's contribution to CJIU. The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from the take up of &pound;2,000,000 of end year flexibility entitlement and a transfer of resources from the Home Office to support the video recording of police interviews. The decrease in capital arises from the return to the Home Office of &pound;150,000 of Capital Modernisation Fund resources.</p>

The decrease in the resource element of the DEL is the net effect of a transfer of &pound;106,000 to clients whose work will become chargeable in the current financial year. The decreases in HM Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor's Department DEL will be affected by a &pound;1,000 Token Supplementary Estimate.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.2/12">The Serious Fraud Office's DEL will be increased by &pound;500,000, from &pound;20,925,000 to &pound;21,425,000, and the administration costs limit will be increased by &pound;500,000, from &pound;14,415,000 to &pound;14,915,000. The increase in the resource element of the DEL arises from development of the Docman information support system and funding of early retirements in support of restructuring of the Serious Fraud Office to enable it to contribute fully to criminal justice targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.2/13">The increases will be entirely met by a transfer from the Criminal Justice System reserve, transfers from the Home Office and take up of captial end year flexibility entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.2/1">We have no plans at present to ask the National Institute for Clincial Excellence to advise general practitioners on the prescribing of the statin group of drugs. Current guidance is available in the National Service Framework (NSF) for Coronary Heart Disease (published March 2000), as amended by the Chief Medical Officer (CMO)'s Update 29. Data on prescribing of statins in primary care shows a substantial increase in prescribing since the NSF was published in line with the recommendations in the NSF for the effective treatment of patients with established coronary heart disease to prevent further coronary events. This trend is continuing with prescribing of statins currently increasing by about 30 per cent each year.</p>

It is estimated that there are currently 1.5 million hearing aid users in this country. We do not know the number of people with a hearing impairment who may benefit from an aid but are not currently using one. As of the end of January 2002, 16,352 people have been fitted with digital hearing aids by the 20 sites currently involved in the pilot project. We have announced that the additional &pound;20 million funding for the project for next year will mean that there will be 50 sites fitting digital hearing aids by the end of March 2003. This will mean that one-third of the country will have access to a site participating in the project.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.2/1">The minimum funding requirement (MFR) is not working as intended, and we have announced proposals to replace it as soon as parliamentary time for the necessary primary legislation becomes available. These proposals will mean better protection and more effective security for pension scheme members, and we are currently working with the pensions industry, consumer organisations, employers and trade unions to take our proposals forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/2">In the meantime regulations have been laid before Parliament today which will enable the MFR to operate more effectively in the period leading up to its replacement and which improve protection for members when an employer decides to wind a scheme up. Draft regulations were issued for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-18">18 September 2001</phrase>, and the consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-10">10 December</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.231.5/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of Rother District Council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/2">Inspectors found that the council needs to improve on its performance and address weaknesses to provide an effective and secure gateway to the benefits system. The council welcomed the inspection as an opportunity to review and improve its benefits services and expressed a commitment to improve the efficiency, security and integrity of its service.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/3">The report identifies a lack of consistency in evidence gathering and verifying claims and details a number of reasons for this including a failure to promote benefits, an inadequate telephone service, a poorly designed claim form, the lack of a benefits visiting team and inadequate training of staff. Improvements are also recommended for the processes for handling renewal claims and reported changes in circumstances to ensure that claims are free from fraud and error. The council's approach to identifying and providing staff training was found to be inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/4">A further area of concern was the classification of overpayments, and the BFI makes recommendations to ensure fraud and error is detected at an early stage to keep overpayments to a minimum. The council was found to have effective systems for investigating fraud and recovering benefit overpayments. Internal and external audit's provision of a robust and effective audit service gives some assurance for the security of the benefits system.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/5">Rother District Council is a good example of an authority responding positively and effectively to weaknesses identified by the BFI and thus providing a more secure and accurate benefits service to its community. The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/6">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.2/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of Southampton City Council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/2">The council has been working with a private company to provide IT solutions and improve its benefits service. Inspectors found that this work was still being implemented at the time of the inspection. It noted that some sound processes were in place but that the overall service being provided had weaknesses. A number of these could be attributed to the backlog of work that arose out of the introduction of new technology despite the council's efforts to plan and manage the change. This backlog was exacerbated by the staff's lack of familiarity with the new IT systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/3">Southampton has been using a variety of claim forms of differing quality but was in the process of designing a single form taking account of the BFI's model claim form.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/4">The report finds that there has been a history of inconsistent standards in the verification of claims for benefit. As a result the council could not provide the necessary assurance that the gateway to the benefit was secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/5">The council makes benefit payments in a number of ways and this is commended in the report, but some weaknesses were found in the security of these payments. In the case of overpayments, the report recognises that the council has a number of good practices for identifying and classifying overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/6">In the case of fraud investigations, it is reported that the council needs to address the organisation and management of its benefits investigation unit if it is to improve the quality of its investigations. Delay in completing investigations and poor quality investigations were identified despite a considerable financial resource spent on training. Better use of the fraud case management system is recommended. At the time of the inspection Southampton was making proposals to restructure the investigation unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/7">Southampton has a number of good practices, such as the way it has managed change. Inspectors were also impressed with its arrangements to train new, and inexperienced staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/8">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/9">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.</p>
