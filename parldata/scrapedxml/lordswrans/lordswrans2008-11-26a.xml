	<p pid="a.292.3/1">There are two main definitions of a small company. First, there is a definition in the Companies Act 2006 that allows for companies that meet the criteria to benefit from simplified accounting requirements. These criteria are derived from the European Union (EU) fourth company law directive. Secondly, the EU has a definition that applies to all Community policies that favour small and medium-sized enterprises. This is the definition used when applying the EU's state aid rules. There are separate rules for the agricultural sector to reflect the specific challenges faced by small firms involved in agricultural production.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.3/2">For both definitions the key criteria used are number of employees, turnover and annual balance sheet. There is no differentiation between business sectors; therefore, farms, horticultural enterprises and smallholdings that meet the necessary criteria would be deemed to be small businesses.</p>

Well-being is defined in the 2004 Act in a way that reflects the five Every Child Matters outcomes including physical and mental health, emotional well-being and protection from harm and neglect.

	<p pid="a.297.3/11">The UK decided to use a two-stage approach to allocate allowances to EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) participants. First, the total number of allowances was allocated to sectors. The sector-level allocations are then further distributed to individual installations within those sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/12">The UK decided that the allocation of allowances to the sectors covered by the EU ETS should be determined as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/13">all sectors other than large electricity producers were allocated allowances equivalent to their projected business-as-usual emissions, taking into account the potential, including technological potential of sectors to reduce their emissions, a deduction for estimated new entry and a contribution to the combined heat and power ring-fence of the new entrant reserve; andthe LEP sector was allocated the remainder of the total of the overall UK cap, taking into account a deduction for the amount of allowances to be auctioned and a contribution to the NER. Thus, the LEP sector will receive a reduced allocation to account for the carbon savings the UK expects the trading sector to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/14">LEP are relatively insulated from international competition and are able to pass the costs of carbon to consumers in the form of higher electricity prices. The sector is therefore able to face a reduction in its allocation without a substantial impact on its competitive position. For this reason, the UK decided that the LEP sector should receive a lower level of free allocation. All others sectors were treated equally in terms of the allocation methodology.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.6/1">These amounts were part of the overall &euro;259 million of aid which the EU is providing to the Turkish Cypriot community, to help bring them closer to Europe and so facilitate a settlement. This money is being used to fund practical projects, developed in partnership with the Turkish Cypriot community, aimed at improving the quality of life of ordinary Turkish Cypriots. As of May 2008, &euro;105 million had been tendered for, &euro;49 million contracted and &euro;12 million spent. While implementation of the regulation has been slower than originally anticipated, the benefits are already being felt. The European Commission is responsible for administering the assistance. A programme team of Commission officials and contract agents was set up in 2006 to implement the programme as part of the Task Force Turkish Cypriot Community within DG Enlargement.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.6/2">Ongoing projects include a successful programme of scholarships for Turkish Cypriot students and teachers to study and teach in EU universities, grant schemes for civil society and targeted support to farmers to upgrade their equipment. Full details are contained in the Commission's most recent annual report on the implementation of the financial aid package. We agree with their conclusion that the current settlement negotiations &quot;will create a positive framework for facilitating the implementation and the success of this aid package&quot; and look forward to rapid implementation of outstanding projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.0/1">The UK co-sponsored UN Security Council resolution 1843, which was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-20">20 November</phrase>, authorised an increase in the UN mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo's (MONUC) force levels of 2,785 military and 300 police. These additional resources were requested by the UN Secretary-General to reinforce MONUC's presence in North Kivu allowing the mission, inter alia, to bolster its capacity to protect civilians; to maintain zones of separation between rebel groups and to increase the mission's mobility. We are pressing to ensure that deployment is as quick as possible. We are working with the UN and international partners to ensure that these additional resources are found and deployed in theatre as soon as possible. Although the UK is not in a position to contribute troops to MONUC given our existing military commitments, we are considering what staff, logistics or other help we can provide to MONUC and to potential troop contributors. We understand that the UN has received expressions of interest from several countries. It is a matter for the UN and the countries in question to announce publicly if they will contribute troops. Clearly it is vital that any troops are capable, correctly equipped and able to deploy quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/2">MONUC now has 95 per cent of its troop strength deployed in the east of the DRC following internal reorganisation of the mission, reinforcing its capacity to protect Goma and other areas of North Kivu until new resources arrive. An EU force is not currently under consideration, although we will keep this under review. We believe that any countries, including individual European countries, willing to contribute troops should deploy to MONUC, which has an existing command structure and logistical support in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.5/1">The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 placed new obligations on political parties and the checking of the eligibility of donors. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 provided the legislative framework for the co-ordinated online record of electors (CORE) system. The objective of CORE is to produce a single, authoritative record of electoral registration data that could be accessed by political parties and the Electoral Commission for the purpose of checking the legality of donations. The system will also supply data to authorised users, and could be used to detect duplicate registrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.5/2">While the detailed specifications of the system are still to be finalised, it is expected that the central record will be updated on a monthly basis by local authorities sending the necessary information to the CORE information system.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.5/3">The CORE system will be maintained by the CORE keeper. Section l(10) of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 provides that &quot;the person designated as a CORE keeper must be a public authority&quot;. The Electoral Commission is the preferred choice to fulfil this role. If the commission is the CORE keeper then funding would be made available through Speaker's Committee. The CORE project has been allocated a total of &pound;11.7 million to implement the CORE service. The annual running costs of the CORE keeper have been estimated at &pound;1.3 million per year, although it will be impossible to provide actual running costs until user requirements have been finalised and costed in detail. Throughout 2008 we have been meeting with our stakeholders, gathering requirements, with a view to publish a high-level statement of requirements by the end of March 2009, with a detailed analysis of costs versus benefits by the summer of 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.0/1">The Energy Saving Trust has two key local authority services for housing: &quot;Practical Help&quot; and the One-to-One support programme. These services provide advice and support through web-based materials, training and consultancies to local authorities. They also provide individual support to review local authority performance on climate change mitigation and implement their action plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/2">Through the local authority carbon management programme, the Carbon Trust provides councils with technical and change management support and guidance to help them realise carbon emissions savings. The primary focus of the work is to reduce emissions under the control of the local authority such as its own estate, vehicle fleets, street lighting and landfill sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/3">With regard to loan schemes, the Carbon Trust offers energy efficiency loans which are designed to reduce carbon emissions by enabling businesses to overcome the capital barrier of purchasing energy-saving equipment. Loans are interest free, provided on an unsecured basis and are typically for &pound;5,000 to &pound;200,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/4">With regard to microgeneration, the Energy Saving Trust (EST) administers the Government's low-carbon buildings programme, which provides grants for microgeneration. EST advice centres also provide advice on microgeneration to household consumers. The Carbon Trust supports market acceleration and directed research into microgeneration technologies, including advanced solar PV (photovoltaic) and micro-CHP (combined heat and power).</p>

	<p pid="a.307.2/1">The Government do not provide subsidies for crops grown for biofuels. However farmers in the UK can claim grant under the EU's energy aid payment scheme for energy crops grown on non-set-aside land with a contract for energy end use. The scheme was oversubscribed at a European level in the 2007 claim year, resulting in a 30 per cent cutback in grant aid. UK farmers received &pound;4.06 million grant aid on around 244,000 ha. The area planted in the UK for the 2008 claim year is just over 56,000 ha: claims when paid will be at &euro;45 per ha, less modulation. The scheme does not differentiate between crops grown for biofuels or the generation of heat and power. As crops grown for biofuels constitute a small proportion of total crop production in the UK, the impact on the poorest consumers and farmers is likely to be negligible.</p>

	<p pid="a.307.5/1">An organisation will qualify for the carbon reduction commitment (CRC) if it has at least one meter settled on the half-hourly market and its total half-hourly metered electricity use was greater than 6,000 megawatt hours (MWh) between <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.5/2">County, district or borough, metropolitan and unitary councils will therefore participate in the CRC where they meet the qualification threshold. Once a local authority has qualified for the CRC it will be subject to the same requirements as all other CRC participants.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.5/3">The CRC is scheduled to begin in April 2010. There will be a three-year introductory phase in which unlimited allowances will be sold at a fixed price of &pound;12 per tonne of carbon dioxide. In the second phase, a fixed number of allowances will be auctioned. There will be no legal requirement for participating organisations to take part in a sale or auction&mdash;an organisation could choose to buy allowances only on the secondary market. Participating local authorities will therefore be required to surrender sufficient allowances to cover their annual emissions and may purchase these through either the annual sale or auction, or on the secondary market. The sale or auction revenue will be recycled to participating local authorities according to their position in the CRC league table.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.2/1">The Government have conducted analysis that indicates that the cost of purchasing allowances will typically be 15 per cent on top of a local authority's energy bill, where the total energy bill is approximately 1 per cent of the total operating costs. However, the Government propose to recycle revenues that accrue from the sale of allowances back to participants, depending on how well they perform in the carbon reduction commitment (CRC) league table.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/2">The Government have modelled various scenarios for local authorities that look at low, medium and high performance in the league table. These indicate that collectively, after year 5, local authorities are expected to make net savings under these scenarios of &pound;2.71 million, &pound;18.48 million and &pound;39.68 million respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/3">The analysis is based on conservative estimates of average 2020 emission reductions of approximately 9 per cent across all CRC participants. The figure for the public administration sector, of which local authorities make up a significant part, is over 12 per cent. This demonstrates that the public administration sector as a whole would do well in the league table and as such it is reasonable to assume a neutral to high case scenario. However, in the worst case scenario of a local authority being at the bottom of the league table in year 1, the maximum cost to the local authority is expected to be no more than 1.5 per cent of its energy bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/4">In addition, in response to feedback from local authorities, the CRC has been aligned to financial year so that both the auction of allowances and recycling of the money collected occur within the same financial year. This change was made to address local authority concerns over cash flow.</p>

	<p pid="a.309.0/1">The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) identified some wide-ranging steps which Governments could take to reduce the degradation of ecosystem services. Many of these are already part of the Government's agenda, consistent with our commitment to sustainable development. For example, the MA recommends removing harmful subsidies and introducing incentive payments for land managers. The UK Government have been among the strongest advocates for reform of the common agricultural policy and we have already made significant progress by breaking the link between subsidy and production.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/2">Internationally, we have helped secure action for follow-up to the MA through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The Government will continue to promote the importance of ecosystem services and the biodiversity that underpins them through relevant multilateral environmental agreements and through our bilateral contacts with other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/3">Nationally, we have also taken steps to embed ecosystems thinking in policy and decision-making, consistent with the MA. Defra's ecosystems approach action plan, published in 2007, sets out a number of key actions to embed an &quot;ecosystems approach&quot; into the protection and enhancement of the natural environment. Essentially, this is about adopting a new way of thinking and working by:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/4">shifting the focus of our policy-making and delivery away from looking at natural environment policies in separate &quot;silos&quot; (e.g. water, air, biodiversity, etc.) towards a more integrated, holistic approach based on whole ecosystems; andseeking to ensure that the value of ecosystem services is fully reflected in policy and decision-making.</p>

	<p pid="a.309.3/1">A number of organisations have investigated the feasibility of generating electricity from the tidal range resource around the UK's coasts, including in the Mersey, Wyre and Thames estuaries. A feasibility study of the Mersey estuary has been conducted by a group including Peel Environmental Ltd, the Northwest Regional Development Agency and the Mersey Basin Campaign. Further information is available at <a href="http://www.merseytidalpower.co.uk">www.merseytidalpower.co.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.3/2">A wider group has also been formed to act as an information exchange forum and to explore the potential for energy extraction from the Irish Sea and its surrounding coastline, including the Wyre estuary, called the Northwest Tidal Energy Group&mdash;for further information see <a href="http://www.nwda.co.uk">www.nwda.co.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.3/3">Regarding the Thames Estuary, the Environment Agency's Thames Estuary 2100 has been tasked with preparing a tidal flood risk management plan through to the end of the century. It considers future flood risk needs and does not have a remit to look at transport links or power generation. Initial findings from the project suggest that under Defra's climate change guidance the Thames Barrier, with some modification, could continue to provide protection to London for most of the century. On the basis of managing flood risk, it is therefore unlikely that a new barrier would be required in the short to medium term. However, we are aware of a business consortium, Metrotidal Ltd, which has announced proposals for a tunnel crossing between Medway and Canvey Island, which would include a surge-tide barrier, tidal power plant, and orbital rail and road links.</p>

	<p pid="a.311.6/1">The Government are carrying out a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) on a draft plan for up to an additional 25 GW of offshore wind generation. It is expected that the SEA will be completed in early 2009. 25 GW of installed offshore wind capacity would generate electricity equivalent to that used by 19 million UK households. This assumes an average load factor of 40 per cent for future commercial scale offshore wind farms and is based on the average UK household electricity consumption of 4,600 kWh in 2007. However, it should be noted that the characteristics of tidal and offshore wind technologies and their role in the energy supply are very different and so cannot be easily compared.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.2/1">We have serious concerns about the Israeli restrictions on Gaza and the impact they have on the lives of Gazans. Although there is no permanent physical Israeli presence in Gaza, given the significant control that Israel has over Gaza's borders, airspace and territorial waters, Israel retains obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as an occupying power. The Fourth Geneva Convention is clear that an occupying power must co-operate in allowing the passage and distribution of relief consignments. The restrictions currently imposed on the passage of relief supplies are, as we see it, a disproportionate response to the security threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.2/2">The extent of Israeli restrictions, and the threat to Israel from militants in Gaza, varies constantly. Rather than focus on whether the restrictions at any given time amount to collective punishment, we have consistently pressed the Israeli Government to comply with their obligations under international law and allow passage of relief supplies. This was the message my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary delivered in his meetings with Israeli leaders during his recent visit to the region.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.0/1">The Government launched their new strategy <I>Manufacturing: New Challenges, New Opportunities</I> last month. It builds on established and successful support delivered by the Technology Strategy Board, the sector skills councils and the Manufacturing Advisory Service and brings together almost &pound;150 million of new support for UK manufacturing, providing a powerful vision for UK manufacturing in the global economy. The strategy focuses on what the sector needs for success in the long term, including seizing the opportunities of the low-carbon economy, supporting skills, realising overseas opportunities, and improving the perception and understanding of manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/2">In addition, we have taken action to help businesses with cash flow, with central government moving to pay all bills within 10 days at the latest. UK banks using the recapitalisation scheme have made an explicit commitment as part of their agreement with the Government that they will maintain, over the next three years, the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to small businesses and home owners at 2007 levels. We will help businesses improve cash flow by identifying cost savings through simple measures to use energy more efficiently. Both the Government and the banks have agreed to more than double the funding for the Business Debtline Service by 2010-11. Government schemes for access to finance such as the small firms loan guarantee (SFLG) have been strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/3">We are providing more help for businesses through advice services such as Business Link, which will provide free &quot;health checks&quot; in England for businesses to identify problems early. We have prioritised training for SMEs in England under the Train to Gain initiative to ensure employees have the skills and business knowledge they need. Finally, the regional development agencies (RDAs) are providing additional help for businesses which includes extending the availability of Selective Finance for Investment in England (SFIE) grants in some regions.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.5/1">The Equality and Human Rights Commission has continued to pursue concerns about the National Probation Service which were originally raised by one of its predecessor bodies, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE). These concerned assurances in spring 2007, following a central review originally agreed with the CRE, that all 42 probation boards were compliant with the statutory duty to promote race equality schemes. The CRE's small dip sample in summer 2007 threw doubt on this, as did a larger dip sample conducted by the EHRC after it had assumed responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.5/2">Therefore, the EHRC earlier this year engaged with the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) stressing its advice that statutory equality duties placed upon the Ministry of Justice included action to secure compliant practice by probation boards and trusts. In response the NOMS has this month set out its programme of guidance and training designed to secure equality schemes which comply with all the equality duties by the end of March 2009. The aim is that that practice based on sound equality schemes will prevent and combat institutional and other discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.5/3">In the past year, the EHRC has received five individual complaints against probation services concerning alleged discrimination on grounds of age, race and disability. The appropriate advice and guidance was provided in each case. Furthermore, the EHRC has said it will discuss with the NOMS its role in relation to probation boards and trusts after it received allegations of non-delivery of the race equality duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.5/4">The commission currently has no plans to undertake any formal investigations into the National Probation Services.</p>

	<p pid="a.326.5/1">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) defines a black, Asian and minority-ethnic (BAME) business as being 51 per cent BAME-owned. Information about ethnic ownership of businesses is provided to the ODA by its contractors through self-evaluation. Contractors are not obliged to provide this information to the ODA. The ODA has worked with over 700 suppliers to date; 44 per cent of these have provided information about their ethnic ownership. Of these, 17 (5 per cent) are BAME-owned. These businesses have been awarded contracts in media, marketing, retail, and communication.</p>

It has an active programme of targeted business outreach which aims to increase the number of BAME-owned businesses engaged in its supply chains. For example, the ODA, partnered with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, held an event for diverse-owned businesses in September. It has also held engagement events for businesses within the Olympic host boroughs, as well as other London boroughs and other parts of the UK with a significant minority presence, including Bristol.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.5/4">The ODA is also working with the regional development agencies and devolved Administrations to direct businesses to appropriate support services to ensure that, especially, small and medium-sized businesses, and those with diverse ownership, are equipped to compete for and win contracts in the London 2012 supply chains.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.6/1">The EU's general approach for free trade agreements with low-income developing countries is to pursue them on a regional basis, as opposed to bilaterally. This was set out in the European Commission's 2006 paper, <I>Global Europe: Competing in the World</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.6/2">In the case of the Community of Andean Nations there have been some difficulties with the regional approach. These have arisen because the members of the CAN have struggled to reach a common position on the trade pillar with the European Union. Colombia and Peru have expressed a desire for those CAN countries that are ready to undertake negotiations to embark on a bilateral, fast-track approach. The European Commission has so far indicated that while it regrets the inability of CAN to find a common position, it is open-minded to this suggestion. The European Commission has stressed that next steps will be dependent on the will of EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.6/3">The UK's response to the suggestion of fast-track negotiations with Colombia and Peru is that this request should be considered seriously. Although there are benefits to the overall regional approach, it is also important that countries that are ready to proceed with a free trade agreement are not unduly penalised because the CAN as a whole is not ready to proceed. However, if a fast-track approach is followed, it is important for the UK that it is open to all members of CAN, either now or in the future, and that any solution is the result of mutually agreed arrangement.</p>

	<p pid="a.333.0/1">A prisoner may be eligible to claim compensation for any perceived wrongdoing that they suffer while detained in prison, such as an injury sustained during an accident. Each litigation case is dealt with on its merits and, so far as the evidence allows, all claims are robustly defended. The amount of compensation is determined following a full analysis of all the available evidence and taking account of the Judicial Studies Board guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.333.0/2">Given that the claim and any subsequent compensation is a separate incident from the original crime, it does not provide grounds for the victims of the original crime to be informed of the claim. In some circumstances, a victim may be eligible for legal aid to pursue action seeking recompense from offenders who subsequently acquire assets. Deductions are not made from prisoners' compensation to offset the costs of imprisonment.</p>

This includes essential work producing a variety of goods for internal consumption and providing in-house services such as catering, cleaning and laundries.

	<p pid="a.341.2/1">In general, we expect host families who volunteer to provide accommodation for pupils involved in visits organised by schools to undergo enhanced CRB checks. This is in line with guidance to schools in respect of volunteers involved in activities requiring an overnight stay, as set out in paragraph 4.56 of <I>Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education. </I>However, if an adult who is travelling with the pupil, and who is responsible for providing care for the pupil during the school trip, stays with the pupil in the host family home overnight, in such circumstances we do not consider it necessary for the host family to undergo enhanced CRB checks. In addition, we recommend that host families are given basic awareness of child protection issues and the contact details of the designated senior person within the school with responsibility for safeguarding issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.341.2/2">The new vetting and barring scheme will mean that from October 2009 those who provide care and accommodation for children under 18 for reward or in pursuance of an arrangement made by someone other than a member of the child's family will be engaged in regulated activity. This includes host family arrangements for fewer than 28 days made by schools or other organisations, including those who are providing tuition in languages or other subjects. It will be a criminal offence for a barred individual to engage in this activity and the person organising the host family placement will be required to check that the person providing the care and accommodation is registered with the new Independent Safeguarding Authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.346.2/1">The decision to reduce budgets in 2008-09 partly reflected the department's wider budgetary pressures but also the decision to be more selective in the activities that we fund. This is because we believe that the business community now increasingly understands the case for taking action to improve environmental performance. Hence we are now focusing on developing the evidence needed to catalyse change among businesses, rather than supporting profit-making business beyond that point. This is something on which Envirowise has a good track record and continues to be well placed to contribute.</p>

	<p pid="a.346.5/1">All ring-fences were re-examined in the Comprehensive Spending Review and most, including the link between landfill tax and business resource efficiency expenditure, were removed. This is in line with the Government's approach to ensuring value for money from their expenditure by providing maximum flexibility and scope to prioritise. We do not plan to reinstate a ring-fence around landfill tax revenue.</p>
