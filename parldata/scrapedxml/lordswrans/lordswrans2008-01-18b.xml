Discussions will take place with police forces and authorities on how best to ensure that they contribute to supporting them and to delivering improvements in protective services in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.3/3">This additional funding also includes &pound;2 million to complete the Home Office's protective services demonstrator programme to test out new initiatives for improving protective service delivery through collaboration.

The change in the pattern of the west London line service from December 2008 does not necessarily preclude the possibility, as proposed in the south London route utilisation strategy, that there might be a &quot;cross-Clapham&quot; service from south London to Kensington Olympia or, in due course, to Shepherd's Bush.</p>
