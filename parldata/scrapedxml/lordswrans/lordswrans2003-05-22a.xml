	<p pid="a.96.0/1">In the case of underspends in areas where automatic end year flexibility (EYF) arrangements apply, the unspent resources are retained by the relevant department for use in the same area in the following financial year. Any residual underspend falls to be surrendered for central reallocation, together with other available resources, in the following financial year (usually in the first monitoring round for the year). It is therefore not possible to separately identify what any residual underspend in any year was spent on. The attached table summarises the position for 2001&ndash;02. The position for 2002&ndash;03 has not yet been determined.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.5/2">The UK regards the NPT a key component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Her Majesty's Government's policy reflects widespread agreement that: the non-nuclear weapon states undertook not to acquire nuclear weapons and to put their civil programmes under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards; the five nuclear weapon states would pursue disarmament negotiations and facilitate the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology under safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/3">The BWC and the CWC are the legal foundation of the international regime which prohibits the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer and use of chemical and biological weapons. We continue to urge universal accession to both conventions. In the CWC context the UK took a leading role at the convention's First Review Conference (<phrase class="date" code="">28 April</phrase>&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-09">9 May 2003</phrase>), tabling 10 papers. The UK was instrumental in ensuring a successful outcome to the Fifth Review Conference of the BWC in November 2002, which reached agreement on a work programme for the next three years.

This process is currently under way. We also acknowledged that there would be a further need for Reservists. A requirement for a further 1,500 Reservists has now been confirmed.

To date, we have demobilised around 1,100 Reservists who have completed their required tasks.

	<p pid="a.101.5/3">There will be a continuing role for our Reserve forces in Iraq, but we expect overall numbers of Reservists required to reduce over time. This further call-out demonstrates our continuing commitment to Iraq and to the Iraqi people. In addition, we continue to plan in detail the withdrawal of forces that have completed their operational tour, and the deployment of further replacement forces to continue to fulfil our responsibilities in Iraq. We will inform the House as soon as these plans become firm. We remain determined to help the Iraqis to set the conditions for Iraq's re-emergence as a country that is both politically secure and economically stable.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.5/1">The Heavens report, a copy of which is in the Library, found no evidence that the deaths could be linked to Irish backgrounds but made recommendations covering such issues as suicide prevention procedures and support for Irish prisoners. The Director General of the Prison Service has accepted all the recommendations of the report, and these are being taken forward by the area manager for London prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/2">Significant numbers of lives have been saved in recent years as a result of the prompt actions of staff. The number of prisoners resuscitated following self-harm incidents totalled 130 in 2000; 147 in 2001, 155 in 2002 and 28 so far in 2003 (up to <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase>). Emerging research findings, including interviews with prisoners who have tried to kill themselves but who subsequently failed, indicate that the strongest predictors of psychological distress concern entry to prison and perceived safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/3">As I said in my reply on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-22">22 January 2003</phrase>, (Official Report, WA 92) the Prison Service is in the second year of a three-year programme to develop new suicide prevention and self-harm reduction policies. This involves targeting work where the risks are highest, particularly during the crucial early period of custody, and developing integrated policies with the agencies with which prisoners may be in contact before, during and after custody. Much of the programme is currently in the pilot stage, and decisions about future strategy and resource allocation will be taken during 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/4">The Prison Service's developing policies, which include the direct involvement of prisoners themselves and a continuing strong partnership with Samaritans and the voluntary sector generally, are integrated with the health agenda and the Government's strategy for reducing suicide in the community. Much of the current work is based on re-emphasising the importance of time to talk and be listened to, specialist help, activities, contact with families, and support from other prisoners. The Prison Service is re-examining how to get the best balance between targeting risk and doing more for all prisoners.</p>

Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests. The herds (and individual animals within the herds) would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the numbers of reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.2/1">The United Kingdom and other European Union member states are required, under the terms of the recently agreed Directive on the Promotion of Biofuels and other Renewable Fuels for Road Transport, to set their own indicative targets for the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels in their areas. Member states are required to set indicative targets to be met in the years 2005 and 2010, and to notify the European Commission of these targets by July 2005 and July 2006 respectively. The Government will consult key stakeholders in due course on possible indicative targets for biofuels sales and sales of other renewable fuels in the UK, as well as on the most appropriate ways of meeting these targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">The Government have already put in place a number of measures to incentivise the production and use of biofuels in the UK. These include a 20 pence per litre fuel duty incentive for biodiesel, which came into effect in July 2002. Sales of biodiesel have increased significantly as a result of this, with some 700,000 litres sold in the month of April 2003. Budget 2003 announced that a similar duty incentive in favour of bioethanol would come into effect in January 2005. It also indicated that the Government are considering how best to give further support to bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic feedstocks, which potentially offers even greater environmental benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.5/1">Studies show that the level of carbon savings from biofuels depends on factors such as the type of biomass feedstock, agricultural management and the processing method. A range of 40&ndash;60 per cent life cycle carbon savings is assumed to be realistic for the UK. Using this range gives an estimate of 0.3&ndash;0.45 megatonnes of carbon (MtC) and 0.9&ndash;1.3 MtC savings for the 2 and 5.75 per cent targets respectively. The cost figures, based on the European Commission's estimates of cost, put the cost of carbon saving at &pound;280&ndash;&pound;700 per tonne.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/2">The final text of the recently agreed Biofuels Directive includes 2 per cent and 5.75 per cent as reference targets for the proportion of sales which should be biofuels by 2005 and 2010 respectively. The expected carbon savings and cost per tonne saved from the introduction of biofuels at these rates have been set out in the preliminary regulatory impact assessment (RIA).
