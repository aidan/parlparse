For stages of the journey where the contractor finds that the risks are uninsurable, the financial loss would be recovered from the contingency fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.3/1">The UK supports the EU's view that to avoid potentially dangerous climate change, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced globally by more than 50 per cent by 2050 in order to limit the rise in global average temperature to 2<sup>&deg;</sup>C. Some climate change is nevertheless unavoidable, partly due to previous emissions, and so adaptation will also be needed to address this. These two responses to climate change are complementary and are widely accepted as necessary by the scientific community as indicated, for example, in the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/2">Geo-engineering projects, in which the climate system would be manipulated to counter warming from greenhouse gases, have been proposed as alternative responses to climate change. However, such approaches are rather speculative and unproven. They may not achieve what they intend and would not tackle the causes of climate change. They may also carry significant environmental risks and suffer from disadvantages such as high cost, limited practicality, unproven technologies and lack of political acceptability. Geo-engineering approaches are thus not seen at present as a viable alternative to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is important, however, to keep such options under review as some might ultimately have a role to play in helping to ameliorate climate change, particularly if emissions reductions are not achieved quickly enough or climate change turns out to be worse than projected.</p>

	<p pid="a.272.3/1">English Heritage advises that it is not possible to provide expenditure figures broken down by county, only by region. Approximately half of its expenditure is allocated directly to its regions and the following table sets out its East of England spend per capita for the years in question. The figures do not include centrally managed expenditure although a considerable proportion delivers activity in the regions, for example, education, outreach, the property investment programme and some grants programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.3/2">The proportion of English Heritage's centrally managed expenditure allocated to the East of England region cannot be established without disproportionate cost.

	<p pid="a.274.8/1">Trade matters are within the competence of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and outside that of the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW), the parent treaty of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The UK Government firmly support the CITES ban on the international trade in whale meat and whale products.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.8/2">We are increasingly concerned about the trade in whale products between countries holding reservations to the CITES appendix I listing, or to countries which have not joined CITES. To eliminate the unacceptable risk of market-driven whaling in the future, we believe that contracting Governments to the IWC should lift all CITES reservations to cetacean species in order to aid negotiations on the future of the IWC.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.2/1">Liverpool's role as European Capital of Culture 2008 not only attracted unprecedented investment in the region, but also helped to raise the profile of culture across Merseyside. Liverpool 08 brought more than &pound;800 million in revenue to the region, on top of the &pound;4 billion that has been invested since 2000, and which has resulted in a number of exciting capital projects, including Liverpool One, the Echo Arena and the Cruise Liner Terminal. These new developments will ensure a lasting economic legacy for Merseyside, both in terms of increased visitor numbers across the region, and also the impact on jobs and skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/2">A key success of Liverpool 08 was the relationships which were forged between cultural organisations and between the city of Liverpool and the rest of the Merseyside region, including Sefton, Wirral, St Helens, Knowsley and Halton. Much of this work will continue, including Halton's Got Talent, Theatre in the Parks and the joint Merseyside projects, Open Art, Streetwaves, Let the People Sing, etc. Furthermore, the new Culture Collective created by Phil Redmond will be working to embed cultural legacy across Merseyside, in particular by continuing the excellent co-operation between the city of Liverpool and the rest of the region, which was so instrumental in the success of Liverpool 08.</p>
