	<p pid="a.111.2/1">The Detention Centre Rules 2001 require the appointment of a religious affairs manager at every Immigration Service detention centre, whose task it will be to ensure that arrangements are made to provide for the various religious needs of those in detention, including access to appropriate ministers of religion. In addition, where the Secretary of State considers that the number of persons of a particular religion in a detention centre is such as to require the appointment to the centre of a minister of that religion, he may appoint such a minister. Separately, we have set up a Religious Affairs Advisory Group comprised of representatives of the main religions likely to be found in detention centres. This group will be available to offer advice on religious affairs issues within detention centres, including guidance on appropriate religious bodies or organisations to approach in connection with the appointment of ministers of religion.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">There is currently no specific offence of trafficking in human beings but there are legislative provisions which may be used to prosecute those involved in trafficking into the United Kingdom for the purposes of prostitution. Setting the Boundaries, the report of a review of sexual offences, recommends that a specific offence of trafficking in human beings for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation should be created. The responses to consultation on that review's recommendations are currently being analysed.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/2">Existing legislation deals with many of the individual elements which constitute trafficking. In bringing any criminal prosecution, the evidential contribution of witnesses is crucial and this Government are keen to ensure that a safe environment exists in which potential witnesses can feel confident to come forward and give evidence against traffickers. There is no automatic right to temporary or permanent residence for those witnesses whose presence in the United Kingdom is unlawful. The Immigration Act 1971 (as amended), however, makes provision for the Secretary of State to exercise his discretion in appropriate circumstances to grant exceptional leave to enter or remain outside the normal provisions of the Immigration Rules. If the Police and/or Crown Prosecution Service identify a potential witness whose presence at court they wish to secure and who would otherwise fall to be removed from the United Kingdom, an application is made to the Secretary of State to consider whether to exercise his discretion to treat them outside the Immigration Rules in order to allow them to remain during the course of judicial proceedings. Each application is considered individually on its merits.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/3">We are also considering what needs to be done to create the circumstances in which a non-governmental organisation could be formed which would provide support and advice to the victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>

However, it is widely believed that the actual number of Palestinian refugees remaining in Lebanon is considerably lower than the official figures and that the actual figure is around 150,000 to 200,000. The UK has contributed &pound;10 million to UNRWA's General Fund for 2001. In June, we agreed to provide a further &pound;5 million, of which &pound;3 million was to support the General Fund budget deficit and &pound;2 million for the UNRWA emergency appeal. This brings the UK's total contribution to the emergency appeals to &pound;10 million since November 2000.</p>

A permanent solution to their plight can only be achieved as part of an agreement on final status. We continue to encourage and support the parties in their search for a negotiated agreement. Though this at present seems a remote prospect, there is no alternative vision that can provide lasting security, peace with justice and prosperity for all peoples in the region. In this process it is primarily for the Palestinian negotiators to take due account of the refugees themselves in Lebanon and elsewhere.

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">We have a good record on the safety and security of our nuclear weapons and continue to place the highest importance on work in this area. We have today placed in the Library of both Houses a table which sets out the circumstances of each of the seven accidents concerned. The information it contains is drawn from records spanning a period of 40 years and confirms that there has never been a weapons accident resulting in the release of radioactive material; there has never been damage to a weapon which risked a radioactive leak or an explosion; there has never been a nuclear weapon lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">In addition to the three road traffic accidents referred to in the table, our research has identified one other, similar, event which took place in 1960 in Lincolnshire. There was no damage to the weapon involved. Since this event pre-dates the current reporting system it is unclear whether, in today's terms, it would be categorised as an accident.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/3">The Government remain committed to greater openness on nuclear issues wherever possible. A key responsibility, however, must be to protect the safety and operational security of our nuclear forces and the people who support them. The practice of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons at any particular place and at any particular time will therefore continue to be a cornerstone of the Government's policy on nuclear weapons issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.5/1">It is not our policy to promote specific languages, although French and German remain the most popular subjects for study in secondary schools. All pupils in England have a statutory entitlement to learn at least one foreign language from the age of 11. The national curriculum requires schools to offer at least one of the working languages of the European Union, which, of course, include French and German.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/2">We do not have a statutory curriculum for modern foreign languages at primary age but primary schools can offer languages as a voluntary option and French is the most popular choice. We are already doing a great deal to support language teaching in primary schools. The national curriculum contains guidance for teaching seven to 11 year olds, and we have published a scheme of work for primary French and further materials for primary German and Spanish. We recently announced further funding of over &pound;200,000 for Early Language Learning initiative, through which we are piloting approaches to extend language teaching in primary schools, gathering good practice and developing classroom materials. We will be building on existing links between primary schools and specialist language colleges. The increasing number of specialist colleges and the developing focus on their roles as hubs of excellence will enhance opportunities for primary schools to access language expertise.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.2/1">Remploy is planning to move its operations to a new site on the Fallbank industrial estate later this year. This is within two miles of their existing location, with good public transport and road links and provides an opportunity to ensure Remploy continues in Barnsely with more modern premises and prospects for increased workloading. The new site forms part of the Remploy modernisation strategy and will increase opportunities for the training and development of more disabled people in Barnsley. This approach is entirely in line with the Government's new Workstep programme which seeks to provide more opportunities for disabled people in the labour market.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.2/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health is publishing today the annual report for 1999-2000, and copies are being placed in the Library. The report covers research and development work carried out by (or on behalf of) government departments in relation to equipment that might increase the range of activities and independence or well-being of disabled people and in particular such equipment as might improve their indoor and outdoor mobility.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">The current report places such research in the context of the NHS Plan and outlines the role of assistive technology in making independent living easier for older people and people with disabilities. The report describes the wide range of government funded projects supporting the development, introduction and evaluation of assistive technology. Relevant projects funded by the European Union are also listed.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.0/1">The Government have today published a new Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 25 Development and flood risk which advises on the consideration that needs to be given to flood dangers when determining planning applications for housing and other developments. It emphasises the lead role of the Environment Agency in providing advice on flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/2">The Government recognise, however, that there will be occasions when other planning considerations in favour of development proceeding will outweigh objections from the agency on flood risk grounds. In such cases, PPG 25 makes clear that the provision and future maintenance of any flood defences or other mitigation measures required because of the development should be fully funded by the developer.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/3">The Government will monitor closely the impact and effectiveness of PPG 25 through national land use change statistics and the high level targets published by the then Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1999. These require the agency to report annually on planning applications on which it has been consulted and whether decisions by local planning authorities or on appeal were in line with or contrary to its advice on flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/4">In the light of this the Government will consider further whether there is need to introduce a flooding direction under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. This could require local planning authorities to refer to the Secretary of State applications they are minded to permit contrary to advice from the Environment Agency on flood risk.</p>

The programme is constrained by the need to use courtyards as Summer Recess working areas for other projects and by available budgets.</p>
