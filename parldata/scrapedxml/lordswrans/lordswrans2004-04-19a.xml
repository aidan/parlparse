	<p pid="a.8.5/1">The yellow card scheme is the United Kingdom system for collecting and monitoring information on suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The scheme is run by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on behalf of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The scheme relies upon voluntary reporting of suspected ADRs by health professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.5/2">The yellow card was introduced in 1964 after the thalidomide tragedy highlighted the urgent need for routine post-marketing surveillance of medicines. Since then almost 500,000 reports of suspected ADRs have been submitted to the CSM/MHRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.5/3">The following table contains the total number of suspected ADR reports received via the yellow card scheme from 1997 to 2003 inclusive.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.8.5/6"> <td>Year</td> <td>Total No. Reports</td> </tr>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.8.5/16">It is important to note that a report of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.5/17">Levels of reporting are affected by media interest in a particular drug or reaction. Additionally, in situations where large numbers of people are exposed to a new drug, high levels of reporting for the drug in question may have a large impact on the overall numbers of yellow cards received.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.5/18">The yellow card scheme primarily acts as an early warning system for the identification of previously unrecognised adverse reactions and also provides valuable information on recognised ADRs, allowing the CSM and MHRA to identify and refine the understanding of risk factors that may affect the clinical management of patients. The value of the scheme has been demonstrated identification of numerous important safety issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.5/19">In evaluating a possible drug safety issue, yellow card data are considered in conjunction with relevant information from other sources such as clinical trial data, published studies and the medical literature. When necessary, the MHRA, on the advice of CSM, may take regulatory action to ensure that medicine is used in a way which minimises risk and maximises benefits to the patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.5/20">Reports are submitted by healthcare professionals and it is good practice, where possible, for the contents of the report to be discussed with the patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.5/21">A review of access to data generated by the scheme is due to report later this year. The report of the review will also consider how the scheme might be strengthened and will consider the reporting of suspected ADRs directly from patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.0/1">Research indicates that excessive drinking during pregnancy may affect the brain of the developing foetus. The Government therefore recommend that women who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should not drink more than one to two units of alcohol per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/2">However, any effect that excessive drinking in pregnancy may have on the later development of the child is less clear. It is difficult to assess the relative impact of excessive maternal drinking and other factors such as maternal socio-economic status, maternal age at the birth and maternal nutrition during pregnancy.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.5/1">This question cannot be answered directly. However, an approximate answer can be given using data on social fund funeral payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.5/2">In 2002&ndash;03, someone was entitled to a funeral payment if he or she had good reason for organising a funeral and was in receipt of income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, council tax benefit, working families' tax credit or disabled person's tax credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.5/4">For a stillborn baby, any funeral is often free of charge. However, if charges are made or moneys have been spent on flowers, obituary notices, etc, then a funeral payment can be claimed and considered for payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.5/5">In calendar year 2002, in Great Britain, there were 5,064 deaths of children under the age of 16, excluding stillborn babies. Of those children who died under the age of 16, 67 per cent were aged under one.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.5/6">Of those under the age of 16 who die each year the proportion who are members of families where a funeral payment is claimed and the claimant is eligible is therefore approximately 32 per cent. Sources:</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">The Government recognise the important role played by sub-post offices in local communities, particularly in rural areas and for the elderly and less mobile. Since November 2000 there has been a formal requirement on Post Office Ltd to maintain the rural network and prevent avoidable closures. This applies until 2006 in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">In developing its urban reinvention programme post office closure proposals, Post Office Ltd undertakes a detailed assessment of the accessibility (including for the elderly and disabled) of alternative offices identified as the main receiving branches. This assessment includes the nature of the terrain between the branches, the distance of the journey on foot, including how busy the roads are and whether/where there are pedestrian crossings, traffic lights or underpasses where these need to be crossed. Access by public transport, predominately by bus, is checked giving route numbers and distance of stops from the closing and receiving branches. Availability of parking is also checked. At the end of this programme, at least 95 per cent of the urban population nationally will still live within one mile of a post office and the majority within half a mile.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/1">The Government believe that the Lisbon strategy needs to incorporate action across a wide range of European Union policy areas if it is to be effective. The Government set out their approach in the progress report Advancing long term prosperity: economic reform in an enlarged Europe (February 2004).</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/2">The recent spring European Council reflected this, with conclusions including support for the four presidency initiative on regulatory reform, implementation of the findings of the Kok review of European labour markets, and action to improve the single market for services. The Government are pursuing:</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/3" class="indent">reform of the structural and cohesion funds so that member states can pursue effective policies for regional growth and developing human capital within a framework which has sufficient flexibility to meet their differing needs as set out in the Government's consultation document A modern regional policy for the United Kingdom (March 2003) and confirmed in the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry's Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-17">17 September 2003</phrase>; and</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/4" class="indent">an approach to competition and industrial policy founded on flexible, dynamic markets. This includes effective control of economically unjustified state aid, strong competition policy including proactive investigation of markets and sectors, and reforms to the EU regulatory framework to promote flexibility and growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/5">The Government published a discussion paper on the stability and growth pact (SGP) alongside the Budget. As the Chancellor said in his Budget Statement, the discussion paper compares the UK framework with the rules of the European Union's SGP and examines the principles, based on UK experience, which should guide the evolution of fiscal policy.</p>
