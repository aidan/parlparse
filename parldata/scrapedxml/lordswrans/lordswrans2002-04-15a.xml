A proposal to put forward a Bill to revise present legislation relating to archives and to the management of records is a possible outcome but it is too early to say whether this will happen or what the objectives of such a Bill might be.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.6/1">We welcome the agreements brokered by the Indonesian Government between the warring factions in Maluku and Sulawesi to end the fighting.

	<p pid="a.136.6/2">The UK, with our EU partners, has urged the Indonesian Government to build on this early, fragile peace and to implement in full its security and law enforcement obligations under the terms of the peace agreements. The Department for International Development (DfID) has pledged more than &pound;4 million to help to establish the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Conflict Prevention and Recovery Unit in Jakarta. We are also awaiting a report from the recent European Union Rapid Reaction Team visit to both provinces which should also allow us to consider the scope for further practical assistance.</p>

Additionally, we draw on a large international presence already active in the provinces such as the permanently stationed UN resource centre in Maluku. However, we do not currently feel that international monitors would be broadly acceptable in Maluku or Sulawesi.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">Prisoners in the healthcare centre at Wandsworth who are suffering from mental illness are normally held in the psychiatric ward away from those patients who have only physical illnesses. However, against the background of a rapid rise in the prison population, it is sometimes necessary, because of the pressure on psychiatric bed spaces, temporarily to locate mentally disordered patients on another ward.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">There are currently 18 nursing vacancies at Wandsworth. The prison has advertised to fill those vacancies on several occasions, most recently in March 2002. In the mean time, nursing cover is being provided by existing staff on overtime, and bank and agency nurses. Eleven of the nursing complement at the establishment are mental health nurses and an additional 16 mental health nurses are available from the nursing bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">Notwithstanding these staffing vacancies, the quality of care being provided to prisoners at Wandsworth remains of a good standard and they are receiving appropriate treatment. Wandsworth is one of 22 establishments in which NHS-funded mental health in-reach services are being developed during 2001&ndash;02 to meet commitments in the NHS Plan (2000) aimed at improving mental health services for prisoners. A multi-disciplinary team offers a range of services to prisoners similar to those available from NHS community mental health teams. The regime for prisoners in the healthcare centre is supported by a daycare centre, occupational therapy and education sessions.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.2/1">The Government are in the process of contracting out the management arrangements for Apsley House and the running of the Wellington Museum. The contracting-out order was approved by both Houses of Parliament in February this year. Under this proposal the Wellington Museum will not be classified as a national museum and will therefore not be required to follow the full range of free access policies. It will be for the new management team to decide on its charging policy for adults. However, it will remain a condition that entrance for children remains free under the new management.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.5/1">The Towers Perrin scoping report was commissioned by the five existing regulators due to be replaced by Ofcom. It was intended as an initial study of the work that needed to be done in preparing for Ofcom, based on an assessment of the White Paper, and was in no sense a blueprint for the new organisation. There is wide agreement that Ofcom needs to be more than a rearrangement of the current five regulators if it is to succeed. But decisions on Ofcom's structure and other management issues will be matters for the new board to be appointed under the completion of the Office of Communications Act.</p>
