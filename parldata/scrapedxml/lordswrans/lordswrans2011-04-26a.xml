	<p pid="a.6.5/1">Ever since the first proposals for the use of depleted uranium (DU) in anti-armour munitions, the Ministry of Defence has maintained a watching brief on related worldwide research activities. This includes research by the European Commission and independent agencies such as the Royal Society, National Academy of Sciences, United Nations Environment Programme, World Health Organisation and International Atomic Energy Agency. There has also been research into topics of direct relevance to the UK; the most significant involve personnel and battlefield monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/2">No DU was detected in the vast majority (more than 99.5 per cent) of the almost 1,000 UK veterans tested by the analysis of urine samples. Some DU was present in a very small number of veterans injured when their vehicles were struck by DU munitions, but the exposures were at levels at which no adverse health effects are expected. No widespread contamination sufficient to impact on the health of the general population or deployed personnel was found in Ministry of Defence environmental surveys in southern Iraq and the Balkans.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/3">The UK position remains that DU is weakly radioactive and has similar levels of chemical toxicity to lead. Measures to prevent or reduce intakes may sometimes be justified after DU munitions are fired, but the scientific consensus is that this will occur only in a very small number of very extreme cases. This is consistent with the findings of the agencies mentioned above and with the recent World Health Organisation statement that, &quot;For the general population, neither civilian nor military use of DU is likely to produce radiation doses significantly above normal background levels&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/4">DU has not been shown to present the health and environmental risks suggested in some quarters.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/5">The 120 mm anti-tank round (Charm 3), fired by the Army's Challenger main battle tank, is the only in-service DU munition. I am withholding information relating to munition stock levels; its disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/6">The Government's policy remains that DU can be used within weapons; it is not prohibited under current or likely future international agreements. UK Armed Forces use DU munitions in accordance with international humanitarian law. It would be quite wrong to deny our serving personnel a legitimate and effective capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/2">In addition, it is recognised that high threat explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operatives, by the nature of their work and the tempo of operations in Afghanistan, are at an increased risk of exposure to significantly stressful situations while on operations. EOD teams are rotated through Camp Bastion on a routine basis to afford them a respite from continuous exposure to these high stress levels, and have ready access to a mental health professional within the camp.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/3">In 2010, the Defence Medical Services undertook an Operational Mental Health Needs Evaluation (OMHNE) that looked specifically at EOD personnel, and which found a slight, but significant, increase in mental health symptoms among them. This survey, together with evidence from the chain of command, is being used to refine the current decompression package towards the specific needs of EOD teams. A further OMHNE in July 2011, surveying a range of UK personnel deployed in Afghanistan, will include further specific sampling of EOD operatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/2">My right honourable friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell made a Written Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-25">25 January 2011</phrase> which set out that the reassessment process had started on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-11">11 October 2010</phrase> with a trial which was restricted to cases in the Aberdeen and Burnley areas.

All claimants will be moved onto employment and support allowance, other benefits more appropriate to their circumstances, or off benefit. We have been very clear that the department does not have a target for the number of people who must be found fit for work during the reassessment. We have also been clear that our objectives are to get people on to the right benefits at the right time, and to ensure that they get the support they need to help them return to work, while providing unconditional support to those with the most severe health conditions or disabilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.0/2">The Government have considered all four texts carefully. Whilst we support the purpose behind the Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay and Mexico text, we believe that it contains elements that go beyond existing international agreements on copyright such as the Berne Convention. There is a need to strike the right balance between improving access and protecting the rights of authors and publishers. These concerns were raised at the last meeting of the relevant WIPO committee in November when member states discussed all four texts and agreed a work plan for further discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/3">Informal work is under way on a possible alternative, bringing together the elements of all four texts.

This supported around 80,000 children who were in care for some or all of that year. This would equate to an average expenditure of &#163;36,000 per child. However, the cost will vary considerably between individual children. For example, the University of Kent, which was commissioned by the Department of Health and the Department for Education to produce <I>Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010</I> (available at <a href="http://www.pssru">www.pssru</a>. ac.uk/uc/uc20lOcontents.htm), has calculated that it cost local authorities &#163;2,494 a week for a placement of a child at a residential children's home and &#163;676 a week for a foster placement.

Street children are among the most marginalised and vulnerable in the world. A global event will help draw attention to the particular needs of street children, and contribute to the debate about how best to address these needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) is committed to reducing poverty among children. We know that poverty is the root cause for many children living or working on the streets. Generating international attention that focuses on why children are forced to live and work on the streets is essential to addressing the problem. The coalition Government are committed to working with our partners in Governments and other organisations, such as non-governmental groups and the United Nations (UN) agencies, to meet the basic needs of children.</p>

This is not a fixed budget and the Treasury remains committed to funding all the net additional costs of military operations in Afghanistan from the special reserve.</p>

In the remaining judicial review claim, which concerned the cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future programme, the claimants were unsuccessful with their main allegations relating to irrationality and substantive legitimate expectation but were successful in relation to allegations of a lack of consultation and that there had been inadequate regard paid to the general equality duties contained in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, Race Relations Act 1976 and Disability Discrimination Act 1995.

	<p pid="a.47.9/1">We understand that this is because many of the 88 studies included by York in their main analyses were conducted on populations in developing countries consuming naturally fluoridated water. The environment in some of these countries is likely to be substantially different from that in the United Kingdom. For example, other factors may be present such as malnutrition, a known cause of enamel defects, and a hotter climate, resulting in higher consumption of water. For these reasons, in its report <I>Water Fluoridation and Health</I>, published in 2002, the Medical Research Council suggested that the prevalence of dental fluorosis of aesthetic concern in populations in the UK drinking artificially fluoridated water was probably lower than the estimates presented by the York report.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.3/1">Over the last six months, rice, maize, wheat and soyabean international nominal prices increased by 7, 28, 9 and 22 per cent respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/2">Cereal prices largely reflect the supply and demand situation on the world market. The increase in cereal prices over the last six months is a reaction to the lower wheat production in Russia and other Black Sea countries, and the subsequent implementation of grain export restrictions by Russia and Ukraine. Lower than expected maize yields in the United States and in Argentina due to adverse weather conditions, coupled with robust demand and tightening stocks, have also had an impact. Additional factors affecting all agricultural commodities are higher energy prices, which have pushed up farm input costs such as fuel and fertiliser, and US dollar depreciation.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/3">After the large increases experienced in the second half of 2010, prices for grains dropped due to more favourable weather conditions and external events such as the social and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, and the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/4">Rice prices rose at the end of 2010 due to robust demand and some perceived tightening of supply in Vietnam, Thailand and the US, and dropped more recently because of improved prospects for Thailand and Vietnam.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/2">According to a recent UN report on Gaza, the easing of restrictions announced by Israel in June 2010 has resulted in the increased availability of consumer goods and some raw materials for manufacturers. Although this is welcome, it falls short of what is needed. Only international organisations are allowed to import construction materials which are subject to protracted and complex entry permit procedures. We continue to press the Israeli Government for full and unhindered access for all humanitarian aid, and to meet their recent promises to facilitate exports from Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">The UN OCHA report <I>Easing the Blockade: assessing the humanitarian impact on the population of the Gaza Strip</I> was published in March 2011 and can be found at <a href="http://www.ocha-opt.org">www.ocha-opt.org</a></p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">There is not a universally accepted definition of public health. There are, however, three broad domains of public health: health improvement (including people's lifestyles as well as inequalities in health and the wider social influences on health), health protection (including infectious diseases, environmental hazards and emergency preparedness) and health services (including service planning, efficiency and audit and evaluation).</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">The Faculty of Public Health defines public health as:</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">&quot;The science and art of promoting and protecting health and well-being, preventing ill-health and prolonging life through the organised efforts of society&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/4">The Health and Social Care Bill (2011) proposes that the Secretary of State will broadly take responsibility for health protection (although local authorities have some existing health protection responsibilities) and local authorities will take responsibility for health improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/5">Rather than defining the difference between health protection and health improvement in legislation, the Bill instead outlines examples of the types of steps that could be taken for both health improvement and health protection. There is considerable overlap between the two sets of steps. For example, providing information or advice appears as examples under both health protection and health improvement. Such flexibility is needed to ensure that the Secretary of State can act quickly in future against threats that have yet to be identified.</p>

Public Health England will carry out the functions currently exercised by the Health Protection Agency. This will include surveillance of infections and other indicators of ill health. We propose that at local level, local authorities will need to work closely with Public Health England health protection units to provide health protection as directed by the Secretary of State.

	<p pid="a.74.3/1">In 2010, the UK funded experts from Aberystwyth University to test for lead contamination of soil, dust particles and water in the Roma Mahalla, and surrounding Fidanishte area, in Kosovo. The project was co-funded with Post Telecommunications Kosovo (PTK), with the UK contributing &#163;10,000. The main objective of the project was to ensure that the Roma Mahalla was safe, or could be made safe, for the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Osterode and Cesmin Lug camps to be resettled there. The results of this project confirmed that Roma Mahalla was safe for the IDPs to be relocated there. 99 of 146 displaced families have so far been resettled in the Roma Mahalla and have access to medical treatment, with more due to relocate there shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/2">The EC Liasion Office (ECLO) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are providing the funding for the resettlement project itself. The ECLO is running a &#8364;5million project to support resettlement of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian families, with the ultimate aim of closing the lead-contaminated camps in both Cesmin Lug (which was successfully closed in 2010) and Osterode (which is due to close in summer 2011). Approximately 15 per cent of ECLO's overall funding is provided by the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/1">Restrictions on access to conflict zones in Libya mean that it is difficult to make a full assessment of the damage caused by Libyan Government attacks on towns and cities. But it is clear that the effect has been severe, particularly in those towns where the most intense fighting has taken place, such as Zawiya and Misrata. Reports from these towns indicate that the use of heavy weaponry by the Libyan regime forces has caused extensive damage to infrastructure and buildings, including private housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/2">Lack of access by humanitarian agencies makes it difficult to give a comprehensive view of humanitarian needs. In eastern Libya people have access to food, water and electricity, although there remain pockets of specific needs. Disruption to regular supply chains also risks causing shortages of basic items. Medical supplies are reaching eastern Libya and hospitals are functioning but stretched, with some staff shortages due to numbers of foreign nurses leaving the country following the start of the fighting and also non-payment of salaries. The situation in western Libya is less clear as access is even more difficult. In the city of Misrata the situation is dire with the city surrounded by pro-Gaddafi forces. Some assistance is reaching Misrata but unfettered access must be allowed immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/3">Throughout Libya we have serious concerns for the protection of civilians and call on all parties to the conflict to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law. The Department for International Development has maintained teams of humanitarian specialists on the Libyan/Tunisian and Libyan/Egyptian borders since late February. The UK is providing &#163;2 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), enabling it to provide medical teams to treat and provide medical supplies to 3,000 people affected by the ongoing fighting. The ICRC will also provide food and supplies to 100,000 of those most in need.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">In accordance with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 (VCDR) foreign diplomats accredited in the UK are entitled to employ domestic workers (foreign or British). Under Article 41(1) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations it is the duty of all diplomats &quot;to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state&quot;. This applies to the terms and conditions of employment for all domestic staff. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) reminded all foreign missions based in the UK of their obligations in February 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">The police investigate any allegation that the law has been broken by persons entitled to immunity and report the results to the FCO. Given the number of people entitled to immunity in the UK (around 25,000), the number of serious offences allegedly committed by diplomats has remained proportionately low in recent years; just two cases involved a domestic worker in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">The FCO treats any allegation of mistreatment of domestic workers in diplomatic households very seriously. When an allegation is brought to our attention by the police, we liaise as necessary with the relevant diplomatic mission and the UK Border Agency to work for an appropriate response. If an allegation of mistreatment requires further investigation by the police, the FCO will request from the diplomatic mission concerned, on behalf of the police, a waiver of the diplomat's immunity. Failure to provide a waiver may result in a request to the mission for withdrawal of the diplomat.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">There is wide-ranging evidence from the United Kingdom and abroad that competition delivers better results for service users. Competition stimulates innovation and improvements, as providers drive up quality to ensure that they deliver the services that users want. Where there is choice, patients are exercising this. Over 200,000 patients a year choose independent hospitals for their National Health Service-funded elective care.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2">The use of procurement and the role of new entrants in primary care have helped to improve access and increase opening hours for general practitioner practices in the evenings and weekends.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/3">Research published by both the London School of Economics and Bristol University has found strong evidence that choice and competition in the NHS leads to benefits for patients. The studies found that hospitals in areas where patients have more choice also have lower death rates and shorter lengths of stay than hospitals in less competitive areas.<sup>1</sup> Other research from Bristol University has shown that quality is higher in more competitive healthcare markets.<sup>2</sup> Critics claim that competition exacerbates inequality in healthcare but research from the University of York has shown this not to be the case.<sup>3</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/4">In the United States State of Maryland, competition has led to significant benefits for patients and taxpayers. An economic regulator has been crucial to transforming the state's secondary care sector from one of the most expensive in the US to being among those with the lowest costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/5">This regulatory model has recently been adopted in the Netherlands, as part of wider health reforms aimed at delivering improvements in patient responsiveness and the quality of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/6">In addition to these academic studies there is a growing number of new independent sector providers who are making a real difference to the lives of patients and carers through access to innovative, responsive services. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/7">Whizz-Kidz-a London-based charity providing customised electronic wheelchairs for children and young people-same day services around half the costs of the NHS;Eastbourne wound-healing centre-long-term wound healing residential centre, which has both high outcomes and cost-effectiveness; andHorder Centre (charity)-providing orthopaedics and muscular-skeletal services, is popular with patients and has good outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.2/2">The programme, which is not part of the Olympic Truce, has been delivered or is currently being delivered in 16 countries (set out in the attached table). Planning for two new countries, yet to be announced, to join the programme will start later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.2/1">London 2012 has already brought significant new opportunities for UK businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), through businesses winning Games-related work, increased tourism and cultural celebrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is responsible for developing and building the venues and infrastructure for the London 2012 Games. As of March 2011, over 1,493 businesses, including those directly involved in the construction programme, have supplied the ODA from across the UK. Thousands of businesses up and down the UK are working on the Games through supplier contracts worth in excess of &#163;5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">This figure does not include the value of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers 2, 3 and so on, which are awarded by the tier 1 contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">In addition, the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) is now ramping up procurement for the &#163;700 million-worth of goods and services it requires to stage the Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5">A post-Games initial evaluation will be published shortly after the Games, in summer 2013. In order to assess the benefits to the UK, the DCMS has commissioned a meta-evaluation of the impacts and legacy of the London 2012 Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/6">A report by the Work Foundation working with Oxford Economics examined how the London economy can fully exploit the opportunities created by the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The report estimated that around 20,200 additional jobs would be created in London in 2012 as a result of the Olympic and Paralympic Games being held in London. The report also estimated that the Games will create an average of 4,500 extra jobs each year in London over the period 2005 to 2020.

	<p pid="a.98.5/1">There is no formal research being carried out at present into the cost of transport to colleges and schools for 16-19 year old full-time students. Discussions held with schools, colleges, representative bodies and with young people in the course of developing proposals for the new 16-19 Bursary Fund have considered the issue of transport costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.5/2">The 16-19 Bursary Fund will provide schools, colleges and training providers with sufficient resource to support less well off students post-16 to a similar level that they are currently supported before the age of 16, taking into account the significant differences in the courses they take and the institutions they attend. We intend that the fund can be used in ways that best fit the circumstances and needs of students, for example, to provide help with books, meals, transport or other course-related costs.</p>

Where there are no grounds on which to make such a determination the material must be destroyed.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.5/13">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/14">1. Information on household income and eligibility for winter fuel payments is available from the Family Resources Survey, for which 2008-09 is the latest year available.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/15">2. Estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. For this reason savings are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million. Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percentage point.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/16">3. As requested, gross household incomes have been used. This means that no taxes have been deducted and the income includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. In practice, the level of savings may vary due to how this would be implemented. The costings assume those who would be eligible for winter fuel payments under the current system in a household with gross annual income above the given limits in 2011-12 no longer receive winter fuel payments. It assumes that all other households are unaffected.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/17">4. Savings to winter fuel payment expenditure use the 2011-12 expenditure forecasts that are consistent with the Budget 2011 forecasts and are therefore based on a &#163;200 payment to households containing someone aged over female state pension age, with an additional &#163;100 payment to households containing someone aged 80 or over. There are additional rules determining how much households containing more than one eligible individual and individuals in receipt of certain benefits receive. These additional rules are also included in the calculations. Family Resources Survey data have been used to calculate the proportion of expenditure which goes to households above the income limits as specified.</p>
