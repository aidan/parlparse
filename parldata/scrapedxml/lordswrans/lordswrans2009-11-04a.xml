	<p pid="a.58.5/1">The Joint Advisory Committee for Qualifications Approval (JACQA) offers advice to the Secretary of State on whether accredited qualifications should be eligible for public funding in 14-19 learning. Its recommendations are made against the published criteria under Section 96 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. These require, for example, that qualifications must be suitable for the age group and, at key stage 4, must fit with the national curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/2">The first criterion is, however, that, to be considered eligible, a qualification must have been accredited by interim Ofqual. Once established in statutory form, assuming Royal Assent of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, Ofqual will have an efficiency objective to ensure that regulated qualifications provide value for money. It would not be appropriate or necessary to ask JACQA to duplicate Ofqual's efficiency objective, but JACQA will need to consider whether according to the Section 96 criteria and in the context of the stated aims of the 14-19 qualifications strategy, public investment in a qualification represents good value for money.</p>

Various diplomatic missions, including our high commission, acted as local observers. Observers agreed that despite election procedures being initially slow, they were meticulously followed. The pre-election phase was characterised by a peaceful political atmosphere and all political parties were free to hold rallies and meetings without hindrance. The Independent Electoral Commission conducted its work in a transparent and professional manner.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.2/1">European directives on public procurement are implemented through the Public Contracts Regulations 2006. Part 4 of these regulations deals specifically with the criteria for rejection of economic operators and the circumstances where a contracting authority (public body) can reject economic operators who have put forward application for the provision of goods, services or works to a public body.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/2">The regulation sets out the offences that if committed by an economic operator or its directors or any other person who has powers of representation, decision or control may give a contracting authority (public body) grounds to treat that economic operator as ineligible for selection to provide goods, services or works to a public body. The regulation as stated deals with convictions for certain criminal offences but does not extend to cover paramilitary links.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/3">A dissatisfied tenderer has the right to challenge a contracting authority either in the High Court or they can complain about the contracting authority to the European Commission (EC). The EC has the power to investigate and, if satisfied that a breach has occurred, may require the contracting authority to remedy that breach.</p>

In June, WRAP held a conference on these issues and discussed the outcomes from its research.

In taking forward the provisions of the Education and Skills Act 2008, which require part-time providers of education falling within specified thresholds to register, DCSF surveyed a sample of local authorities to determine the number of providers that would in future need to register.
