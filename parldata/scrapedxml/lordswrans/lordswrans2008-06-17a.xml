The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform negotiated the tariff for the work required to progress claims based on the anticipated volume of claims at the time and the processes involved in handling the claims.

The assumptions are presented in the form of four illustrative scenarios for different levels of energy prices (low, central, high and high-high scenarios). These illustrative scenarios are meant to capture the uncertainty around the outturn of future fossil fuel prices and are in line with other industry analysts' projections.

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">The Committee of Ministers took into account the Parliamentary Assembly's opinion 248 (2004) when preparing the 2005 budget. There should be direct dialogue between the European Court of Human Rights and the Secretary-General on options for a social protection scheme for judges in the course of setting the Council of Europe budget for 2009. The Committee of Ministers will need to approve any new expenditure.</p>
