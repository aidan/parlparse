	Magistrates: Political Affiliations
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.47.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/2" qnum="HL1245">Whether they have regard to the party political affiliation of applicants for the lay magistracy; and, if so, whether they will publish details of the numbers of lay magistrates affiliated to, or members of, political parties in England and Wales.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-03-29a.47.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100325" speakername="Lord Irvine of Lairg" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010329/text/10329w01.htm#10329w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.47.2/1">The instructions to my Advisory Committees as regards political affiliation are clear. They are set out in paragraph 8.8 of my Directions to Advisory Committees on Justices of the Peace, a copy of which is in the Library. They make plain that:</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The political views of a candidate are neither a qualification nor a disqualification for appointment. However, the Lord Chancellor requires, in the interests of balance, that the voting pattern for the area as evidenced by the last two general elections, should be broadly reflected in the composition of the bench.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/3">The pre-eminent requirement for appointment to the magistracy is that a candidate must be personally suitable, possessing the six key qualities required in a magistrate (good character; understanding and communication; social awareness; maturity and sound temperament; sound judgment; commitment and reliability).</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/4">Despite the fact that political affiliation has been used by successive Lord Chancellors as a proxy for social balance I doubt its continuing relevance and with this in mind I issued a consultation paper in 1998, Political Balance in the Lay Magistracy, seeking views. Respondents favoured removing political affiliation as a balancing factor but could offer no viable alternative. I decided in 1999, reluctantly, that political balance would have to remain for the time being, but instructed my officials to continue to work on an alternative. Later this year pilots will be conducted to ascertain whether or not a combination of social and occupational groupings would be a practical alternative to political balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/5">I said in my Judicial Appointments Annual Report 1999/2000 (Cm 4783) (paragraph 5.21) that I hoped it would be possible to provide a breakdown of the lay magistracy in England and Wales by each balancing criterion (gender, ethnic origin, geographical spread, occupation and political affiliation) in my next Annual Report. I still hope to do so. However, this is dependent upon successful completion of the validation of the records held on all 26,000 magistrates for which I am responsible, on a relatively new computer database. If the validation is not completed in time to include the figures in this year's report, I will announce in this year's report when the figures will be published.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/2">The key findings from the report are:</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/3" class="indent">overall there has been a drop in the number of claims issued, in particular in the types of claim where the new Civil Procedure Rules have been introduced;</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/4" class="indent">anecdotal evidence suggests pre-action protocols are working well to promote settlement before issue and to reduce the number of ill-founded claims;</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/6" class="indent">there has been a rise in the number of cases in which Alternative Dispute Resolution is used, suggesting that, since the introduction of the Civil Procedure Rules, parties are more likely to try alternative means of settling claims;</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/7" class="indent">the use of single joint experts appears to have worked well. It is likely that their use has contributed to a less adversarial culture, earlier settlement and may have cut costs;</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/8" class="indent">the time between issue and hearing for those cases which go to trial has fallen;</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/9" class="indent">it is too early to provide a definitive view on costs with statistics difficult to obtain and conflicting anecdotal evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is today publishing for consultation the draft Export Control and Non-Proliferation Bill. Copies of the Consultation on Draft Legislation: the Export Control and Non-Proliferation Bill (CM5091) will be laid before the House and will be available at the Vote Office. Copies will also be available from the Stationery Office and on my department's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">The draft Bill replaces in full the export control powers in the Import, Export and Customs (Powers) Defence Act 1939. Export controls currently imposed under the 1939 Act include both strategic export controls, which are the responsibility of my department, and export controls on cultural objects, which are the responsibility of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The Bill is intended both to provide for improved accountability for and transparency in export controls and to provide a more up-to-date and comprehensive legislative framework for export controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">The draft Bill establishes the purposes for which export controls can be imposed and will provide for parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation made under it. These measures will meet recommendations made by Sir Richard Scott in his report of the Inquiry into the Export of Defence Equipment and Dual-Use Goods to Iraq and Related Prosecutions. The Bill also provides for annual reports to be laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/4">The draft Bill provides the Government with new powers to impose controls on the transfer of military and dual-use technology by intangible means and the provision of related technical assistance, and on activities connected with international trade (usually referred to as trafficking and brokering) between overseas countries in military or dual-use equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/5">The Introduction to the Bill in Part I of the Consultation on Draft Legislation sets out the controls which the Government propose to introduce in secondary legislation to be made under these new powers. These are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/6" class="indent">Controls on the electronic transfer of military technology in line with similar controls already introduced for dual-use technology in the new European Dual-Use Items Regulation which came into force in September 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/7" class="indent">Controls on the transfer of technology by any intangible means and the provision of technical services intended for weapons of mass destruction and related missile programmes. These controls will meet the requirements of a European Union Joint Action agreed in June 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/8" class="indent">Controls on the trafficking and brokering of weapons and related equipment to any destination. In addition, controls will be introduced which will be used to prohibit trafficking and brokering to embargoed destinations and trafficking and brokering in types of equipment whose export we have already banned because of evidence of their use in torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/9">The Bill will also allow for imposition of export licensing procedures and includes a power to require the provision of certain information which is intended primarily to ensure that the Government can meet its reporting obligations to international bodies, such as the UN Conventional Arms Register. The Bill allows for the maximum penalty for offences in respect of matters controlled under the powers in the Bill to be raised from the current maximum level of seven years' imprisonment to a maximum of 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/10">Views are invited from all those with an interest in either strategic export controls or export controls on cultural objects by <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 24 May</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">A shaft approximately 10m deep and 1.8m by 1.8m wide opened up in May last year on the top of Silbury Hill. A scaffolding cover with secured metal sheeting was immediately erected to provide protection to the shaft and the surrounding area. This was intended to be a temporary measure while a method of backfilling the shaft was devised. In December, the shaft further collapsed and changed shape. There is now a hole 3.8m deep and 7.2m by 5.5m wide. Structural engineers consider that no backfilling can take place at the top of the hill as this may cause even further damage. It is likely that the mineshaft and any other voids within the hill will have to be grouted from the base of the hill upwards. A seismic survey will be undertaken in the near future to map the voids within the hill, so that a detailed repair specification can be drawn up.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">London Underground (LUL) inform me that the escalators at Notting Hill Gate station are some of the oldest on the network, all of them dating back to commission dates in 1959-60. The plan to replace all six in one major project therefore represents a very substantial programme of work designed to benefit customers, but with some inevitable disruption while key works are completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">An alternative would be to close the station to allow work to proceed more quickly but LUL wished to maintain its service to customers. LUL therefore decided that it was best to keep the station open while closely monitoring the existing escalators in operation and ensuring that safety is paramount at all times. As I said in my earlier Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase> (HL 679) LUL's escalators are subject to very heavy-duty usage, and in many cases they are specially built for each individual location and have to be installed piece by piece on site. The actual time for each renewal can therefore vary according to the location and inherent difficulties such as space etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">Her Majesty's Rail Inspectorate do not make recommendations regarding the hours of work on escalators at Underground stations. However, they do take the view that where major escalator works are taking place there may be risks to passengers should certain work be done when the station is open to passengers. As examples, &quot;hot&quot; work (such as flame cutting or welding) with its associated fire risk or movement of large equipment and materials would not be possible in a working station. LUL take account of these requirements in planning their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">The Government are concerned about the issue of works on escalators, and believe that it is important for escalators to work smoothly and to be maintained, replaced and refurbished in the minimum time required which is consistent with safety and value for money. We are therefore encouraging LUL, in the interests of customers, to take steps to improve escalator availability.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/1">This is an operational matter for London Underground (LUL), who inform me that it is necessary to place limitations on the type of engineering and related work undertaken where stations are in day to day operational use. It would not be desirable or efficient for heavy engineering work to be carried on through the day in areas which customers are passing through, for example because of noise and dirt associated with the work; and for staff or contractors to carry out work alongside moving escalators could be hazardous in certain circumstances. In practice, however, other work on the escalators is often carried out during the day.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.6/2">It serves as a guide, an indicator that signatories to the convention have in place the necessary legislation, training, certification and quality assurance measures to implement STCW 95. However, for service on the registered ships of a country wishing to recognise another country's certificates, it is only a starting point for recognition. STCW 95 requires that countries take any measures necessary to satisfy themselves that the training and certification are of an equivalent standard.

	<p pid="a.59.11/1">In accordance with the protocol agreed between Ministers, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector and the Prison Service, an action plan will be produced within 30 working days of its publication. This will address all the report's recommendations, but some of the key developments already in hand are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.11/2">A new staff attendance system planned to come into effect next month should provide a considerable increase in out-of-cell hours. Extra education spaces will be available following the conversion of additional classrooms. A first night centre is being set up. To tackle the problems caused by overcrowding, the roll was reduced to 1,000 from November 2000, and is planned to reduce further to 800 by <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.11/3">Birmingham prison will be one of the first wave of pilot sites for the development of National Health Service funded &quot;in-reach&quot; teams to support prison healthcare staff in looking after seriously mentally ill prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.11/4">A senior healthcare manager has been appointed jointly by the Prison Service and the local health authority and a new nurse manager is being seconded from the NHS to improve nursing leadership in the prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.11/5">A major redevelopment project is planned for Birmingham prison, which will include two new houseblocks, a new healthcare centre, workshop and sports hall. This will provide safe and secure accommodation for prisoners as well as providing improved regime facilities. The proposed investment is in excess of &pound;50 million, although this is still awaiting Treasury approval. If the necessary funding is secured, it is anticipated that the project will be completed during 2004. In the meantime, an interim refurbishment programme to improve the environment in the healthcare centre has been completed, and the reception area is also being redecorated.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">During April 2001, the Integrated Casework Directorate (ICD) of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) will devote some of its resources to starting applications for British citizenship on receipt. All cases, at both ends of the queue for consideration, will be considered using new procedures and working practices. New applicants will be asked to supply supporting documentation at the time of application and to respond more quickly to requests for further information than has previously been the case. The aim of these changes is to eliminate the current backlog of nationality applications by attacking it from both ends. This approach has been successfully used elsewhere in IND--for example, in the production of travel documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/2">ICD will have achieved its target of 91,000 decisions by the end of March 2001, which is more than twice the total for 1997. By the end of February 2001, the average waiting time for all types of citizenship applications had fallen to exactly 12 months, as compared with nearly 20 months at the same time last year. These improvements flow from significantly increased investment in the system and the new service delivery culture now becoming established in the ICD.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/3">Because of these improvements, ICD is now in a position to deal with the remaining backlog of work from both ends, cutting out unnecessary handling. This approach has proved very successful in other parts of IND's work. More resources will continue to be devoted to those applications that have been waiting longest, but the ICD's intention is to reduce the waiting time for all applications to an average of six months by April 2002 and to three months by April 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.1/2" qnum="HL1400">What is their estimate of the total number of children with statements of special educational needs who will require places in mainstream schools under the provisions of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill in each of the next five years; and how many mainstream schools will be involved in accepting such pupils; and</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/3" qnum="HL1405">What savings they expect in each of the next five years as a result of the closure of special schools and the reduction in the size of special schools following the transfer of more children with special educational needs and disabilities from special schools to mainstream schools as required by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill; and whether these savings will be used to help pay for additional support for those children in mainstream schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.2/1">The Government want an education service to offer excellence and choice for all. The SEN and Disability Bill does not require the closure of special schools. The Bill strengthens the right to a mainstream place for children who have statements. It does not make it harder for parents whose children have statements to gain a place for them in a special school. A parent's right to express a preference for a maintained special school or to make representations to have a non-maintained school named in their child's statement is being fully maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">There is a continuing and vital role for special schools. The Government want all special schools to become outward-looking centres of excellence working in partnership with mainstream schools. The proportion of pupils in special schools fell from 1.3 per cent in 1991 to 1.2 per cent in 1995 but has remained constant in each of the last six years.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/3">Inclusion is not about cost cutting. Research suggests that in time inclusion can provide savings. The Government believe that any such saving should be used to benefit all pupils, including those with learning difficulties or disabilities. Significant resources have been made available to help support the inclusion of children with special educational needs or disabilities. The SEN standards fund will rise from &pound;55 million in 2000-01 to &pound;82 million from April. In addition, &pound;220 million is being provided over the next three years from April via the School Access Initiative to help schools become more accessible.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.2/1">There is no need for authorities to cut existing services, as substantial extra resources are being provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/2">The Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill will advance civil rights for disabled people in education and help to improve provision for all children with special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/3">We are making significant resources available to support the implementation of the Bill. In particular, next year (2001-02) we will make &pound;82 million of supported expenditure available through Standards Fund, for special educational needs. This will be available for training for staff of pupils with special educational needs, improvements in speech and language therapy provision for children with communication difficulties, the provision of information and advice to parents and the greater inclusion of children with SEN in the mainstream. We are also making available &pound;220 million between 2001 and 2004, under the Schools Access Initiative, to help schools improve both access to premises and the curriculum for pupils with SEN and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/4">In addition, as a result of the March budget announcement there will be over &pound;800 million increase in education spending in England over the next three years. Funding per pupil in 2001-02 will now be over &pound;200 higher in real terms than in 2000-01. Additional direct funding to schools over and above normal funding will mean that a typical primary school will get an extra &pound;24,000 next year, while a typical secondary will receive an extra &pound;70,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/5">The Government published Explanatory Notes and a Regulatory Impact Assessment with the Bill which estimated the effect of the Bill on public sector finances and the private and voluntary sectors respectively. The documents estimated that the costs of the provisions to local education authorities and schools would be relatively minor given the large amount of funding already made available for special educational needs provision and disability access. The duties to plan to increase the accesssibility of schools will require schools and local education authorities to plan within the context of the resourses available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/6">Greater inclusion can require quite modest changes or changes to practices that are cost free. Inclusion will become a reality only where there is an attitudinal change, and that does not necessarily cost money.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/7">We do not believe that there will be a reduction in provision for pupils with special educational needs provided by LEAs or a reduction in services provided by schools as a result of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">Afghanistan is currently suffering from its worst drought in 30 years. This, combined with continuing conflict and the absence of significant economic recovery, has led to a dramatic deterioration in the humanitarian situation. The UN indicates that about 12 million people (over half the country's population) have been affected by the drought; 3-4 million of them seriously. One million people are thought to be at risk of famine. Neighbouring countries are becoming increasingly unreceptive to population flows from Afghanistan and there have been reports of border closures over recent months.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.2/2">We have continued to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan where this can be done effectively. This financial year, we have provided some &pound;10.5 million through UN agencies, the Red Cross and NGOs. As well as drought relief assistance, this includes a longer-term programme of humanitarian assistance to the Afghan population, both in Afghanistan itself and to Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran. We intend to continue with this programme in the coming year, and stand ready to respond to additional needs as required.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.2/3">We have also reviewed our policy of not financing NGO activities that involved UK nationals, because of the personal security risks. There have been no serious security incidents involving expatriates for some time. With this in mind, we have decided to consider funding on a case by case basis for NGOs that send UK nationals into the country. As before, the appraisal of proposals will continue to include an assessment of the agency's personnel security arrangements. Only if these arrangements are judged to be appropriate would the agency be eligible for funding.</p>
