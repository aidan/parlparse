	<p pid="a.118.3/1">The main reason for the delay in publication of the 2000 accounts for the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission was due to the auditor of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, the predecessor body, not certifying the commission's final accounts until October 2002. This was because the accounting standards applicable to the FFC were changed and the new standards created difficulties with regard to the funding of the FFC Pension Scheme. Previous assurances with regard to the funding that had been provided by the commission's sponsoring departments were no longer adequate to allow the auditor's certificate. Lengthy discussion with the Department of Finance (ROI) eventually agreed that resolution would only be achieved if a qualification of the accounts was provided by the auditor.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.0/1">On present trends it is likely that some countries in sub-Saharan Africa will fail to reach the UPE goal by 2015. The Education for All Monitoring Report identifies 24 countries which are unlikely to reach this Millennium Development Goal. Countries affected by, and emerging from, conflict are most at risk. Good progress is being made in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/2">We are continuing to work in partnership with African Governments through bilateral and multilateral channels to address this situation. We have committed over &pound;700 million to basic education since 1997 and project to spend about &pound;1 billion on universal primary education in the years 2002&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.3/2">We have substantially increased our support to governments with credible plans for achieving UPE. These countries include Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia. We do envisage however that some may continue to have difficulties in reaching this goal. Decisions taken recently by some governments, notably Kenya, to make primary schooling free will have a major impact. We judge that the situation will continue to improve in our partner countries as we project to spend &pound;1 billion on UPE in the years 2002&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.6/1">There has been a marked increase in enrolment in Malawi since school fees were abolished in 1994, resulting in a national net enrolment rate of 65.7 per cent <sup>1</sup> . The free primary education (FPE) policy, almost resulted in universal primary education (UPE) with an extra 1 million children enrolling at this time. However, there is still much to be done if UPE is to be achieved and maintained. Approximately 24 per cent <sup>2</sup> of primary school-age children are currently out of school. Families continue to bear other costs (i.e, school materials and uniform costs), and the increase of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the region results in some school-age children not going to school.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.6/4">Malawi's experiences in the introduction of FPE have been widely shared in the region through our country offices. A key lesson from this experience is the need to ensure that the education system can cope with a large influx of enrolling children before FPE is introduced so as not to affect the quality of education. Also, strong government commitment is crucial to achieving UPE.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.2/1">Ministers can consider an application for exceptional funding under Section 6(8)(b) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 only when the Legal Services Commission recommends it. The provision came into force in April 2000. In 2000 and 2001, no exceptional funding applications for employment tribunals were recommended. In 2002, the commission recommended funding one application, for disability discrimination, which was approved. In 2003, one application for alleged discrimination under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was received, but funding was refused, as alternative funding was available. A further three applications for exceptional funding for employment tribunals were recommended in 2003, which are currently being considered. One concerns allegations of sexual discrimination, one of racial discrimination and the other of disability discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.0/1">No. It is, however, a fundamental proposition of the Gender Recognition Bill that, following legal recognition in their acquired gender, a transsexual person will be regarded in UK law as being of the acquired gender for all purposes and that in law that acquired gender will be the same as any legal definition of their sex. This means that, following legal recognition, if the acquired gender is the male gender, the person's sex in law becomes that of a man and if the person's acquired gender is the female gender, the person's sex in law becomes that of a woman. Where under any legislation it is necessary to decide the sex of a person who has an acquired gender, or to say whether that person is a man or a woman, or male or female, the question must be answered in accordance with the person's acquired gender.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.9/1">There is nothing to prevent a minister asking a parishioner whether they have lived previously in another gender. Whether the parishioner chooses to volunteer the information, or answer a question that has been asked, is a matter for that individual and for the relationship between the parishioner and the clergyman. This is not an area in which the state should get involved. Ultimately, it seems unlikely that a person who has changed gender would place him or herself in the embarrassing position of forcing the issue before a minister who, in conscience, did not want to marry him or her. The Government agreed in Grand Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-14">14 January</phrase> to look again at the detail of the &quot;conscience clause&quot; within the Gender Recognition Bill and to consider providing further protection for the conscience of the clergy.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">A transsexual person who has been legally recognised as a woman by law in the UK under gender recognition legislation could be charged with, and found guilty of, the rape of another female person. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 in England and Wales is very specific about the relevant act, rather than the gender or sex of the defendant or complainant. Because many sexual offences in Scottish law remain gender-specific, the Gender Recognition Bill includes a clause relating to Scottish gender-specific offences. Northern Ireland is currently reviewing its legislation on sexual offences with the intention of recasting this to be gender neutral.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.4/2" qnum="HL630">What progress has been made in addressing the problems caused to HealthSure Group Ltd and other not-for-profit health cash plan providers by the change in the tax treatment of surpluses; and whether they will ensure that a satisfactory solution is found so as not to impact adversely upon such providers or the charitable donations they make from such surpluses to the National Health Service and medical charities.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.5/1">After discussions between the Inland Revenue and representatives of health cash plan providers, it was agreed it was necessary to tailor solutions that took account of the differing circumstances of the providers. Inland Revenue staff have been working with the individual cash plan providers on an agreed timetable to ensure a smooth change to the tax treatment of surpluses.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/2">For those health cash plan providers who opt to change their constitution to comply with the requirements for mutual trading, the Inland Revenue is allowing tax exemption to apply through the transition. For these, there is no impact on charitable donations.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/3">For those that prefer not to change their constitution, their surpluses will, from a date to be agreed with their inspector, be chargeable to tax as trading profits. However, they can make donations to charities, which qualify for tax relief under gift aid rules, so in practice, they will see little change from the previous situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.5/4">The impact of these changes depends largely on decisions taken by individual health cash plan providers.</p>
