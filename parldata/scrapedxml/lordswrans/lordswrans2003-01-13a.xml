It replaces the previous instructions and sets out mandatory requirements. This PSO brings existing policy in line with the direction of the Prison Service's approach to suicide prevention (the move from &quot;awareness&quot; to &quot;prevention&quot;) and the broader context (decency, safety, the concept of the healthy prison). It provides prison staff with instructions on identifying prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm and on providing the subsequent care and support for such prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.8/2">A guidance document Suicide Prevention Strategies has been issued in conjunction with this PSO. Copies of both have been lodged in the Library. The guidance document provides suggestions in line with the suicide and self-harm prevention strategy based on the Internal Review of Suicide and Self-harm in the Prison Service and incorporates protocols on the use of safer cells and information on the role of Samaritans and prisoner peer supporters. It aims to support the practices and procedures set out in PSO 2700, while recognising that not all the guidance will be appropriate or feasible or affordable for all establishments. Managers are encouraged to judge which suggestions are appropriate to their type/category of establishment and carefully to consider which aspects of the advice they believe realistically can be implemented in their establishment within the resources available.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.8/3">These documents cannot reflect all the learning from the Prison Service's suicide prevention and self-harm reduction programme, which is at its half-way stage. This programme includes a series of projects to address pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support, and the learning from investigations into deaths in custody. The three-year programme, which started in April 2001, will be subject to an independent evaluation, and a new generation of replacement PSOs is planned for 2004. It is likely that, as with PSO 2700 and the supporting guide, the distinction between mandatory actions and good practice will be maintained.Joan</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/1">The Prison Service is taking a number of steps to improve the service to the courts. These include the greater use of video links to reduce prisoner movements to court and the provision of additional resources to contractors to enable them to respond to the increased volume of business.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">All necessary information is passed between the contractor and the Prison Service whenever a prisoner is moved. Any failure to pass on any necessary information would be investigated by the Prison Service as part of their monitoring processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">The contracting out of prisoner escort arrangements has offered better value for money and a reduction in the number of escapes and has freed up prison officers to concentrate on their core duties. A recent Prison Service review confirmed that the service should continue to be contracted out. It also concluded that existing contracts, which are planned to be re-let in 2004, should be replaced with more flexible ones to allow the Prison Service to respond more quickly to future business needs. The Prison Service is developing this approach and is considering how the relevant agencies in the criminal justice system can work together to improve the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary launched a three-year safer custody programme in April 2001 aimed at reducing deaths, self-harm and violence in prisons. The programme targets the highest risk prisoners in the highest risk locations, concentrating on six pilot sites. As part of this programme the Prison Service is considering how it can improve and strengthen investigation procedures into deaths in custody to determine not only what happened in an individual case but also how practice might be improved in future to try to prevent further deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/2">The Prison Service has conducted a wide-scale consultation exercise, considering a number of options (including asking HM Chief Inspector of Prisons to conduct such inquiries) to make investigations into deaths in custody more independent. Ministers are considering whether to give responsibility for investigating deaths in prison custody to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. In the interim, the Prison Service is doing what it can within available resources to strengthen and improve the current system of investigating deaths in custody. There are no plans at present to introduce routine independent investigations for serious incidents in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/3">Section 5A(4) 1952 permits the Home Secretary to refer specific matters connected with prisons and prisoners to HM Chief Inspector of Prisons and direct her to report on them.

	<p pid="a.11.2/1">The African continent comprises the entire range of mine-affectedness, with some countries among the most heavily mine-infested in the world, others completely mine-free and others again falling somewhere between these extremes. Apart from the toll of human tragedy caused by anti-personnel landmines, affected countries share to differing degrees a common experience of social and economic dislocation caused by denial of access to productive land, diversion of medical and other resources and, in many cases, obstacles to conflict resolution and post-conflict reconciliation, regeneration and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/2">HMG's global humanitarian demining strategy is directed towards universalisation of the Ottawa Convention and helping developing countries to develop their own capacity to meet their convention obligations. The Department for International Development (DfID) funds work in support of mine clearance, mines awareness and capacity building programmes. The latter include programmes aimed at improving the linkage with poverty reduction in national planning and prioritisation; encouraging practical innovation to enhance safety and efficiency in operations; and strengthening international systems for co-ordination and collaboration. DfID has a planned provision for around &pound;10 million annually for mines action, the majority provided through the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) and the United Nations Development Progamme (UNDP).</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/3">DfID has supported humanitarian mine action in Africa for over 10 years, with bilateral demining programmes covering Angola, Chad, Guinea Bissau and Mozambique. In the current financial year DfID is providing financial support of &pound;2 million to UNDP, aimed at enhancing the capacity of mine action organisations in Angola, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Somalia and Sudan, with a view to improving the effectiveness of their operations planning, building national capacities and linking their mine action work with broader development goals.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.2/2">In line with its commitments under Article 12 of the UNCRC (United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child) the UK is fully committed to ensuring that children's views are taken into consideration when making any decision that will affect them.

	<p pid="a.12.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel advice for Indonesia was changed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-07">7 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/2">Previously it advised against all travel to the country. It now advises against all non-essential travel to Indonesia. The FCO continues to assess that the threat to British nationals and British interests from terrorism throughout Indonesia remains high and that British nationals already in Indonesia should consider leaving if their presence is not essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/3">The decision to change the advice was taken after careful consideration of the latest information, including intelligence. It also brings it into line with the latest advice of the Australian Government. The terrorist threat in Indonesia remains real, and further attacks cannot be ruled out. But account has also been taken of the strengthened Indonesian commitment and actions since Bali to confront the terrorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/4">Since Bali, there has been only one significant attack, at a McDonalds restaurant and a car showroom in Makassar, Sulawesi, in December which killed three Indonesian nationals. A number of anti-terrorist decrees have been passed and some important arrests made in respect of the Bali bombings and previous terrorist incidents. The Muslim mass movements are now speaking out against terrorism. The radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir has been held for police questioning. The Indonesians have also provided more security than before to diplomatic missions and international schools, as well as other non-specifically Western targets, such as shopping malls, entertainment centres and churches.</p>

We hope that many will be suitable for national application.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.8/2">We will also be increasing the visibility of health messages highlighting to smokers the risks environmental tobacco smoke presents. This is through regulations to transpose into United Kingdom law the European Union Directive on the Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco Products. These regulations require tobacco products to carry larger and starker health warnings on both the front and back of the packet. The dangers of passive smoking are highlighted in two of the new warnings which include &quot;Smoking seriously harms you and others around you&quot; and &quot;Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke&quot;.</p>
