	<p pid="c.91.5/1">Currently there are no proposals within Europe for adding the red squirrel to Annex IV of the Habitats Directive, as the rest of Europe has stable populations that are not yet threatened by the spread of grey squirrels.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.5/2">However, the red squirrel is listed on Appendix III of the Bern convention and is protected within the UK by virtue of being listed on Schedules 5 and 6 to the WCA and Schedules 5 and 6 to the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.5/3">A species action plan for the red squirrel was one of the first to be published as part of the UK biodiversity action plan (UKBAP) in 1995. The plan recognised the spread of the grey squirrel, habitat fragmentation and disease (squirrel pox virus) as factors causing loss or decline of the red squirrel. The plan sets objectives and targets to maintain and enhance the existing populations and to re-establish populations where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.5/4">Defra also launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-22">22 January</phrase> an action plan to control grey squirrels. The action plan, which has been developed by Defra and the Forestry Commission, focuses on areas where they are damaging woodland and preventing red squirrels becoming established.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.5/5">The Government have been instrumental, along with Ireland and Italy, in raising the profile of red and grey squirrel issues across Europe. This includes the tabling of a recommendation, agreed by the standing committee of the Bern convention in December 2005. This encourages signatories to undertake studies into the impact of greys on red squirrel populations, forestry and other biodiversity, and ensure that governments are attentive to and actively seek to prevent further introductions of non-native squirrel species.</p>

	<p pid="c.93.3/1">The operators and drivers of certain heavy goods and public service vehicles are required to use tachographs to record drivers' compliance with the EU drivers hours rules. Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2135/98, such in-scope vehicles put into service for the first time after <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-05">5 August 2004</phrase> were required to be fitted with a digital tachograph. However, digital tachographs were not available by that date and the requirement could not be enforced.</p>
	<p pid="c.93.3/2">The Council and European Parliament agreed last December to change the August 2004 date to ensure legal clarity. This will be achieved through a clause in a new EU regulation on drivers hours which will amend Regulation (EC) No. 2135/98. The effect of this amendment will be to require the use of a digital tachograph in vehicles put into service for the first time from a date 20 days after formal publication of the new EU regulation on drivers hours. Publication is expected in early April and digital tachographs should become mandatory for new vehicles from early May 2006.</p>
