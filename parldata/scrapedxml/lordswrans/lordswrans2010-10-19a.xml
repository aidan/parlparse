The MPC decides on the use of measures, including the asset purchase facility (APF), in order to target 2 per cent inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the consumer prices index (CPI).

	<p pid="a.139.2/1">The Bank of England's inflation report published in August 2010 makes an assessment of M4 and the availability of credit. The report points out that the growth rates of bank credit remained weak in 2010 Q2 relative to recent averages. These trends reflect in part the severe monetary squeeze precipitated by the financial crisis. Banks have tightened the supply of credit and fewer loans have been advanced, reducing deposit growth.</p>

This was to assist British manufacturers to take advantage of opportunities in all the newly emerging low carbon sectors. In order to focus support for suppliers, or potential suppliers, to the nuclear industry, the Government asked MAS NW to act as lead centre for the nuclear sector and allocated &#163;245,000 to ensure that MAS could provide specialist advice on civil nuclear.

The new text has been negotiated given the new mandates of European Parliament and Commission, updated to reflect the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/2">Concerns have been expressed within the council that the framework agreement could potentially breach the requirement for the Commission and the European Parliament to act within the limits of the powers conferred upon them by the Lisbon treaty by both conferring powers on the European Parliament beyond the treaty and limiting the Commission's autonomy. The council is therefore proposing to issue an official declaration noting its intention to monitor the operation of the framework agreement and reserving its right to bring a legal challenge before the Court of Justice at a later date if it considers that either or both institution subsequently applies the framework agreement in a way contrary to the treaties. The UK has been in the forefront in pushing within the council to secure a robustly worded council declaration in response to the framework agreement, and the Government will continue to push this line as discussions on these texts progresses.</p>

These publications relate to US policy and Veterans Affairs (VA) services to 1990-91 Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan veterans so their relevance to the UK needs to be seen in that context, and there are no direct implications for the ill-health reported by UK Gulf veterans or on our own UK services.

	<p pid="a.159.5/1">The British Coal Respiratory Disease Litigation Claims Handling Agreement was originally established to compensate underground workers. It has subsequently been amended to include some men with mixed underground and surface employment. Men with pure surface employment have never been eligible to receive compensation under the terms of the claims handling agreement and therefore (save for any instances of fraud or administrative error) no compensation payments should have been paid by the department under the terms of that agreement to any such men.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.3/1">There are no singles or couples rates as such. The basic state pension is paid as an individual benefit. However, a person whose own basic state pension entitlement is less than &#163;58.50 (April 2010 rates) may receive a state pension based on their spouse's or civil partner's national insurance contribution record. The maximum amount they can receive in combination with any basic state pension of their own is &#163;58.50 per week. To qualify, both they and their spouse or civil partner must have reached state pension age.

	<p pid="a.161.3/3">State pension is paid to people who claim it after reaching state pension age and who fully or partially meet the contribution conditions. A person can get a basic state pension by building up enough qualifying years before state pension age. A qualifying year is a tax year in which a person has sufficient earnings upon which they have paid, are treated as having paid or have been credited with, national insurance contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.3/5">One qualifying year of paid or credited national insurance contributions will give entitlement to some basic state pension.

	<p pid="a.164.2/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has made a robust commitment towards detecting, removing and preventing all forms of corruption in partnership with the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/2">A dedicated corruption prevention unit (CPU) works with regional corruption prevention managers, the front line and partner agencies to raise staff awareness, develop an understanding of the extent and nature of staff corruption in prisons and related HQ functions and where practicable, to prosecute identified instances of corrupt behaviour. Each prison has an identified local corruption prevention manager with responsibility for raising awareness of the risks from corruption, helping staff in reporting and taking forward action in including working with the police in support of prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/3">A joint memorandum of understanding was agreed between ACPO and NOMS in October 2008 and gives the primacy for investigating and prosecuting individual cases of staff corruption to the police. NOMS also uses internal disciplinary proceedings to take action, up to and including dismissal, of any member of staff who is found to be involved in corrupt activities where there is insufficient evidence to support police prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.3/1">Prior to September 2010 there had been no incidents of allergic reactions or burns from material that has been stored over long periods of time at the Serious Fraud Office. There have been to date four incidents where staff working with case papers have experienced skin irritation. These have all been treated with off-the-shelf anti-histamines and the symptoms then subsided.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/2">The Serious Fraud Office works proactively to minimise health and safety risks and manage identified risks whilst ensuring the timely progression of its casework. As part of this approach, the Serious Fraud Office takes day to day precautionary measures to provide its staff with the option to use personal protective equipment including gloves, aprons and masks when dealing with material that has been in storage for a long period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/3">As a result of these minor incidents the SFO further enhanced its existing process by contacting the National Archive for guidance on dealing with documents that have been in storage for long periods of time. That advice has been implemented and included only handling the material in one designated area and sealing material in containers when not in use. In addition, the SFO has also sought guidance from a leading pest control company which advised that the documentation in question does not contain any insect infestation.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/4">There is no specific guidance issued to government departments on the risks associated with handling such old material, and although the Health and Safety Executive does collate reported information about such incidents it is not able to break this information down by organisation, government or otherwise.</p>
