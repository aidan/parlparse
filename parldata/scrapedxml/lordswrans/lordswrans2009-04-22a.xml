When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.(3) Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.(4) Staffordshire Police Force was only able to submit sample data for persons proceeded against and convicted in the magistrates' courts for the year<I></I>2000.

	<p pid="a.402.2/1">Directives 2006/24/EC (Data Retention) and 2002/58/EC (Privacy and Electronic Communications) concern data processing and data retention in the electronic communications sector and the elimination of obstacles to the internal market for electronic communications, and were therefore made on a first pillar basis established by the 1992 Maastricht treaty. The legal basis of 2006/24/EC (Data Retention) was upheld in the recent European Court of Justice case (C-301/06 Ireland v Parliament). It was the opinion of the European Court of Justice that all the normal tests for using Article 95 were met.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.2/2">It is important to note the 2006 directive covers the retention of communications data and not access to it.

The national Quality and Outcomes Framework was introduced in April 2004, as part of the new general medical services contract. Participation by practices in the framework is voluntary, though participation rates are very high&mdash;with most personal medical services practices also taking part. The above information was derived from the quality management analysis system&mdash;a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health.3. The quality management analysis system captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists. The above figures are just the number of patients on the disease register for dementia.</p>

	<p pid="a.406.3/1">The legal provisions governing the taking and retention of DNA samples and fingerprints for the national DNA database (NDNAD) and the national fingerprint database (IDENT1) are set out in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), as amended by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003. They provide that both DNA and fingerprints may be taken from a person arrested for a recordable offence and retained indefinitely, including for persons who are not convicted of a crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/2">Policy on the retention of DNA and fingerprint records is being reviewed in the light of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of S and Marper. The Government are considering their response to the judgment in conjunction with the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers. A White Paper will be published later this year which will contain proposals on how we intend to implement the judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/3">In relation to the removal of records, under the provisions in PACE, the decision on whether to agree to a request from an individual to have their DNA profile, fingerprints and associated records removed from police databases lies with the chief officer of the force which took the DNA sample and fingerprint records.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/4">In January 2006, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) issued guidance to chief officers on the consideration of applications for the removal of DNA samples, fingerprint records and Police National Computer records taken by forces in England and Wales. The ACPO guidelines make it clear that it is expected that DNA profiles and fingerprints which have been taken lawfully will be removed in exceptional cases only.</p>
