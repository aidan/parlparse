	<p pid="a.10.2/1">Cycling on the pavement, legally known as the &quot;footway&quot;, is an offence under Section 72 of the Highways Act 1835 as amended by Section 85(1) of the Local Government Act 1888, and in Scotland under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/2">It is an offence in England and Wales punishable by a fine of level, 2 on the standard scale, currently a maximum fine of &pound;500, if pursued through the courts. In 1999 a fixed penalty notice was introduced with the standard penalty for a non-endorsable offence. This was increased from &pound;20 to &pound;30 on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-01">1 November 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/3">The original penalty for the offence was a fine not exceeding 40 shillings. There is no accurate way in which to compare the value of money in 1835 and the present day. Most offences are punished in the magistrates' court with reference to the standard scale offences. When this is revalorised it applies equally to all offences affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/4">The penalty levels associated with all fixed penalty offences are kept under review by the Home Office chaired Fixed Penalty Procedures Working Group. In reviewing the level of fixed penalties the group takes account of many different factors. Inflation is only one of these. Others include the importance of traffic control and road safety, the over-all fixed penalty structure and effect of any changes in government policy, the level of court imposed fines for the same offences, the impact on low income groups and the need to set penalties at levels which offenders will pay without contesting, but which will also act as a deterrent.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/5">To date the group has not considered that there is a sufficiently strong case to recommend to Ministers that there should an increase in the fixed penalty level.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.2/1">In 2004, the Department for Education and Skills published an SEN strategy, <I>Removing Barriers to Achievement</I>, which recommended greater delegation of SEN funding to schools so they could intervene earlier to meet children's SEN and set out a programme to improve mainstream schools' ability to provide for a wider range of children with SEN without the need for a statement. The Government made clear that implementation of the strategy would not lead to a reduction in children's entitlement to receive appropriate support and that local authorities' duty to draw up statements, where necessary, remained unchanged.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.5/1">The September 2007 target date for the formal identification of quiet areas in agglomerations was not met and there is no revised target date in the amended regulations. For the reasons set out below, the process has now been amended to allow more local participation and greater flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/2">In terms of timing, the consultation on the draft noise action plans for agglomerations, which include the proposed method for identifying quiet areas, has just been completed. Subject to the review of the consultation responses, it is anticipated that the action plans will be formally adopted in the early part of next year. After that, the local nomination and formal identification of quiet areas will be implemented as part of the whole action planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/3">The environmental noise directive (END) requires the competent authorities of member states to draw up action plans for first round agglomerations (ie urban areas with more than 250,000 inhabitants). It also requires that these plans shall contain measures which aim to protect quiet areas within agglomerations against an increase in noise. The environmental noise regulations originally required the Secretary of State to identify quiet areas by <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September 2007</phrase> for first round agglomerations, and by <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-30">30 September 2012</phrase> for second round agglomerations. In the consultation on the transposition of the END, Defra considered different criteria for identifying potential quiet areas, including relevant land use designations and acoustic thresholds.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/4">As the process developed, however, it became evident that the centralised and mechanistic approach envisaged by the regulations for identifying quiet areas would be rather inflexible and potentially difficult to implement effectively. In addition, it became increasingly clear that making the identification of quiet areas an integral part of the action planning process-rather than being independent of it-could be beneficial in ensuring that, from a local perspective, the appropriate areas are identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/5">This revised approach will enable local knowledge to be used to assist the competent authority, both in the identification of quiet areas and in ensuring that appropriate local policies are developed to protect such areas against an increase in noise. This more flexible approach will allow much greater local engagement than the process originally laid down in the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.8/2">The letter sent by CLG officials on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-19">19 October 2009</phrase> in response to requests for information under the Environmental Impact Regulations 2004 explained the reasons for redacting certain elements of the information. This reply has subsequently been subject to an internal review, which upheld those reasons, and has now been referred to the Information Commissioner for independent review.</p>
