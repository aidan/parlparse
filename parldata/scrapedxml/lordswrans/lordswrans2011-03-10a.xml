	<p pid="a.428.5/1">Revisions to the EU electronic communications framework, including the universal services directive, provide for member states to empower national regulatory authorities (Ofcom in the UK) to specify, where appropriate, requirements to ensure that disabled end-users:</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/2">have access to electronic communications services equivalent to that enjoyed by the majority of end-users; andbenefit from the choice of undertakings and services available to the majority of end-users.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/3">The revised framework makes it clear that responsibility for decisions on equivalence reside with the National Regulatory Authority (NRA).</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/4">In order to fully implement these new provisions, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is proposing to make changes to Section 51 of the Communications Act 2003 to clarify Ofcom's power to impose a general condition in relation to equivalence. This will be in addition to the existing powers that Ofcom has under General Conditions of Entitlement (GC 15) and the Universal Service Order 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/5">In addition, DCMS continues to analyse responses to the recent government public consultation on proposals to implement the revised framework, including the new Article 23a of the universal services directive, detailed above.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/6">At the same time, Ofcom is undertaking a review of relay services that support disabled end-users in their use of electronic communications. The objective of this review is to assess whether current arrangements for the provision of relay services are adequate in delivering equivalence to voice telephony for hearing-impaired and speech-impaired end-users (including British Sign Language users) and, if they are not, to consider proportionate solutions. The formal public consultation element of this review will launch in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/7">DCMS's proposed changes to the Communications Act 2003 will enable Ofcom, following the outcome of its review, to mandate the changes that it deems appropriate and necessary to ensure that disabled end-users have access to the equivalence and choice required by the revisions to the framework.</p>

In addition DCMS and Ofcom officials have been in regular contact to discuss implementation of Article 23a of the revised universal services directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.5/2">DCMS and Ofcom officials have co-facilitated discussions on disability and equivalence, including video relay services, at the stakeholder events run during the public consultation on the implementation of the revised EU electronic communications framework. Representatives from the BSL community attended these events and BSL interpreters were provided to facilitate full and inclusive discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.5/3">Ofcom is a key member of the DCMS e-Accessibility Forum established last autumn. One of the forum's key aims is to deliver better access to, and more affordable, adaptive technologies as part of its accessible consumer technology and digital equipment work stream.</p>

	<p pid="a.430.2/1">We provide academies with additional funding in recognition of the additional responsibilities that they have, which would previously have been borne by their local authority. There are two elements to the grant: the proportion that the department can recoup from the dedicated schools grant that would otherwise go to local authorities and the proportion that the department cannot recoup because it is in respect of services normally paid from other local authority funds. For the latter, to avoid academies and local authorities being funded for the same services, we have calculated a total cost, and this is reflected in the amounts transferred from local authorities' formula grant of &#163;148 million and &#163;265 million in 2011-12 and 2012-13 respectively. The consequent adjustments to the baseline for each local authority are available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website at: <a href="http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1112/1011adjusteds.xls">http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1112/1011adjusteds.xls</a> and <a href="http://www.local">http://www.local</a>. communities.gov.uk/finance/1112/1112adjusteds.xls</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/2">These adjustments were based on national averages and estimates, applied equally to all local authorities, as we cannot predict at this stage how many academies and free schools there will be in each local authority over the next two years. The deductions do not affect the schools budget in each authority, which is funded through the dedicated schools grant direct from the department, rather than through formula grant.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.8/1">The sustainability of the Wrexham, Shropshire and Marylebone Railway Company was entirely a matter for the directors of that company to assess, bearing in mind the conditions and restrictions under which they knew they had to operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.8/2">Moderation of competition on the west coast main line will cease on <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-31">31 March 2012</phrase> and the Office of Rail Regulation published its decisions about new applications for access rights on the west coast main line on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-02">2 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.8/3">We look forward to seeing whether bidders for the replacement inter-city west coast franchise, which is due to commence on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-01">1 April 2012</phrase>, are able to make a case for improvements to service patterns in the West Midlands.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.2/1">The Department for Transport set out the broad requirements for the new timetable in its specification for the inter-city east coast franchise when that franchise was re-let in 2007. The department has facilitated the subsequent development of the timetable by Network Rail and train operators by ensuring that co-ordinated service changes are made by the various operators on the route to deliver the right overall service pattern.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.5/1">The Department for Education provided grant of &#163;115 million to school sport partnerships in 2009-10 and &#163;118 million in 2010-11. In October 2010, the Secretary of State for Education announced that he was not going to continue to provide ring-fenced funding for school sport partnerships beyond March 2011. Instead, the Secretary of State is providing &#163;65 million in the school years 2011-12 and 2012-13 to fund the release of a teacher for one day per week in every secondary school to enable them to provide more opportunities in competitive sport for pupils. This is in addition to any support that schools themselves decide to secure from their own budgets in order to meet the national curriculum requirement for PE and sport. The Secretary of State has not yet announced his plans for the 2013-14 academic year.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.5/2">In addition, the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport announced recently the Government's outline plans for a network of school games organisers from September 2011. These organisers will be funded by the Department of Health and Sport England for three days a week to help schools to sign up for the nationwide school games and to increase sporting competitions. Further details on the funding for these organiser posts and their precise roles will be announced shortly.</p>
