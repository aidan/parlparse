	<p pid="a.243.0/1">In May 2009 the Financial Services Authority (FSA) launched an investigation into the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) to consider whether regulatory rules had been broken and what, if any, action was appropriate. The review looked specifically at the conduct of senior individuals at the bank, the acquisition of ABN AMRO in 2007, and the 2008 capital raisings. The FSA conducted the review with assistance from PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-18">18 May 2010</phrase> the FSA closed the enforcement investigation into Johnny Cameron, former executive director of RBS and former chairman of Global Markets. Following the completion of this investigation, Mr Cameron agreed not to hold any senior management positions or undertake full-time employment in the financial services industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-02">2 December 2010</phrase> the FSA announced that a supervisory investigation had confirmed that RBS made a series of bad decisions in the years immediately before the financial crisis, most significantly the acquisition of ABN AMRO and the decision to aggressively expand its investment banking business. Had the investigation led to enforcement action then it would have been usual for the FSA to make these outcomes public. However, the issues investigated by the FSA did not warrant any enforcement action, either against RBS or against individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/4">The FSA cannot publish the contents of the review, because information gathered for the review remains confidential under FSMA. The Treasury does not have a copy of the review. The FSA has, though, proposed producing a publishable report on lessons to be learnt both from the decisions made by the RBS board and executives, and from any failings of the supervisory approach in place at that time. In order to publish such a report, the FSA considers that it would need permission from RBS and other individuals to use confidential information provided by them in the course of the supervisory investigations now concluded, as well as those to whom the information relates.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.9/1">Child development is a priority for this Government because of the difference it can make in the long term to both social justice and social mobility. Good-quality early education is particularly important for children from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to tackle the achievement gap which is already evident from as early as 22 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.9/2">The Government are committed to giving local authorities the flexibility and autonomy to work for their communities and to be accountable to local people for their services, including the quality of childcare. We will achieve this through a new Early Intervention Grant, worth around &#163;2 billion, which brings together funding in a new area-based grant while giving local authorities the freedom to invest in the manner most appropriate to local circumstances. We have removed the top-down performance framework and will replace this with local transparency so that people can hold local authorities to account for delivering high-quality provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.9/3">The Early Years Foundation Stage sets out what all childcare settings must do to support the welfare and learning and development of children from birth to five years old. Dame Clare Tickell is currently reviewing the Early Years Foundation Stage to look at how young children can be best supported through their early years to help give them the best start in life. The review is seeking ways to reduce bureaucracy while ensuring that any new framework both protects and improves the future chances of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. The review will report in spring 2011.</p>

Visual inspection of the pelvis at laparoscopy is the gold standard investigation to diagnose endometriosis. Compared with laparoscopy, transvaginal ultrasound has limited value in diagnosis except for confirming or excluding endometriotic ovarian cysts. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that magnetic resonance imaging is a useful test to diagnose or exclude endometriosis compared with laparoscopy.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.2/1">The increase in the standard rate of VAT is a necessary measure which will raise &#163;13 billion annually in extra revenue-money which does not have to be found from extra spending cuts or other tax rises.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/2">The Government are committed to keeping everyday essentials such as food and children's clothing, as well as other zero-rated items like newspapers and printed books, free from VAT over the course of this Parliament. There are no plans to introduce a new intermediate rate of VAT.</p>
