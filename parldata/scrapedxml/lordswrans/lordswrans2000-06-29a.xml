Following the conference, the Government of Zimbabwe's land reform programme has not been consistent with the agreed principles.

We do not believe that all licensed premises should enjoy later closing times, particularly where this would lead to excessive disturbance to local residents. However, where this can be avoided, extended hours should help ensure that customers leave venues gradually over a longer period and so reduce binge drinking and public order problems arising from large numbers of people arriving on the streets simultaneously. We therefore believe that the scheme described in the White Paper would help to deliver reductions in reports of drink-related offences and in arrests for such offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.5/1">We have now had advice from the Greater London Returning Officer (GLRO) about the first election of the mayor and assembly for London. There were a number of innovations at the election designed to make voting more convenient and to speed up the counting process. These included electronic counting, early voting, opening polling stations an hour earlier than usual and sending a leaflet to every elector containing an election address from each candidate contesting the mayoral election.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/2">Two issues have emerged in relation to the count: the speed of the count and the number of votes classified as &quot;rejected&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/3">Although the count took a few hours longer than originally expected, the GLRO has stressed that Ministers can be satisfied that the first use of electronic counting in an election of this size and complexity went well. There were some technical problems with some scanning machines on the night but a manual count would have taken many more days to complete. In all other respects the electronic counting system worked very well and fully in line with expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/4">A number of other factors also contributed to the slower than expected count. For example, there were a larger than expected number of ballot papers out-sorted by the scanning machines for manual checking before they were entered into the system. It is also the case that as this was the first time that staff had used an electronic counting system in an election, they quite rightly took time to make sure that the new procedures were followed properly. These factors inevitably slow things up.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/5">The other issue was the larger than expected number of electors who chose not to cast a vote in one or more of the elections. Each elector had four opportunities to vote--first choice for mayor, second choice for mayor, constituency assembly member and London assembly member--and each is recorded separately. If an elector chooses not to vote in any of the four ballots, which they have every right to do, this is recorded as a &quot;rejected&quot; vote even though the ballot paper was left blank. For example, if a voter selects a first choice for mayor but not a second choice, and does not vote at all in the two assembly elections, the system would record one valid vote and three &quot;rejected&quot; votes.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/6">Over 6.5 million votes were cast by about 1.75 million electors. Around 0.5 million votes were recorded as &quot;rejected&quot;. These were made up of multiple votes (where the voter had voted more than once in a column), papers where marks identified the voter, blanks where no vote had been cast and uncertain votes where even after manual checking the voter's intention was still not clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/7">The majority of votes classified as &quot;rejected&quot; simply record the fact that many electors chose not to use all the four votes at their disposal. Almost 300,000 people did not use their second preference vote for the mayor, although they did give a first preference. About 130,000 did not cast a vote for a constituency assembly member and about 70,000 did not cast a vote for a London assembly member. About 1 per cent of ballot papers were &quot;rejected&quot; because they were either marked with multiple votes or had marks that identified the voter. This proportion is in line with other elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/8">Over 3 per cent of voters took advantage of early voting. Almost all of them welcomed the opportunity to vote early and said they would use it again if it is available. Just under half of those who used the facility said that they would not have voted on polling day.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/9">About 3 per cent of voters also took advantage of the extended polling hours on polling day and voted between 7am and 8am on polling day. In some polling stations 11 per cent of voters voted in the first hour. Most were on their way to work and 20 per cent said that they would not have been able to vote at another time on the day. More people preferred the polls to open an extra hour in the morning rather than later in the evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/10">A leaflet containing election addresses for all 11 mayoral candidates was produced and delivered to every elector in London, as required by law.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.2/1">If an outbreak is discovered in the United Kingdom, the Forestry Commission will carry out detailed surveys to evaluate the scale of the outbreak. It will then take whatever action is most appropriate, which is likely to be immediate containment followed by felling and burning the infested trees. The necessary legislation to enable the commission to do this is already in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The International Whaling Commission (IWC) will be holding its 52nd Annual Meeting in Adelaide between 3 and <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-06">6 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">At this meeting the UK delegation will be confirming that the UK remains strongly opposed to whaling and that our ultimate aim is to secure a permanent, worldwide ban on all whaling, other than some limited aboriginal subsistence whaling. We will be seeking to build upon the successful outcome of the recent CITES meeting where all whale downlisting proposals were rejected and the primacy of the IWC reaffirmed.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/3">There will be further discussions of proposals put forward by Ireland in 1997 for a package of measures on whaling. The Irish proposals would involve a ban on all whaling, including scientific whaling, outside coastal waters (in effect creating a global ocean sanctuary), with a possibility that countries might authorise whaling under IWC rules within their own coastal waters; there would be a ban on international trade in whale products. In these discussions we will maintain our previous position on these ideas: while we are prepared to discuss constructively all ideas for improving whale conservation, and strongly support some elements of these proposals, we have significant reservations about others, in particular those relating to coastal whaling. Nevertheless, we are prepared to consider interim solutions on the way to our ultimate destination provided that these deliver very real benefits to whale conservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/4">It is, however, unlikely that any progress will be made on the Irish proposals, as the whaling countries and their allies remain opposed to key aspects of them. Japan, in particular, has demonstrated that it is not prepared to consider ending scientific whaling or a ban on international trade in whale products. In these circumstances, the United Kingdom will continue to support the alternative ways of achieving our aims that we outlined at last year's meeting and subsequently reported to the House, <phrase class="date" code="1999-06-09">9 June 1999</phrase>, Official Report, cols. 34-35.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/5">A key element of our approach is support for the creation of regional sanctuaries, and we will be strongly supporting a proposal put forward by Australia and New Zealand to create a South Pacific whale sanctuary. The proposed sanctuary will afford greater protection to whales in a highly important breeding and feeding area and one through which many other great whales migrate. The proposal has been endorsed by South Pacific Forum leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/6">At previous IWC meetings the UK, together with a majority of IWC members, has consistently criticised the whaling operations authorised by Japan under special permits--so called &quot;scientific&quot; whaling. It is, therefore, very disappointing that Japan has presented proposals for discussion in the IWC Scientific Committee to extend these whaling operations to cover two further species, Sperm and Bryde's whales. Under the IWC's parent convention, IWC approval for these proposals is not needed and it is for Japan to authorise whaling under special permit. The UK delegation will, nevertheless, be registering the Government's strong objection to these proposals and will be urging Japan to withdraw them.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/7">There will be further discussion of the revised management scheme (RMS) which is being developed to regulate all aspects of any future commercial whaling. The IWC meeting will be preceded by a two-day working group focusing in particular on the inspection and observation scheme which would form an integral part of the RMS. It is important for the credibility of the IWC for it to be seen to be making progress on the development of the RMS and the UK will continue to participate constructively in this work. We will be seeking a comprehensive RMS that would ensure that, if commercial whaling was ever authorised in future, it could not pose a threat to whale conservation and that catch limits and other rules would be strictly observed. The Government will also be making it clear that our participation in this work is without prejudice to our opposition in principle to commercial whaling.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/8">As we have at previous meetings, the UK will again be expressing its concern about the cruelty involved in whaling; we also intend to raise the inhumane methods used and lack of regulation in the hunts for small cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises that take place in some countries. Other topics on which we hope to make progress include the impact of environmental change and pollution on whales and other cetaceans and the encouragement of whalewatching.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/9">We will report the outcome of the meeting to Parliament.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-06-29a.107.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100284" speakername="Baroness Hayman" colon=":" colnum="107"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000629/text/00629w04.htm#00629w04_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.107.2/1">An animal born on <phrase class="date" code="1996-08-25">25 August 1996</phrase> was confirmed as a BSE case on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-27">27 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">The date is significant because it is after <phrase class="date" code="1996-08-01">1 August 1996</phrase>, when extra control measures on animal feed containing mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM) has been implemented. The State Veterinary Service will be carrying out a special investigation into the background. However, experts have always foreseen that a few cases of BSE could be confirmed in animals born after this date. Indeed, an assessment last year on behalf of SEAC assumed that, by the end of 2000, up to 19 cases born after August 1996 might be identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">There is no risk to food safety as a result of this case. The cow, aged 44 months at the time of slaughter, would not have entered the human food chain because of the rule which prevents animals aged over thirty months. The offspring of this case has already been traced, and will not enter the food chain either.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/4">Furthermore, this animal would have been ineligible for our Date Based Export Scheme (DBES) not only because of its age but, in any event, also because its mother was slaughtered as a casualty--in November 1996--less than three months after the animal concerned was born. Under the DBES the dam must have survived for at least six months after birth of the calf and shown no signs of BSE.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/5">There is an automatic cull of offspring of animals which are confirmed cases of BSE. This would not, however, prevent cases of maternally transmitted BSE where the dam was slaughtered--for reasons other than BSE--when the disease was in it pre-clinical phrase. This could have happened in this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/6">Investigations into the source of infection are continuing. In accordance with standing procedures cohort animals born six months either side of this animal will be traced, placed under movement restrictions and barred from the food chain. The State Veterinary Service will investigate thoroughly the background to this case in order to establish whether anything about the BSE epidemic can be learnt from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/7">This case does not change in any way our view that we have the toughest rules in place to protect public health and to eradicate the disease. The overall BSE epidemic continues to decline along predicted lines. Details for Great Britain are given in the table below (also lodged in the House Library).</p>
