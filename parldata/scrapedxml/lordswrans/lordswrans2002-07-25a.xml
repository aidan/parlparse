	<p pid="a.101.8/1">The market test for the management of Brixton did not attract bids from the private sector, partly because of its poor physical condition and location. The in-house bid, while being impressive, was not affordable. Therefore, instead of operating under a service level agreement, the prison will continue to be run under existing management arrangements. However, a performance baseline will be set with challenging improvement targets and progress will be closely monitored.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.0/1">Under existing procedures, an applicant who is not issued with a statement of evidence form (SEF) to complete prior to their asylum interview is allowed five days after their substantive asylum interview to make further representations before a decision is taken on their asylum claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/2">Those asylum applicants issued with an SEF prior to any substantive interview do not benefit from this arrangement. This is because applicants issued with an SEF form are given 10 working days to submit the completed form to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. We think this gives applicants a reasonable period to set out their claim and time to seek legal representation if they wish for the submission of further supporting evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/3">We have decided that asylum applicants who go through the induction centre process will no longer benefit from the five day period to make further representations. The induction centre process is designed to familiarise an asylum applicant with the asylum procedures, providing the asylum seeker with detailed briefings on different aspects of the asylum process and to explain to applicants what their obligations are. All asylum applicants who go through the induction centre process are told that all information relevant to their claim must be available by the time they are substantively interviewed because decisions on claims will be made shortly after the interview. The interview itself will be scheduled to take place two weeks after the applicant has gone through the induction process. We consider that this two-week period offers the applicant sufficient time to prepare for the interview and gather any supporting information he considers necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/4">This change is in keeping with our commitment to deliver fast asylum decisions, while at the same time ensuring that asylum seekers have a proper opportunity to establish their claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/5">These arrangements do not apply to Oakington or any detained cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.5/1">, On <phrase class="date" code="1991-01-01">1 January 1991</phrase> a concession was introduced concerning over-age applicants for entry clearance, following DNA testing. It enabled those dependent children who had previously been refused entry to join their parents in the United Kingdom owing to doubts about their being related as claimed to re-apply if a DNA test now confirmed the relationship. Among other requirements, they had also still to be dependent upon their parents and unmarried. By July 1991, some 550 cases relating to the concession had been considered, of which 115 were conceded. However, in recent years use of the concession has been nil. Each year between five and 10 people who have already re-applied once and been refused, have applied again, but no applications have been granted under the concession.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/2">Last year, some members made representations to the Home Office, urging that the concession be widened so as to allow people who had been refused as minors to re-apply. The Government had considerable sympathy with their views and with the people yet more who were wrongly refused before the introduction of DNA tests made such decisions much more reliable. However, this situation arose owing to technological advances and we have already attempted, by way of the present concession, to correct any previous injustices resulting from decisions which were taken in good faith on the available evidence at the time. It is now no longer possible to identify those people who may have been wrongly refused due to doubts about their relationship to a United Kingdom sponsor, as many records of earlier decisions have been destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/3">Given that it is not possible to widen the concession, and given that the concession is not being used and has not been used for some time, we have decided that the concession should end. After <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-24">24 August 2002</phrase> no new applications under the concession will be considered. There remains within the Immigration Rules provision for dependent relatives who find themselves in distressed circumstances to apply to join a sponsor in the United Kingdom. Any future applications will instead be considered under the existing Immigration Rules governing dependent relatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The United Kingdom Immigration Service does not operate a border control on the land frontier between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom as this falls within the arrangements set out for the common travel area. The objective of the common travel area is that all the territories should be treated as a single unit for the purpose of travel within the area. A person's arrival in the United Kingdom from within the common travel area is not, therefore, subject to control except under very specific circumstances as outlined in the Immigration Act 1971 and the Control of Entry through the Republic of Ireland Order 1972 which defines those persons who may not enter the United Kingdom from the Republic of Ireland without leave from an immigration officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">People entering Ireland from outside the common travel area, including European Union states other than the United Kingdom, would arrive by sea or air into ports of entry controlled by the Irish authorities. We are confident that the Irish authorities control their borders effectively in accordance with their legislation and the United Kingdom Immigration Service liaises closely with its Irish counterparts on matters of mutual operational interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/3">Any asylum seeker who has sought asylum in another member state of the European Union who subsequently travels to the United Kingdom is liable for return to that country under the terms of the Dublin Convention. This includes people who have sought asylum in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.2/1">British passports are issued to British nationals in the United Kingdom at the discretion of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and, at overseas posts, at the discretion of my friend the Foreign Secretary, both exercising the Royal Prerogative. The essential requirements are that the intended holder has British nationality and is the person described by the personal details to be entered in the passport. Passports are therefore not issued to persons who are not British nationals and/or whose identity cannot be authenticated.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/2">Passport facilities are refused or can be withdrawn in certain other well defined categories, which have been reported to Parliament from time to time. These are:</p>

	<p pid="a.106.2/5" class="indent">(iii) in very rare cases, a person whose past or proposed activities are so demonstrably undesirable that the grant or continued enjoyment of passport facilities would be contrary to public interest;</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-25a.107.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="107"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020725/text/20725w02.htm#20725w02_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.107.2/1">The asylum system is working increasingly quickly, through reforms and increased resources. Measures in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill will continue this process. This means that the employment concession, whereby asylum seekers could apply for permission to work if their application remained outstanding for longer than six months without a decision being made, is becoming increasingly irrelevant. The vast majority&mdash;around 80 per cent&mdash;of asylum seekers receive a decision within six months, and work is continuing to improve that further. An increasingly small number of people, therefore, are entitled to apply for the concession. It is also the case that the great majority of new asylum applicants will have their cases decided within two months and the concession, which dates from a time when lengthy delays were widespread in the asylum system, is therefore no longer appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">We are determined to make it clear that there is a distinct separation between asylum processes and labour migration channels. It is essential that we have a robust asylum process that works effectively and swiftly in the interests of refugees and also is not open to abuse by those who would seek to come here to work. But that does not mean we are ''Fortress Britain''. The Government are putting in place an effective managed migration programme and continue to create a number of work routes to allow more people to come and work here legally in ways which boost our economy. For example, the Government have overhauled the work permits system and the number of work permits issued has doubled over the past two years&mdash;in 2001 we issued work permits to nearly 140,000 people. Other entry routes for people who want to work in the United Kingdom include the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme, the Working Holidaymakers Scheme (under which nearly 40,000 Commonwealth young people a year come to the United Kingdom for a working holiday) and the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (which brings in nearly 20,000 seasonal workers a year). In addition, the Government are currently consulting on schemes to bring in more temporary workers in industries with recruitment difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">Those who are granted refugee status can work immediately, and we welcome the enormous contribution that the skills and knowledge of refugees can make to our society and to our economy. However, our asylum system exists to help those fleeing persecution&mdash;those who want to come here to work must do so through the various economic routes available rather than abuse the asylum system.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/4">We have therefore decided, with immediate effect, that the concession should be abolished. Asylum seekers who already have permission to work will retain that right until such time as a final decision is made on their claim. Asylum seekers who, prior to this announcement, had sought permission to work but have not had a response will have their requests considered in line with our previous policy. We will retain a discretion to grant permission to work for asylum seekers in exceptional cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/5">It is absolutely vital, of course, that all asylum seekers use their time constructively while their case is considered. Therefore, we have also decided to review our current rules governing the voluntary work which asylum seekers can undertake in order to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/6">To demonstrate our ongoing commitment to purposeful activity for asylum seekers, we have also awarded over &pound;900,000 to 135 projects across the United Kingdom for summer programmes to give them the opportunity to get involved in voluntary activities in the community or partake in sports orientated and educational events.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/1">It is not possible to say precisely how many jobs will be affected by the US import restrictions. The volume of UK exports directly affected by restrictions represents less than 2 per cent of the UK steel output. However, some smaller UK companies are more reliant on the US market and will therefore be more significantly affected by decisions on product exclusions. The indirect effects on UK steel producers are potentially more important but more uncertain. In particular, those arising from the possible deflection of exports from other EU member states, which would otherwise have been destined for the US market, are difficult to calculate.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.6/1">Crime rates in the whole of the United Kingdom increased between 1998 and 2002. It is not possible to identify one factor alone being responsible for increase in crime rates in Northern Ireland. As acknowledged in the 2001&ndash;02 chief constable's report, the new electronic recording systems have resulted in a significant increase in recorded crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.6/2">While police numbers in Northern Ireland have reduced since 1998, the Government continue to be guided by the chief constable's assessment of policing requirements. The PSNI and Policing Board are working together to develop an overall human resource strategy which will help to ensure optimum use is made of the resources the PSNI has available. However, the Government accept the analysis of the chief constable, again from his annual report, that the need to devote resources to police public disorder situations places great pressure on the ability of PSNI to respond to other crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.8/2">The Government remain committed to the objective of phasing out the full&ndash;time reserve in line with the Patten report and the implementation plan. The Policing Board has asked the PSNI, in the context of the service's overall human resources strategy, to prepare detailed proposals to be considered by the board. The Government will want to hear the Board's views, in conjunction with the Chief Constable's assessment, before final decisions are made and announced. The Government recognise and regret the effect of uncertainty on officers and their families. We hope that it will be possible to reach conclusions on this issue in the near future. In the meantime, contracts for reserve officers are being renewed within the current guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.8/3">Discussions over the severance terms that will be available to full&ndash;time reserve officers, once a firm decision has been taken to begin the phasing&ndash;out process, have not yet concluded. However, the Government have already given a commitment that the full&ndash;time reserve will be treated no less favourable than the generous terms currently on offer under the voluntary severance scheme.
