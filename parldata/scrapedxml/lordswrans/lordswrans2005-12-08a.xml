	<p pid="a.111.8/1">Article 4(1) of the delegation order places consultation requirements on the designated body, the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy (the POBA), to consult in respect of regulations which it makes under the powers in the order.

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">The International Crisis Group report includes recommendations on:</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/2" class="italic">Ensuring Free and Fair Elections</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/3">The international community, including the UK, is fully focused on ensuring successful elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), as a vital first step towards a sustainable peace, effective and accountable government and long-term poverty reduction in the DRC. The UK is the largest bilateral donor to the electoral process, providing &pound;22.2 million over 18 months. We have made clear to all parties in government the critical importance of keeping to the electoral timetable and ensuring that free and fair elections take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/4" class="italic">Good Governance and Justice</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/5">The International Committee Accompanying the Transition (CIAT&mdash;which includes a number of ambassadors, including from the UK, and the UN) has been putting increasing pressure on the Government of the DRC to tackle corruption. CIAT issued its most strongly worded communiqu&eacute; yet to the DRC Government on this issue this week, and the Secretary of State for International Development has made an offer of further UK support to the army integration conditional upon tackling corruption in the army pay system. DfID supported an audit of the justice sector in the DRC last year, and will be supporting the implementation of the resulting action plan for long-term reform. We also plan to support a programme to rehabilitate the justice system in the east of the DRC, where some of the worst human rights abuses have been committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/6" class="italic">An Integrated National Army and Police Force to Establish Security</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/7">Integration of the army is essential for providing security to the people of the DRC and the region as a whole. The UK is funding two members of the EU Security Sector Reform Mission to the DRC (EUSEC), which is providing advice to the Congolese Government on army integration in the run-up to elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/8">In his recent visit to the DRC, the Secretary of State for International Development offered UK help to provide water, shelter and human rights training to the newly integrated brigades, but only on condition that the Government of the DRC feed their troops properly and accept and implement the recommendations of the EUSEC report on reforming the army pay system to help stamp out corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/9" class="italic">Disarmament, Demobilisation and Repatriation of the Forces Democratiques de Lib&eacute;ration du Rwanda (FDLR)</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/10">The Congolese army, in conjunction with MONUC (the UN mission to DRC), is exerting military pressure on the FDLR to disrupt its operations in the Kivu provinces. We have encouraged MONUC to support the Congolese army in taking a robust stance against the FDLR but are clear that the solution to the problem requires political as well as military pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/11" class="italic">Fulfilment of MONUC's Mandate to Protect Civilians</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/12">The protection of civilians is an integral part of MONUC's mandate. We would consider strengthening MONUC based on a revised concept of operations from the department of peacekeeping operations. We are aware that regional leaders are, like the International Crisis Group, recommending to the Security Council that MONUC be strengthened. The Security Council is considering this.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">There are very few reliable statistics available in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on which to base performance indicators. There has not been a census in the past 20 years and the latest social sector statistics data come from a survey undertaken in 2001 but cover only the third of the country under government control at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">Improving the robustness of the data available on the DRC is an enormous task, and data and indicators relating to street children are one aspect of this. Although not currently doing specific work on performance indicators regarding street children, DfID has been the lead donor (providing both financial and technical assistance) in supporting a participatory poverty analysis in the DRC, which the Congolese Government are using to produce the DRC's first poverty reduction strategy. This included baseline qualitative and quantitative data on how the poor people of the DRC&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;see their lives and how they want them to change. It includes data on the lives of vulnerable children, including street children, and could be used in the future to measure progress in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">DIfD's programme in the DRC (&pound;55 million in 2005&ndash;06) is currently focused on consolidating peace and basic security; re-establishing the rule of law; ensuring free and fair elections; infrastructure rehabilitation; promoting a responsible media sector; and emergency humanitarian assistance and other basic service delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">One of the key elements of DfID's programme in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is supporting the restoration of security and the rule of law. Through this, we are supporting the Belgian NGO RCN&mdash;<i>Justice et Democratie</i> to train justice sector workers in the DRC and undertake rights awareness campaigns. Next year, we plan to fund a large justice sector rehabilitation programme in the east of the DRC, to tackle the prevailing culture of impunity in a region that has suffered widespread human rights abuses. We are also supporting the peace-building work of CAFOD, Christian Aid, International Alert and the Life and Peace Institute in eastern DRC. These international organisations support local community dialogue and human rights groups in some of the most war-torn areas in the DRC. All DfID-funded projects are monitored regularly, including through field visits. The Foreign Office in the DRC also funds several local human rights organisations operating in the DRC under its small grants scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">Under the UK's presidency, the European Union has been looking in the DRC at how to tackle the problem of street children, and particularly of those accused of sorcery (thought to make up around 60 per cent of Kinshasa's street children). In the DRC, the EU has been liaising with the Government on this issue and are developing recommendations for helping to tackle this problem in the DRC and internationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/1">Recent estimates made by the non-governmental organisation IRC (International Rescue Committee) suggest that the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has caused around 4 million extra deaths since it began in 1998. The Internationally Displaced Persons Unit in the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that of the 2.3 million people left displaced at the end of the major conflict in 2003, 1.68 million have been able to return, leaving 1.67 million still displaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/2">However, these numbers reflect overall trends and do not illustrate the increasing short-term displacement observed over the past two years. Save the Children has estimated that there remain tens of thousands of children under arms in the DRC. Fewer that 8,000 have demobilised since the end of the war under the various disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes in operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.8/2">In El Salvador, expenditure to replace loss and damage from Hurricane Stan (complicated by an almost simultaneous eruption of the volcano Ilamatepec) is estimated to be about US $ 356 million (equivalent to 2.25 of gross domestic product (GDP)). This is mostly affecting the peasant agriculture sector and some small and medium-scale tourism industry, which will require re-activation through public sector investment. Expenditure to rebuild damage and losses to water and sanitation as well as transport systems will also be significant.</p>

Some of those impacts extend into 2006. This does not include the value of lost informal employment in small workshops and food production. Some employment in the short and medium term could be generated in reconstruction of infrastructure and the re-activation of small and medium scale economic activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.2/1">The agreement reached at <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> Agriculture Council to reform the EU sugar regime will bring it into line with other already reformed CAP sectors and will benefit many developing countries. But we recognise the negative impacts that the EU reforms will have on some African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) sugar producers, including Jamaica, with preferential access to the EU market.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in his speech at Guildhall on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase> (<a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page8524.asp">www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page8524.asp</a>), we recognise the problem of preference erosion. This does not argue for maintaining the current system, but it does argue for helping the countries affected through the transition. The EU will provide transitional assistance to help ACP producers improve their efficiency in the sugar sector where feasible or diversify into more profitable sectors. Ensuring that credible and timely transitional assistance is in place remains a priority for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/3">We have supported the Commission's proposal of &euro;40 million in transitional assistance for ACP producers in the first year (2006). We have worked hard to secure this amount in the negotiations on the 2006 EU budget, which we hope will formally be agreed by the European Parliament when it meets in a plenary session in mid-December. Further funding will be available over the following seven years, and the UK will fight to ensure it is adequate and timely.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/4">The Department for International Development (DfID) is collaborating with the World Bank to assess the implications of the EU reforms for the rural economy as a whole.

	<p pid="a.121.5/1">We recognise the negative impacts that the reforms to the EU sugar regime agreed at the <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> Agriculture Council will have on some African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) sugar producers&mdash;including Jamaica&mdash;with preferential access to the EU market. However, we welcome the overall reforms, particularly the benefits they will bring to many developing countries. Furthermore, the reforms will see a smaller price cut and a longer adjustment period than originally proposed. This will give the ACP a better opportunity to adapt to the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/2">The EU will provide transitional assistance to help ACP producers improve their efficiency in the sugar sector where feasible or diversify into more profitable sectors. Ensuring that credible and timely transitional assistance is in place remains a priority for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/3">In September 2003, the Department for International Development (DfID) commissioned consultants LMC International Ltd (LMC) to produce an independent report on the impact that EU sugar reform would have by 2015 on the ACP countries that are party to the sugar protocol. This work was updated in June 2005, after the Commission put forward its proposals but before agreement was reached on the shape of the reforms. It therefore assumes a 39 per cent price cut rather than the actual 36 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/4">The sugar industry in Jamaica currently contributes about 1 per cent to GDP (mainly through exports to the EU) and it employs around 30,000 workers (2.5 per cent of the workforce). On the basis of the limited information available to it, the LMC study forecasts that the sugar industry in Jamaica was likely to be unsustainable after the EU reforms. This conclusion was contested by the Government of Jamaica, who have since clearly stated that there will be a viable sugar industry after transition.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/5">A more recent assessment by European Commission funded consultants (who again assumed a 39 per cent price cut) concluded that this would reduce the value of sugar export revenues from 6.9 per cent of total exports to 4.9 per cent and a reduction of 0.8 per cent of GDP over four years. The consultants estimate redundancy costs of &euro;10.5 million, assuming that the government decide to close two of the state-owned mills.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/6">A recent International Monetary Fund working paper estimated that a similar reduction in preferences would result in the loss of 1.4 per cent. of exports and a 0.6 per cent reduction in GDP for Jamaica. But these estimates should be viewed with caution, as they are based on a number of strong assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/7">Currently, DfID is collaborating with the World Bank to assess the implications of the EU reforms for the rural economy as a whole. We are also supporting the Planning Institute of Jamaica to carry out a study on the social impact of the erosion of sugar preferences and how best to help those affected adversely by the changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.3/1">Regional development agencies in England are tasked to address the priorities identified in the regional economic strategies for their regions and to contribute to the delivery of the Government's PSA targets on regional economic performance, sustainable development and productivity/rural productivity, and through these to the delivery of a range of other PSA targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/2">The RDAs' role in contributing to delivery of these PSA targets and regional priorities will vary, reflecting the diversity of the regions. For this reason, the priority attached to particular sectors, such, as food and drink, will also differ, and there are therefore no national targets for specific sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/3">Guidance is provided to RDAs on the framework within which they are expected to operate; for example, to ensure the consultation and participation of regional and local stakeholders. However, the Government recognise that no two regions are the same and have therefore not prescribed one model for delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/4">The Government have developed new performance monitoring and reporting arrangements to reflect this new method of tasking the RDAs. This is designed to establish progress against both outputs and RDA strategic added value activities, agreed with government through individual corporate plans. Progress will be reported on a six-monthly basis and reports made public through each RDA website. In addition a second strand of the performance monitoring and reporting arrangements will be a biennial independent performance assessment of each RDA, carried out by the. National Audit Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/5">RDAs contribute to delivery of Defra's quality regional food strategy through their regional programmes of support for the quality regional food sector. This is managed through the department's Cross-Cutting Group on quality regional food, made up of representatives from Defra, the RDAs, Food from Britain, the Countryside Agency and the Food Standards Agency. The purpose of the Cross-Cutting Group is to agree Defra's national programme and the RDA's regional programmes of support for the quality regional food sector and to monitor and co-ordinate delivery of those programmes to ensure that there is no overlap or double-funding of activities and to share best practice. Targets are based on the nature of the activity; for some it relates to the numbers of producers taking part in an activity and for others it relates to the amount of additional income generated from participation in a particular activity. An independent economic review of the our quality regional food strategy, carried out by ADAS earlier this year, showed that government support for the sector has been effective and that those firms that have benefited from the strategy have performed better than non-beneficiaries. A copy of the evaluation is at <a href="http://www.statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/evaluation/env.asp">www.statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/evaluation/env.asp</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.8/1">The Government's intention is to assess whether the present levels of data being reported are sufficient to give a credible indication of the Government's performance on implementing their timber procurement policy. A sample of departments is considered sufficient to make such an assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.1/2" qnum="HL2589">Why the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs plans a sample assessment rather than a full report of timber procurement, given that in the 2002 Framework for Sustainable Development the department stated that &quot;a cross government report cannot substitute for comprehensive performance reporting by individual departments&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">Individual departments are required to report annually on their timber purchases as part of Sustainable Development in Government Reports. Some observers have suggested that the data being reported are not adequate to effectively measure the Government's performance on implementing their timber procurement policy. In considering their response to these observations the Government want to establish how accurate the data being reported are, what value they have, what other options should be considered and what the costs and benefits would be. The sample assessment will indicate how accurate the currently reported data are and what is involved in collecting it. It is considered unnecessary to produce a costly and time-consuming report on all departments to obtain this information.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.5/1">The trade in goods and services deficit with the EU widened between 2000 and 2004, mainly due to stronger growth in imports than exports, rather than a fall in the value of exports. Indeed, exports to the EU increased by &pound;6.3 billion between 2000 and 2004, which support domestic employment. In a dynamic economy such as the UK's, the employment structure continually changes, and it is difficult to ascertain specific trends. However, between 2000 and 2004, employment in the UK increased by 1 million jobs.</p>
