	<p pid="a.175.2/1">Defra's support for British Food Fortnight in the past two years has come through the funding that it has made available to Food from Britain (FFB) to deliver a range of activities in support of the quality regional food sector in England. Wherever possible, FFB has supported British Food Fortnight by ensuring that the activities that it delivers in support of quality regional food sector coincide with the fortnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">In addition, last year FFB funded the production of a guide that included information on how retailers and the food service sector could support British Food Fortnight. The guide also included information on how buyers could source quality regional food and drink and the importance of linking tourism with quality regional food and drink. This year, FFB funded an update of the guide and provided &quot;in kind&quot; public relations support that helped generate substantial media coverage for British Food Fortnight. According to figures provided by the organisers of British Food Fortnight, the guide was distributed to 24,000 shops, pubs and restaurants.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/3">As well as funding from Defra, both the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Department of Health have provided seed corn funding to British Food Fortnight. The funding has been used to produce resource packs for schools which contain guidance and suggestions to schools for activities about healthy British foods and link to the Healthy Schools programme, Food in Schools programme, School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme and 5-a-day programme. This year, DfES publicised British Food Fortnight on its Growing Schools website.</p>

Figures from the organisers show that information on how to incorporate food-related activities into the national curriculum was sent to 26,000 schools and that 24,000 shops, pubs and restaurants were given details on sourcing and promoting British produce.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.2/1">No targeting proposals, geographical or otherwise, have yet been made for the successor to the England Rural Development Programme, which will run from 2007 until 2013. Objectives for the successor Rural Development Programme have yet to be agreed. However, we will want the programme to focus on key policy priorities to ensure that it delivers value for money and effective outcomes; so appropriate targeting of the programme's resources will be necessary. Proposed objectives and targets for the successor Rural Development Programme will be subject to a public consultation that will begin either towards the end of this year or in early 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/2">Similarly, negotiations on the next round of structural funds are ongoing, and the arrangements for future programmes are still unknown.

	<p pid="a.177.5/1">We know that the UK is the world's fourth largest importer of wood products. However, with the exception of unlicensed species included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) we are unable to estimate how much illegally logged timber is coming into the UK, as timber is not identified as legal or illegal at ports of entry. That will change however with the implementation of the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation, which recently reached political agreement. It will prohibit the entry into the EU of illegal timber products from countries that enter into partnership agreements with the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.5/1">The EU delegation stated its position on coastal salmon fisheries in its opening address and in subsequent negotiations at the NASCO annual meeting in June. It indicated that the problem was coming under control in member states but that some problems persisted. It had therefore commissioned a report,</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/2" class="indent">&quot;to examine these fisheries in EU waters and see what else needs to be done&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/3">It indicated that if it proved necessary it was,</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/4" class="indent">&quot;fully committed to taking measures to reduce these fisheries or even to consider whether these fisheries should be brought to a complete end&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/5">The UK has supported that approach. No representations have been made to NASCO subsequent to the annual meeting in June. UK scientists led the initial preparation of the EU review of mixed stock fisheries for Atlantic salmon in European Community waters, excluding the Baltic Sea, which was submitted to the European Commission in August. We are not aware what progress has been made by the European Commission since then.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.5/1">Under our reforms for personalisation, school improvement partners and the new Ofsted inspection regime will challenge every school to demonstrate effective planning and delivering of tailored teaching and learning for every child, in particular for pupils who have fallen behind age-related expectations. We also expect all local authorities under their duty to raise educational standards to use their national strategies consultants and other school improvement staff to promote, monitor and spread best practice about personalisation of learning to ensure that all schools meet the needs of parents and pupils in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.5/2">Ofsted will use the same framework to inspect primary and secondary schools. During inspections, inspectors will evaluate how well teaching and resources promote learning and address the full range of learners' needs and the extent to which programmes or activities match learners' aspirations and potential, building on their prior attainment and experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.5/3">Our White Paper, <i>Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&mdash;More Choice for Parents and Pupils</i>, published on <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase>, set out an additional &pound;60 million in each of 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 that would be available to authorities to enable them to support the schools in primary and secondary sectors that had the greatest number of pupils who had fallen behind and faced the greatest challenges in improving their performance. The White Paper also announced &pound;335 million, specifically earmarked in the dedicated schools grant (DSG), to be invested by 2007&ndash;08 to provide secondary schools with the resources to deliver personalised learning for 11 to 14 year-olds. Details of the methodology used to distribute the funding between local authorities and the actual allocations for each authority will be announced as part of the wider announcement on school funding allocations for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 later in the year. Guidance for local authorities on the distribution of funding between schools will be made available at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.2/1">The UN estimates that 3.4 million people in Darfur are in need of humanitarian assistance. In recent weeks there has been a marked increase in violence perpetrated against civilians and attacks on humanitarian and commercial convoys throughout Darfur. There has also been a significant increase in clashes between the belligerent parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/2">Road access for humanitarian agencies in west Darfur has been all but cut by persistent banditry. The UN has positioned air transport in Geneina to meet urgent humanitarian needs and is confident that essential operations can be maintained. In central Darfur, the upsurge in active fighting has seen news waves of localised displacement. The UN is confident that it can meet immediate humanitarian needs with existing resources. Contingency planning for prolonged disruption is under way by the humanitarian agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/3">We have made it consistently clear to all sides that the resumption of violence is unacceptable and that attacks must cease. The AU-mediated Abuja talks are the only prospect for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. We fully support that process, at which a UK observer is present.</p>
