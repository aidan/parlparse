We are currently working with our international partners to find the best way to take this forward at CHR 61.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.8/1">The Government are strongly committed to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The treaty strikes a balance between non-proliferation, disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The obligations taken on by nations becoming a state party to the treaty apply equally to the nuclear weapon states and the non-nuclear weapon states. The UK delegation to the review conference will work to strengthen all three pillars of the treaty. The delegation will stress the need for a stronger and more effective counter-proliferation regime. We will emphasise the importance of compliance with the treaty and will promote the adoption of safeguards. We will emphasise too the UK's good record on nuclear disarmament, and will produce a final report of the studies that we have conducted on the verification of nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.8/2">The UK supports universalisation of the treaty. However, the non-signatories to the treaty, India, Pakistan and Israel, have no obligations to fulfil in respect to it, and the review conference is not in a position to put obligations upon them.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.2/1">Police can arrest an individual under the Terrorism Act only if they reasonably suspect that individual to be a terrorist. Arrests are not made on the basis off any generalisations or assumptions, but are frequently the result of months of intensive intelligence gathering and surveillance.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.2/2">Statistics published in the report under Section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 do not support allegations that the terrorism stop-and-search powers are used to target particular communities. Although statistics relating to an individual's faith are not collected, the proportion of Asians stopped and searched under these powers fell in 2003&ndash;04. It is important to remember that use of the powers can only be authorised in places and at times where they are necessary for the prevention of terrorism, and that these authorisations are subject to scrutiny by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.2/3">The Home Office recently published a draft manual on stop and search, which stated that &quot;officers must not discriminate against black and minority ethnic communities&quot; when exercising anti-terrorist stop and search powers. This echoes the instructions on these powers given by the police codes of practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.5/1">The diversion of old telephone numbers was carefully considered when it became clear that it would not be possible to transfer these existing numbers to the new Home Office headquarters at 2 Marsham Street. The move or diversion of old numbers to the new location could not be achieved at reasonable cost and would not have enabled the implementation of a single range of telephone numbers for the Home Office London estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.5/2">To support the number change, staff were advised to let their contacts know their new telephone numbers in advance and, where possible, to leave voicemail messages so that callers would hear a message giving the appropriate new telephone number. These two steps were felt to be a better way of getting new numbers known. Simple call diversion would not inform callers of the change and would lead to loss of contact when, inevitably, support for the old numbers ceased.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.0/1">As the Government have outlined in this year's Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report (HC 372 para. 7.52), they are progressing their plans for a lorry road user charge (LRUC), accompanied by offsetting tax cuts, due to be phased in from 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.0/2">Since announcing plans for LRUC in the 2001 Pre-Budget Report (Cm 5318), the Government have completed an initial public consultation and worked closely with the haulage industry in developing its requirements. In particular the Government have taken into account developments in other countries in Europe, including Austria, Germany and Switzerland. It has been supported by advisers and industry experts in road-charging initiatives around the world. The Government have published regular progress reports, in April 2002, April 2003 and March 2004, setting out, in detail, how plans are being developed, as well as a procurement prospectus in May 2004 and a discussion paper in January 2005. Copies of these documents are available in the Library of the House, and from the HM Customs and Excise website.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.0/3">The LRUC programme is now well into its procurement phase, and Customs have now started detailed discussions about their requirements with short listed bidders. In line with good practice guidance for government procurement projects, these requirements do not specify particular technologies, which will be selected from the best value-for-money solutions offered by bidders. The requirement for distance-measuring equipment does not include location tracking.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.0/4">Progress report three set out the requirement for public sector resources and a range of operational activities, including assurance, enforcement, communications and marketing, which Customs would incorporate with their other operational responsibilities or within an LRUC management authority. Customs are continuing to work on estimates for the costs and resource requirements for LRUC. Much will also depend on the technical solutions proposed by bidders, which will only become clear following commercial negotiations. Final decisions have yet to be taken. To speculate at this stage in the procurement would prejudice the Government's commercial interests in this process.</p>

	<p pid="b.40.0/1">LRUC will apply to all lorry operators regardless of their nationality and therefore enable the Government to charge foreign lorry operators using UK roads for the first time. It will be offset by a reduction in fuel duty, available on duty-paid fuel purchased in the UK and used in any lorry that falls within the scope of LRUC. In this way, lorries of all nationalities driving in the UK will pay their fair share in LRUC charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/2">The Government have stated that the total tax paid by the UK industry will not rise as a result of introducing LRUC and its offsetting tax cut. As was made clear in response to the noble Earl on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. GC 88), when LRUC is in place, the Government will also be able, for the first time, to take decisions about taxation levels which affect the haulage industry separately from the decisions they take about general motoring taxes, on a Budget-by-Budget basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/3">Two methods of delivering the fuel duty reduction have been identified: a new chemically marked fuel that would be sold at a discounted rate to haulage operators, or a repayment scheme whereby operators declare how much fuel they have used in each chargeable vehicle. In progress report three, following consultation with the oils and haulage industries, the Government identified a repayment scheme as the lead option. Provided that adequate fraud mitigation measures can be put in place, there will be no need for the fuel to be a different colour.</p>

GC 89), his idea would probably not be compliant with EU law. It involves a requirement that lorry operators buy goods (in this case fuel) in a particular member state. It seems likely that this would be regarded as having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on imports and exports, creating practical as well as economic obstacles to the free movement of goods or services, contrary to the provisions of the Treaty Establishing the European Community.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/2">The Government believe that, in a competitive market, the fuel distribution and refuelling infrastructure would adapt to meet any potential increase in the demand for fuel in the south-east of England. However, this proposal would have implications for the commercial viability of fuel retailers in other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/3">The Government have estimated that the total amount of revenue (including both excise duty and VAT) lost in Great Britain to cross-border shopping of diesel fuel by both UK-based and overseas hauliers in 2002 was &pound;300 million. No estimate has been made for later years. Details are published in <i>Measuring and Tackling Indirect Tax Losses</i> (HM Customs &amp; Excise, December 2003), a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. No assessment has been made of the impact of the noble Earl's proposal.</p>

The regulations both provide expressly (Article 2) that investigations by OLAF shall not affect the powers of the member states to bring criminal proceedings. Reports drawn up, following an investigation by OLAF in one or more member states, are sent to the competent authorities of the member state(s) in question. The director of the office is also required to forward to the judicial authorities of the member state(s) concerned the information obtained by the office during investigations into matters liable to result in criminal proceedings.

	<p pid="b.42.5/1">The Energy Saving Trust (EST) was established by the Government in 1992, after the Rio Earth Summit. It is a private, non-profit organisation grant-funded by Defra to support its household energy efficiency activities. These activities are aimed at increasing demand for energy efficiency through raising awareness, providing advice and support for action. They also support the supply of energy efficiency products and services to meet this demand by developing partnerships, stimulating innovation, supporting training and providing accreditation.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.5/2">The Carbon Trust (CT) was launched in April 2001, as part of the climate change levy package, to take the lead in improving business and public sector energy efficiency and support the development of a low carbon economy in the UK. The CT is also a private non-profit organisation, receiving grant funding from Defra to support its activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.5/3">The EST currently receives grant funding from Defra of about &pound;25 million per annum for its energy efficiency work. CT currently receives grant funding from Defra of about &pound;44 million per annum. Both trusts also have a range of other financial arrangements with devolved administrations and other government departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.5/4">The trusts' remits and activities do not overlap. The CT has a focus towards industry and innovation, while the EST focuses on household energy use. These sectors have different needs and require different approaches. The trusts work closely and effectively together on some areas where they have shared or interacting interests; for example in the public sector and at different stages of the market transformation and innovation process.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-23b.43.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="43"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050323/text/50323w05.htm#50323w05_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.43.2/1">An interim review was undertaken by the Environment Agency during 2003-04, using data collated during the period up to and including 2002. The review was completed in April 2003 and concluded that no change was warranted to the bylaws introduced in 1999, but that there was a case for further examining the need for additional controls on exploitation of salmon in a number of rivers.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.2/2">In 2004 the Environment Agency reported on its more recent review of salmon stock conservation. This highlighted that salmon stocks are in a depleted condition in the majority of rivers in England and Wales. It recorded that further controls on exploitation are required to protect stocks under particular pressure, although such controls, on their own, will not resolve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.2/3">The England and Wales spring salmon bylaws expire in April 2009. The Environment Agency will therefore carry out a full review in 2008. This will include the status of stocks of spring salmon and the levels of control and any other measures required.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.8/1">There are no guidelines restricting transport managers to a maximum client base of five small vehicle operators. The legislation requires that a transport manager must have &quot;continuous and effective responsibility for the management of the transport operations of the business&quot;. There is nothing to prevent a person acting as transport manager for more than one operator but the traffic commissioner will need to be satisfied that in each case the manager is able to exercise &quot;continuous and effective responsibility&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.8/2">The financial standing requirement for holders of standard national and international goods operator licences is prescribed by European Directive 96/26/EC (as amended). The directive specifies an amount of &euro;9,000 for one vehicle and &euro;5,000 for each additional vehicle. For member states which have not adopted the euro, provision is made for these limits to be revalued into national currencies at five-yearly intervals. The current sterling equivalents based on the rate of exchange on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> are &pound;6,200 and &pound;3,400 respectively.</p>
