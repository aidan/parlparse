	<p pid="a.105.2/1">The Home Office have received a range of representations and correspondence concerning the use of the &quot;Mosquito&quot; ultrasonic dispersal device. Five were from Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents, 15 Questions have been asked by three Members of Parliament in the House of Commons and 13 items of correspondence from members of the public and local authorities have been received. Of the representations and correspondence received, five were concerned that the device might breach a person's human rights and two were concerned with the legality of the device. Other questions and correspondence received referred to the use of the device and whether the Home Office will provide guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/2">The Home Office encourages local agencies to consider the full range of innovations, schemes and practices intended to reduce crime, the fear of crime and anti-social behaviour. It is for local agencies such as the police and local authorities to decide on the most appropriate interventions to tackle anti-social behaviour based on their knowledge of what works best locally, adopting a tiered approach to tackling anti-social behaviour using a blend of measures to provide a proportionate response.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/3">The Home Office does not recommend or promote any commercial ultrasonic dispersal device or venture and at the present time does not have any plans to take further action on this matter.</p>

This was published in November 2007 and can be found on the internet at <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/07-08/070898iii.pdf">www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/07-08/070898iii.pdf</a>. A copy is also available in the Library of the House. Due to the complexity of the two contracts, neither provided separate costs for the individual vessels.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">The Central-Local Concordat, agreed between the Government and the Local Government Association (LGA), on behalf of local authorities in England, was signed in December last year. It commits both parties to a framework of principles to secure a new relationship between central government and local government. Discharging the rights and responsibilities of central government and local government set out in the concordat will require major changes in the behaviour and practice of both parties. The operation of this agreement will be monitored on a continuing basis, through renewed central-local partnership arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2">We are discussing with the LGA how we take forward the concordat, focusing on its guiding principles and specific commitments. These include encouraging councils to make effective use of their power to promote the well-being of their area; enabling local government to conduct a growing share of the business of government; central government consulting and collaborating with councils in setting national policies and proposing legislation; reducing the burden of appraisal and approval regimes and the volume of guidance issued by central government to local authorities; supporting and encouraging strong leadership and effective partnership working at local level; and increasing local democratic accountability of key public services, in particular the police and health services.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/5">The department is working to ensure that each new local area agreement is informed by a joint strategic needs assessment of the local population's health and well-being needs carried out by the local authority, primary care trust and their partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">The details of how carbon capture and storage (CSS) will be included within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) are yet to be finalised. None the less, the current proposal is that CCS installations will not be required to surrender allowances for CO2 that has been captured and stored. In future phases with a full or high degree of auctioning, CCS plants would not be required to purchase allowances for CO2 stored. Consequently, CCS would be covered in the same way as other abatement technologies already within the scope of the scheme, ensuring that the EU ETS remains technology neutral. It is not currently envisaged that CCS should be incorporated into the scheme by means of credits or that it should in any way affect the role of CDM within the EU ETS.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which has the responsibility for regulation of medicines in the United Kingdom, operates a pharmacovigilance system for all licensed medicines and has achieved a widespread reputation for excellence in this area. Reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions directly from healthcare professionals and patients (through the yellow card scheme) and from pharmaceutical companies forms one of the most important data sources used by MHRA. Newly licensed medicines undergo intensive monitoring through this scheme and are assigned a &quot;black triangle&quot; in product literature to signify this to healthcare professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">Biosimilar medicinal products are new medicines that have been designed to be similar to existing &quot;biological&quot; medicines. Because these medicines are complex and may not be completely identical to the existing medicine, the MHRA intensively monitors approved biosimilar medicines and assigns them black triangle status. It is also mandatory for the applicant to submit an appropriate risk management plan at the time of the initial marketing authorisation (MA) application, which is assessed to ensure that the applicant has demonstrated that adequate arrangements are in place for continued safety evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/3">The MHRA encourages MA holders for biosimilar products to give them a brand name so that there is no confusion or inadvertent substitution between the generic and original medicines, in relation to prescribing or dispensing. The MHRA also encourages the use of brand names for adverse drug reaction reporting in relation to biosimilar medicines and has recently promoted this message in a bulletin to healthcare professionals (<I>Drug Safety Update</I><I>, </I>February 2008).</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/4">The British National Formulary (BNF) usually reflects the safety information contained within the summary of product characteristics that relates to the product and includes black triangles where appropriate. The MHRA has raised the subject of biosimilar medicines with the BNF, highlighting the MHRA policy to intensively monitor these medicines. The MHRA also provides the BNF editorial team with a copy of each monthly edition of its bulletin <I>Drug Safety Update</I>, in which prescribing and adverse drug reaction reporting issues for biosimilar medicines were raised very recently. However, the BNF takes advice on this from expert clinical advisers and the BNF Joint Formulary Committee, on which the MHRA is represented.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/5">The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain's <I>Professional Standards </I><I>a</I><I>nd Guidance </I><I>for the </I><I>Sale </I><I>and </I><I>Supply </I><I>of </I><I>Medicines </I>provides advice to pharmacists on the supply of prescribed medicines. This states that, except in an emergency, a specifically named product should not be substituted by any other product without the approval of the patient, or carer and the prescriber, and in the case of hospital drugs, the approval of the therapeutics committee, or in line with other similar locally agreed protocols.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">The local authority was the accountable body for the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) and was required to have in place effective systems to ensure that NRF was spent correctly and appropriately. Government offices (GOs) were charged with reviewing the effectiveness of the local strategic partnership (LSP) and helping the LSP to identify learning needs and to access appropriate support. The review was expected to take into account the level of LSP spend against its allocation and whether the NRF spend had been targeted at activities agreed by the LSP and had had an impact on achieving outcomes in accordance with the local neighbourhood renewal strategy, including national floor targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">Once the review was completed GOs prepared a report for the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit (NRU), which included a rating of each LSP based on a traffic-light system. In cases where the LSP performance was assessed as &quot;red&quot; or &quot;amber/red&quot;, NRU worked with the GO and LSP to identify and implement a support package aimed at improving delivery within the local area.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.0/1">The Immigration Rules prevent a man from bringing in a second or subsequent wife with him to the UK if another woman has already been admitted to the UK as his wife and that marriage has not been dissolved. All those who seek leave to enter the United Kingdom for the purpose of settling as a spouse of a person resident in the UK or a British citizen must have a visa in this category for entry. If the person does not hold this visa, they will be refused leave to enter.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">Although the current Immigration Rules relating to spouses prevent two wives from seeking entry to the UK in this capacity, there are ways in which all parties to a polygamous marriage may be legally present here. For example, a second wife may come to the UK legally through an alternative migration route other than in her capacity as a spouse. In addition, the present prohibition for second wives in the Immigration Rules did not exist before 1988.</p>
