Other nations also provided additional resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/2">NATO repeated its commitment to Afghanistan at the informal meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Brussels on 8-<phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>. NATO has made progress implementing Stage 2 expansion of ISAF to western Afghanistan and is now aiming to accelerate this in order to provide support for the parliamentary elections scheduled for Spring 2005. Italy announced at the meeting that it will run the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Herat and also the related foward support base, in co-operation with the United States and other nations. But NATO still requires further resources to complete Stage 2. We will continue our efforts to support NATO in pressing potential contributors to commit part or whole PRTs or wider force enablers.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.2/5">There were 265 newly diagnosed cases of cancer in England in 2001 which were coded to cranial nerves (based on ICD10 code D33.3) with the morphology code for neurilemmoma (M9560/0) which includes acoustic neuroma. (Therefore not all of these may have been cases of acoustic neuroma).</p>
	<p pid="a.118.2/6">These figures, aggregated at the 3rd and 4th digits of the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD10), were published in <i>Cancer statistics: registrations, England 2001</i> Series MB1 no. 32. London: The Stationery Office, 2004, which is available on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme-health/MB1-32/MB1-32.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme&ndash;health/MB1&ndash;32/MB1&ndash;32.pdf</a></p>

	<p pid="a.120.0/1">When in an equal value claim there is a dispute as to whether work is of equal value as mentioned in Section 1(2)(c) of the Equal Pay Act 1970, the tribunal must hold a &quot;stage 1 equal value hearing&quot;. There are standard orders which a tribunal may make at a stage 1 equal value hearing. The aim of those standard orders is that certain factual information is exchanged and agreed between the parties. At that hearing the tribunal will also decide whether it wishes to require an independent expert to prepare a report on the question of whether the claimant's work is of equal value to that of the comparator. The independent expert does not have to prepare the report at this stage; the tribunal is just deciding whether it will require the independent expert to do so later in the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/2">In most cases the tribunal will only actually require the independent expert to prepare the report after the &quot;stage 2 equal value hearing&quot;&mdash;that is after certain facts have been exchanged and agreed as explained above. The logic is that the independent expert needs to have certain facts available to him before he can start to prepare his report. However, occasionally there may have been an inadequate exchange of factual information by the parties after the stage 1 equal value hearing. That is where the tribunal's power in rule 6(2) of Schedule 6 comes in. In such circumstances the tribunal may, if it considers it appropriate, order an independent expert to assist the tribunal in establishing the facts on which he is to base his report. The situation described in rule 6(3)(c) is where insufficient factual information has been disclosed by a party, therefore the independent expert would have insufficient facts on which to base his report.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/3">Rule 6(3)(c) is not addressing a lack of ability on the part of the independent expert, but is instead addressing a failure of one of the parties to the proceedings to disclose sufficient factual information.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.0/1">The Government recognise that the stirring up of hatred against people because of their religious beliefs represents a real problem in England and Wales. Since the events of September 2001 in particular there has been clear evidence of words and behaviour from a small minority being used to stir up hatred against religious groups. Following the introduction of the offences of incitement to racial hatred there has also been evidence that extremists use religious terms to identify the targets of their threatening, abusive and insulting words and behaviour, to avoid prosecution were they to use racial terms to identify the same people. In evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences, which reported in April 2003, several organisations, including Association of Chief Police Officers and representatives of faith communities, gave examples of this type of activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/2" qnum="HL130">What penalties exist for those manufacturers and retailers of food supplements found guilty of placing on the market after July 2005 products which contain ingredients which are currently legal but which are omitted from the lists of permitted ingredients established by the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/1387); and</p>

	<p pid="a.129.0/1">The penalty in the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 for manufacturers and retailers found guilty of placing on the market after July 2005 products containing ingredients omitted from the lists in the regulations is a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. This equates to &pound;5,000. This is the maximum penalty and it will be for a court to decide ultimately on the exact penalty on a case by case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/2">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health (Miss Melanie Johnson) met with manufacturers, retailers and consumers of food supplements in July and September 2004. Following those meetings the Health Food Manufacturers Association and Food Standards Agency officials have met with officials from the European Food Safety Authority and the European Commission to discuss the implications of the Food Supplements Directive. It was made clear at those meetings that before further ingredients may be added to the lists in the Food Supplements Directive they must be assessed for safety through submission of a dossier and have received a positive opinion from the EFSA. The European Commission explained that a member state would be in breach of the directive if it allows ingredients and sources not listed in the directive to remain on the market without a dossier being submitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/3">The United Kingdom Government have nevertheless made clear that providing an ingredient was on the market before July 2002 and a dossier has been submitted to a member state that ingredient can remain on sale in the UK pending an opinion by EFSA following its safety evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/4">The EFSA will publish its recommendations for maximum permitted levels for nutrients allowed in food supplements in early 2005. The European Commission has indicated that it will bring forward its proposals, based on EFSA's advice, after the summer of 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">Vitamins and minerals not permitted for sale after July 2005 are those which do not meet the requirements of the legislation. The purpose of the Food Supplements Directive is to ensure the safety of food supplements for the benefit of consumers and for supplements to be freely traded across the European Union, which will benefit the food supplements industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">The EU directive came into force in July 2002 and the United Kingdom Government were required by UK and EU law to implement it by the end of July 2003. Food supplement regulations for England were approved by the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-03">3 July 2003</phrase>. A regulatory impact assessment on the Food Supplements Directive which assessed the impact of the directive on businesses and consumer choice was laid in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/3">The number of products which may be removed from the market after July 2005 will depend on the number of dossiers submitted by companies to the Food Standards Agency or to other member states, and those not already covered by the positive lists in the directive and regulations. The UK will give derogation for products to remain on the market where dossiers have either been submitted to the UK or to another member state pending a positive opinion from the European Food Safety Authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.3/2">Children with learning or motor disability have an increased incidence of gastroenterological problems.

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">The Government acknowledge that beekeepers are concerned about a number of risks that may arise from its proposals to reduce inspections for certain diseases over the coming three years. However, we believe our proposals are reasonable in the light of current disease status and available means of control. We will continue to work closely with the National Bee Unit and beekeeping associations to manage the changes envisaged and the risks which have been identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.5/1">The Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) is likely to be amended when the OTM rule is replaced with a system of BSE testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/2">Work is continuing in parallel both to ensure that there is a robust testing system in place so that the OTM rule can be amended and to ensure that export restrictions are eased and the Date Based Export Scheme can be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/3">Any changes in the domestic OTM rule are unlikely to come into effect until the latter half of 2005. Changes in export restrictions are not expected to come into effect until late 2005.</p>
