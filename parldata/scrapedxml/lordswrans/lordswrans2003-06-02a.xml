The first such recommendation (made on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-11">11 February 2003</phrase>) does not identify the NHS and educational establishments as specific markets. However many aspects of the provision of electronic communications networks, electronic communications services and associated facilities to educational establishments and the National Health Service are likely to fall within one or more of the markets identified in the recommendation.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.5/1">Regulation 2(2) and 2(3) define who is &quot;the responsible person&quot; in relation to any nuclear premises which is defined in Regulation 2(1) to cover three types of premises. Who is the responsible person depends on the type of premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/2">The responsible person in relation to the first type of &quot;nuclear premises&quot; (namely a licensed nuclear site on which nuclear material or other radioactive material is used or stored) is the holder of the nuclear site licence. Under the Nuclear Installation Act 1965 such a licence can only be granted to a body corporate. Therefore, the responsible person will be a body corporate (and not a company director).</p>

Therefore, if a company is using or storing the material, the company (and not its directors) will be the responsible person.</p>

Suppliers are expected to produce 10.4 per cent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2010&ndash;11 and have three ways in which to comply with the obligation: through supplying eligible renewables electricity to customers in Great Britain; buying renewable obligation certificates independently of the power that gave rise to their issue; and/or paying a buy-out price to Ofgem rather than supplying renewables electricity.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.6/1">Before qualifying for Bellwin grant in any year an authority must have spent 0.2 per cent of its budget on activities that would be eligible for grant: 0.2 per cent of budget is referred to as &quot;the Bellwin threshold&quot;. There is no proposal to change this provision of the scheme. However in the past, because of delays in the process of notifying authority budgets to the department the threshold was calculated using a proxy arrangement whereby the previous year's budget was uprated by the average increase in standard spending assessment for the following year. Since the standard spending assessment is no longer part of the local government finance arrangements we have waited until we had details of authorities' budgets and then calculated the threshold on the basis of 0.2 per cent of the actual budget. In accordance with normal arrangements officials consulted all authorities before promulgating the thresholds for 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.2/1">Since September 2002, we have ensured that the standards required to qualify as a teacher include an understanding of how pupils' learning can be affected by their physical, intellectual, linguistic, social, cultural and emotional development. A number of these issues may affect young carers. Newly qualified teachers are required to complete an induction period during which they liaise with parents and carers to further develop their professional knowledge.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">The flexibility of the citizenship framework allows schools to choose how to organise and teach citizenship in a way that suits their pupils' needs. Pupils are taught about taking a responsible role in the community through participation in both school and community-based activities during citizenship education. Teachers can therefore draw on the role of young carers in discussions about responsible action and community service.</p>
