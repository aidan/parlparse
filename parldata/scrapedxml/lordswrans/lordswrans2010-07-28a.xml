Through its published guidance, the EFSA's GMO panel applies a case-by-case approach, treating each application as unique. Fixed-test protocols are requested by the EFSA, especially for scientific issues where harmonisation of test methods is possible and validated test methods are agreed upon by international risk assessment bodies: for instance, on the testing of chemical substances. However, the guidance is not completely prescriptive about the use of specific study protocols, and does not stipulate a mandatory list of exactly which tests should be done as the requirements will vary according to the type of genetically modified product being assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.6/2">The EFSA also stipulates that the studies that are submitted for evaluation should be carried out according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) principles of good laboratory practice, where applicable, and accompanied by a formal statement of quality assurance. The EFSA's approach to risk assessment of food from genetically modified plants is consistent with that of the Codex Alimentarius.</p>

	<p pid="a.355.2/1">The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the centralised body which has responsibility for carrying out risk assessments for genetically modified food and feed in the European Union. EFSA has completed assessments of three of these genetically modified (GM) crops, namely MON810 maize, MON863 maize; and GT73 oilseed rape, including the results of the relevant animal feeding studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.2/2">Applications for the authorisation of LY038 maize and for LY038 x MON810 maize were withdrawn by the applicant, citing a reduced commercial interest in these products. No application has been made in relation to a GM crop called A580.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.2/3">An application for renewal of authorisation of genetically modified Roundup Ready soya is currently being evaluated by EFSA. In 2005, 2006 and 2009 the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) considered published reports of potential adverse effects on rats and mice that had been fed Roundup Ready soya. The ACNFP advised that it was not possible to draw conclusions based on the design and reporting of these studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.2/4">EFSA considers any concerns raised regarding the safety of genetically modified crops, whether authorised or undergoing authorisation, provided these are supported by reasoned arguments or scientific data. In the case of MON810 maize and MON863 maize, EFSA has provided additional advice following the publication of critical assessments of the feeding studies. The Food Standards Agency has also sought advice from the ACNFP on these reports. To date, none of the concerns raised have caused EFSA or ACNFP to alter their opinion on the safety of these crops.</p>

	<p pid="a.356.5/1">The Olympic Delivery Authority has committed to placing 350 apprentices on the Olympic construction programme by 2012. The ODA is working with contractors to ensure that those apprentices who are unable to complete their training on the site are given the opportunity to do so elsewhere. This represents an increase on the initial target of 100 apprentices, set in February 2008, before the Big Build phase when significant numbers would work on site. The ODA has not set specific targets for particular trades.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/2">At the end of June, 242 verified apprentices had been employed by contractors working on the Olympic construction programme. Of these, 90 were electrical apprentices. The ODA understands the term &quot;buildings craft apprentice&quot; to cover construction apprenticeships in general, and the remaining 152 apprentices on site at the end of June were in trades including plant maintenance, brickwork, formwork, plumbing, scaffolding, and carpentry.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/3">The Government have not advised the ODA on the number of apprenticeships it should offer, as the ODA targets are based upon its construction programme's forecasted employment and skills demands, and at 3 per cent of the peak workforce, improves the current levels of apprentices within the construction workforce in London (1 per cent of all manual trades) and will match or exceed the UK average for the rest of the UK (2.5 per cent of the construction workforce). The ODA will continue to focus on meeting, and where possible exceeding, its targets.</p>

A reformed system will make it easier to ensure that drug and alcohol users receive the help and support they need to overcome their dependency and get back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.5/2">Drug and alcohol addiction is one of the most damaging root causes of poverty. Helping people who are trapped on benefits through drug and alcohol addiction so that they can recover and find employment is a top priority for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.5/3">It is estimated that 80 per cent of problem drug users-those using heroin or crack cocaine-are on working-age benefits, including jobseeker's allowance and disability-related benefits, often for many years<sup>1</sup>. Receipt of disability-related benefits is not dependent on the basis of a diagnosis or condition, but rather the effect that the diagnosis or condition has upon a person. For instance entitlement to disability living allowance is not dependent on a diagnosis or condition but relies instead on the care and/or mobility needs arising.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.5/4">Drug or alcohol dependency does not of itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits. To qualify for incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the personal capability assessment. This assesses the effects of a person's condition on their ability to carry out a number of everyday activities relevant to work. People with a recorded diagnosis of alcohol or drug dependency may have other diagnoses, for example mental illness, which result in their incapacity for work.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.5/5">For those customers who are claiming the employment and support allowance, this is not paid on the basis of a specific medical condition. It is paid at different rates depending on an individual's circumstances and where they are in the claim process. Claimants undergo a work capability assessment to ascertain their capacity for work.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.0/1">The current terms are set out in the Civil Service Compensation Scheme (CSCS), a statutory scheme made under the Superannuation Act 1972. The compulsory terms are the most generous and apply in cases of compulsory redundancy. Compulsory early severance (CES) terms apply where individuals are aged under 50 or are aged between 50 and 60 and have less than five years' service. CES terms provide a severance payment based on age and length of service which is generally capped at three years' pay. For certain individuals in service before 1987, the cap does not apply and the basis of calculation may be more generous. Compulsory early retirement (CER) terms apply where individuals are aged between 50 and 60 and have a minimum of five years' service. CER terms provide immediate payment of pension (and associated pension lump sum) without the normal reduction for early payment, plus a service enhancement of up to six and two-thirds years, plus a lump sum of six months' pay. A payment of six months' pay is made to those aged over 60 (and who are able to access an unreduced pension).</p>

It is anticipated that the review will be completed by the end of 2010. It is proposed that the report will be made available in the first instance to the House of Lords EU Committee that commissioned it. Arrangements for its wider publication will be considered after the Committee has had an opportunity to consider it.</p>

	<p pid="a.365.6/1">Many overseas students wish to undertake some work while studying, to offset some of the financial demands of living and studying abroad.</p>

The Department for Work and Pensions is committed to ensuring that NINos are issued, used and controlled correctly. A new adult NINo allocation process was introduced in April 2001, and was strengthened in July 2006 with the introduction of a Right to Work test for all employment-related applications. In order to be allocated a NINo for employment purposes, an individual has to prove their identity and prove they have a right to work in the UK; students with a right to work will be able to demonstrate this. Where the applicant is unable to establish any of the above then a NINo will be refused.</p>

The aim of that work will be to ensure that the right balance is struck between providing a user-friendly route for bona fide students and education providers and keeping out those who would seek to abuse the student system. The work will also take into account the Government's overall objective to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands by the end of the parliamentary term. That evaluation will include consideration of the current rights of students to work whilst studying in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.368.0/2">The Government have not made a formal assessment of the effect of not adopting common global accounting standards on systemic financial risk and regulatory arbitrage. The impact would be determined by the nature of the divergence and the mitigating steps taken by standard setters and prudential regulators. Standard setters, for example, would have the option of increasing transparency of the impact. Prudential regulators have a range of tools for dealing with the risk of regulatory arbitrage, for example, by adjusting pillar 1 rules so that they are accounting-regime neutral. At present, the risk of regulatory arbitrage is constrained by the similarity between the International Financial Reporting Standards and the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles standards for accounting for financial instruments.</p>

The number of out-of-country main applicants through the tier 1 (general) route will be held flat from the equivalent period for 2009-10. We are also introducing an interim limit on the number of migrants who can be sponsored by employers through tier 2 (general).

	<p pid="a.379.2/1">The UK funds a project in northern France (the Global Calais Project) which advises potential illegal entrants of the realities of life in the UK and promotes and provides reintegration to their home countries as an incentive for them to return. Reintegration assistance up to a maximum of &#8364;4,000 per returnee is available, depending on the type of assistance chosen.

	<p pid="a.379.5/2">While we believe that the UK compares favourably with other countries, both in terms of speed and quality, we recognise there is room for improvement. Shortly, we will be carrying out an internal project to explore new ways of speeding up the asylum process.

Charter flights play an important part in effecting volume returns to countries from where asylum intake is high or where there are a significant number of foreign national prisoners (or disruptive immigration offenders) awaiting return. The UK Border Agency operated 14 charter flights in the first three months of this financial year. Regular destinations include Jamaica, Nigeria and Afghanistan. We have worked during this period with the authorities in Iraq to agree processes for documentation and return. This resulted in the successful removal of 54 individuals to Baghdad by charter flight in June. Further flights to Baghdad are planned during 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.383.2/3">voice and advocacy-articulating and championing peoples' views, needs and preferences, especially in reaching individuals that are excluded;community engagement and infrastructure;designing and providing highly personalised services based on authentic insight into their clients' needs;providing knowledge, expertise and insight to support GP consortia in making well informed commissioning decisions;harnessing social capital through the mobilisation of volunteers; andcommunity organisations supporting big society, enabling communities to take control.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.2/4">Voluntary organisations have a long history of delivering high-quality, user-focused, innovative and cost-effective National Health Service, public health and social care services. These services can often reach those hard to reach groups that statutory organisations cannot. Many voluntary organisations work across both health and social care and are therefore well placed to support better integration with local authorities across health and social care. We are confident that voluntary organisations have the potential to do much more and the White Paper offers opportunities beyond just service provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.2/5">We are committed to ensuring that voluntary organisations find it easier to deliver services. Our governing principle is that &quot;any willing provider&quot; that meets National Health Service standards within NHS prices should be able to compete on a fair playing field, with patients having the control to choose the service and provider that best meet their needs. In making commissioning decisions, GP consortia will work with, among others, voluntary organisations to ensure the services commissioned best meet the needs of their patients and the local population.</p>
