	<p pid="a.281.8/1">It has been estimated by the British Art Market Federation, and by independent research commissioned by the IPO (report published in 2008), that full implementation of resale right in the UK may increase the size of resale right payments (currently around &#163;2.5 million per annum) about fourfold. It also seems reasonable to assume that the cost of administering resale right payments will rise in line with this. The total likely payment for full implementation of resale right was estimated in the 2008 report as being around &#163;13 million per annum on auction house turnover of &#163;1,789 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.2/1">Cambridgeshire County Council currently estimates the total cost of this project to be &#163;161 million. When the Department for Transport granted the scheme full approval in 2006, the total cost was &#163;116.3 million and the department agreed to provide a capped contribution of &#163;92.5 million, which remains unchanged. At that time the scheme was due to complete in February 2009. I understand that the contractor's latest construction programme shows that it expects to complete building the final section of the route in January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/2">The issue of how best to assess the delivery of the Cambridgeshire guided bus scheme, and how the contract for the scheme has worked, is a matter for the council. The council has recently agreed to undertake an independent public review into the scheme once construction has been completed. In the mean time, we recognise that there are a number of lessons that can be learnt from this scheme. As part of a wider review looking at how to make light rail and other such schemes more cost-effective, the Department for Transport will draw on the Cambridgeshire experience, among others.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.3/1">There is no statutory definition of &quot;low incidence special needs&quot;. The department commissioned Peter Gray of the Special Needs Consultancy to conduct a national audit of support, services and provision for children with low incidence needs, which was published in 2006. The categories included in the project specification were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.299.3/2">multisensory impairments;severe visual impairment;severe/profound hearing impairment;profound and multiple learning difficulties;severe autistic spectrum disorders; andsevere behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.3/3">The report pointed out that the concept of low incidence special educational needs was not simply related to rarity but also has a functional element, with an emphasis on the complexity of the task of supporting and providing for the children concerned and the nature of the skills and organisation that are required to ensure that all their needs are properly addressed. These children will typically be provided for through local authority support services and in units or resource bases attached to mainstream schools, maintained special schools or in independent or non-maintained special schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.3/4">The department collects data on the numbers of children with statements by type of need but does not distinguish by severity. However, being given a statement itself is an indication of the severity and complexity of need. As of January 2010 there were 88,400 children with statements for types of need listed above (see Table 11 of <I>Statistical First Release: Special Educational Needs in England</I>, January 2010 (DfE, 2010) <a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000939/index">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000939/index</a>. shtml). The total number of children with statements in January 2010 was 220,890.</p>
