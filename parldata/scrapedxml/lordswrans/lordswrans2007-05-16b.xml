	<p pid="b.35.11/1">The MoD has funded the King's College London Centre for Military Health Research (KCMHR) to undertake major research into the health of those who have served on recent operations. Ongoing work includes multiple theatres, including Afghanistan. At a time when a growing number of personnel have been deployed to more than one operational theatre, it is becoming clear that it is difficult to attribute a subsequent mental health condition (which in many cases may not present itself until months or even years later) to service on a specific deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.11/2">The new research mirrors that carried out by KCMHR on members of the British Armed Forces who served in the Iraq war in 2003, and which resulted in major pieces of work published in 2006, details of which can be found on the KCMHR website: <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kcmhr/information/publications.html">www.kcl.ac.uk/kcmhr/information/publications.html</a>. This research showed that there was no increase in psychiatric disorders seen in regular personnel deployed on the first phase of Operation TELIC compared to the rest of the UK Armed Forces and that the later Operation TELIC deployments examined were not associated with any worsening of mental health consequence compared to the initial Operation TELIC group.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.11/3">A new questionnaire to gather data on those who have served in Afghanistan has already been piloted and funding approved, and the data collection phase of the research will be commencing shortly. It should be noted that the result of this research will not be available for a period of years.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.11/4">A tri-service overarching review of operational stress management was carried out in 2004-05 which recognised the issues surrounding operational and combat stress. The Armed Forces have been tasked with adopting its recommendations as appropriate within their single-service provisions.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.17/1">DfID supports the Government of Afghanistan in their plan to meet all of the millennium development goals (MDG) by 2020. This includes MDG 3, promoting gender equality and empowering women, and MDG 5, improving maternal health. DfID is working with the Government to ensure that gender is fully addressed and integrated into the Afghanistan national development strategy (ANDS), which will provide the framework for development over the next five years. We have seconded an adviser to the ANDS secretariat, who will work closely with UNIFEM and the Ministry of Women's Affairs to ensure that gender issues are addressed. Overall, we provide 80 per cent of our current assistance (estimated to be &pound;107 million in 2007-08) directly to the Government of Afghanistan. This helps, for example, to pay salaries of staff in the Ministry of Public Health, as well as in other government departments, and in this way supports healthcare provision in Afghanistan, including family planning and maternal health. In addition we also support gender equality at provincial level and through NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.17/2">DfID has provided &pound;17 million over the past three years (2003-06) to the Afghan Government's national solidarity programme (NSP). This programme has led to the creation of 16,000 community development councils (CDCs). Under this programme, DfID is pressing for more effort to be placed on improving women's participation in the councils. Female-only CDCs have already been established and have become fora for a discussion on issues that women could not previously discuss openly in mixed gender CDCs (for example on health, domestic violence and literacy).</p>
	<p pid="b.35.17/3">So far, DfID has also provided &pound;20 million to the Government of Afghanistan's micro-finance and investment support facility of Afghanistan (MISFA). This provides micro credit loans to more than 311,583 beneficiaries across 22 provinces, over 75 per cent are women. This supports women in developing sustainable livelihoods and therefore promotes economic independence. MISFA plans to expand to all 34 provinces by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.17/4">DfID has also provided &pound;4 million to support quick impact projects (QIPs) in Helmand. These are identified by the Afghan Government, and some benefit women directly. One particular example is the construction of new midwifery facilities in Lashkar Gar.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.17/5">DfID is also supporting a five-year women's empowerment programme from 2005-10, implemented by Womankind, through our Civil Society Challenge Fund. This &pound;500,000 initiative is focused on promoting women's equal participation in governance; building awareness of women's rights among civil society and policy makers; and on providing educational, health, community and psycho-social support to those women affected by violence and conflict.</p>

A recent re-examination of those figures suggests that the value of pollination of the commercial crops used to derive the earlier figure has dropped by some &pound;20 million. This is due to a reduction in some of the crops used in the calculation, such as apples, cherries and runner beans. However, these figures do not take into account crops such as borage which rely on honey bee pollination. The value of pollination of wild plants by honey bees has not been calculated.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.50/1">Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is a generic name given to a number of major colony losses reported by no more than around 60 commercial bee farmers spread across 25 states in the USA. Currently, the UK is not suffering from similar bee health-related problems on the same scale. Nevertheless, the National Bee Unit (NBU) at Defra's central science laboratory is maintaining close contact with researchers from the USA who are investigating possible causes. Although it is not possible to develop contingency plans for unknown threats, the NBU's activities are devoted to identifying new threats and mitigating the impact of known pests and diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.50/2">A 2001 economic evaluation of Defra's bee health programme estimated the value of honey bees to commercial pollination at approximately &pound;120 million, although changes in crop areas and values suggest that the value may now be lower. No valuation of the role of honey bees in relation to the pollination of wild plants is available.</p>

For a regional organisation to become a member, the charter would need to be amended. Even if the charter was amended to allow that, it would not be in the interests of either the EU or the UK to replace current representation on the Security Council with a single EU seat.

	<p pid="b.35.83/1">At the March 2007 Transport Council, the presidency and Commission reported on the current difficulties with the current contract negotiations with the private sector concessionaire bidding to run the Galileo public/private partnership (PPP). The immediate cause of the breakdown in negotiations is disagreement about industrial work-share between the partners in the bidding consortium.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.83/2">As a result of the delays, the council gave the bidding consortium a deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May 2007</phrase> to take the necessary measures to allow the resumption of effective negotiations. At the same time, the Commission was requested to prepare an analysis of the consortium's response and to develop alternative options for taking forward the Galileo project. A more detailed discussion on these issues will follow at the June Transport Council, where it is expected that EU member states will be asked to decide whether to continue with the current negotiations or bring them to an end and request the Commission to explore in detail alternative options for proceeding with the project.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.83/3">Galileo has been defined and agreed as a civil system since the project's inception. While Galileo's open service, like that of GPS, can be accessed by all and therefore could be used by military forces, Galileo remains a civil programme under civil control. This has repeatedly been confirmed by the EU Transport Council, most recently in its October 2006 council conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.116/1">Organised crime networks in Europe, as elsewhere in the world, have become global. South-eastern Europe and the western Balkans are far from immune, not least because of the region's strategic location on the traditional heroin trafficking route from central Asia to Europe, as well as the widespread economic deprivation throughout the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.116/2">Networks of organised crime traverse the Balkans. They have expanded from narcotics trafficking into human trafficking, human smuggling, counterfeit currency production, cigarette smuggling and trade in other illicit materials such as pirated CDs and DVDs. These problems are common to all the countries of the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.116/3">Kosovo's provisional institutions of self-government and police force, with the support of the international community, are working to combat organised crime. We are confident that these efforts will be maintained and intensified following implementation of a status settlement in Kosovo. Indeed, clarity over its status will help Kosovo develop the modern and robust police, immigration services, border controls and customs procedures it needs successfully to deal with these problems, as well as to start to make progress on long-term economic development.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.119/1">The Government agree that music and dance should not be restricted by unnecessary licensing regulations. We do not believe that the current licensing regime is damaging these sectors or that the current regulations are unnecessary. The Licensing Act 2003 has removed unnecessary bureaucracy, such as the need to renew licences or apply for several different permissions to put on events. More venues are also now able to put on performances involving more than two musicians. Recent research has indicated that most venues wanting to put on live music have secured a licence and very few highlighted licensing requirements as a barrier.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.119/2">We are monitoring the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 and will consider changes only where firm evidence demonstrates unintended and detrimental consequences. That is why we set up the Live Music Forum to monitor the impact of the Act on live music and to recommend how the Government might better promote live performances. We look forward to receiving its report shortly.</p>
