	<p pid="b.245.2/1">The UK has been a strong supporter of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NePAD) since its creation in 2001. The principles and objectives it embodies (such as African leadership and commitment to good governance and human rights) are critical to achieving poverty reduction and sustainable development in Africa. These are core themes for all DfID's work in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.2/2">In addition to its advocacy role, the NePAD secretariat has also initiated a number of regional programmes. DfID has provided &pound;500,000 towards the work of the secretariat, as well as supporting some specific programmes. This includes &pound;6 million to the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) to increase agricultural productivity; $30 million to the Investment Climate Facility to make Africa a better place to do business; and $20 million to the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa to support project preparation and co-ordination. DfID is a major funder of the Africa Peer Review Mechanism to promote good governance, initiated by NePAD, and has contributed around &pound;2.7 million to date (including to support the process in Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique and Uganda). DfID has also provided &pound;325,000 to support the African Union/NePAD Consolidated Plan of Action on Science and Technology.</p>

	<p pid="b.248.0/1">Defra and State Veterinary Service (SVS) officials are informed when importers of avian raptors apply for licences, and Defra officials are informed when importers apply for Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) permits.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/2">Copies of any special import licences issued are sent to the Animal Health Divisional Office which covers the area where a bird will become resident. This will alert the local divisional veterinary managers of the bird's arrival and specify the necessary checks on quarantine that will need to be made, as well as any additional tests that may need to be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/3">Birds for commercial import from other member states of the European Union do not have to go to quarantine.

	<p pid="b.249.2/1">Natural England advises that a small amount of public money was spent on developing a captive breeding programme for red kites in 1989. The exact sum is not known, and the attempt to breed these birds in captivity was unsuccessful so no captive bred specimens were released into the wild. No programme for breeding any of the other species has been undertaken using public money by Defra, Natural England or their predecessors.</p>

	<p pid="b.250.2/1">Releases of red kites as part of the Natural England (formerly English Nature)&mdash;RSPB Reintroduction Programme (1989 to present) have been carried out in accordance with the internationally agreed IUCN (World Conservation Union) guidelines. These include a requirement to consult local landowners, as well as other interested individuals and organisations, before birds are released.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/2">Licences would not be required for the release of the red kite, common buzzard, goshawk, golden eagle, merlin, and peregrine falcon, as they are species which are ordinarily resident in Great Britain. Releases of some of the species listed (for example, the goshawk) have been carried out by individuals or private organisations. My department has no records about consultation with local landowners in these cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/3">The release of the white tailed eagle (also native to Great Britain), Harris hawk and lanner falcon would require a licence. To release these species without a licence would be an offence under Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/4">The department has no records of licences having been issued in England for the release of artificially-bred specimens of the white tailed eagle, Harris hawk and lanner falcon. Associated impacts of any such releases would be considered, as appropriate, as part of the licensing decision process.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/5">Non-governmental organisations are at liberty to propose, conduct and participate in release programmes. For example, the red kite reintroduction programme is a joint RSPB and Natural England endeavour. Natural England, as the licensing authority, would need to be satisfied that it was proper to license any such releases.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/6">Any conditions imposed on a licence, including any conditions relating to artificial feeding, would be specific to that licence.</p>

The percentage of UK-produced goods changes regularly as a result of seasonality, value for money incentives, changes to the product specification and supplier. The country of origin of some products is indeterminate because they are manufactured using a number of ingredients, and other products, such as fresh fruit and vegetables, are sourced seasonally from a variety of countries. We can, however, state that under the new food supply contract, 44 per cent of pork (excluding gammon and bacon products), beef and lamb (by value) has been procured from British farms.</p>

This was the first time that any part of the service police had been subjected to such a rigorous and in-depth independent examination, applying national bench-marking for police investigations. HMIC identified a number of areas where it felt that improvements could be made and these questions are linked to the report's recommendations. This important work is ongoing, including an assessment of resource implications. The report also identified several opportunities for developing tri-service working and we intend to examine how the lessons learnt can be implemented across the RN and RAF SIBs.</p>

The initiative is divided into three phases. The first phase (2006-07 to 2008-09) will identify the key climate information needs to support achieving the millennium development goals. The second phase (2009-10 to 2011-12) will scale up good practice and the final phase (2012-13 to 2014-15) will focus on large-scale implementation to build climate resilience in Africa.</p>

These include the Three Diseases Fund in Burma, in which poverty and conflict issues have similarities to those found in PNG.

	<p pid="b.260.0/1">The total number of staff currently employed by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) is 3,174.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/2">More than 200 inspectors are trained in all aspects of cross-compliance inspections currently carried out by RPA<sup>*</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/3">The majority of RPA inspectors have a formal agricultural or related qualification ranging from national certificate/NVQ 3 to postgraduate level and/or a strong farming background. Others have become inspectors after gaining relevant skills and experience elsewhere in Defra/RPA. All inspectors undertake a rigorous internal training programme including mapping and measuring, arable and livestock skills, the requirements of each statutory management requirement falling within RPA's remit and the full range of GAECs. Training is conducted both on and off farm, with input from Defra/external experts as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/4">The Environment Agency is responsible for carrying out inspections in relation to SMRs 2, 3 and 4 (groundwater, sewage sludge and nitrate vulnerable zones); and the State Veterinary Service for inspections conducted under SMR 10 (restrictions on the use of substances having hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists in farm animals); a13-15 (control of animal disease and 16-18 (animal welfare).</p>

	<p pid="b.260.3/1">The work being done by volunteers for the natural environment is hugely valuable and much appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.3/2">Volunteering England's 1997 <I>National Survey of Volunteering</I> showed that 48 per cent of the adult population are involved in formal volunteering work (that is, through an organisation). Of this number, 5 per cent did so to conserve and enhance the natural environment. These figures are based on the main purpose of the group or organisation through which the person volunteers. The latest version of this survey&mdash;the National Survey of Volunteering and Charitable Giving&mdash;is due later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.3/3">An objective in the England Biodiversity Strategy is to increase time spent and number of people volunteering for biodiversity conservation. The indicator for this shows positive progress; for example, the number of Wildlife Trust volunteers has increased by 28 per cent from 21,600 to 27,700 over the five years to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.3/4">In addition, Natural England is also working to increase the ability of individuals to take action for the natural environment. Nearly 2,000 volunteers work with Natural England on its national nature reserves and sites of special scientific interest. In 2005-06 the value of this work was assessed at &pound;1.8 million. Natural England has a target to increase volunteer involvement by 5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.262.0/1">British Waterways has powers under the Transport Acts 1962 and 1968 to undertake waterside regeneration and property development in the vicinity of its waterways. It has a strong track record of achievement and innovation in delivering both urban and rural regeneration through its involvement in property investment and development.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.0/2">Its 1,700 properties are currently valued at &pound;520 million and generated income of &pound;63.2 million last year. British Waterways keeps its operational and investment property portfolio under regular review to ensure that it continues to provide a long-term income stream for the future maintenance and improvement of its waterways. This in turn provides social, economic and amenity benefits and contributes to the British tourist industry.</p>
