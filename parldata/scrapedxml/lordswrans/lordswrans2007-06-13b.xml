	<p pid="b.251.8/1">First-class treatment is provided to our patients at Selly Oak by NHS and military doctors and nurses. The military-managed ward achieved initial operating capability, with 24 military nurses assigned to it, before Christmas. It will achieve full operating capability, with 39 military nurses in post, this summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.8/2">Working together with the NHS, we have introduced a wide range of improvements to the clinical and nursing care and the welfare arrangements provided for military patients in the Birmingham area. Alongside the Defence Medical Welfare Service, which supports patients and relatives, there are two embedded military formation liaison officers, who maintain the linkage between patients, next of kin and the patient's military unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.8/3">We and the NHS respond to concerns expressed by patients and will make further improvements as and when necessary. We accept that military patients would prefer to be nursed together. This happens where that is clinically appropriate. The works project under way in the military-managed ward will partition off a section of the ward to help that to be achieved. The project should be completed shortly.</p>

The association with the Birmingham New Hospital project, which is due for completion around the turn of the decade, will also make a major contribution to the development of the RCDM.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.11/2">Against that background, we are considering what performance indicators or benchmarks should now be put in place to enable independent authorities, as well as ourselves, to be satisfied that our vision of the RCDM as an internationally recognised centre of excellence has been achieved.

	<p pid="b.251.14/1">Financial assistance for UK residents affected by terrorism overseas is available through the British Red Cross Relief Fund for UK Victims of Terrorism Abroad. The fund was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-17">17 May</phrase>, following a &pound;1 million donation from the Government. The British Red Cross makes immediate, small payments in two phases to those seriously injured or bereaved, to meet the immediate costs which may arise.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.14/2">Similarly the US Government directly reimburse victims of international terrorism for actual out-of-pocket expenses associated with their victimhood, such as funeral or medical costs, through their international terrorism victim expense reimbursement programme. The Canadian Department of Justice offers limited financial assistance to victims of serious violent crime abroad for unanticipated and exceptional expenses resulting from their victimhood. Victims of terrorism may also be eligible for this assistance. We are not aware of any compensation scheme in the US or Canada for victims of terrorism overseas, although victims are of course able to pursue remedies through the civil courts, as did the families of the victims of Pan Am 103 (Lockerbie).</p>
	<p pid="b.251.14/3">There is currently no compensation scheme for UK victims of terrorism overseas. However, the European Council Directive 2004/80/EC of <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-29">29 April 2004</phrase> entitles EU nationals who are victims of &quot;violent intentional crime&quot; within the EU to apply for compensation from the member state on whose territory the crime was committed. The levels of compensation are determined by the member states individually and vary considerably.</p>

	<p pid="b.251.20/1">Periodic global assessments of the state of the world's coral reefs are carried out by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and others, such as the World Conservation Monitoring Centre. The effects of climate change are considered in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. UK non-governmental organisations and scientists are very active in coral reef conservation work. The Government are, therefore, aware of the particular pressures on the world's coral reefs.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.20/2">Several surveys of cold-water coral reefs in UK &quot;home&quot; waters have been carried out over the past decade. Large-scale reefs have been found on, for instance, Rockall and Hatton Banks. Unusual coral reef structures, known as the Darwin Mounds, have been found to the north and west of Scotland. Evidence of damage from trawlers at this site led to the Government seeking fishery management measures through the common fisheries policy. These measures are now in place, and there is evidence that fishing activity has decreased greatly as a result. Similar management measures are in place to protect coral reefs on the Rockall and Hatton Banks.</p>

	<p pid="b.251.41/1">At the April 2004 General Affairs and External Relations Council EU foreign Ministers expressed their commitment to ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and facilitating the reunification of Cyprus through economic development. At the council's request, the Commission produced two draft regulations to deliver on this commitment: one enabling preferential direct trade between the north and EU member states on a tariff quota system and the other disbursing &euro;259 million of aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.41/2">The aid regulation was agreed in February 2006, and projects funded from this package have already begun. This package represents one of the highest levels of EU aid per capita. The money will be used to fund practical projects, developed in partnership with the Turkish Cypriot community. These will improve the quality of life of ordinary Turkish Cypriots and bring them closer to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.41/3">On trade, successive expansions of the Green Line regulation have allowed the export of an increasing variety and volume of Turkish Cypriot goods across the Green Line. However, despite efforts by a number of EU presidencies, there has to date been no agreement on the direct trade regulation. The German presidency, together with the Commission, continues to take this forward. We will continue to support efforts to liberalise trade between northern Cyprus and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.41/4">In practice, however, the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community can only be fully lifted through a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. As it did during the negotiations on the Annan plan, the EU continues to support the efforts of the UN to broker such a settlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.251.44/1">Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights&mdash;and the UK reservation to that convention&mdash;is incorporated into the Human Rights Act 1998. Article 2 provides that UK citizens shall not be denied the right to education. There is currently no equivalent EU legislation. One of the main aims of the Bologna process is to improve the recognition of all higher education qualifications across the European Higher Education Area (EHEA).</p>
	<p pid="b.251.44/2">A key mechanism is the Lisbon recognition convention. The convention does not lead to automatic recognition of qualifications but requires ratifying states to ensure that there are fair processes for the assessment of qualifications from other countries. This could and should include qualifications awarded by institutions in the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.251.86/1">The security situation in Darfur remains precarious, with increasing banditry and inter-tribal fighting. The Sudanese Government resumed bombing villages in Darfur in late April, killing and injuring a number of civilians. These attacks showed little regard for human life and violated UN Security Council Resolution 1591. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has strongly condemned them. We call upon the Sudanese Government to stop these attacks and on all parties to the conflict to stop attacks and other violations of the ceasefire immediately. All sides must commit to the resolution of the conflict or face further measures in the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.86/2">We remain very concerned about the humanitarian and security situation in eastern Chad. We are particularly concerned by increasing levels of internal displacement, due to inter-ethnic fighting and cross-border attacks from Darfur; protection of refugees and internally displaced people; the security environment for humanitarian agency operations and the fragility of the natural resource base to support displaced populations. We support renewed French efforts to get a peacekeeping force into Chad.</p>
