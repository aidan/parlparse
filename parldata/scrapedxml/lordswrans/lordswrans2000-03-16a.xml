	<p pid="a.218.3/1">The Government fully appreciate that the provision of high quality piers in convenient locations is essential to the development of sustainable Thames passenger services. That is why our Thames 2000 initiative includes the construction of new or replacement piers in at least four key locations (Blackfriars, Tower, Waterloo and Westminster). The transfer of the management of key central London piers to the London Transport subidiary London River Services Ltd was an important step towards integrating piers and river services fully into the capital's public transport network.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/2">Responsibility for managing river services after July 2000 will fall to the new Mayor of London. The mayor will have a statutory duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting and encouraging use of the river and especially river passenger services. It will be for the mayor to consider whether to carry out a review of piers.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.8/1">My department works alongside the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development, exploring methods for predicting the impact of environmental stresses on stability and defining the options for UK government response through, for example, environmental policy, aid programmes or defence diplomacy. The seriousness of these issues is reflected in the high priority that environment is given in government policy, domestically and internationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.8/2">In addition, we support multilateral work to mitigate the effects of natural disasters. The UK is the second largest donor of the United Nations' Environment Programme (UNEP), which takes a leading role in assessing the environmental impacts of natural disasters. Its recent activities include work in Venezuela and Mozambique. UNEP's most recent assessment of the effect of natural disasters is contained in its Global Environment Outlook 2000 report, which was published in September 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.8/3">While it is not possible to attribute any specific natural disaster to human-induced climate change, it is expected that global warming will be accompanied by changes in extreme weather events. This conclusion has arisen from the results of part of an &pound;8 million-pa research programme funded at the Hadley Centre by my department, which is continuing.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.8/4">To combat the effects of climate change, we have just announced a programme for reduction in UK greenhouse emissions by 21.5 per cent, almost double our 12.5 per cent target under the Kyoto Protocol. This programme could also achieve the more difficult national goal of a 20 per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.2/1">Welfare reform is central to this Government's agenda of modernisation, and to its goals of tackling poverty and social exclusion. Today the Prime Minister is announcing plans for the next stage of welfare reform, which will radically change the way the Government provide support for people of working age. The aim is to accelerate the move from a welfare system that primarily provides passive support to one that provides active support to help people become more independent, based on work for those who can and security for those who cannot.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/2">During 2001, a brand new, modern agency will be established with a clear focus on work. This will draw together the Employment Service and the parts of the Benefits Agency which support people of working age. It will deliver a single, integrated service to benefit claimants of working age and to employers. The agency will continue and develop the partnership approach to working with local authorities and the private and voluntary sectors which the Government have adopted in implementing its welfare to work policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/3">Already the New Deal has helped around 260,000 people back into work. The national minimum wage and tax credits are helping work pay. And the ONE pilots are showing how, working together, the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service can provide a radically improved service to clients and employers alike. The new agency will have a new culture, and will be firmly focused on helping people to become independent. It will help further to embed a culture of rights and responsibilities within the welfare system. Personal advisers will steer clients towards work or training, help them claim the benefits they need, and provide additional support tailored to their needs. Help will be directed to those who genuinely need it, while fraud will be squeezed out of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/4">The agency will provide a proactive and responsive service to employers--helping people to find jobs and helping employers to fill their vacancies with the right people.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/5">The agency will also help and support working age people who are out of the labour market for whatever reason. A single agency will provide a better and more responsive benefits service to all people of working age, tailored to individual needs and asking the question: what can we do to help you become independent? Fraud will be squeezed out of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/6">The agency will provide a single point of contact for all working age people to access the following benefits: Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance, Maternity Allowance, Widow's Benefit, Industrial Injury Disablement Benefits and Invalid Care Allowance. The adminstration of the Social Fund is under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/7">The new agency will be in the front line of the drive to modernise government. It will have the technology to provide the most up-to-date service to more than 10 million customers each year. Job vacancies, information about services and benefits and availability of child care will all be on hand at the press of a button. Located in high streets and town centres across the country this new service will represent the face of 21st century government. Over time, the new agency will produce efficiency savings compared to the current arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/8">Design and development of the new agency will be carried out jointly by the Secretaries of State for Education and Employment and for Social Security. The Prime Minister is asking them to establish the agency as soon as possible in 2001 so that, alongside the new service for pensioners announced yesterday, it can start to deliver our vision of a modern welfare state and contribute to reducing poverty and expanding opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.6/1">Oakington Reception Centre will strengthen our ability to deal quickly with asylum applications, many of which prove to be unfounded. In addition to the existing detention criteria, applicants will be detained at Oakington where it appears that their application can be decided quickly, including those which may be certified as manifestly unfounded. Oakington will consider applications from adults and families with children, for whom separate accommodation is being provided, but not from unaccompanied minors. Detention will initially be for a period of about seven days to enable applicants to be interviewed and an initial decision to be made. Legal advice will be available on site.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.6/2">If the claim cannot be decided in that period, the applicant will be granted temporary admission or, if necessary in line with existing criteria, moved to another place of detention. If the claim is refused, a decision about further detention will similarly be made in accordance with existing criteria. Thus, detention in this latter category of cases will normally be to effect removal or where it has become apparent that the person will fail to keep in contact with the Immigration Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.2/1">The White Paper Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum, published in July 1998, standardised the period allowed for asylum seekers to submit further material after a substantive interview at five days. We have decided that some adjustment to this policy is needed to deliver faster asylum decisions while at the same time ensuring that asylum seekers have a proper opportunity to establish their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/2">In the case of applications considered at Oakington Reception Centre, we are arranging for the Refugee Legal Centre and Immigration Advisory Service to provide legal advice on-site. It has been agreed with those organisations that the consideration process should operate so that such advice may be provided both before and after the substantive interview. Other than in very exceptional circumstances, the substantive interview will take place on the third day at the centre and so there will normally be two more days after the interview in which to submit additional representations. The five-day period for submission of supporting material will in these cases therefore commence as soon as the asylum application has been made, rather than from the date of the substantive interview.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/3">We have also decided that the five-day period for submission of further supporting evidence will not apply to asylum claims where no substantive interview is conducted at the time when the claim is made. In those cases, applicants are issued with a Statement of Evidence form, which they are required to submit to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate within 14 days. We think this gives applicants a reasonable period to set out their claim, and time to seek legal representation if they wish. Where an application is not granted on the basis of the evidence in the Statement of Evidence form, applicants are interviewed and in these cases a decision will be made immediately after this substantive interview.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/4">The five-day standard period for applicants to submit further material after substantive interview, as set out in the White Paper, will continue to apply in all other cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/5">Discretion will be exercised to permit an extension of the applicable period for the making of post-interview representations where exceptional circumstances require--for example, where possible torture victims are identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.2/1">The response to a consultation document issued in December 1999 was overwhelmingly supportive of Prison Service proposals to continue its predominantly geographic structure but to realign its boundaries so that they match those of police areas and planned probation areas, the English regions and Wales. From April 2000, 12 area managers will manage establishments grouped by police areas within the boundaries of the nine English regions. Three regions--the South East, the North West and the East Midland--will have two area managers each. There will be a further, thirteenth manager for Wales. Two functional managers will continue to manage the higher security estate and the women's estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/2">These arrangements will improve alignment of criminal justice boundaries around the nine Government Offices for the Regions and Wales and provide the Prison Service with a platform for further joint working regionally and locally with other agencies. The move to a criminal justice focus on the 42 police areas is accelerating. The Crown Prosecution Service is organised on that basis already. Crown Courts Circuits are being reorganised on the basis of groups of police areas, and 42 criminal justice strategy committees and trial issues groups are being established this year. Forty-two magistrates' courts' committees and probation areas are planned from April 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.5/1">Good progress has been made so far. Three hundred and forty-nine recruits have graduated from the OSCE Police School and a further 250 recruits are currently undertaking their training. Following their academic training, each recruit will receive a further 17 weeks of field training with an UNMIK police officer, and an additional 80 hours of advanced classroom training. Having successfully completed the three phases of instruction, the recruit is eligible for certification and independent assignment.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.5/2">The OSCE training mandate is to develop and deliver democratically oriented, basic police training for approximately 3,500 locally recruited students within the next 16 months. On completion of the refurbishment of the Police School, it is anticipated that 500 students will be housed and trained at the same time.</p>
