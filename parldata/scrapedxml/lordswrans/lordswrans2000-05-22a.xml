	<p pid="a.48.0/1">The European Commission working papers, the first of which was issued in 1994, and the subsequent formal Commission proposal for a waste incineration Directive of October 1998, excluded burning of certain waste by reference to Directive 75/442/EEC. Animal carcasses were among the wastes excluded but only if they were already covered by other legislation. The Council's Common Position text does the same. The Government's view is that environmental standards for animal carcass incineration are not covered by any other Community legislation and that, as was the case at earlier stages, animal carcass incinerators are therefore not excluded from the scope of the incineration proposal Common Position.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/2">The Council is currently considering the European Parliament's amendments to the Common Position, including those affecting the scope, at official level. Council's rules of procedure do not allow me to comment on the detail of those discussions. No decisions have been taken by the Council in relation to the European Parliament's amendments. We will keep the House informed in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/2">Interrogation of data on the police national computer (PNC) (covering 14,646 of the 14,837 prisoners placed on home detention curfew up to <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-31">31 December 1999</phrase>) indicates that, as at <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-13">13 April 2000</phrase>, 351 of this group had been convicted of, or cautioned for, an offence committed whilst subject to the home detention curfew scheme, or had a prosecution pending in respect of such an offence. In addition, there are 44 cases where the Prison Service has been notified of new charges involving prisoners placed on home detention curfew in 2000 and prisoners placed on home detention curfew in 1999 who could not be traced on the police national computer. (The figure of 44 excludes cases where the Prison Service is aware that charges were brought but not proceeded with, or resulted in acquittal.) This means that at <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-15">15 May 2000</phrase>, the total number of cases where the Prison Service knew of convictions, cautions or pending prosecutions in respect of curfewees was 395, or 1.9 per cent. of the total.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">Table 1 gives a breakdown of the offences which led to convictions or cautions or where prosecutions are pending. Table 2 shows the number of cases in which these offences are similar in type to the original offence leading to a custodial sentence, and provides a breakdown.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/4">Figures used in responding to previous Parliamentary Questions in relation to reoffending by those placed on the home detention curfew scheme (both in 1999 and 2000) were based on information about charges reported to the Prison Service by the police. The Prison Service had previously been notified of 171 cases where charges had been brought against offenders placed on home detention curfew in 1999, and 37 cases involving offenders placed on home detention curfew in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/5">The interrogation of data from the police national computer was undertaken as part of the continuing evaluation of the home detention curfew scheme by the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate. The evaluation exercise has not to date covered those placed on home detention curfew in the current year, but regular updates are planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/6">The figures obtained from the police national computer cannot be compared directly with those previously used in responding to Parliamentary Questions. The new figures are based on convictions, cautions and pending prosecutions, rather than charges reported to the Prison Service by the police. However, the figures show that there has been some under-reporting of charges by the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/7">This means that the procedures for notifying the Prison Service of curfewees charged with further offences have not fully been followed. These procedures are set down in Home Office Circular 1/99, issued to chief constables and police home detention curfew liaison officers in January 1999. The circular requires the police to notify the Prison Service either at the time the charge is laid or at the first opportunity thereafter. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has written today to the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, asking that the association give this matter its attention and identify what further steps can be taken to improve compliance with the circular. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will also be monitoring actions taken by the police to improve compliance with the notification procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/8">As a reinforcing measure, other agencies will also be asked to alert the Prison Service to any case that comes to their attention where a curfewee has been charged with an offence committed whilst subject to curfew. As already indicated, the police national computer will also be interrogated on a regular basis in order to monitor the effectiveness of the notification procedures, and to ensure that information on the numbers of convictions, cautions and pending prosecutions is kept up to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/9">Although more curfewees have been charged with further offences than originally notified, overall compliance with the scheme remains high. Taking account of the new information, the successful completion rate is around 94 per cent (93.6 per cent).</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/10">The scheme is designed to ensure a better transition for short term offenders between custody and the community. Prisoners are only placed on home detention curfew after a careful risk assessment. The safety of the public is paramount at all times and with this in mind, prison governors will be reminded of the importance, when considering a prisoner's suitability for home detention curfew, of assessing the likelihood of reoffending whilst subject to curfew.</p>

In the short term, it is possible that there will be an increase in the numbers imprisoned. It is difficult to make firm estimates of the numbers involved, but if the new statutory warning scheme is ignored by half of those offenders who currently fail to comply without good reason on one or more occasions, some 25,000 additional offenders could be imprisoned resulting in an increase in the average daily prison population of about 1,900.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.5/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today informed Mr Tyson that he will be granted entry clearance for a single visit of three weeks' duration strictly for the purpose of a boxing match in Scotland on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-24">24 June 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2">The decision to grant entry clearance has been taken in accordance with Rule 320 (18) of the United Kingdom Immigration Rules which requires that admission will not normally be given to those with criminal convictions for relatively serious offences unless it can be justified for strong compassionate reasons, but also bearing in mind the residual discretion which my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has under the rule.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/3">In reaching a decision, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary took note of the fact that Mr Tyson has relevant convictions for the purposes of the application of this Rule. I also noted that there are recent allegations of an assault on an employee of a nightclub in Las Vegas, but we understand this is still under investigation. He also took into account the views expressed by the public about Mr Tyson visiting the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/4">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary did not consider that there were strong compassionate reasons which would justify admission in Mr Tyson's case for the purpose of the rule. However, he concluded that there were other exceptional circumstances which justified his entry to the country for the purpose of participating in the boxing match. His decision took account of the following factors: that Mr Tyson's behaviour on his previous visit to the United Kingdom was satisfactory; that any risk to the public to which his criminal convictions and the other allegations referred to above might be relevant, would be minimised by the circumstances of his proposed visit i.e. his high media profile, the presence of his trainers and other supporting entourage, and the limited duration of his visit; and that a refusal to permit entry would result in a loss of economic benefit to the United Kingdom, and in particular to the areas in which engagements took place, and would not enhance the United Kingdom's standing as a venue for major sporting events.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/5">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary also took account of the fact that Rule 320(18) currently operates in an inconsistent manner in that those in the public eye whose convictions are known are more likely to be caught by its provisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.0/1">The Royal Parks Agency have advised me that on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-06">6 April</phrase> the Royal Parks Constabulary attended a briefing by the Metropolitan Police at which they were informed of the demonstrations planned for <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-01">1 May</phrase> and advised that damage might occur to the statues on Parliament Square, including the statue of Sir Winston Churchill. A week later the Royal Parks Constabulary received a telephone call from the Metropolitan Police advising that the statues in Parliament Square be boarded up. The Royal Parks Agency took the view that to board up the statues would draw attention to them and that the hoarding could be used as weapons by demonstrators in the event of a riot. The Metropolitan Police were informed of this decision at a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-26">26 April</phrase> where it was confirmed that others had also decided not to board up statues.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/2">English Heritage has advised me that it is clear that it did not act against police advice. On <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-17">17 April</phrase>, English Heritage received telephone advice from the Metropolitan Police that, in view of the potential for vandalism during the likely demonstrations over the May Day bank holiday, English Heritage might wish to consider erecting protective hoarding around the Cenotaph. Preparations to that end were begun by English Heritage and its consultants, EC Harris. On <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-20">20 April</phrase>, EC Harris, acting under English Heritage's instructions, sought further advice and attended a briefing meeting with the police. Advice at this stage was that hoarding around the Cenotaph could exacerbate the security problem. It could draw attention to the monument, provide a potential hiding place for bombs, and be used for ammunition by rioters. English Heritage's consultants clearly understood that an additional police presence would be allocated to the Cenotaph in addition to the security measures already in place. On the basis of what English Heritage saw as clear police advice, it then stood down the contingency planning for protective hoarding around the Cenotaph.</p>

In general, these do not include estimate of the average annual mileage undertaken by different lorries, since that will vary according to the types of journey undertaken by a lorry, not according to the type of lorry used.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.3/2">However, there are a number of other goods vehicles which attract a concessionary rate of VED because they are primarily used off the public road, including a range of goods vehicles used in agriculture and construction.

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">Attributable benefits for Reserve Service were introduced in 1980, and the regulations are contained in the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions (Non-Effective Benefits and Family Pension) Order 1999, the Army Pay Warrant 1977, and the Queen's Regulations for the Royal Air Force. It has been the practice since 1980 to award attributable benefits only where members of the reserve forces are medically discharged from the reserves at an end of a period of active duty. During periods of recalled service for operations, individuals in the regular reserve forces could claim benefits only if they were medically discharged at the point of demobilisation. We have now taken legal advice, which suggests that Army reservists are, under current regulations, eligible to claim attributable benefits if they are medically discharged from the reserve at any time. Our legal advisers have also identified some anomalies in the regulations for the other Services.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">We therefore propose for the future that all members of the volunteer reserves and regular reserves should be eligible for attributable benefits if they are medically discharged from the reserve forces at any time for reasons attributable to reserve service. The existing anomalies in the regulations, under which reservists are treated differently depending on which Service they come from, will be removed. We shall re-examine claims from Gulf Reservists under the interpretation of the regulations we now believe to be correct.We shall also consider any new claims.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.5/1">The RAND report, which is a comprehensive compilation of published literature on pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and its relationship to Gulf Veterans' Illnesses (GVI), has now been carefully reviewed and a written assessment of the report has been produced. We are placing a copy of this assessment in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/2">The RAND report does not present any new work on pyridostigmine bromide. It concentrates on several hypotheses of how PB might be the cause of GVI and to a lesser extent discusses the effectiveness of PB. Although a number of theories have been identified, they have not, in our view, been critically evaluated and there is no differentiation between the credibility and value of the various pieces of research. The report gives no guidance as to which of the various hypotheses is worthy of further investigation or for the prioritisation of further research. The approach and methodology adopted for this review do not advance the debate on whether PB is possibly linked to illness in Gulf veterans.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.2/1">The 1997 &quot;Gulf Veterans Illnesses: A New Beginning&quot; policy statement set out a number of commitments to help address the health concerns of Gulf Veterans. One of these commitments was to review specific incidents of suggested biological warfare exposures and the activities of 1 Field Laboratory Unit. As part of this commitment, we are today publishing a paper entitled A Review of the Activities of the 1 Field Laboratory Unit and Suggested Biological Warfare Agent Detections During Operation Granby.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">As a result of our review of the available information we assess that UK troops were not subject to attack by or exposed to biological warfare agents during the Gulf conflict. There were alarms on some detectors, many of which were recognised to be false by the system operators at the time. On one occasion, a biological substance was detected and samples returned to the UK for testing. The tests concluded that this was not caused by a biological warfare agent. Our review re-examined this incident and concludes that the evidence suggests that the detection was caused by natural biological material.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.9/1">The Joint Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Regiment, which was established as a joint initiative in April 1999, following recommendations arising from the Strategic Defence Review, will be permanently based at RAF Honington.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.9/2">The regiment was established at RAF Honington as a successful joint initiative in April last year, following the recommendations of the Strategic Defence Review, and was fully operational by December. The regiment's operational capability will comprise nuclear, biological and chemical detection, reconnaissance and survey, and will combine these aspects with expertise in decontamination techniques. This is a critical enabling capability--and the regiment will be invaluable in reducing the risk to our Armed Forces who deploy in dangerous areas like the Gulf.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2" qnum="HL2294">Whether the quality of Spanish veterinary surgeons whom the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons is, by European Union law, required to register is satisfactory; and what effect the employment of Spanish veterinary surgeons has upon the quality of service offered by the Meat Hygiene Service to abattoir owners and managers in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.2/1">The Veterinary Training Directive, 78/1027/EEC, lays down the content and quality of veterinary undergraduate training in recognised establishments in the Europen Union, with the aim of ensuring that all those graduating from such establishments are trained to an adequate standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/2">In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) is obliged to register veterinary surgeons who have qualified from such recognised educational establishments. This is a reciprocal arrangement required by Directive 78/10126/EEC, on the mutual recognition of qualifications in veterinary medicine.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/3">Once a Spanish veterinary surgeon is registered by the RCVS, and is practicing veterinary surgery in the United Kingdom, his conduct and behaviour is governed by the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 (as amended). The Act gives disciplinary powers to the RCVS. In addition, the College publishes a Guide to Professional Conduct, most recently revised in March 2000. This document provides guidance to veterinary surgeons on professional and ethical issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/4">We are advised by the Food Standards Agency that the use of Spanish veterinary surgeons by the Meat Hygiene Service has no effect upon the quality of service it provides to abattoir owners and managers in Great Britain. Apart from the requirement for such veterinarians to be registered with the RCVS, the overriding criterion for designation as an Official Veterinary Surgeon (OVS) with the Meat Hygiene Service is the ability and competence of the individuals concerned, not the country of origin. All qualified veterinary surgeons wishing to be designated as OVSs must first successfully complete the MHS OVS course.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/2" qnum="HL2448">On what basis 1,000 tonsil samples were discarded before being tested for new-variant CJD; and what procedures were followed to make sure that infection with new-variant CJD did not result in the sample being discarded.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">A significant proportion of the samples was unsuitable for analysis because they were found by scientists to be damaged or otherwise of insufficient quality to enable analysis to be carried out. At the time the samples were taken, during routine surgery, there had been no intention of subjecting them to further analysis. The decision to set up the study of these appendices and tonsils came later. Discovery of any abnormal prion protein indicative of variant-CJD in those suitable for testing would have been reported.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.5/1">The Government do not in general publish the results of research findings unless they have first been peer reviewed. Preliminary data from the survey of human tonsil/appendix tissue currently under way were evaluated at a recent meeting of a scientific committee chaired by Professor Borysiewicz of the University of Wales College of Medicine. Experienced scientists operating in the relevant field of research into variant CJD are members of this committee and were present at this meeting. The preliminary findings were seen as helping to increase our knowledge about variant CJD. There was a very high level of public interest in this study. Following that meeting, an announcement about the results was made on 28th April 2000 by the Department of Health (ref. 2000/0250).</p>
