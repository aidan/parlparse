	<p pid="a.364.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-02">2 December 2010</phrase> the Financial Services Authority (FSA) announced that a supervisory investigation into the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had confirmed that RBS made a series of bad decisions in the years immediately before the financial crisis, most significantly the acquisition of ABN AMRO and the decision aggressively to expand its investment banking business. The issues investigated by the FSA did not warrant any enforcement action, either against RBS or against individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.2/2">The FSA cannot publish the contents of the review, because information gathered for the review remains confidential under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA has proposed producing a publishable report on lessons to be learnt both from the decisions made by the RBS board and executive and from any failings of the supervisory approach in place at that time. In order to publish such a report, the FSA considers that it would need permission from RBS and other individuals to use confidential information provided by them in the course of the supervisory investigations now concluded, as well as those to whom the information relates.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.2/3">The FSA is conducting extensive supervisory investigations into other major UK banks that required full or partial taxpayer bailout support. These investigations are ongoing. If they lead to enforcement action being taken, then it would be usual for the FSA to make these outcomes public.</p>

	<p pid="a.364.5/1">No separate estimates of the yield from the bank levy or the bank payroll tax for United Kingdom incorporated bank entities have been made. The bank payroll tax applied to certain entities (banks and holding companies) in banking groups operating in the UK as well as to bank companies in non-banking groups operating in the UK. It therefore applied to both UK incorporated banks (in both UK and foreign banking groups) and UK branches of foreign incorporated banks. The bank levy is a permanent tax on the balance sheets of banks and building society and banking groups, and does not depend upon the location of incorporation of banks within those groups. The bank payroll tax was introduced by the previous Government and was a one-off measure.</p>

	<p pid="a.370.2/2">The fiscal impact of these measures is set out in Table 2.1 in the Budget Red Book. The impact of tax and welfare changes on households is set out in Chapter A of the Red Book. It is essential that government policy is informed by analysis that is known to be robust, and the Treasury has followed a well established methodology, similar to that used by other organisations to undertake its distributional analysis. On the basis of this approach, the Treasury was able to model around two-thirds of benefit and tax-credit changes and the majority of direct and indirect tax changes in the Budget analysis, including CPI indexation of benefits and tax credits. The data sources document published alongside the Budget sets out the full list of measures that this includes. Separately, the Department for Work and Pensions will publish an impact assessment for the CPI indexation of local housing allowance rates when relevant legislation is brought forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.376.0/1">The UK is deeply concerned by the use of child soldiers in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is actively working to tackle this issue. Following a UK recommendation, UN sanctions have been imposed against Lt Col Innocent Zimurinda of the Forces Armees de la Republique Dernocratique du Congo (FARDC) for recruitment of child soldiers. We continue to lobby the Government of DRC to arrest Bosco Ntaganda and hand him over to the International Criminal Court. We support the biometric census project of EU's Security Sector Reform Mission to DRC (EUSEC),which allows child soldiers in the FARDC to be successfully identified and removed. We also support the work of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) to demobilise child soldiers in armed groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.0/2">On the situation in eastern DRC, there has been significant recent progress in weakening the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and other armed groups, but high levels of violence against civilians continue.

These included refusal of access for international monitors, lack of access in some instances for independent national monitors and candidate representatives to key parts of the voting and counting process and reports of attempts to limit media comment on the elections. In some cases, reported voting irregularities and the harassment and arrest of opposition candidates and their supporters amounted to serious interference in the electoral process.

	<p pid="a.388.8/1">We know England's cancer survival rates are currently poorer than many comparable countries. To understand more about the reasons for these persisting differences we are leading the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP). The ICBP is examining issues around late presentation and patients having more advanced stage at diagnosis; treatment variation; population awareness and beliefs about cancer; general practitioner (GP) beliefs and behaviour, and delays from first symptom to diagnosis. Lessons learnt from the ICBP will help us focus on making the improvements that deliver improved survival outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.8/2">It is already widely accepted that early diagnosis of cancer is key to improving survival rates, and we recently announced plans to speed up diagnosis by providing more than &#163;25 million in 2011-12 to give GPs increased direct access to key diagnostic tests. These tests include non-obstetric ultrasound to support the diagnosis of ovarian cancer; flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) and colonoscopy to support the diagnosis of bowel cancer; and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans to support the diagnosis of brain cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.8/3">Action to raise public awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer is also being taken to achieve earlier diagnosis of cancer. In September, we announced that &#163;9 million would be provided through the National Awareness and Early Diagnosis Initiative to support 59 local campaigns that will work to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of bowel, lung and breast cancers and to encourage early presentation at a GP surgery. A further &#163;1.75 million is being provided to pilot activity in two regions to test the viability of a possible national signs and symptoms campaign on bowel cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.8/4">We are extending both the National Health Service Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NHSBCSP) and NHS Breast Screening Programme to ensure the earlier diagnosis of cancer. The former is being extended to men and women aged 70 to 75, the latter to women aged 47 to 73. Those above the upper age limit will continue to be able to self-refer for screening.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.8/5">We are also introducing FS to the NHSBCSP Programme. This can detect abnormalities before they become cancer, as well has helping to detect cancer early. Experts estimate this technology will save around 3,000 lives a year. Sixty million pounds has been provided for a four-year rollout and, subject to the approval of the UK National Screening Committee, pilots will begin next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.8/6">The current review of the cancer reform strategy is considering what more needs to be done to achieve improved survival outcomes, and we aim to publish an updated strategy shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.390.0/1">The decision about the future of the children's congenital cardiac service at the John Radcliffe Hospital and the other current services will not be taken until the outcome of the public consultation has been considered by the Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts (JCPCT)<sup>l</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/2">The JCPCT aims to agree recommendations for reconfiguration at a public meeting in the next few months and these will be published for a full public consultation. Parents, National Health Service staff and the public will have the opportunity to make their views known during the consultation process, including on the future of the service at the John Radcliffe Hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/3">The independent investigation into the children's congenital cardiac service at the John Radcliffe Hospital in July 2010 recommended the continued suspension of the service pending a decision on its future place within the national service by the NHS Safe and Sustainable review.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/4">In May and June 2010, an expert panel chaired by Professor Sir Ian Kennedy assessed all hospitals in England that provide children's congenital cardiac surgery services. The Safe and Sustainable assessment process assessed the ability of the current congenital cardiac surgical services to meet new standards in the future, and the outcome of this assessment was that the service at the John Radcliffe Hospital unit received the lowest ranking assessment of the current 11 centres by a significant margin.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/5">The Safe and Sustainable review team undertook further work to determine whether the location of the John Radcliffe Hospital could justify its inclusion in potential options on the grounds that this would improve overall access for children and families. This showed that, in the national context of a reduction in number of units, the inclusion of the John Radcliffe Hospital service in the potential options would not improve overall access for children and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/6">Having considered the outcome of this independent assessment, and on the basis of information currently available, the Safe and Sustainable review team is likely to recommend to the JCPCT that the eventual options for reconfiguration that are put out for public consultation in 2011 do not include the children's congenital cardiac surgery service at the John Radcliffe Hospital. This does not mean that the JCPCT has made any final decision about the future of the service at the John Radcliffe Hospital, pending the outcome of the public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/7">The review team has shared this information in advance of formal consultation and without delay so that the trust and other interested parties are kept informed of emerging potential recommendations in line with best stakeholder engagement practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/8">There has been a wide and robust engagement process. In October 2009 a national stakeholder event, attended by 200 people from across the country, included the representatives from John Radcliffe Hospital as well as parents and carers of children treated at Oxford. The outcome of this event informed the development of the clinical standards and the clinical case for change. There have also been further local stakeholder engagement events, held between June and July 2010. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-15">15 June 2010</phrase>, the Safe and Sustainable engagement event took place in Oxford. It is planned that further local engagement events will take place as part of the formal consultation in 2011, including one in Oxford.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/9">Information regarding whether all panel members had an opportunity to approve the independent review of paediatric cardiac surgery and clinical governance at the John Radcliffe Hospital's paediatric cardiac surgery unit is not held centrally. This is a matter for South Central Strategic Health Authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.5/1">Homeless households are one of the groups that must be given reasonable preference-that is to say, overall priority-for allocations of social housing, and the Government have no plans to change this. The Localism Bill, introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-13">13 December</phrase>. includes provision to give local authorities greater flexibility to bring the homelessness duty to an end with an offer of accommodation in the private rented sector, without requiring the applicant's agreement. We think local authorities are best placed to weigh the needs of individuals owed the homelessness duty against the overall demand for social housing in their district.</p>

The Department for International Development (DfID) also supports specific measures in India's 120 poorest districts to promote the empowerment and access to benefits and services of excluded groups, including Dalits.

	<p pid="a.409.0/2">The Government accepted the National Audit Office's analysis and are responding to these obstacles through their review of offender learning (<I>Breaking the Cycle: Straight to Skills</I>, to be published shortly), particularly by ensuring offender learning resources are properly distributed and by putting a significantly enhanced focus on developing in offenders the skills employers need, including the underpinning skills of literacy and numeracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.413.8/1">The equivalent of a pupil premium for 16 to 19 year-olds attending schools and colleges or funded as an apprentice already exists within the 16 to 18 funding formula. The formula has two elements which provide disadvantaged learners with a funding supplement. These are the funding linked to the disadvantage uplift within the formula and that for additional learning support. Details of the 16 to 18 funding formula for schools and colleges for 2010-11 can be found on the website of the Young People's Learning Agency at <a href="http://readingroom">http://readingroom</a>. ypla.gov.uk/ypla/funding rates and formula v2.2.pdf and that for apprenticeships on the Skills Funding Agency website at <a href="http://readingroom.skillsfundingagency">http://readingroom.skillsfundingagency</a>. bis.gov.uk/sfa/Aprenticeship-funding-requirements-2010 11-v1.pdf.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.8/2">For the 2010-11 academic year, the funding for disadvantage and ALS was &#163;561 million within the 16 to 18 budget of &#163;7,503 billion. For the 2011-12 academic year this will increase by over one-third to &#163;770 million, within a budget of &#163;7,612 billion. In 2011 we will review the funding formula to look at how it can better support the coalition Government's aims of transparency and fairness and, in particular, how targeted support for 16 to 18 year-old learners can be aligned with the pupil premium for pre-16s and the national scholarship programme in higher education.</p>

The investigation is also highly confidential.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/2">The special prosecutor has explained in public that it was not possible to recruit local attorneys or to contract with them to provide legal advice. This was not because the local Bar lacked expertise. Rather, it was a consequence of the fact that the legal profession is relatively small, that the investigation is wide ranging and that it was preceded by a commission of inquiry. Most of the law firms on the islands would be unable to provide legal services to the SIPT because they are already advising persons or entities that are the subject of investigation. Legal advice on local law and procedure is provided by the Turks and Caicos Islands Attorney-General's chambers.</p>

	<p pid="a.421.3/1">The Office for Fair Access (OFFA) does not have powers to instruct universities to change their admissions policies. Universities are responsible for their own admissions policies and decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.3/2">OFFA's role is to safeguard access to higher education for under-represented groups. OFFA does this by approving and monitoring access agreements-agreements in which universities set out their tuition fee limit, their plans for targeted bursaries and other financial support and, in many cases, additional outreach work for under-represented groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.3/3">Evidence to date strongly indicates that the introduction of higher fees in 2006-07 has not had a detrimental effect on participation of disadvantaged students from low-income backgrounds and other under-represented groups. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-07">7 December</phrase>, the Government published early draft guidance setting out the coalition's expectations of how the Director of Fair Access might approach the approval and monitoring of new access agreements from 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.3/4">All universities are required, as a condition of receiving a widening participation allocation, by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, to produce Widening Participation Strategic Assessments (WPSAs). A WPSA must include a statement on admissions policy showing how the university will ensure transparency, consistency and fairness.</p>

	<p pid="a.421.6/1">The Government are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation and with greater government investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Universities wanting to charge more than a &#163;6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support. This will include a requirement to participate in the new &#163;150 million national scholarship programme. This work will be further supported by the &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium to turn their school-based achievement into success at university.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.6/2">Participation in higher education has improved in recent years-in 2008-09, 88 per cent of young entrants to full-time degree courses in England were from state schools. However, there is more to do. Access will remain a focus for all institutions, which will continue to submit a widening participation strategic assessment to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Universities charging above the &#163;6,000 threshold will draw up a new access agreement with the director of fair access, who will expect most from those whose records show they have furthest to go in securing a diverse student body. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-06">6 December</phrase>, we published draft guidance to the director of fair access setting out our expectations on how he might approach the approval and monitoring of universities' new access agreements.</p>
