	<p pid="a.65.2/1">The European Commission has provided a grant of 35 million euros to the Government of Indonesia to fund the Leuser Development Programme. The original seven-year implementation phase was extended for a further two years to allow for fund raising activities by the newly established Leuser International Foundation. The foundation will continue the management of the Leuser Ecosystem for a period of 20 years from 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/2">Two local NGOs and one national NGO active in illegal logging monitoring, Yayasan Leuser Lestari, Pagar Alam Semesta and Forest Watch Indonesia (all funded by DfID's Multi-Stakeholder Forestry Programme), continue to express concern about continuing illegal logging within the Leuser National park. They cite three recent allegations:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/3" class="indent">(1) Lack of serious investigation by authorities of illegal logging in the upper watersheds of Bukit Lawang in Bahorok.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/4" class="indent">(2) Involvement of local elite political party members in illegal logging in Karo, North Sumatra and Aceh Tenggara, including some with links to the Leuser International Foundation.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/5" class="indent">(3) Continued indecision or inability to limit the scope of the Ladia Galaska road network through the Leuser National Park.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/6">A comprehensive review of the Leuser Development Programme has just been completed (October 2004) which concludes that this programme has achieved the conservation of 2.6 million hectare of forest. It acknowledges that reports of illegal logging do continue. The Leuser Management Unit, established to manage the project, considers that illegal logging is much reduced but that continued vigilance is necessary. The review identifies significant lessons and makes constructive recommendations for improvement in management.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/7">The Ladia-Galaska road project has not yet been approved and the new government have indicated that they wish to take a decision on this as a priority. The Leuser Management Unit and the Leuser International Foundation continue to oppose the contruction of the road.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.2/1">The Memorandum of Understanding aims to strengthen the capacity of the Indonesian Government and Indonesian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to tackle illegal logging. Some training of Indonesian NGOs in monitoring has been provided by international NGOs, with financial support provided under the Memorandum of Understanding. However, no formal international monitoring of logging activities is planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/2">Future support to monitoring by Indonesian NGOs will focus on West Kalimantan and Jambi provinces. This monitoring is likely to cover illegal logging activities by the military.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/3">On the second part of the question, findings released in local papers and magazines have been overwhelming about the existence of illegal loggers in the park. These reports have also been confirmed by heads of two districts and the Leuser National Office. Local NGOs are frustrated at the lack of progress in addressing illegal logging in the National Park. The Leuser Management Unit continues to pass on allegations and reports of illegal logging to the police and the Ministry of Forestry for further investigation, but the Leuser Management Unit cannot itself instigate criminal proceedings; this is the responsibility of the Government of Indonesia. In the past, there has been a lack of political will to tackle illegal logging in Indonesia. However, following the recent elections, with the new ministerial team, there is the prospect of real change. The Leuser International Foundation has met the new Minister of Forestry and expressed its concerns at the problem. The Minister has stated that tackling illegal logging is a priority of the new government.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.5/1">The European Commission (EC) is not providing further direct assistance to the Leuser International Foundation after <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-09">9 November 2004</phrase> for the management of the Leuser ecosystem. It has always been an objective of the EC support that the foundation should be financed through other sources and not directly by the EC. The Commission has supported the Leuser International Foundation in its efforts to raise funds through the provision of expertise in fund raising and the foundation is finalizing the arrangements for a grant of 500,000 US dollars for the next two years from a major international company. The foundation is optimistic that contacts already made will lead to further grants before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.5/2">However, the management of Leuser National Park continues to be highly contested, with a number of NGOs expressing doubts as to whether the Leuser International Foundation will be effective or credible in tackling illegal logging or the new road through the National Park.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.5/1">The primary responsiblity for conducting assessments of the distribution of cetaceans in United Kingdom and other waters rests with the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Defra has conducted a number of surveys on cetaceans, most of which have addressed cetacean bycatch issues. Currently, Defra is contributing about &pound;300,000 to a survey addressing small cetacean abundance in the North Sea and North East Atlantic. This international project will carry out a survey of whales, dolphins and porpoises in the North Sea and European Atlantic waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/2">The Ministry of Defence is also funding research into cetacean distribution. This research is being conducted by various academic and civilian institutions, including Aberdeen University, the Sea Mammals Research Unit (SMRU) at St Andrews University, and the Biscay Dolphin Research Programme. A component of this research involves observational surveys at sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/3">In addition, Royal Navy ships collect observations on marine mammal sightings during normal operations. These sightings are recorded and passed to the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO). Over the last two years, UKHO has received an average of 68 records of cetacean observations per month from Royal Navy sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/4">All records of sightings are held by UKHO on an operational database, which now has several thousand observations of cetaceans. UKHO regularly replies to requests from the public for sightings in a specific area of the world by releasing appropriate unclassified information from that database. The full UKHO database is not available to the public, as some of the information held is classified.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/5">The Ministry of Defence also refers to data from SRMU and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), as these organisations also hold information on the distribution of cetaceans in UK and North Atlantic waters. Data from SMRU is not readily available to the general public. However, JNCC has produced an atlas of cetacean distribution in north-west European waters. This contains information on animal distribution by species but not by the date of observations of those species. This information can be accessed on <a href="http://www.jncc.gov.uk">www.jncc.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="a.74.6/4">The criteria for closures longer than 30 years were defined in a White Paper on open government published in 1993 (Cm 2290), which stated that it is for the department responsible for depositing the material to decide on the closure period.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.6/5">Documents containing information about individuals, whose disclosure would cause either substantial distress, or endangerment from a third party to persons affected by disclosure or their descendants can be subject to a variable closure period of between 40 and 100 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.6/6">At the conclusion of Lord Cullen's inquiry, the papers were lodged with the then Scottish Record Office. As is normal practice, the closure periods were identified by the SRO, in consultation with the secretary to the inquiry and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. In light of the obvious sensitivities in relation to the information about children and alleged offences against them the productions were closed for 100 years. This closure was in accordance with the government guidelines published in the White Paper, <i>Open Government</i>, Cm 2290 (1993), and Lord Cullen was content with these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.6/7">However, subsequently the Lord Advocate decided that the material from the Dunblane inquiry should be catalogued by staff at the National Archives of Scotland in a way which did not lead to the identification of children. The cataloguing of the productions has recently been completed. Officials from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service are currently reviewing this material and considering what information is suitable for release either in its entirety or in an edited format. However, the sensitive nature of the information contained in some of the material will obviously prevent its release before the end of the 100-year closure period.</p>
