The proposals within the document would mostly be for the European Commission to take forward in its internal processes, but, if the strategy were agreed, there are some proposals that could affect the policy areas of several departments. The UK Government, therefore, intend to oppose the development of a strategy on the grounds that there is no relevant legal base for the activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.5/1"><I>Managing finances in mental health</I>, which was published in June 2006 by the Audit Commission for local authorities and the National Health Service in England, stated that some primary care trusts (predominantly, but not exclusively, those in rural settings) spend less than &pound;75 on mental health per head per year whereas others (that is, PCTs in central London) spend over &pound;300.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.5/2">No assessment has been made of the relatively low level of spending on mental health in rural areas and the need for organisations such as the Rural Stress Information Network (RSIN). It is for PCTs to determine how to use the resources allocated to them to commission services to meet the healthcare needs of their local populations. In addition, under Section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health awards grants to voluntary organisations whose activities support the Department of Health's policy priorities. Voluntary organisations working with people in rural areas, such as RSIN, continue to receive support through the Section 64 scheme of grants.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.2/1">The longstanding position of successive Governments is that pension assets should be converted into a secure income in retirement by age 75. For most people, an annuity or scheme pension is the best means by which they can do this. The new pension rules introduce an additional option for achieving this&mdash;an alternatively secured pension (ASP). As the Government made clear during the development of the new pension tax provisions, ASPs are specifically designed for those who have a principled religious objection to annuitisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/2">It has become clear, however, that some advisers are intending to use the ASP provisions for a much wider purpose to enable individuals to pass on tax-privileged retirement savings to their dependants rather than to provide a pension in retirement. In order to prevent this, the Government are examining how best to restrict ASPs to their original limited purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.5/2"><I>Letter to </I><I>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</I><I> from the </I><I>National Statistician, dated</I><I> October 2006</I></p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary Question asking whether we take account of changes in the quantity of an item for a given price in the retail prices index (RPI). (HL7527)</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/4">Both the consumer prices index (CPI) and RPI are based on the prices of a &quot;basket&quot; of around 650 goods and services that are purchased by the vast majority of UK households. We collect prices for this &quot;basket&quot; at around 150 locations around the UK, as well as centrally by ONS staff. We aim to keep this basket fixed, so that comparisons between time periods are meaningful, most notably for an annual rate of change (often termed &quot;inflation&quot;) to be calculated. In order to do this, there are times when we have to perform an adjustment to ensure that we are comparing like with like across a given time period.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/5">The simplest form of an adjustment is quantity adjustment, which is used when there is a permanent size change in an item, as in your Question. This occurs most frequently with homogenous goods such as food and drink, and has been used recently when the size of some confectionery bars was changed. In this case, in each outlet the nearest equivalent new size of the product priced in that outlet was found, and an adjustment made to the price pro rata to ensure that we are measuring the price correctly for the given change in weight or quantity of an item.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/6">Similar adjustments were made in October 1995 when many items were changed from imperial to metric quantities. In this case, in each outlet the nearest equivalent new size of the product priced in that outlet was found and an adjustment was made for the change in weight.</p>
