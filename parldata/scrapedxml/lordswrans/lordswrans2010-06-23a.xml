	<p pid="a.178.2/1">We are aware of reports of the Deputy Secretary of the Afghan Lower House of Parliament's remarks regarding the execution of Christian converts from Islam. We understand that the remarks were made during a debate over a recent series of television reports, which showed video footage of Afghans converting to Christianity. As a result, two international non-government organisations have been accused of proselytising and are currently under investigation by Afghan authorities. Under Afghan law, proselytising is illegal and conversion from Islam is a capital offence. We are following the investigation closely, but cannot pre-empt the findings at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.2/2">The Government are opposed to the death penalty under all circumstances and continue to strive for the global abolition of capital punishment. The Government also strongly support the right to freedom of religion or belief, including full implementation of those norms laid out in Article 2 of the Afghan constitution, which provides for freedom of religion. As an EU member, the UK adopted a set of EU council conclusions on freedom of religion or belief. These conclusions reaffirm the EU's commitment to promote and protect freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, including the right to adopt, change or abandon one's religion or belief of one's own free will. The Government are working to support all individuals who face discrimination and persecution on the basis of religion, including Christians, wherever they are in the world. Pending the outcome of the investigation, we will raise this case with the Afghan Government as necessary.</p>

It was the result of conversations with stakeholders and a web-based review of publicly available information. There is therefore no material or evidence beyond that cited in the report and, where possible, linked in the report to the relevant web source. The Communications Consumer Panel produced two versions of this report; the second was simply an updated version of the original.

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">Section 86 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (the 1983 Act) empowers the Secretary of State to authorise the repatriation of certain in-patients detained in England or Wales who are neither British citizens nor Commonwealth citizens having the right of abode in the United Kingdom. Before doing so the Secretary of State must be satisfied that proper arrangements have been made for the patient's removal and for their care and treatment in the receiving country. The Secretary of State must also obtain the approval of the appropriate tribunal. In Wales, this function is transferred to the Welsh Ministers, except in relation to certain patients detained under Part 3 of the 1983 Act subject to special restrictions (&quot;restricted patients&quot;). Part 3 of the 1983 Act deals primarily with mentally disordered offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">Two patients were repatriated by the Secretary of State under Section 86 in 2007, and one in 2009. All three were restricted patients.</p>

Nine restricted patients were deported in 2007, 11 in 2008 and 12 in 2009. To date, two have been deported in 2010. In 2008, one restricted patient was repatriated by means of conditional discharge. No patients have been repatriated under the 1984 Act in the past three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.6/3"><I>Income Support</I></p>
	<p pid="a.193.6/4">Premiums paid in respect of disability may be withdrawn from in-patients if another benefit which qualified them for the premium ends or the income support claimant has been an in-patient for a continuous period of more than 52 weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.6/16">Housing benefit and council tax benefit can be paid for up to 52 weeks to people who are in hospital and expect to be discharged home within that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.6/17"><I>State Pension</I></p>
	<p pid="a.193.6/18">Weekly state pension is not affected by being in hospital, even if a stay in hospital is for longer than 52 weeks. Extra state pension or a lump-sum payment can still be earned during a stay in hospital while a claim for state pension is being put off. However, if an increase is paid with state pension for a husband, wife or someone who looks after a recipient's children, the recipient needs to tell the department when they, or the other person in respect of whom the increase is payable, goes into and comes out of hospital, as the increase payable to the recipient can be dependent on them actually residing with the other person.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.6/19"><I>Pension Credit</I></p>
	<p pid="a.193.6/20">On admission to hospital the amount of pension credit payable to a single person will stay the same unless their appropriate amount includes an extra amount for severe disability or carers. The extra amount for severe disability will stop (or may reduce in the case of couples) when attendance allowance or disability living allowance stops. The additional amount for carers stops eight weeks after carers allowance (or underlying entitlement to it) stops. Housing costs will continue to be allowed as long as they are treated as responsible for the costs. This will normally be for a maximum of 52 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.6/21">Couples, where one or both people are in hospital and are not expected to return home on discharge, will be treated as single people and will both claim pension credit in their own right. Where one partner is in hospital and is expected to be discharged home, their pension credit will normally stay the same for the first 52 weeks unless they have an additional amount for severe disability or carers. After 52 weeks both partners are usually treated as single people for pension credit purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.6/22"><I>Winter Fuel Payments</I></p>
	<p pid="a.193.6/23">A person who has reached the qualifying age for a winter fuel payment will not receive a payment if, at the qualifying week, they are in hospital getting free in-patient treatment and have been getting such treatment for more than 52 weeks.</p>
