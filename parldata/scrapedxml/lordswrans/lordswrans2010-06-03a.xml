	<p pid="a.3.8/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how the data on languages gathered in the next census is intended to be used. (HL25)</p>
	<p pid="a.3.8/4">The topics and questions included in the 2011 Census are the result of a four year period of extensive assessment and consultation with census users including central and local government, business, academics and members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.8/5">The new questions on language in the England and Wales census will ask about the main language used and ability in speaking English and Welsh in Wales. These questions will help central government, local authorities and the NHS plan their resources and service provision for language support and translation services for non-English speakers, and in particular the impact of English (or Welsh) language ability on employment and other social inclusion indicators. Information on the number of British Sign Language (BSL) users will inform service planning and assist in developing policies to address the deaf community's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.8/6">Government departments who have expressed a requirement for information on languages were the Department for Health, the Department of Communities and Local Government, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Education, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Home Office and the Welsh Assembly Government. Local authorities, academics, and special interest groups also expressed a need for such information.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.8/7">A separate question on Welsh language will again be asked in Wales-as has been done in one form or other since the 1891 Census. Responses will provide information that will be used to measure the change in Welsh language proficiency to inform policy development and monitoring and to inform local resource allocation.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.8/1">The promotion of social justice and the fight against poverty is at the heart of the Government's programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.8/2">Work provides the most sustainable route out of poverty, so our first priority will be to reduce the deficit and restore economic growth so that more people can benefit from the proceeds of a strong and competitive economy. The changes to national insurance outlined in the Queen's Speech will save jobs and support economic growth, contributing to the reduction of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.8/3">We will reduce poverty by understanding and addressing the root causes and drivers of poverty, particularly family breakdown, educational failure, addiction, debt and worklessness, and economic dependency. A social justice committee, chaired by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, will consider issues relating to poverty, equality and social justice and will ensure the integration of policies to combat poverty across government.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.8/4">To get those people on benefits into work and out of poverty we will simplify the benefits system and address prohibitive and regressive marginal tax rates which too often act as a barrier to moving from benefits to work. These policies will make sure that work always pays.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.8/5">We will therefore reform back-to-work support, and move toward a single employment programme offering targeted, personalised help, ensuring that support is available to those who need it most, sooner rather than later. The work programme will be delivered by providers from the private, public and voluntary sectors. We expect funding to be more heavily focused on outcome payments so that the results providers achieve are aligned more closely with the payments they receive.</p>
