Every stage is open to the closest scrutiny by the Judicial Appointments Commissioner. The Lord Chancellor is also directly and personally answerable to Parliament for the system and policies relating to the award of Queen's Counsel. That kind of accountability could not be appropriate for the Lord Chief Justice. Nor would it be appropriate for the Lord Chief Justice to be responsible for a system which exists to confer benefits on consumers in relation to the provision of services by the legal profession.</p>

As the work of the chief executive of the Irish Language Agency is carried out wholly or mainly outside Northern Ireland, the employment laws of Northern Ireland do not apply to the appointment; the employment law of the Republc of Ireland would apply to the post.</p>

Comparisons between aid levels for Afghanistan and other post-conflict countries can be misleading. In 2002, the figure for Afghanistan is around 80 dollars per capita. One has to take purchasing power into account as well as economies of scale. The purchasing power of 1 dollar in Afghanistan is clearly a lot higher than in the Balkans; and Afghanistan is a much bigger country. Support to post-conflict countries should be based on an assessment of needs, not simple comparisons.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">Data are not held centrally in the format requested. However, DfID supports a number of international sexual and reproductive health organisations that share our aim of reducing poverty and providing services and choice to poor people in accordance with the principles agreed at the UN Conference on Population and Development. All our funding supports the goal of universal access to reproductive health and is central to attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) specifically those related to maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS and child mortality. Without access to high quality reproductive health services and care, it is most unlikely that progress will be achieved in meeting the health MDGs. We will continue to support international organisations and NGOs which make an effective contribution to these goals, and of course the efforts of governments seeking to improve people's access to reproductive health services.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.0/1">Since Iraq broke diplomatic relations with the UK in February 1991, UK officials have been denied access to most of Iraq, making an independent and complete evaluation of food and water security impossible. However, UN reports show that under the UN Oil for Food programme access to food and potable water in Iraq has improved considerably since 1996. Approximately 78 per cent of the population in Baghdad-controlled Iraq, and up to 96 per cent in Northern Iraq, has access to potable water. UK humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people also includes funding for rehabilitating water and sanitation facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.6/1">As I have made clear to the House on a number of occasions, Her Majesty's Government's policy on Iraq is to ensure Iraq complies with its obligations under relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs), including by giving up its weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/2">Her Majesty's Government's prime objective is to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles (BM), as set out in UNSCRs. This would reduce Iraq's ability to threaten its neighbours and the region, and prevent Iraq using WMD against its own people. UNSCRs also require Iraq to renounce terrorism, and return captured Kuwaitis and property taken from Kuwait.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/3">These UNSCRs are an expression of the will of the international community, with which Iraq has persistently failed to comply, thereby perpetuating the threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/4">A further objective is to maintain the authority of the United Nations by demonstrating the Security Council's effective response to the challenge posed by Iraq's non-compliance. Success in achieving our prime objective should help deter the proliferation of WMD and BM more generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/5">We have pursued these objectives through the United Nations, culminating in the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of UNSCR 1441 (2002) on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-08">8 November 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/6">Her Majesty's Government's immediate priorities are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/7" class="indent">(a) Support the work of the UNMOVIC/IAEA inspectors in Iraq;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/8" class="indent">(b) Enable UNMOVIC/IAEA to institute long-term measures to ensure compliance as part of their ongoing monitoring and verification regime;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/9" class="indent">(c) Maintain international solidarity behind the United Nations Security Council and support for effective UNMOVIC/IAEA action;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/10" class="indent">(d) Preserve regional stability;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/11" class="indent">(e) Continue to make military plans and preparations in case military action is required to enforce compliance by Iraq with its WMD/BM obligations under UNSCRs;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/12" class="indent">(f) Continue to support humanitarian efforts to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/13">We would like Iraq to become a stable, united and law-abiding state, within its present borders, co-operating with the international community, no longer posing a threat to its neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its international obligations and providing effective and representative government for its own people.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/14">These objectives are consistent with wider government policy which includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/15" class="indent">(a) Efforts to resolve other causes of regional instability, including the Middle East peace process;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/16" class="indent">(b) Wider political engagement with Arab countries and the Islamic world;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/17" class="indent">(c) Efforts to counter the proliferation of WMD; and</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/18" class="indent">(d) The elimination of terrorism as a force in international affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/19">To achieve our objectives we will act in conformity with international law, including the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/20">Consistent with the above, we are working intensively with our allies and partners to secure the peaceful disarmament of Iraq's WMD by means of UNMOVIC/IAEA inspections. But as SCR 1441 makes clear, if the Iraqi regime does not comply, it will face serious consequences.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.5/2">The grant distribution formulae include one reflecting the relative costs of highway maintenance. The proposed new formula for 2003&ndash;04 includes a predicted gritting days indicator, which is an assessment of the average number of days where gritting is required for the authority. Data used for this assessment come from the Meteorological Office Open Road Index (MOORI). This is a retrospective forecast of the number of days on which gritting (or salting) would have been required at individual weather stations. The forecast is based on a number of variables, not just temperature. Further information can be found on the Internet at <a href="http://www.local.dtlr.gov.uk/finance/0304/grant.htm">http://www.local.dtlr.gov.uk/finance/0304/grant.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/3">The proposed indicator was created using data from a number of weather stations that were chosen to represent the distribution of roads within the authorities' areas.

This figure was used for the &quot;predicted gritting days&quot; indicator. A table showing the weather stations used for highways authorities in Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and West Yorkshire has been placed in the House of Lords Library. A table showing weather stations used for all authorities in England can also be found as at the internet address above.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.2/1">The Bill that was published on <phrase class="date" code="">3 December</phrase> is intended to enable Parliament to reach a conclusion on the contentious issue of hunting with dogs. It seeks to prevent cruelty while recognising those activities which are necessary to countryside management such as the protection of animals or crops. All activities have to satisfy the two tests of &quot;utility&quot; (what is necessary for purposes set out in Clause 8, including the protection of livestock and crops) and cruelty (what method involves the least suffering). The evidence on which decisions were taken include the report of the Burns inquiry and evidence provided to that inquiry, submissions from a variety of organisations and individuals to my right honourable friend in response to his invitation in March to submit evidence, and to his further invitation to respond on specific issues in May. The Burns inquiry concluded &quot;that hare coursing is a sport and not to control hare numbers, and stalking and flushing out causes less suffering than deer hunting and will always be available&quot;. Following his open period of consultation my right honourable friend formulated tests for utility and cruelty as set down in Clause 8 of the Hunting Bill. He has returned to the evidence referred again in the light of his consultation process and feels it is quite clear that both hare coursing and deer hunting do not meet both the tests.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.2/1">British roundwood deliveries to the wood processing industry currently stand at some 7.5 million tonnes per annum, compared with 7.1 million in 1996. This increase has been against a background of a continuing decline in international and UK prices for round timber, which is adversely affecting the area of woodland being thinned in Britian. The development of gluing and laminating technologies is now being adopted by commerical companies in new timber products. Long fibre spruce roundwood is an excellent pulping material and there is some potential for an increase in its use. Renewable energy, including heating, offers a potentially major new market for small and low grade timber. There is now a significant number of small schemes and sites utilising wood fuel for heat. Co-firing with coal for power is another promising option.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.5/1">All wild birds are protected under Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which implements the EC Birds Directive in the United Kingdom. However, Section 16 of the 1981 Act sets out the circumstances under which Defra can issue licences to control protected species of birds. The feral pigeon is included in the list of 13 &quot;pest birds&quot; covered by general licences. These licences allow the control of listed birds by authorised persons all year round, where they are considered a threat to public health and safety. Permissible methods would include the use of trained birds of prey to control pigeon populations. Using raptors to control pigeons emulates the naturally occurring predator/prey relationship. This method, operated under the strict auspices of the departmental licence, is compatible with the Government's policies towards animal rights and welfare.</p>

Corresponding secondary legislation for Northern Ireland is expected to be made early in 2003. Under this regime intensive pig and poultry production is regulated by the Environment Agency in England and Wales, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service. Installations existing in October 1999 in Great Britain will be required to apply for an IPPC permit around the end of 2006. New installations are required to have an IPPC permit before commencing operation. The regulators are working with the farming sector to streamline the regulatory process for farmers and to minimise costs.

	<p pid="a.191.2/1">The Government introduced family visitor appeals in October 2000. Since then, we have made a number of changes to the system in the light of operational experience and in response to input from stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations. We will consider the concerns of the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux with the results of the research commissioned by the inter-departmental team which the Home Secretary set up to review family visitor appeals.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.5/1">A person born in the United Kingdom will not necessarily be a British Citizen. The law on citizenship changed on <phrase class="date" code="1983-01-01">1 January 1983</phrase> when the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force. Since that date, a child born in the United Kingdom will only be a British citizen automatically, if he is born to a parent who is either settled in the UK or a British Citizen. When deciding whether or not to take deportation action, staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate are required to act in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1998. Where a person alleges that a decision taken under the Immigration Acts which relates to his right to remain in the United Kingdom infringes his human rights, he has a right of appeal to an adjudicator before removal unless he has already had a one-stop appeal at which the point could have been raised. Where the person has a British citizen child, that is a factor which will be taken into account in deciding whether or not to remove him or her, but the European Court has made it clear that Article 8 does not automatically over-ride the immigration laws of individual signatory states. Removal in those circumstances would therefore not necessarily be incompatible with that article.</p>

A deportation order does not directly affect access to possessions, but clearly a person who is not at liberty will not necessarily have free access. Deportation does not affect legal title, and any possessions remain the property of the deportee after his or her removal. The individual concerned will be aware that they are liable to removal from the United Kingdom, and the onus is on them to make such arrangements in respect of their possessions as they see fit.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.3/1">It is always a matter of deep regret when someone takes their own life. I would like to express my sympathy to the family of the deceased. We are committed to improving the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit in all local authorities (LAs). We have listened to LAs and have introduced improvements that make the schemes easier for them to administer and easier for the public to understand. We have published comprehensive performance standards and have provided the tools for LAs to self-assess their performance. We also provide direct practical support for authorities through our help team, performance improvement action teams and a kit of proven service improvement tools and techniques. These measures have already begun to make a real difference to the standard of performance in many authorities. The Lord Chancellor's Department is working to improve the standards of business ethics and practice of the enforcement profession, enforcement agents and those who employ them or use their services. They have produced national standards for enforcement agents to share, build on and improve existing good practice and thereby raise the level of professionalism across the whole sector. This guidance includes the advice that enforcement agents or agencies and creditors must recognise that they each have a role in ensuring that the vulnerable and socially excluded are protected, and that the recovery process includes procedures agreed between them about how such situations should be dealt with. Both the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Local Government Association are strongly encouraging all LAs to ensure that enforcement agents working on their behalf adopt the national standards. In addition the Association of Civil Enforcement Agencies and the Certificated Bailiffs Association have both recently agreed to incorporate adherence to the national standards in their codes of conduct for their members in the near future and to encourage them to be recognised in contractual arrangements where appropriate. The Lord Chancellor's Department plans a White Paper early next year which will contain a package of proposals for improved methods of recovery for civil court debt and commercial rent, and a single regulatory regime for warrant enforcement agents.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.8/1">The main contribution of the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) was in processing environmental specimens (water) and in the typification of the patient-derived legionella specimens for matching to the environmental evidence. It supplied the capacity for, and assisted in, testing clinical specimens both locally and nationally. It also supplied the capacity for serological follow-up and processing of environmental specimens. In addition to its laboratory expertise, the PHLS in the North-West contributed the expertise of two consultants who between them have wide experience in the management of Legionnaires' Disease outbreaks. Their contributions to the investigation of the outbreak were particularly important in the areas of epidemiological analysis, environmental reviews, forensic evidence collection and management. We are still evaluating the many lessons that are to be learned from this outbreak. It was a large outbreak and was resolved only by the active participation of many agencies including the PHLS, NHS trusts, the Cumbria and Lancashire Health Protection Unit, the Health and Safety Executive, the local authority environmental health department, and the Cumbria police. Very good co-operation existed between all partners throughout the investigation, which was an essential feature of the successful management of this outbreak.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.2/1">We are making significant additional resources available for personal social services (PSS) over the next three years (2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06). Total PSS resources are set to increase by an average 6 per cent per year in real terms over that period. The children's services grant alone will total over &pound;560 million in 2003&ndash;04. However, most of the resources available to local government are not earmarked and it is for each individual local council to decide how much to spend on its children's homes in the light of its local priorities. The Care Standards Act commenced in April 2002. National minimum standards for children's homes were issued along with this Act and these form the basis for judgments made by the National Care Standards Commission as to whether individual homes are providing satisfactory care for the children they are looking after. Standard 29 states that in every children's home a minimum ratio of all staff should have completed their National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) level 3 in Caring for Children and Young People by January 2005. Staff may hold other qualifications that require similar competencies to the NVQ3. Currently &pound;57 million is allocated through the training support programme. The objective of this is to increase significantly the proportion of staff who have appropriate qualifications for the work that they undertake, at vocational, qualifying and post-qualifying levels. In 2003&ndash;04&mdash;as part of the financial settlement for the personal social services&mdash;new grants have been allocated to improve the skills of the social care workforce, so that they are able to deliver care that meets the national minimum standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.5/1">The NHS Cancer Plan commitment is that National Health Service investment in specialist palliative care will increase by &pound;50 million per annum by 2003&ndash;04, compared with 2000&ndash;01. This increase is intended both to enable the NHS to make a more realistic contribution to the costs hospices incur in providing agreed levels of service, and to tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care. We have not identified a specific share intended for hospices.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">The Government view the proposals for revision of the EC Public Procurement Directives, which reached political agreement at the May 2002 Internal Market, Consumer Affairs and Tourism Council, as achieving the right balance on the use of social criteria at the award stage of the procurement process. The use of social criteria at this stage is permissible where such criteria are relevant to the subject matter of the contract, and provide a benefit to the contracting authority. Going beyond this, at the award stage, which would be the effect of certain EP amendments, would not be consistent with the principles, including value for money, on which the directives are based. It is at the earlier, specification stage that relevant wider issues should be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.5/1">No review is considered necessary. Whilst the Court (in case C-513/99) stated that it is permitted in principle to use criteria &quot;relating to the preservation of the environment&quot; when awarding a contract, the judgment makes it clear that such criteria must be linked to the subject of the contract, not confer an unrestricted freedom of choice on the authority, be expressly mentioned in the contract documents or the tender notice, and comply with all the fundamental principles of Community law, in particular of non-discriminiation. This is in line with the UK's understanding of the position under the current EC procurement directives. The judgment does not, therefore, require a change to the normal value-for-money criteria permitted at contract award stage. The Commission v. France ruling (C-225/98) does not have any direct bearing on the use of environmenal award criteria. There, the Court held that it might be possible in limited circumstances for a condition relating to unemployment to be used as a contract ward criterion if it complied with the fundamental principles of Community law and the rules on advertising.</p>
