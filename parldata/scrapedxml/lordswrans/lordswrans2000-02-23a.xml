	<p pid="a.31.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-11">11 January 2000</phrase>, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) asked the Home Office for authority to provide funding to enable the Global Cultural Diversity Congress, to be held in Cardiff on 20-<phrase class="date" code="2000-03-23">23 March</phrase>, to go ahead as planned and subsequently asked for additional funding from the Home Office Vote. This international conference was being organised under the auspices of the CRE following decisions they made in 1998 but by a separate company limited by guarantee, Global Cultural Diversity Congress (GCDC) 2000 Ltd. At the time when they first decided to proceed in 1998, it was made clear that the Government could not offer substantial financial support for the conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.8/2">The Government have supported the aims of the congress, which was a potentially important forum for serious debate about issues of race and diversity, and was widely welcomed by many with an interest in these issues both in this country and worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.8/3">In the light of the CRE request in January this year for government funding, the Government thought it right to seek advice from independent consultants on the viability of the conference at this late stage, including from forensic accountants, who examined the affairs of GCDC 2000 Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.8/4">The conclusions of the accountants' report raised serious questions about the quality of the management and financial controls in GCDC 2000 Ltd as well as confirming that very significant additional funds, in the order of &pound;1.5 million, would be required to enable the congress to go ahead, not least because fewer than 500 tickets had been sold for a congress initially planned to attract 2,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.8/5">Given the report's findings, it would not be justifiable to use substantial public funds to support this event. Yesterday, the directors of the company were advised of the report's findings and our decision. My honourable friend the Minister of State of the Home Office (Mr O'Brien) understands that the directors of GCDC 2000 Ltd decided late on <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-21">Monday 21 February</phrase> to put the company into liquidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.8/6">The decision to set up GCDC 2000 Ltd was a collective one of the Commissioners for Racial Equality, taken in September 1998. My honourable friend the Minister of State of the Home Office (Mr O'Brien) has asked the incoming chair of the CRE, Gurbux Singh, to consider urgently the lessons to be learnt from all of this and to provide us with a report.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.5/1">No. The position of the Lord Chancellor is unaffected by this case. The decision in McGonnell is confined to the special position of the Bailiff of Guernsey and his role in the particular case. The European Court of Human Rights emphasised (paragraph 51): &quot;The question is always whether, in a given case, the requirements of the Convention are met&quot;. On the facts of this case it held that they were not because of the judge's direct involvement in the passage of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.5/2">The Court accepted the Government's submission that neither Article 6 nor any other provision of the Convention required &quot;States to comply with any theoretical constitutional concepts as such&quot;. This is precisely what I have always said.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.5/3">The Lord Chancellor would never sit in any case concerning legislation in the passage of which he had been directly involved nor in any case where the interests of the executive were directly engaged.</p>

Although it was on the same tribunal, the post for which Mrs Anderson applied was different from that for which she had been a member of the interviewing panel.

	<p pid="a.34.5/1">No free tickets are provided to sponsors. Tickets available to sponsors are part of the sponsorship contractual terms and are an integral part of the benefits sponsors receive in recognition of their financial support for the project. These arrangements are standard for sponsorships of major events. The number of tickets available to sponsors under these arrangements vary according to the level of contribution made by each sponsor. Since they are part and parcel of the sponsorship contract, details are commercially confidential under the confidentiality clauses applicable to both parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/2">No VIPs automatically gain free entry to the Dome. The policy of the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is that, where there is a benefit to the business or a relevance to NMEC's public accountability remit, guests (whether VIPs or not) invited to the Dome can attend on a non-paying basis. Additionally, because the Dome has such a high profile as the centrepiece of the UK's Millennium celebrations, many VIPs on official or State visits, often request that the Dome be included on their itinerary. In most cases, the host body of the group visiting reimburses NMEC.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.2/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has made clear his intention that sex and relationships education should be firmly rooted within the Personal, Social and Health Education framework for schools issued last November. That framework clearly states that when learning about developing good relationships and respecting the differences between people, pupils should be taught about the nature and importance of marriage for family life and bringing up children. Marriage is defined in English law as &quot;the voluntary union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of others&quot;. The Government also recognises that there are strong and mutually supportive families and relationships outside marriage and that many unmarried couples remain together throughout their children's upbringing and raise their children as successfully as married parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.5/1">Note 134 is misleading in its use of the word &quot;best&quot;. There is no one &quot;best&quot; hearing aid that can be supplied to hearing impaired people in general or to an individual. Each user has different requirements, preferences and circumstances which can change with time. The hearing aid user wants to be able to have the choice from a wide range of hearing aid models. The National Health Service has always made available cost efficient and beneficial hearing aids to its patients. It has always provided all kinds of hearing aid types which have been supplied by all the high quality world famous manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/2">However, technology is always advancing and a project will start in England later this year to trial digital hearing aids for NHS patients. This project will help to inform our plans to modernise hearing aid services. Detailed proposals for the scheme are being developed but we anticipate that the project will cover 20 hearing aid departments and that an estimated 20,000-30,000 patients will benefit from the scheme. The project is intended to lead to improvements for all NHS patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.2/1">The FV430 series completed development in the early 1960s, and entered service in 1964. On present plans the vehicles will be progressively replaced between 2006-2018 by the Future Command and Liaison Vehicle, the Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle, and the Armoured Battlegroup Support Vehicle. The reliability of the power pack varies with environmental conditions and terrain. The vehicles achieve some 3,500 miles between engine failures.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">On the specific questions relating to the FV432--the armoured ambulance variant--the vehicle is fitted with the Clansman VRC 353 radio and the maximum road speed is 30 mph, which compares to 46.5 mph and 45 mph for the Warrior and CVR(T) variants respectively. Information regarding the vulnerability of the vehicle to certain types of munitions, and the operating range of the radio, is classified and, therefore, withheld in accordance with Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, which relates to defence, security and international relations.</p>
