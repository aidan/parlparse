<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-02-25a.12.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="12"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030225/text/30225w01.htm#30225w01_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.12.5/1">The Ram doctrine reflects a well-established principle of constitutional law. Like many other persons, Ministers and their departments have common law powers which derive from the Crown's status as a corporation sole. Ministers and their departments also exercise prerogative powers of the Crown. Common law and prerogative powers may be limited by statute either expressly or by necessary implication and in this respect are subject to direct parliamentary control. The courts have recognised the legitimacy of these principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/2">Whether legislation is necessary or appropriate to authorise government actions depends on the circumstances and the matters in issue. Sometimes it will be clear that legislation is needed, for example, when the proposed action might substantially interfere with human rights. In such cases a clear and reasonably accessible legal framework is required in order to comply with human rights law. At other times, the legal necessity for legislation will not be clear, in which case a political as well as a legal judgment has to be made as to whether legislation is desirable. Such a judgment may take into account a number of factors, including whether the proposed action is a priority and whether authorising that action by legislating represents a good use of Parliamentary time.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/3">The principles governing the use of the annual Appropriation Act to provide authority for the exercise of functions by government departments where such functions may involve financial liabilities extending beyond a year are stated in the Public Accounts Committee Concordant, 1932 (see Annex 2.1 of Government Accounting 2000).</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/4">During the past five years, as in previous periods, the common law powers of the Crown have often been relied upon as the legal basis for government action. Common law powers form the basis of such governmental actions as entering into contracts, employing staff, conveying property and other management functions not provided for by statute either expressly or by implication. To require parliamentary authority for every exercise of the common law powers exercisable by the Crown either would impose upon Parliament an impossible burden or produce legislation in terms that simply reproduced the common law.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/5">Finally, the circumstances that gave rise to the Ram doctrine are that the Ram opinion (the text of which was made available when an earlier Question (HL595) was answered on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-22">22 January 2003</phrase>) was given when the Ministers of the Crown (Transfer of Functions) Bill was being considered. This Bill later became the Ministers of the Crown (Transfer of Functions) Act 1946. The opinion addresses the need for legislation to confer power to add new functions to exisiting government departments by order. At that time Ministers were considering machinery of government changes following the Second World War.</p>

Normal field operations resumed fully during 2002. An additional &pound;300,000 was made available to the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) (&pound;50,000 to provide additional manpower during the busiest part of the year and &pound;250,000 for additional survey work). &pound;900,000 was made available for replacement traps etc.</p>

Local veterinary inspectors who carry out much of the routine and backlog TB testing have significantly stepped up their work on behalf of Defra, resulting in an increased spend in this area as well. Veterinary Laboratories Agency costs associated with laboratory diagnosis of bovine TB have also been increased substantially. It is not possible to identify separately the proportion of these additional resources which were directed to badger culling trial areas.</p>

As I said to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-19">19 November 2002</phrase>, the view we have taken is that rape is rape and cannot be divided into more and less serious offences. It can be equally as traumatic to be raped by someone you know and trust, who has chosen you as his victim, as it can be to be raped by a complete stranger.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.9/2">This remains the Government's position. We believe that the crime of rape is so serious that it needs to be considered in its totality rather than being constrained by any relationship between the parties. The issue of severity of the offence should be left to the judges on sentencing, rather than attempting to deal with it by creating a separate offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.9/3">This view is supported by the Sentencing Advisory Panel in its recently published guidelines on sentencing in cases of rape.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.3/1">Research evidence suggests that cost is not a major factor in influencing employers' attitudes towards recruitment and retention of disabled people. In a recent survey of employers <sup>1</sup> , 49 per cent of respondents thought there were no difficulties or were unable to say what the difficulties might be in recruiting a disabled employee; this figure was higher in the case of retaining disabled people (72 per cent). Cost was not mentioned as a difficulty in recruitment. Only 2 per cent cited it as a difficulty in retention.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/2">The experience of employers who have sought to retain disabled employees also suggests that cost does not play a major role. In the same survey, 78 per cent of employers with workers who had become disabled in post reported that they had made changes to retain the employee, including 19 per cent who said they had provided retraining for employees. Of those making adjustments, 20 per cent reported that the adjustment did not lead to any cost. A further 28 per cent stated that they regarded the cost as part of normal costs of the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/3">Research has also examined the factors influencing whether employers recruit disabled people or not. A survey of small employers <sup>2</sup> showed that only a small minority (4 per cent) of employers said they would not consider recruiting a person with a disability.

Using its existing rolling stock the company could expand its passenger services at weekends but not on weekdays. However, low demand for additional services at weekends would not warrant the additional subsidy costs that would be entailed. The replacement of its existing 18 Class 80 trains with 23 new trains currently on order will in due course enable Translink to expand its services particularly at peak periods on weekdays.</p>

However, the Lisburn to Antrim line now carries on average 70 passengers per day. On the basis of an economic appraisal which explored future growth patterns in the population serviced by the Antrim-Lisburn line, the case for significant capital investment on this line is not compelling.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.9/1">We have today placed in the Library copies of Modernising Medical Careers, the response of the four UK health Ministers to the consultation on Unfinished Business: Proposals for Reform of the Senior House Officer grade.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.9/2">The document sets out the results of our consultation which began last summer on the reform of training for senior house officers, who are doctors in the early stages of their specialist training. We received over 250 responses to our consultation and our proposals were broadly welcomed. The document we are publishing today sets the way ahead based on the results of the consultation and work which has been done since with the key stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.9/3">Plans for reform will also extend to general practice training and will embrace the existing non-consultant career grades with easier routes back into training. Partnerships will work to test these out in a variety of National Health Service environments. Pilot projects will start later on this year and with major implementation following in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/1">The information requested is shown in the following table. The comparison is between graduates with a first degree and national average earnings. Lifetime Earnings: Graduates vs. The National Average Summary 1. First degree graduates in full-time employment are estimated to earn around &pound;400,000 more (in gross terms) than full-time employees in general over their working lives. The attached note provides the analysis behind these figures. Sensitivity analysis suggests that these figures are robust to changes in the specific quarterly Labour Force Survey data used. Analysis of Gross Lifetime Differential 2. Table 1 shows the estimated lifetime earnings of graduates and the national average, based on gross earnings. Graduates are defined as individuals whose highest qualification is a first degree. Lifetime earnings are taken as earnings between the ages of 20 and 59. Graduates are included in the cohort to calculate average earnings. The analysis suggests that on average, graduates earn around &pound;400,000 more than the national average.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/10">Additional notes on Methodology and Interpretation</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/11">3. The figures in Table 1 are rounded to the nearest &pound;25,000 because they are based on the Labour Force Survey, which is a sample survey. Weekly earnings are usually rounded to the nearest &pound;10.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/12">4. The analysis is based on gross weekly average earnings for graduates and the national average, for the four quarters of the Labour Force Survey, autumn 2000 to summer 2001. The figures relate to full-time employees in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/13">5. Average weekly earnings were obtained for the following age groups: 20&ndash;24; 25&ndash;29; 30&ndash;34; 35&ndash;39; 40&ndash;49; and 50&ndash;59. Information on the employment rate of graduates and the national employment rate was also obtained for the same age groups. The gross weekly earnings figures were deflated by the respective employment rates to account for the fact that not all individuals are employed at any point.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/14">6. The deflated weekly earnings were averaged over the four quarters and grossed up to annual estimates for each age group. Since the averages relate to the age groups, they were taken as proxies for the average (deflated) annual earnings at each age in the group. Multiplying the averages by the number of years in the age group and summing across all groups provide an estimate of average lifetime earnings for graduates and the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/15">Sensitivity analysis</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/16">7. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess whether the estimated lifetime earnings differential changed according to the use of different quarters of LFS data. This analysis (see table 2) suggests that the lifetime earnings estimates fluctuate very little. Given this, the &pound;400,000 figure seems to be a robust estimate.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">Connexions partnerships will generally advertise the existence of the Connexions service within their locality. In addition, through the partnership agreement, partnerships will work with schools, colleges and other appropriate institutions to make the availability of the Connexions service known to parents and their sons and daughters; letting them know that it is available to young people both within their school or institution and via Connexions one stop shops in the high street.

	<p pid="a.29.5/1">We are extremely gratified that local authorities in London have shown a marked improvement between 1993&ndash;94 and 2001&ndash;02 in the average time it takes to relet their dwellings; and that registered social landlords have shown an improvement in average relet times across the South East between 1996&ndash;97 and 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/2">The figures quoted for the average time taken to relet local authority housing stock should be treated with caution, however. These figures are based on estimates provided by local autorities as part of their annual housing investment programme returns and there are likely to be variations in the way local authorities maintain their lettings records and compile these estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/3">One factor contributing to the increase in average relet times is likely to be the impact of low demand on housing, since the largest increases are in the regions which are experiencing the most acute level of low demand&mdash;North West, North East, Yorkshire and Humberside and West Midlands. In these regions we are tackling the problem head on through the establishment of nine sub-regional pathfinder projects to address the most acute problems of low demand. We have recently announced in Sustainable Communities: Building for the future an additional investment of &pound;500 million in the next three years for these pathfinder projects. An important part of returning these areas to sustainability is ensuring that there is a better balance between supply and demand for housing across all tenures (including the social housing stock).</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/4">The Government are committed to the adoption by local authorities of customer-focused, choice-based lettings policies. We believe that this is the best way to ensure sustainable lettings and stable and viable communities. We are funding a pilot scheme to test different choice-based lettings approaches and are monitoring their effect on relet times as part of the evaluation of the pilot scheme.</p>
