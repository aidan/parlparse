	<p pid="a.179.2/1">I refer the noble Lord to my Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September 2003</phrase> (WA 143) in which I stated that the principles of the directive are applied to the Race Relations (RRA) Act 1976 in respect of claims brought in areas of the RRA that are within the scope of the directive. Therefore potential claims of unlawful discrimination which fall within the scope of the directive will be subject to the revised provisions&mdash;such as the amended definition of indirect discrimination, the new statutory definition of harassment (which corresponds to the existing case law definition), the new definition of &quot;genuine occupational requirement&quot;, the provisions dealing with acts after a relationship has ended and with the burden of proof, and the repeal of some provisions which are contrary to the principle of equal treatment (as defined in the directive)&mdash;whereas claims which fall outside the scope of the directive will be subject to the Act's original provisions. It is our view&mdash;as reflected in the Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003&mdash;that claims brought on the grounds of colour fall outside the scope of the directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.0/1">We have no plans to open an immigration removal centre in Northern Ireland. Immigration detainees in Northern Ireland are accommodated in HMP Maghaberry. It is our policy to transfer persons detained in Northern Ireland to immigration removal centres on the mainland unless a specific request is made to stay in Northern Ireland, in which case the detainee in question will continue to be held at HMP Maghaberry.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/2">The location of immigration detainees at HMP Maghaberry is separate from the main prison population and every effort is made to cater for their needs. These detainees are managed as untried prisoners with a more favourable regime, which is more akin to that of enhanced prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/3">The Northern Ireland Prison Service seeks to provide for different pastoral needs of the immigration detainees as well as providing access to legal representation as required. Exercise is provided morning or afternoon and alternate evenings and a teacher attends two mornings each week to provide a basic English programme. Special diets are available, a fully equipped kitchen is provided and the detainees may use the prison tuck-shop without spending limits. There is unrestricted telephone access and various voluntary organisations provide support services including financial support to the extent of &pound;5 each week for each detainee.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.3/1">There is currently no official estimate of the number of immigrants unlawfully present in the United Kingdom.

Illegal migrants are motivated to ensure they remain hidden, which is a challenge to conducting research.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.6/1">A Home Office consultation document on the development and funding of voluntary and community sector (VCS) infrastructure in England is being published today. The Government's aim is to help to build a VCS, including social enterprise, which is fully engaged in shaping and delivering public services, underpinned by a high quality sustainable infrastructure that enables this to happen. Such support must meet the needs of a diverse sector and should complement support services available from the small business service and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/2">As part of the spending review 2002, the Treasury undertook a cross-cutting review of the role of the VCS in service delivery, published in September 2002. The review identified that VCS infrastructure was patchy in distribution and in quality and that this was a barrier to increasing VCS involvement in service delivery. It recommended that &quot;Government and the VCS should develop a coherent shared strategy to underpin capacity in the sector&quot;. Consultation with voluntary and community organisations, and others interested in an effective sector, will inform a final strategy to be published early next year. This will include proposals to guide the investment of approximately &pound;80 million of SR2002 funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/3">The aim is to put a strategy in place which ensures:</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/4" class="indent">high quality support for voluntary and community organisations delivered as close to the point of need as is economically viable;</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/5" class="indent">the existence of effective infrastructure locally, regionally and nationally. This may be supplemented by activity at a sub-regional level particularly activities that cannot be afforded more locally;</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/6" class="indent">accessible, high quality support available across the VCS, including to support volunteering, black and minority ethnic and other diversity issues, social and community enterprise, community development, rural needs, and to support VCS use of information and communications technology; and</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/7" class="indent">strengthened specialist infrastructure organisations operating nationally&mdash;and regionally where needed&mdash;covering thematic areas of VCS activity and service delivery such as youth work, childcare, and vocational training.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/8">Copies of the consultation document are available in the House Library and on the Home Office website. We would welcome views on the proposals and questions outlined in the paper by <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-22">Monday 22 December 2003</phrase>. A draft regulatory impact assessment is included with the consultation document.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-09-17a.184.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="184"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030917/text/30917w03.htm#30917w03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.184.6/1">The Government have today introduced a Bill to allow piloting of innovative voting methods at next year's European Parliamentary elections. The European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Bill also provides for pilots at local elections where these are combined with and take place on the same day as elections for the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.6/2">This legislation demonstrates the Government's commitment to their goal of making voting easier and more convenient and represents a marked scaling up from previous pilots. The Bill is needed as current legislation does not allow for piloting at European parliamentary elections and the Government are keen to maintain the momentum gained through previous successful pilot schemes. Such schemes have included both all-postal ballots and multi-channelled e-voting and, at this year's local elections, were conducted in 61 local authorities covering 6.4 million eligible voters.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.6/3">Decisions on which regions should be chosen for next year's pilots and which methods should be used in those regions will be informed by advice from the Electoral Commission. The Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are today jointly writing to the commission with guidance on this issue. The commission&mdash;an independent body funded by Parliament&mdash;will consult with stakeholders and report back later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.6/4">Alongside this legislation, the Government have also today launched a consultation on implementation of next year's pilot schemes. This consultation, to be conducted by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, will outline our plans for the pilots and seek comments from local authorities and other interested parties on our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.6/5">Our proposals have been developed in the light of the Electoral Commission's strategic evaluation of the pilots held at the local elections earlier this year. Its report, The Shape of Elections to Come, made a number of recommendations, which the Government have considered very carefully, and we have published today our formal response.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.6/6">One of the main recommendations made by the commission was that all-postal voting should be made the normal method of voting at local elections. We welcome that recommendation, but we recognise that it would involve a major change to our traditional electoral arrangements. Therefore, the Government intend to launch a public consultation on the detail of that recommendation later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.5/1">Our Physical Education, School Sport and Club Links strategy, being implemented jointly with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, provides targeted support to enhance school swimming. A recent survey carried out jointly by the Times Educational Supplement and the Central Council for Physical Recreation found that 84 per cent, or five in six pupils are able to safely swim, at least, 25 metres by the end of key stage 2. This is a modest improvement on the position reported to us by Ofsted in 2000&mdash;when 80 per cent, or four in five pupils in England, achieved this target.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/2">In its report, Ofsted noted that only in a minority of schools was water safety and survival not covered sufficiently well. The quality of teaching was good or better in four out of five lessons and in one-third of lessons, teaching was very good. Swimming is a vital personal and social skill, and an essential part of the PE national curriculum programme of study. Our swimming strategy is taking forward all of the key recommendations made by the Swimming Advisory Group. We have:</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/3" class="indent">created a new swimming and water safety website which provides practical support for schools and swimming teachers;</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/4" class="indent">carried out a pilot programme which tests out how best to support those children who reach the end of key stage 2 and are not able to swim 25 metres. Over 1,000 pupils have benefited from the scheme; and</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/5" class="indent">plans to publish a swimming charter before Christmas. This will set out guidelines, share best practice and provide the practical support to help schools overcome many of the challenges they face when planning and delivering swimming.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/6">Furthermore, as part of its wider provision, the PE and School Sport National Professional Development Programme will help to improve the quality of swimming teaching throughout England. The programme will identify where there is most need and provide specific professional development and support to help ensure high quality swimming tuition in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/7">No charge can be made for the cost of providing swimming lessons that take place wholly or mainly during school hours, or for the cost of transport to carry pupils to and from the lesson. Similarly, no charge can be made for lessons, or transport, that take place outside of school hours where the lesson is part of the national curriculum. Schools can ask for voluntary contributions to cover the cost of swimming activities, but when requesting the contribution it must make it clear that no child will be treated differently, or left out of the activity, because their parent is unable or unwilling to make the contribution. The department does not collect data on the percentage of maintained schools that request financial contributions towards swimming provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.0/1">The WTO ministerial Doha declaration in 2001 commits all WTO members to negotiations aimed at reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies for agricultural products.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/2">The proposals tabled for consideration at Cancun envisaged the elimination of export subsidies on certain products of particular interest to developing countries. The nature of these products and the timetable for elimination were left to be determined. The question of an end date for phasing out all forms of export subsidies was to remain under negotiation.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/3">The Government hoped for an outcome to the Cancun negotiations which would benefit farmers and consumers everywhere through a global move to freer and fairer agricultural trade. The failure to reach an agreement at Cancun is very disappointing and all parties must now reflect on how best to get the Doha process back on track. The Government remain fully committed to the Doha objectives for agriculture.</p>
