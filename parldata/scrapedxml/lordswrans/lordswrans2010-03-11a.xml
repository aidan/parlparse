	<p pid="a.95.2/1">The total carbon savings from the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme will be determined by the emissions cap which will apply from 2013. Analysis shows that by 2020 the scheme is expected to have delivered overall emissions savings of at least 4Mt CO2 per year. In setting the cap Government will consider advice from the Committee on Climate Change, which will be delivered later this year. Government will also consider the available cost effective emissions savings from the CRC sector to ensure it contributes fully to our carbon budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/2">The cap on emissions will be set for the scheme as a whole, not at sector or organisation level. The method of carbon reductions will be determined by each participant.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.8/1">Prisons have a responsibility to keep prisoners and staff safe. The management of violence, including sexual violence, and its reduction is central to successful prison management. It is fundamental to the objectives of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and vital to achieving the broad aims of safer custody. NOMS has in place a local violence reduction strategy which is currently under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.8/2">NOMS records numbers of all types of sexual assault incidents in prison but does not have a separate offence classification of rape. In the financial year 2008-09-the latest data available-124 sexual assaults were recorded on the NOMS incident reporting system. Analysis has shown that over 90 per cent of sexual assaults occur in male prisons. This figure includes proven and unproven allegations and is subject to change because some alleged incidents are removed or reclassified following further investigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.5/1">Multi-disciplinary courses have a key role to play in higher education. One of the strengths of English higher education is that institutions are autonomous, so it is for universities to decide which courses they teach. However, we want students and employers to have a say in what higher education programmes provide and we want universities to respond to their needs. We made clear in our framework for the future of higher education, Higher Ambitions, that we expect businesses to play a role in the design of higher education programmes. Higher Ambitions also commits to providing improved information for students and their families. This will help students to choose the course and institution that is right for them.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.8/1">Ultimately it is up to English universities, as autonomous institutions, to decide on the nature of their degree courses. However, the Government's framework for the future of higher education, Higher Ambitions, makes clear that we want both students and employers to engage with universities to ensure that courses are meeting their needs, including, where appropriate, by the provision of multi-disciplinary courses of study. Improved information for students about courses will help them to make informed decisions regarding the type of higher education course they wish to study.</p>
