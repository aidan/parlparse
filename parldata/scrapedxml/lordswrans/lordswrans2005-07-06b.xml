Estimates for biometric readers published in the RIA with the ID Cards Bill were &pound;250 to &pound;750. Costs for biometric readers at border control will differ from those used to read ID cards as the technologies within ID cards and some biometric documents presented at border control are different.

Any British national holding Indian overseas citizenship would be ineligible for registration under Section 4B since they could not meet the requirements of Section 4B(2)(b) of the British Nationality Act 1981 to hold no other citizenship or nationality.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.8/7">The share of rural development support allocated to individual measures under the Rural Development Regulation will depend in part on the overall total of expenditure available, and in part on ministerial decisions following a consultation later this year on how the rural development regulation is to be implemented in England. Some parameters have, however, already been set: the draft Rural Development Regulation on which political agreement was reached at the Agriculture Council meeting on 20 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June</phrase> establishes minimum percentages for the contribution from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to each of three priority areas: improving competitiveness of farming and forestry (10 per cent), environment and land management (25 per cent), diversification and broader rural development (10 per cent) and leader (5 per cent).</p>

The competition challenges developers to build quality two bedroom homes at a construction cost of approximately &pound;784 per square metre, which equates to &pound;60,000, or less. About a third of the homes will be built to this size and cost&mdash;the rest will be larger or smaller, in order to provide a mix of dwellings.

Through contracting, NOMS already has partnership arrangements in place for a range of services including property services, electronic monitoring and prison escort and custody services. NOMS will look centrally at what needs to be provided and will put in place the most appropriate strategy for delivery of those services, which may be at a national, regional or local level depending on the service and market place. Where identical services are required across regional boundaries NOMS will not be looking for service providers to bid individually to provide the service to each region.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.8/1">The Government have not so far been asked by the Council of Europe for a response to this question about plutonium discharges from Sellafield.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.8/2">All discharges from Sellafield are rigorously regulated by the Environment Agency to ensure that they do not pose a significant risk to human health or the environment. The current limit for liquid plutonium discharges from Sellafield is 700 gigabecquerels. This is the same as the previous limit. Actual discharges are currently less than half this limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.8/3">The question by Mr Hagberg also refers to a leak at the thermal oxide reprocessing plant. This leak was entirely contained within a secondary shielded cell which was designed for this purpose. There was, therefore, no release to the environment of any radioactive material from this incident.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.8/4">The Government have committed themselves to the objective of reducing radioactive discharges in the period to 2020. In 2002 the Government published a strategy on radioactive discharges demonstrating how this objective would be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.5/1">It is the Government's understanding that the Land Rover Defenders in question were supplied by a Turkish company to the Turkish Government who then gifted the vehicles to the Uzbek Government. Inquiries into this are continuing. The Government understand that Land Rover sells flat pack civil Land Rover Defenders to the Turkish company, that then assembles and rebadges them for onward sale under its own name, using its own products and components, and according to designs for which that company holds the intellectual property rights. These are not Land Rover approved products.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/2">Under the EC Dual-Use Regulation and our own domestic legislation, the UK has no power to control the export of civilian specification Land Rovers. The export of civilian vehicles converted by a Turkish company using its own technology and without UK involvement is a matter for Turkish export controls.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/3">More generally, the UK has been at the forefront in condemning the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force by the Uzbek authorities in Andizhan. When my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary first heard the reports of troops firing on demonstrators, he urged the Uzbek Government to allow an independent, international investigation. We are pleased that the US, the UN, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and NATO have all done the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-13">13 June</phrase>, the EU's General Affairs External Relations Council (GAERC) gave the Uzbek Government until the end of the month to agree to an independent, international enquiry. The GAERC made clear that partial suspension of co-operation under the partnership for co-operation agreement was likely to be one consequence of failure to do so. The EU is also considering a range of other options, which could include an EU visa ban for Uzbek Ministers, and an arms embargo.</p>

	<p pid="b.112.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>, 117 failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers were held in the UK detention estate awaiting removal to Zimbabwe. The asylum decision-making and independent appeals processes ensure that only those failed asylum seekers who would not be at risk of treatment that amounted to persecution under the 1951 Refugee Convention or that would engage our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights will be returned to their country of origin. If an unsuccessful claimant submits new information to show it would no longer be safe for them to return as a result of developments since their claim was refused, we will consider that information. If we decide it is still safe to remove but regard the information as nevertheless amounting to a fresh claim, a decision to proceed with removal would generate a further right of appeal. We do not actively monitor returnees, to Zimbabwe or to any other country&mdash;the processes outlined above ensure that we would not return someone if we believed them to be at risk. However, we will investigate any specific allegations of mistreatment of returnees. We are aware of uncorroborated reports that failed asylum seekers have been detained on arrival in Zimbabwe. We have investigated these reports where the returnees have been identified but the local and international human rights organisations we consulted were aware of only one unsubstantiated report of ill-treatment by a returnee, who was subsequently released. No corroborating evidence was found and there is no evidence that returnees have been systematically mistreated.</p>
