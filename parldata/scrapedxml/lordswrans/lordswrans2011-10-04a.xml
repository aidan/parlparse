In addition the Government are also progressing measures with regard to improving European vehicle safety regulations, supporting Bikeability cycle training for the rest of this Parliament, raising the standard of lorry driver training, and promoting the Highway Code. There is also a range of measures that local authorities can take, for instance safer road infrastructure, cycle lanes, local safety campaigns, 20 mph zones and better traffic management. These will, however, depend on local decisions and need to reflect local priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.2/1">The Government are fully committed to developing a representative workforce in all areas of the Civil Service. Respecting and valuing differences will help ensure that government policies and services reflect the needs and experiences of the people we serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/2">In 2005, the Government launched &quot;Delivering a Diverse Civil Service: A 10-Point Plan&quot; to drive forward the commitment to diversity over the three years to 2008.

This strategy built on the 10-point plan and earlier achievements and reflected the drive to mainstream equality and diversity further into every aspect of government business. This strategy also enables the Civil Service to fulfil its data transparency requirements under the Equality Act 2010-including monitoring of age, sexual orientation and religion or belief; as well as race, disability, gender and gender reassignment.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/4">The Civil Service is committed to various initiatives to address under representation issues, for example:</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/5">Leaders UnLtd launched in 2007. This is a Civil Service talent development programme aimed at women and black, asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff at grades 6 and 7 with the potential to progress to the senior Civil Service; andWhitehall Internship Programme launched in 2011. This comprises three complementary internship schemes designed for graduates, undergraduates, college students and secondary school students from under-represented groups, including BAME communities and people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. These programmes offered a variety of work placements including opportunities in Ministers' private offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/6">There are also departmental specific initiatives such as private office roadshows. These have been delivered in geographical areas with a high proportion of BAME staff and are intended to encourage staff from more diverse backgrounds to consider a career in private office.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.2/1">Since May 2010, three executive agencies have been reorganised and absorbed into government departments. Specifically, these are: the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency; the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency; and the People, Pay and Pensions Agency; all of which have been absorbed into the Ministry of Defence. No trading funds have been reorganised and absorbed into government departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-03">3 October 2011</phrase>, JobCentre Plus and the Pensions, Disability and Carers Service will formally have their agency status removed, and be absorbed into the work of the Department for Work and Pensions. There are a number of executive agencies whose status is currently under review, and which may be absorbed into departments in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/3">Arrangements for chief executives and senior managers, websites and performance reporting are a matter for individual departments. It will also be for departments to inform the public of the changes.</p>

Under a medium growth scenario, the global population will continue to rise throughout the 21st century, passing 9.3 billion in 2050 and 10.1 billion in 2100. Rapid population growth will mostly take place in the poorest countries where current fertility rates, if not reduced, will mean that populations in some countries are expected to double or triple by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.5/2">In the absence of commensurate economic growth, this will place a significant strain on the ability of Governments to deliver basic services such as health and education. Even with economic growth, this increase in global population is likely to build additional pressure on natural resources with some regions of the world experiencing increasing water scarcity, food shortages and new challenges for sustainable energy supplies and land availability. Rapid population growth, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, could also have an important role in shaping mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change, migration patterns and successful urbanisation policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.5/3">The UK Government are working closely with others to advance a comprehensive understanding of the role of population dynamics (specifically the demographic dividend associated with declining fertility) in helping achieve increased economic productivity and rising per capita income in developing economies.</p>
