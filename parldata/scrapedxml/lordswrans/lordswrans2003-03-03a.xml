	<p pid="a.79.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-27">27 February</phrase> an Order in Council was made to amend the constitution of Bermuda. This amendment, which has received widespread political support in Bermuda, will change the system of elections to Bermuda's House of Assembly from 20 dual-seat constituencies to 36 single-seat constituencies, as recommended by the Bermuda Constituency Boundaries Commission in its 2002 report.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/2">The consultation process adopted in deciding upon this amendment has highlighted concerns in Bermuda that there should be a clear and generally acceptable procedure for considering future proposals for constitutional amendment. The Secretary of State wishes to ensure that, subject to the sovereign rights of Her Majesty, the process of considering such proposals is as transparent as possible and that the citizens and political parties of Bermuda are consulted as widely as possible before changes are made. He has therefore asked the Governor to explore the issue locally to see whether interested parties in Bermuda can come forward with acceptable proposals for procedures to be followed in future, which can then be put to him for consideration. These proposals are to include the means by which the public is consulted over proposed constituency boundary changes when a future constituency boundaries commission is undertaking its work. The Secretary of State understands that the Governor plans to canvass suggestions from individuals, political parties and organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.3/1">There are no special arrangements for overseas nationals coming to the United Kingdom (UK) to visit a spouse or other family member who has been imprisoned here. Such applications are considered under the general provisions for visitors as set out in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395). To qualify for entry to the United Kingdom as a visitor an applicant must demonstrate that he or she is genuinely seeking entry as a visitor for the period stated, has sufficient funds for personal support and accommodation, holding any dependants without working or recourse to public funds, and that he or she will leave the United Kingdom at the end of the visit. The maximum period allowed for a visit is normally six months. We do not consider that this policy is inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">Government policy is aimed at ensuring we have a firm, fair, fast and effective system, which of course affects all asylum applicants, by dealing with those with genuine claims effectively and efficiently, while also deterring those who seek to abuse the system. We also help a number of those needing humanitarian assistance via specific schemes (e.g. Kosovans assisted under the HEP programme).</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2">Current policy initiatives, such as juxtaposed controls in France and the deployment of detection technology at continental ports, are designed to prevent those who seek to circumvent our controls at specific ports of entry from doing so. The Government are confident that by September 2003 this will reduce significantly new asylum claims by around half compared with the number last October.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.5/1">In order to maximise the impact of the non-suspensive appeal provisions, Oakington took, from <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-07">7 November 2002</phrase>, only claimants from the 10 EU accession states (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia) listed as safe in the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Claims from these countries will be refused and certified as clearly unfounded, generating a non-suspensive appeal (NSA) right, unless my right honourable friend the Home Secretary is satisfied they are not. In these cases, applicants are detained at Oakington for their decision and until removal, unless it is judged necessary to transfer them to secure detention. The daily intake at Oakington was then dependent upon claims from persons entitled to reside in these 10 countries and the impact on this daily intake of this new process was obviously not possible to predict. In fact, the process had an immediate and significant impact: numbers dropped significantly in December 2002 and were low in early January 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/2">As a result, from <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-12">12 January 2003</phrase>, Oakington has resumed intake from the list of 40 previous nationalities from the Oakington-suitable list. This has enabled us to make best use of Oakington while retaining the flexibility to give absolute priority to the 10 nationalities at present covered by the NSA process, which is to be extended to include the further seven nationalities recently announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/3">Figures for occupancy at Oakington are normally published on a quarterly basis and those for January are not yet available in publishable form. However, at <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>, locally-held management information shows there to have been 116 detained at the centre on that day.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.5/1">We comply with the recommendation. It is important to read the relevant parts of the text of the recommendation in context and as a whole. The recommendation clearly envisages that the constitutional or legal provisions of some countries allow judges to be appointed by the government. (In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the Lord Chancellor is responsible for appointing, or advising the Queen on the appointment of, virtually all judges. The most senior appointments are made by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister following advice provided by the Lord Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/2">The recommendation proposes that in such circumstances there should be guarantees to ensure that the appointment procedures are transparent and independent in practice and will not be influenced by reasons other than merit. One of the examples of such guarantees suggested is that the authority which makes the decision safeguards against undue or improper influences. That guarantee is given effect here by the fact that there is in this country no higher duty of the holder of the office of Lord Chancellor than to ensure from within government that judicial independence is respected and maintained. Futhermore, the procedures for appointing judges are transparent and subject to the scrutiny of the Commissioners for Judicial Appointments covering England and Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.5/1">The Goverment's aim remains a comprehensive settlement in time for a reunited Cyprus to accede to the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="">16 April</phrase>. For this to happen, the UN has set <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase> as the deadline for a decision on the Secretary-General's proposals. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">Sunday 23 February</phrase>, Kofi Annan put forward ideas to the two sides on how he might revise his <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase> proposals and consulted the governments in Ankara and Athens before his historic visit to Nicosia. President-elect, Mr Tassos Papadopoulos, has made clear that the change of government under way in Cyprus will not impede the UN timetable. The UK has supported the UN throughout this process and has welcomed the balanced and comprehensive settlement proposals tabled by the Secretary-General. We urge both sides now to secure a settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/2">During the intensive negotiations which followed the Copenhagen European Council, it became clear that the issue of territorial readjustment was a key one, needing to be resolved if there was to be a settlement. In particular, it became clear that both sides attached great importance to adjustments which represented a relatively small percentage of the area of Cyprus. The Government therefore gave urgent consideration to whether we could in some way help to bridge the remaining gap. A decision was reached to inform the UN Secretary-General that Britain would be prepared to cede part of the UK's sovereign base areas, and this offer has now been included in the UN Secretary-General's ideas of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/3">The offer consists of 45 square miles&mdash;just under half of the total area of the SBAs. This makes up 1.2 per cent of the area of the new state of affairs in Cyprus. The areas involved would bring a number of Cypriots living near Limassol, and in the Dhekelia sovereign base area, within the administration of their respective constituent state. It will also open up areas of coastline for possible development. The areas involved do not contain military infrastructure, and this offer will not have any adverse impact on the functioning of the SBAs. The offer would only become valid if there were agreement by both sides to the UN's proposals. And, of course, legislation would be introduced to bring the transfer of territory into operation. In the event that either side in Cyprus rejects the proposals, or the proposals are rejected in a referendum by either side, the offer, along with the rest of the UN proposals, will become null and void.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/4">We urge both sides not to let this historic opportunity to heal the division of Cyprus slip away; and to go the last mile to conclude negotiations and secure the settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.0/1">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs commissions market surveys to assess the effectiveness of the Green Claims Code. We have commissioned two since its publication. The first, The Green Claims Code: is it working?, was carried out in 1999 by the National Consumer Council (available on the NCC's website at <a href="http://www.ncc.org.uk/pubs/green.htm">www.ncc.org.uk/pubs/green.htm</a>). The second, A survey of environmental claims and declarations made on consumer products, was carried out in 2001 by Ecotec Research and Consulting (available on the department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consumerprod/accpe/research/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consumerprod/accpe/research/index.htm</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/2">The general findings are that only a small proportion of products in the market offer any form of environmental declaration. Where claims are actually made the quality varies considerably. The most recent survey indicated that about half met the standards in the code, but about 40 per cent did not and about 10 per cent were borderline.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/3">There are regulatory and advisory measures which serve to deter bad practice in green claims. Legislation is available to deal with claims which are demonstrably false or misleading under the Control of Misleading Advertising Regulations 1988 and the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. No information is collected centrally about cases brought under this legislation. The Green Claims Code also advises on practice which should be avoided by those placing information on the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/4">The Green Claims Code is also designed to help business make good green claims by giving advice on best practice. As well as issuing and promoting the code, we have published a consumer information leaflet (Hi I'm Green) which provides advice to the public on what claims to look out for and how to take up claims they think are unhelpful or misleading. Together the code and leaflet will increase consumer awareness about the standard of information they should expect and should start to demand from manufacturers and retailers; and will help consumers to identify which businesses are performing to a good standard.</p>
