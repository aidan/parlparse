	<p pid="a.163.1/1" qnum="HL8777">To ask Her Majesty's Government, in view of the high risk of lower limb injury as a result of improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and the number of military personnel surviving these injuries, whether they will (a) remove the current cap on awards of &#163;570,000 in the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, (b) remove the sliding discounted scale for additional injuries, and (c) remove the word &quot;compensation&quot; from the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme title.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.2/1">The review of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) carried out by Admiral, the Lord Boyce, re-examined the increases made to the tariff levels in 2008 and concluded that the top level of lump sum of &#163;570,000, that had been doubled, remained appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/2">Lord Boyce also looked closely at the compensation arrangements in place for those who suffer multiple injuries arising from a single incident. He concluded that in these instances some compensation will be paid for each injury up to a maximum level for a single tariff level one injury of &#163;570,000. The rationale behind this was that there comes a point where the injuries sustained by an individual are most profound and that therefore a consistent approach should be taken to lump sum payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/3">It should be noted that the guaranteed income payment element of an AFCS award can be the most financially beneficial part of the compensation package. This tax- free payment paid from the point of discharge for life is worth many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and is not capped.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/4">It is important that the title of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme is understandable, accessible and transparent. We therefore have no plans to change it.</p>

We believe that Saudi Arabia, like other states in the region, supports a successful dialogue in Bahrain. We have seen no concrete evidence that Gulf Co-operation Council forces have done anything other than safeguard installations.</p>

The four largest UK banks will support the establishment of the Big Society Bank (BSB) with the injection of &#163;200 million of capital over two years, commencing in 2011. Capital invested through the BSB will mean more financing available for front-line organisations. The BSB will work with social investors, social lenders and other organisations that support the front line to grow a sustainable social investment market. By investing in products developed by intermediaries and encouraging others to invest in social change, BSB will grow the pool of capital and range of financial options available for investment in front-line social sector organisations. This will give these organisations more scope to increase their sustainability and resilience.</p>

The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my honourable friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40600" name="Jeremy Browne">the Member for Taunton Deane (Mr Browne)</phrase> has written to the Chinese ambassador raising his concerns at recent human rights developments in China, including the situation at Kirti Monastery.

Long-term stability in Tibet and Tibetan regions can only be achieved through respect for human rights and genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution.

	<p pid="a.165.5/2">Gang injunctions were introduced as a civil tool, in January 2011, to allow the police or a local authority to apply to a county court (or the High Court) for an injunction against an individual who has been involved in gang-related violence. Courts may place a range of prohibitions and requirements on an individual, including those that prohibit the person from being in a particular place or that require them to participate in rehabilitative activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.2/1">The Government have developed a fresh approach to managing the return of families with children who do not have a legal right to be in the UK. The aim is to maximise the opportunity for families to take responsibility for how they leave the country and to avoid the need for their departure to be enforced by the UK Border Agency. Most elements of this new process were introduced nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March</phrase>. All families with children that remain unlawfully in the UK could potentially go through this new returns process. The number of families who go through the different stages of the new process will depend on the decisions they take about their departure and therefore is difficult to predict accurately, but we hope that most families in this position will take the opportunity to leave at the earlier assisted or required return stages. This new approach will not apply to children who are unaccompanied.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.3/1">All victims of trafficking are offered a minimum 45-day recovery and reflection period. Some victims are UK nationals and some are EU citizens not subject to immigration control. Those that are subject to control may be eligible for a residence permit if their personal circumstances warrant them remaining in the UK or if they are co-operating with the authorities in a criminal investigation or proceedings.
