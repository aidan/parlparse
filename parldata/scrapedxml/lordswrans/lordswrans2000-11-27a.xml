	<p pid="a.101.5/1">Responsibility for monitoring progress towards the International Development Targets (IDTs) lies with the World Bank, which collates relevant data from the other international agencies and publishes them annually in World Development Indicators. The Department for International Development reproduces these data for each IDT by country in its annual publication Statistics on International Development. The next edition will be published in December 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/2">There is widespread agreement in the international community, including the United Nations, the World Bank and the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, on the uses of a core set of some 21 indicators to monitor progress towards the IDTs. In many countries, statistical capacity to collect the necessary data is weak. DFID and others are providing support to strengthen national statistical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/3">Monitoring annual progress is not possible in all circumstances as in some cases data are collected only every few years. For example, data on the proportion of a nation's population subsisting on less than US$1.00 per day are collected only every third year. Estimates of maternal mortality rates are mostly based on surveys which collect data on maternal deaths over several previous years, and in some cases the previous 10 or 12 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/4">DFID's Public Service Agreement (PSA) provides a framework for monitoring the contribution of DFID's activities towards achievement of specific IDTs. Progress against PSA objectives is reported in DFID's annual departmental report.</p>

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has spent &pound;2 million on research to investigate the epidemiology of BSE and vCJD. The study of BSE epidemiology has not indicated that there is a link with exposure to OPs. MAFF has also invited a leading proponent of the link between exposure to OPs and BSE to submit a proposal to investigate this theory; (b) no research has been funded by the DH or MAFF into vaccines or injectibles where bovine material has been used. Again epidemiological studies have failed to implicate biologicals or pharmaceuticals in the epidemiology of BSE; (c) the persistence of BSE in the environment (soil) is being funded by MAFF at a total cost of &pound;2.3 million and the possible role of bacteria in feed and the environment in triggering BSE is being studied at a total cost of &pound;230,000 to MAFF.</p>

This is being led by Deputy Chief Constable Colin Port, and both he and his team continue tirelessly to track down and bring before the courts those responsible for this cowardly murder.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.6/1">As announced by my honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr Moonie) in the other place, on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-09">9 November 2000</phrase>, (Official Report, col. 326W), the Met Office has chosen Exeter Business Park as the preferred site for its new operational and administrative headquarters. In making this choice the Met Office took full account of the strategic issues both as they relate to its own future and as they affect the UK more generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.6/2">While there are some attractions of being close to the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) at Shinfield Park, Reading, this is by no means essential in order to derive maximum benefit for the UK and Europe. What is important is that the Met Office should continue to develop its Numerical Weather Prediction capability in concert with ECMWF, thereby placing the UK in a strong position within Europe. With modern communications and the undoubted desire of both parties to strengthen the already close relationship, this can be achieved very well indeed from Exeter, and without raising concerns amongst our European partners which would have almost certainly been the case had the Met Office relocated to Shinfield Park.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.6/3">With regard to economic factors, reducing the Met Office's operating costs--so that, among other things, it can fund its future research and development programmes--is vital, as is ensuring that it can continue to recruit and retain the very best staff. This is better achieved by relocating to an area where the costs of living are lower and where there are excellent opportunities for further development.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">As announced by my honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, (Dr Moonie) in the other place, on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-09">9 November 2000</phrase>, (Official Report, column 326W), the Met Office has chosen Exeter Business Park as the preferred site for its new operational and administrative headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">Whilst no direct consultation has taken place on the choice of preferred site itself, this choice was taken by the Met Office in the best interests of its customers, both in the public and private sectors. These customers have repeatedly made it clear that, whilst forecast accuracy and service quality are high and continually improving, they remain concerned about the affordability of the Met Office's services and the costs of maintaining and developing its underpinning core capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">Part of the reason for choosing Exeter as the preferred site was the opportunity to reduce costs significantly without compromising quality, so that the benefits could be passed on to customers.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.4/2" qnum="HL4657">Further to the Written Answer by Baroness Scotand of Asthal on 9 November (WA 167-168) concerning the proposed European Charter of Human Rights, how the statement that &quot;The Charter is not legally binding&quot; can be reconciled with a following statement: &quot;In deciding how to interpret fundamental rights the ECJ is now, and will remain, free to have regard to relevant material. That may include the Charter&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.5/1">The two statements are consistent. The EU is already obliged to respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the ECHR and resulting from the constitutional traditions common to the member states; and the ECJ is responsible for ensuring that this happens. That obligation to respect fundamental rights was first given treaty status at Maastricht.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.5/2">The ECJ can and does look at all kinds of sources. It does not follow that the charter will itself become legally binding as a result. The fact that there is language in the charter does not mean that the ECJ has to take it into account. It would only become manadatory for the ECJ to take account of the charter if it were incorporated into the treaties or otherwise made legally binding. We and others have made our opposition to that clear.</p>

The Governor informed the Cayman Island's UK Representative when the CPA visit was first proposed of his absence from the territory during August and early September.

	<p pid="a.118.2/1">The House of Lords ruled in the appeal case of David Steed v the Home Office that a firearms compensation claimant could bring proceedings against the Home Office in the County Court to claim for unpaid compensation. In line with the normal court procedures in such a case, a claimant would also be entitled to claim simple interest at the statutory rate if successful and if the payment of compensation was regarded as being &quot;late&quot;. The House of Lords did not stipulate what a reasonable time for payment might be and, indeed, recognised that different periods would apply in different cases. The ruling in the Steed case does not therefore create a general entitlement to interest and there are no plans to make such payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.5/13">* All figures rounded to nearest &pound; million.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/14">tal Standard Spending</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/15">Police funding proposals within the local government finance system are being announced today by my right honourable friend the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Ms Armstrong, and by the National Assembly for Wales. These proposals and my right honourable friend the Home Secretary's would provide Total Standard Spending on the police in England and Wales of &pound;7,731.774 million, an increase of around &pound;377.4 million or 5.1 per cent over the comparable provision for 2000-2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/16">The overall increase is 5.1 per cent, but increases for individual police authorities vary. The formula used to determine the distribution of grant/Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) is unchanged for 2001-02. The main reasons for differences between police authorities result from changes in the data applied from one year to the next. These include changes in population, unemployment, projected pensions commitments and the Area Cost Adjustment.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/17">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary proposes that the Metropolitan Police Service should continue to receive additional funding in recognition of its distinct national and capital city functions. It has proved very difficult for the principal formula to take account of these special circumstances. As in previous years, therefore, a special payment of grant will be made to the Metropolitan Police Service over and above that available through the principal formula. He has set the amount of this special payment at &pound;191 million; which is included in the total provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/18">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary proposes to make special payments of grant to the following police authorities in 2001-02 in recognition of the additional costs which will be incurred as a result of the changes to the Metropolitan Police District boundaries as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/19" class="indent">Essex: &pound;14,000</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/20" class="indent">Hertfordshire: &pound;627,000</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/21" class="indent">Surrey: &pound;1,609,000</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/22">The proposed allocations, compared with those for last year, are given in the table as follows. The table also includes provisional allocations for capital financing SSA and for SSA Protection Grant and Central Support Protection Grant where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/23">ecial Police Grants and Central Support Services</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/24">The substantial increase since the last settlement provides the opportunity to develop a number of specific ringfenced initiatives:</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/25" class="indent">Crime Fighting Fund: (&pound;151 million, for which up to &pound;129 million will be targeted grants) for the estimated cost in 2001-2002 of police officers recruited this year and next, over and above forces' existing recruitment plans. The overall cost includes recruitment and training. Targets agreed with each force for recruitment, and performance against them, will be reviewed regularly. Actual payments to police authorities will be based on performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/26" class="indent">Rural Policing Fund: (&pound;30 million) to help address the particular pressures of policing rural areas. The payment follows an allocation of &pound;15 million made this year. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will expect police authorities to demonstrate how they have used the added investment to reduce crime and the fear of crime in more rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/27" class="indent">Airwave: (&pound;49 million) for introduction of the public safety radio communication system. The total includes up to &pound;32.488 million grants to police authorities for start-up costs for introduction of Airwave. Grants will be paid to forces taking Airwave in 2001-2002. Similar arrangements will apply in future in the year each force joins the system. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will also provide centrally for payment centrally of the core service charge to the contractor. He envisages that the total provision in the years 2001-02 to 2003-04 (for start up, capital and core costs) will reach &pound;500 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/28" class="indent">Basic Command Unit Fund: (&pound;5 million) to support and encourage initiatives to prevent crime and the fear of crime at the policing level closest to the general public and to extend inspection to BCU performance. Details of the scheme are being developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/29" class="indent">DNA Expansion Project: (&pound;63 million) for processing samples, scientific support, training and evidential casework. Work on how most effectively to target this money is in hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/30" class="indent">National Strategy for Police Information Systems: (&pound;12 million) to support information system developments by forces on behalf of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/31">Capital</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/32">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary intends to increase the provision of grant and supplementary credit approvals from &pound;144.43 million this year to &pound;157.43 million next year. Allocations will reflect any remaining outstanding undertakings given to support particular capital projects and will otherwise be guided as in previous years by the grant/SSA formula. In addition, capital grants for the introduction of Airwave (up to &pound;75 million) will be made available to those police authorities taking up the service in 2001-02. Grants will be made in future years to those taking up the service subsequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/33">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will inform the House of any significant allocations of grant to police authorities for these initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/34">Several projects to be carried forward next year were launched or increased with new money this year, in addition to that in the settlement for 2000-01. The original targets in the Crime Fighting Fund were accelerated (&pound;24 million), the Rural Policing fund was introduced (&pound;15 million), provision was made for special initiatives to counter robbery in metropolitan areas (&pound;20 million) and a central programme of recruitment advertising to support local police authority initiatives was launched (&pound;7 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/35">The settlement continues to take account of my commitment to improve police efficiency. For the third year running, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has set a target of 2 per cent efficiency gains year on year for the police service from 2001-2002. As in previous years, police authorities may invest the savings to help meet front line policing priorities. Police grant allocations for 2002-2003 will be considered in the light of police authorities meeting the 2 per cent efficiency targets. Authorities which fail to achieve the efficiency gain sought may be subject to an appropriate deduction from their resources. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is pleased that performance this year is such that it has not been necessary to apply this sanction to the grant allocations for 2001-2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/36">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary expects police authorities in England to exercise restraint and sound financial management by setting budgets that are responsible, prudent and reasonable. We shall be monitoring the position very carefully. The National Assembly for Wales is responsible for exercising reserve powers to limit council tax increases in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">The total provision for police forces in 2001-02 for officers recruited under the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) is likely to be &pound;129 million. This includes funding for the continued employment of officers recruited during 2000-01 as well as funding for new recruits in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/2">The table provides an indicative breakdown of payments between forces, assuming that all forces recruit their full CFF allocation in 2000-01 and that they also recruit their full CFF allocations in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/3">Bids form forces to accelerate or to defer CFF allocations between 2000-01 and 2001-02 are presently under consideration. CFF allocations for 2001-02 are therefore provisional and depend upon forces meeting the continuation criteria set out in the CFF bidding guide. Decisions on acceleration/deferral and on compliance with the continuation criteria may affect the amounts payable to forces in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/4">Payments to forces for individual CFF recruits are made pro rata from the point at which the CFF officers are recruited. Payments due will change to reflect the actual pattern of recruitment if it is different from the even distribution assumed for the purposes of the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/5">In addition to payments direct to forces, National Police Training (NPT) will receive funding to train new recruits to provincial forces. The total CFF provision also includes a contingency to cover, for example, costs arising from any new allowances that may be introduced which affect CFF recruits.</p>
