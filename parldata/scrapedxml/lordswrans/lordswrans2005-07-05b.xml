	<p pid="b.75.0/1">The construction of section 2 of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link was originally forecast to cost &pound;3.3 billion.

LCR calculates that if these inflationary effects were removed, then the outturn cost of section 2 would be within a few percentage points of the target price.

	<p pid="b.77.2/1">There are aspects of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings that are currently of concern. The particular areas of concern relate to issues surrounding the provision of recovery and reflection periods (Article 13) and residence permits (Article 14). The mandatory nature of these provisions when coupled with the scope of the convention has led to concerns that the provisions will act as an immigration pull factor, encourage spurious claims, and be used by those who have no right to remain in an effort to frustrate removal. Abuse of the provisions would ultimately impact on those in genuine need of assistance. Provision already exists for my right honourable friend the Home Secretary to exercise his discretion where it is clear that it is not appropriate to remove an individual or where it is appropriate to allow them time to recover before any decision is made in respect of their immigration status.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.0/1">All unaccompanied children requiring leave to enter the United Kingdom are examined by immigration staff at ports of entry. Their details, in addition to the details of their UK sponsor if appropriate, are checked against the Home Office databases for the purposes of immigration control and the prevention of crime. Where a child arrives without a document, a screening interview will be undertaken by specialist immigration staff to determine, as far as possible, their true identity. The screening interview will cover family background, family members, contacts in the United Kingdom and their travel route to the United Kingdom. A set of fingerprints will also be captured but only in the cases of children over the age of five years of age to ensure that prints are of an acceptable quality. The vulnerability of children who arrive unaccompanied in the United Kingdom is recognised and every effort is made to establish the bona-fides of the person they are meeting and the purpose of their visit. Where an immigration officer has concerns for the welfare of a child the police or social services will be alerted, depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.3/1">The assessment that delays as a result of traffic management are unlikely is based on the design studies for the scheme. The studies show that the majority of traffic using the junction between the M2 and A2 originates from and returns to the A2, and therefore does not pass under the bridges where works are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/2">Under the bridges there is normally one running lane coast bound and two running lanes London bound. Since an equal volume of traffic passes in both directions, the required capacity is generally only one lane in each direction. During the period of roadworks, a minimum of one running lane is being maintained in each direction. Therefore the assessment is that delays are unlikely.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/3">Observations of traffic conditions at the site are made by the traffic management contractor. The contractor visits the site every two hours, during the week and at weekends, to monitor traffic flow and the safety of the site. To date no major delays have been observed due to the traffic management arrangements, either during the week or at weekends.</p>

	<p pid="b.80.2/1">The quote in the Question is not from a Defra press notice. However, our approach to improving services in rural areas is to build capacity in communities to allow them effectively to identify and articulate their needs to those who deliver services. The public services modernisation agenda is founded on providing local solutions for local people. Rural proofing, linked to the public services modernisation agenda, will ensure that services to those in rural areas are supported and that rural needs are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/2">In practice this means that we will continue with our work across government to help rural proof policies and delivery at national, regional and local levels so that people living in rural areas see benefits from the Government's programme to modernise, improve and support public services.</p>

Others include the way we designed mini Sure Start programmes in rural areas and work we are doing to ensure pensioner take-up of benefits. The Rural Services Review also highlights a number of solutions to delivery in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/4">This sort of collaborative working, based on the principles in our strategy for rural areas, will ensure that communities benefit from our programmes to modernise, improve and support public services and will enable communities to help themselves to meet the needs of local people.</p>

	<p pid="b.81.0/1">We are supporting the modernisation of school premises through the massive expansion of capital support that we are making available. In 1996&ndash;97, there was under &pound;700 million a year being provided for investment in school buildings. This year there is &pound;5.5 billion, and this will rise to over &pound;6.3 billion by 2007&ndash;08&mdash;a sixfold increase in real terms. Over &pound;17.5 billion of government support is available over the next three years for investment in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/2">Every school in England now receives substantial money to invest in its own buildings. By 2007&ndash;08, a typical secondary school of 1,000 pupils will get &pound;113,000 a year and a typical primary school of 250 pupils will get &pound;34,000 a year. In addition, every authority and every diocese gets needs-related allocations of funding for their local priorities and strategic investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/3">We are also addressing the transformation of secondary schools through the academies programme and Building Schools for the Future (BSF) which aims to give all secondary schools 21st century facilities in 15 years. Thirty-nine authorities and about 380 schools have been prioritised in the first three waves, with &pound;6.5 billion of investment. We aim to have 200 academies operational or in development by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/4">In his March Budget, the Chancellor announced that from 2008&ndash;09, there would be additional capital available&mdash;&pound;150 million in 2008&ndash;09, rising to &pound;500 million a year from 2009&ndash;10&mdash;to start the transformation of primary schools, with the aim of renewing at least half in the next 15 years. We will announce further details of this programme later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/5">All investment should be aimed at improving educational achievement. As part of BSF, my department commissioned a range of exemplar designs for primary and secondary schools from a range of leading and innovative architects, to promote innovation and excellence in school design. We have also supported many exciting and ground-breaking individual &quot;classroom of the future&quot; projects, and also the work of organisations such as the Sorrell Foundation, School Works, the Design Council, RIBA and Learning through Landscapes in developing school-based design solutions for improving school buildings and better use of their grounds. Information on these projects is available to help schools and authorities consider how best to modernise their buildings and ensure that investment impacts positively on achievement.</p>

These pilots have tested various approaches and have included targeted interventions to support particular groups of pupils through, for example, academic mentoring and catch-up support. The experience of these projects is currently informing the roll-out of a national programme to raise the attainment of black pupils from September 2005. This programme will work with local authorities and schools to target additional support directly at underachieving black pupils.</p>

	<p pid="b.84.5/1">We have no plans to release all Zimbabweans currently held in detention pending deportation. It is clear that there are Zimbabweans who need international protection, and we will continue to offer that protection to those who need it. However, not all Zimbabweans who claim asylum in the UK genuinely face persecution. We return only those who the asylum decision-making and independent appeals processes have found do not need international protection and who can therefore be returned safely to Zimbabwe. It is an important part of ensuring an effective and fair asylum system that those found not to be in need of international protection are removed from the UK. We examine with great care each individual case before removal and we will not remove anyone who we believe is at risk on their return.</p>
