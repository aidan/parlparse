Evidence from local involvement networks, national surveys and Commission for Social Care Inspection surveys obtained from service and regulatory inspections will give appropriate opportunities to triangulate the results with councils' own monitoring and survey work to form a view on the quality of services.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.0/1">It might be helpful if I begin by explaining the basis on which any MoD civil servant may be awarded a non-consolidated award. It is a key element of the Government's pay policy that a proportion of the pay of civil servants is performance-related. The MoD meets this requirement by awarding one-off, non-consolidated and non-pensionable payments which very clearly reward performance in any given year rather than by increasing base pay which has a consolidated ongoing effect even if performance later tails off.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/2">In turning to non-consolidated awards for senior civil servants, the policy framework for awarding them to members of the Senior Civil Service is set by the Cabinet Office. The MoD is responsible for implementing its own base pay and non-consolidated award arrangements within this framework through an agreed pay strategy. Any non-consolidated award is based on a judgment of how well an individual has performed against their peers and they are awarded to those individuals judged to have made the highest in-year contribution to MoD business objectives. There is no restriction on the nature of the contribution; the only requirement is that it benefits the department or defence more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/3">Recommendations for awards, which are considered by moderation committees, must be linked to demonstrable evidence of delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.5/1">As reported in PQ HL2990, the MRC has made one award which specifically addresses somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The award, held by the University of Newcastle, aims to incorporate technological advances to improve the efficiency of SCNT in human oocytes and develop a reproducible method of generating human embryonic stem cells following the transfer of the nucleus of an adult somatic cell into an oocyte. The project was funded in 2007 and is due to end towards the end of 2009. No research papers relating to this ongoing study have been published to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.5/2">The publications referred to on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) relate to ongoing MRC funding to the MRC Centre in Edinburgh and Professor Smith's team in Cambridge. This work was commenced prior to the MRC call for platform technology proposals in iPSC, funded in April 2009, though has been directly aided by the additional funding provided through this call.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.5/3">It should be noted that the timescale of developments using these two distinct approaches is not directly comparable, since SCNT represents technology in development, with significant technological hurdles in relation to using human oocytes, which are being addressed through the MRC award to the University of Newcastle. This is in contrast to the iPSC field, which has moved rapidly since the original proof of concept in mouse (2006) and human (2007) cells through the concerted efforts of numerous laboratories worldwide able to utilise the published methodology.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.3/1">The 2004 spending review committed the Northern Ireland Office to achieving a target of &pound;90 million of efficiency gains by March 2008. By the end of 2007-08, &pound;103.6 million of efficiency gains had been delivered by the department and, as part of the NIO CSR 2007 settlement, HM Treasury agreed that &pound;11 million of this overachievement could be included as part of the department's CSR07 value-for-money target. At the request of HM Treasury, to ensure transparency around the figures, this overachievement was deducted from final published SR04 efficiency figures to ensure there is no double counting when the department publishes delivery against value-for-money programme targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.3/2">The final efficiency gain amount for 2007-08 is less than the forecast figure that appeared in the department's efficiency technical note and the 2007 autumn performance report because these figures were not at the time reported net of overdelivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.3/3">The SR04 efficiency programme concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> and the department now reports efficiency against the CSR07 value-for-money programme, details of which can be found at <a href="http://www.nio.gov.uk">www.nio.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.6/1">The Care Quality Commission (CQC), as regulator of social care, inspects care providers against statutory regulations and national minimum standards and has powers of enforcement, which it may use at its discretion, depending on the nature/severity of any breach of regulations. The range of powers is:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.6/2">a formal non-statutory caution;a notice requiring improvement within a specified time period;conditions that place restrictions on registration (for example, preventing the provider running a particular service or preventing further admissions to a service);prosecution of organisations and/or individuals&mdash;resulting in fines or, in extreme cases, imprisonment; and ultimatelycancellation of registration, which closes the service down.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.6/3">From 2010, the CQC will be introducing a new system of registration under the Health and Social Care Act 2008, which will give it additional powers designed to bring providers back into compliance where they are not providing acceptable levels of care. The full range of powers will be:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.6/4">a formal non-statutory caution;a new statutory warning notice, requiring improvement within a specified time; conditions that place restrictions on registration (for example, preventing the provider from running a particular service or preventing further admissions to a service);a new power to issue a fine in lieu of prosecution (penalty notice);a new power to suspend registration for a specific period;prosecution of organisations and/or individuals&mdash;resulting in fines or, in extreme cases, imprisonment; and ultimatelycancellation of registration, which closes the service down.</p>
