This is set out in Section (1) of the appendix to Annex VII. The EU is not seeking guaranteed access to any other NATO assets and capabilities. NATO intends to put in place arrangements to provide for the presumption of availability of other NATO capabilities and common assets. This means NATO will in principle be ready to provide such support, but will decide case-by-case on the release of assets for an EU-led operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.5/1">I understand that, having being refused leave to appeal by the Court of Appeal, Sussex Police Authority sought leave to appeal from the House of Lords. This was refused on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-02">2 November 2000</phrase>. No further appeal in the proceedings is possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/2">As a result of the judgment in this case, it is clear that a police officer's &quot;ordinary duties&quot; under the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 (as amended) should be interpreted to include operational duties. It is likely that this interpretation will result in more officers being certified to be permanently disabled from performing the ordinary duties of a police officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/3">Under the Pensions Regulations it is, however, a matter for the police authority to decide whether or not an officer should be retired on health grounds. If there is, in the view of the police authority, a sufficient range of duties that an officer is capable of undertaking there is no requirement for it to set a date for retirement. The Court of Appeal made this point in its judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/4">It would, however, be more satisfactory if the current regulations were to be amended so that it is clear in future that a police officer is not permanently disabled from police duties if able to perform a sufficient range of the duties expected of his or her rank. We therefore expect to consult the police service about the precise terms of revised regulations later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.3/1">The Ministry of Defence does not hold centrally information on all serving personnel who have been diagnosed with a cancer. To facilitate research into the health of Gulf veterans, the Ministry of Defence arranged for all Gulf veterans' records to be flagged on the Office for National Statistics' NHS Central Register (NHSCR) database, as well as a similar comparison group of personnel who were also in service on <phrase class="date" code="1991-01-01">1 January 1991</phrase>. This should ensure that the Ministry of Defence is notified of cancer registrations and deaths together with the causes of death in England, Wales and Scotland. Similar information on cancer registrations is not available for Northern Ireland for security reasons, nor for serving personnel diagnosed overseas. Although flagging is complete for 98 per cent of all records, NHSCR cancer registration data are currently complete up to 1996. My officials will review the available data and I will write to the noble Countess setting out such information as is available, placing a copy of my letter in the Library of the House, when I am in a position to do so.

The equivalent figure for cancer deaths in the comparison group is 25. The excess in Gulf veterans is not statistically significant.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/1">We place the highest priority on tackling racism within the Armed Forces. It is right that services should reflect more closely the ethnic balance of our society and should set a positive example to others in the promotion of racial equality. The Army's equal opportunities policy sets out to provide equal opportunities for all personnel within an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment and intimidation. The result of the considerable equal opportunities initiatives undertaken by the Army over the last four years has shown an increase in its ethnic minority strength from 1,066 (1.0 per cent of total strength) on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> to 2,057 (1.9 per cent) on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-01">1 February 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/2">The Armed Forces are making a particular effort to recruit men and women from the UK's ethnic minority communities. This significant, long-term investment is bearing fruit. All three services have established ethnic minority recruiting teams located in areas of high ethnic population and all undertake numerous and varied initiatives aimed at encouraging ethnic minority personnel into joining the Armed Forces. This has resulted in a slow but steady year on year increase in both the number and percentage of ethnic minority recruits since 1997-98.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/3">Although progress with recruitment of ethnic minority personnel is slower than we would wish, we remain fully committed to pursuing our 2002 goal of 5 per cent. The figures are moving in the right direction--a tribute to the dedication of the staff involved. The recruiting goals, and indeed their time frame, were and are deliberately aimed at stretching the Armed Forces, so that we could drive hard to reach recruiting levels that match more closely the population which the Armed Forces serve. There is nothing short term about this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/4">As a result of both the equal opportunities initiatives and the recruiting effort, the ethnic minority proportion of the Armed Forces has risen from 1.0 per cent (2,184 personnel) on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> to 1.5 per cent (3,086 personnel) on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-01">1 February 2001</phrase>.</p>

This will include wide circulation of material describing the proposed changes, both in hard copy and on a range of web sites. We will also be going out to interested organisations to explain our proposals, answer any questions and seek views. Because of the complexity of the proposals we have allowed over four months for consultation. After this time we will publish a summary of the responses and consider how to take the package forward in the light of them.</p>

For the UK the number of exchanges where the &quot;incumbent&quot; is offering DSL is given as 54 when the figure for BT should be 619, and the number of &quot;incumbent&quot; DSL lines is given as 15,000 whereas BT had installed 30,000 ADSL lines. At <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-15">15 January</phrase> nearly 700 local exchanges were included in the bow wave process for handling orders for local loop unbundling although loops had been unbundled at only two exchanges. These errors are indicative of the inaccurate basis on which the report draws its conclusions on the progress of local loop unbundling.

	<p pid="a.133.3/1">The proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, adopted by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-12">12 July 2000</phrase>, contains provisions in Article 6 (consultation and transparency mechanism) that would permit the Commission to require a national regulatory authority (e.g. Oftel and, subsequently, Ofcom) to amend or withdraw a draft measure under the new framework if the Commission had serious doubts as to the compatibility of the draft measure with Community law and, in particular, Article 7 (policy objectives and regulatory objectives) of the proposed directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.3/2">The Government do not believe that it would be appropriate for the Commission to assume the role of arbiter of Community law in this area, nor do they believe that the Commission would be better able to judge measures proposed by national regulatory authorities without the local knowledge that those authorities possess. National and European courts would, in any event, be able to consider appeals against measures proposed by national regulatory authorities under Article 4 (right of appeal) of the proposed directive. Infraction proceedings against member states would continue to serve as the primary means for the Commission to address inadequate implementation of the new regulatory framework. The Commission's powers in this regard will be aided substantially by the establishment of clear objectives for national regulatory authorities and increased legal certainty about their tasks.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.3/3">Nevertheless, the Government support the Commission's aim of ensuring that national regulatory authorities act similarly in similar circumstances, in the interests of the single market. The Council is now considering a different requirement in Article 6 for national regulatory authorities to include the Commission among the interested parties whom they consult on proposed measures for which consultation is appropriate. The Commission would be able to delay adoption of measures that it believed incompatible with Community law and to publish critical opinions. The Government believe that this would act as a powerful incentive to national regulatory authorities to act appropriately.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/2">As a result of the e-commerce directive, which must be implemented by member states by <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-16">16 January 2002</phrase>, an EU provider of online services and his services will be subject only to the requirements of the law of the member state in which he is established (subject to certain exceptions including contractual obligations concerning consumer contracts). The application of the rules for the designation of applicable law may be affected by this principle in certain cases, because the directive has the effect of disapplying the legal requirements of another member state if they are less advantageous to the online service provider than those of the member state in which he is established.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.2/1">The Government understand that the European Commission will shortly issue a Communication initiating a debate on the designation of the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (for example product liability, or defamation).</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/2">The choice of applicable law may involve the identification of the country where an act occurs or where its effects are felt. This raises a number of potentially difficult issues in the case of activities involving websites, which may be accessed from any location. The Government believe that it will be important for the Commission's consultation to take account of the implications of the growing use of the Internet in Europe's increasingly knowledge based society and economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/3">The Government are conscious that some users of the Internet, particularly individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, may face cost and other disadvantages as a result of legal uncertainty, and have therefore emphasised in discussions with the Commission and in the Council and in other fora that any legislation at the EU or national level must provide a coherent and positive environment for the confident use of the Internet for e-commerce and other purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.2/1">It is not for the Government to define the proposed equestrian centres of excellence. This is an initiative proposed by the British Equestrian Federation and therefore its reponsibility as the national governing body of the sport. In this regard the British Equestrian Federation has defined the purpose of the centres as regional leadership and co-ordination of competition and training for all members of the federation; setting high standards of competition and training through delivery and example; implementation of the best practices in equine science and sports medicine for riders; development, in conjunction with Riding Clubs and pony clubs, of the BEF regional riding club structure; host venues for the Regional Coaches in Residence, and will set high minimum standards in terms of facilities, particularly all-weather surfaces that are kind to horses.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/2">The BEF has developed a facilities strategy as part of an overall strategic plan for 2001-04, which was recently presented to UK Sport and Sport England, containing proposals for the establishment of equestrian centres of excellence. The facilities strategy proposes to establish 11 centres in England, two in Scotland and two in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/3">Any funds made available to support the centres of excellence will be determined by the appropriate home country sports council and the purpose of the funding would be based upon each indvidual facility application. To date there have been no applications for funding.</p>
