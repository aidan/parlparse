In the current financial climate, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary believes that a 16 per cent cut to the BBC World Service budget is reasonable. It maintains the same proportion of money coming from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) since 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.8/2">Under the broadcasting agreement between the FCO and the BBC World Service, the Foreign Secretary has to give his written authority for the closure of any language services.

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">In England the procedure which a commons registration authority must follow in deciding an application for voluntary registration of land by the owner under Section 15(8) of the Commons Act 2006 differs depending on whether the application relates to one of the seven areas pioneering the implementation of Part 1 of the 2006 Act. In the pioneer areas, notice of an application must be published on the authority's website and sent to certain other persons who may have an interest in the application. Elsewhere, the authority is not required to advertise the application, but must proceed to grant it if satisfied that the application complies with the relevant regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">Where an application is made in the pioneer areas, the commons registration authority need give weight to objections only if it tends to show that the application is not made by the owner of the land, is not compliant with the relevant regulations, or where the necessary consent of any relevant leaseholder, or proprietor of any relevant charge over the land, has not been obtained in accordance with Section 15(9). In our view, an authority may also consider objections which relate to the applicant's description of any locality or the neighbourhood within a locality of which the inhabitants are to have the right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes on the land.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-14">14 January 2011</phrase>, the Director of Public Prosecutions agreed that the Crown Prosecution Service will conduct a comprehensive assessment of all the material in the possession of the Metropolitan Police Service relating to unlawful interception of mobile telephones, following developments in the civil courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.8/2">The exercise will involve an examination of all the material considered as part of the original investigation into Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire and any material that has subsequently come to light. The assessment will be carried out by the Principal Legal Advisor, Alison Levitt QC. The purpose of this assessment is to ascertain whether there is any material that could now form evidence in any future criminal prosecution relating to phone hacking.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.8/3">The Metropolitan Police Service recently announced a new investigation into alleged mobile phone interception. Ms Levitt will evaluate any evidence gathered as a result of that investigation and will advise as to the progress of the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.8/4">While both the investigation and assessment are ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.5/1">The upgrade project is currently in progress so forecast rather than actual costs are provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/2">The capital cost of new equipment (personal computers and laptops) is forecast to be &#163;288,000 (including VAT). Where equipment can be upgraded it will be at a forecast cost of &#163;25,000 (including VAT). The revenue cost of rolling out the new and upgraded equipment is forecast to be approximately &#163;80,000 (including VAT).</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/3">The new and upgraded equipment will move Members from software and hardware that is no longer supported or will be unsupported in the near future. Many of the services are obsolete and need to be replaced-for example, the current dial-up and virtual private network (VPN) remote access services. The new software offers greater reliability and also additional features such as Office Communicator Suite (OCS). The upgrade will mean that Members in both Houses will be using the same software and range of hardware and this will allow improved support to be offered through the greater focus and depth of expertise that will be possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/4">The Windows 7 solution was developed in January 2010. It was checked and tested during the spring and early summer. The complete package, Windows 7, Office 2007 and related software, has been deployed in the second half of 2010 to more than 3,000 devices.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.2/1">The PICT Service Desk has received a small number of calls relating to the upgrade. It is still early in the migration and as a result it is difficult to assess efficiencies experienced by PICT. These should become clearer once the migration is complete and services are decommissioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/2">PICT staff have been working with Windows 7 and Office 2007 since early in 2010. The engineers, Service Desk personnel and other support staff are experienced in the use of the system. PICT's experience with other groups in Parliament is that the Windows 7 and Office 2007 solutions are more stable and have fewer problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/3">PICT's approach to training has been to work directly with Members during the upgrade. This has included the option of one-to-one coaching and specifically written training material available as a booklet and online.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.5/1">Section 11.4 of <I>Operational Guidance to Local Authorities-Parking Policy and Enforcement</I> (March 2008) advises that a local authority has a discretionary power to cancel a penalty charge notice at any point throughout the civil parking enforcement process. It can do this even when an undoubted contravention has occurred if the authority deems it to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Under general principles of public law, authorities have a duty to act fairly and proportionately and are encouraged to exercise their discretion sensibly and reasonably and with due regard to the public interest.</p>
