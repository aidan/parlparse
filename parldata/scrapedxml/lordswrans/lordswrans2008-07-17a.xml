	<p pid="a.179.1/2" qnum="HL4744">What proportion of the stalks, leaves and roots of food crops grown commercially in the United Kingdom are recycled for (a) composting; (b) biogas; (c) biomass; and (d) use in coal-fired power stations; and where the remainder goes.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.2/1">A small amount of cereal straw is composted for use by the mushroom industry, but very little other agricultural plant material is composted. Most of the biogas plants in the UK are fuelled by animal manures and waste from the food processing chain, rather than crop residues.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">Around 9 per cent of the sugar beet crop (around 650,000 tonnes a year) is used in the production of transport biofuels. Around 2 per cent of cereal straw (around 200,000 tonnes) is used to generate electricity in dedicated biomass power stations. Around 200,000 tonnes of agricultural residues (including cereal straw), wastes and energy crops, are used to generate heat. Around 2.3 million tonnes of a wide range of woody biomass and biomass wastes (including forestry residues, paper industry waste and imported plant wastes), are co-fired with coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/3">The vast majority of the remaining residues from crop and horticultural production are either returned to the soil to help build soil organic matter content and provide nutrients for following crops, or are used as animal feed or bedding, which is then recycled to land.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.3/1">During the period January to June 2008, 191 dispensations were granted. 177 related to delays, 7 were VIP flights and 7 were emergency related.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.3/2">There have been restrictions on night flights at Heathrow since 1962. The underlying principle of these restrictions is to preserve the balance between the need to protect local communities from excessive aircraft noise at night and the operation of services where they provide economic benefits. These restrictions are reviewed periodically.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.3/3">The current regime which applies from October 2006 until October 2012 comprises restrictions on the types of aircraft which may be operated throughout the &quot;night period&quot; (11 pm to 7 am).</p>
	<p pid="a.180.3/4">In addition, further restrictions apply between 11.30 pm and 6 am (the night quota period). In the latter period, first, the noisiest types of aircraft cannot be scheduled to operate. Secondly, the Department for Transport sets two limits&mdash;on the number of aircraft movements and on the amount of quota points that may be used. Neither limit may be exceeded. The quota points system allocates a quota count (QC) number to each different type of aircraft for landing and taking-off according to the amount of noise generated. Every time the aircraft operates in the night quota period its number of QC points is deducted from the total for the season. There are two seasons&mdash;summer and Winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.3/5">The regime provides for a stepped reduction in noise quota over the life of the current regime (ie until 2012), encouraging operators to use the quietest aircraft available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.3/6">There is provision for certain flights to be disregarded from the requirement to be counted against the movements and quota limits in exceptional circumstances. These include cases where there are:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.3/7">delays to aircraft which are likely to lead to serious congestion at the airport or serious hardship or suffering to passengers,delays to aircraft resulting from widespread and prolonged disruption of air traffic;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.3/8">Normal operational delays do not fall under these rules and provision has to be made for these to be covered within the allocated movement and quota limits.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.5/1">The European Commission has provided no such confirmation, but none has been sought. It is unlikely that infraction proceedings against the UK would be considered on these grounds and no such proceedings are anticipated.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.5/2">There is no specific legislation giving the European Commission power to start infraction proceedings against the United Kingdom for not culling badgers in bovine tuberculosis-affected areas. There are of course general obligations under European law to control the spread of TB and infraction proceedings can arise whenever the Commission considers there has been a failure correctly to implement EU law. The decision to set a policy of not issuing licences to farmers to cull badgers to prevent bovine TB has not resulted in any such failure.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/1">The role of maize in the spread of <I>M. bovis</I> has not been specifically investigated by any Defra-funded research projects. However case-control studies carried out as part of the randomised badger culling trial (RBCT) did investigate associations between a number of feed types and risk of a herd TB breakdown. Studies TB99 and CCS2005 found an association between feeding silage and the use of grass feeding types for grazing/forage and an increase in risk of TB breakdown, respectively. The findings of these studies are in the final report of the Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB. In addition, TB99 also identified not using feeding supplements as a risk factor for confirmed cases of TB.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.0/1">The Agriculture and Fisheries Council reached political agreement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-23">23 June</phrase> on a compromise text of the Slovenian presidency for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products (essentially agricultural pesticides) on the market. The Government expect the text to be adopted as the common position of the Council and communicated to the European Parliament for its second reading in the autumn, in accordance with the codecision procedure laid down in Article 251 of the treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/2">The regulation will extend to all uses of plant protection products within the scope defined in the text, including those authorised for amateur use and for use in public gardens. It will not, however, extend to uses of household products for treatments such as flea, mite and tick infestations within the scope of Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/3">The eventual effects of the regulation cannot be predicted with certainty at this stage. The Pesticides Safety Directorate has published an assessment of the potential impact of proposals for approval criteria based on hazard and for comparative assessment and substitution of substances approved as candidates for substitution. A copy of the report, which considers 286 active substances, including glyphosate and pyrethroids, has been put in the Library of the House. It will not be possible to confirm which substances are likely to be caught by the regulation, and which are likely to remain available for continued use to control pests and weeds, until the negotiations are concluded and its provisions have been finalised.</p>
