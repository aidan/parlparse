	<p pid="a.193.5/1">The United Kingdom's largest contribution to education in 2009-10 will be made by the Department for International Development (DfID) to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF).

The FSA will be issuing a response statement shortly and aims to have the code in place for firms' 2009 remuneration review processes. The Chancellor has also asked the FSA to provide an annual report on remuneration practices, including compliance by firms with the new code. This report will assess whether remuneration practices are likely to lead to a build up of systemic risk, and make recommendations for action if this is thought to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/3">In parallel, the Walker review is looking, among other things, at strengthening remuneration practices as part of improvements to corporate governance. Sir David will be publishing his consultation paper on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-16">16 July 2009</phrase>. Neither the FSA's work nor the Walker review are intended to dictate the quantum of remuneration, either for individuals or at the level of groups or institutions. This remains a matter for those institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.8/1">The Government have carried out analysis on generation costs in some detail in recent years to inform policy decisions.

More recently the Committee on Climate Change have published estimated levelised costs (&pound;/MWh, in 2008 prices) associated with 1 MWh of electricity generated, for their December 2008 report (<a href="http://www.theccc.org.uk/pdf/TSO-ClimateChange.pdf">http://www.theccc.org.uk/pdf/TSO-ClimateChange.pdf</a>), as set out in table 1 below and include construction, operation and maintenance costs and where applicable the cost of carbon allowances (EU ETS). Moreover, for nuclear, they also include the costs of decommissioning and waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.8/2">It should be noted that the estimates of levelised costs<sup>1</sup> for different types of electricity generation are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for capital costs, fuel and EU ETS allowance prices, operating costs, load factor, and other drivers. In reality, there are large uncertainties and ranges around these figures.</p>

This improvement is largely due to good rains and tools, seeds and fertiliser provided by the international community ahead of the growing season. Much work remains to be done to improve food security, increase production, ensure the availability of grain and generally stabilise the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.9/2">Our support will continue to be based on information provided by a range of food and nutritional assessments, principally by the UN. We will also look to the inclusive government to drive progress in the agricultural sector as it has begun to do in its short term emergency recovery programme (STERP). A land reform commission is also planned which will start its work by conducting a land audit expected to deliver results later in the year.</p>
