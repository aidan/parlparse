	<p pid="a.118.8/1">The Government are firmly committed to maintaining effective immigration controls while at the same time ensuring that genuine passengers are able to pass through our ports with the least possible inconvenience.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.8/2">The number of Algerian nationals arriving at UK airports who are found to be inadmissible is unacceptably high. Although Algerian nationals must obtain a visa to enter the UK they may, in common with other nationalities, transit this country for up to 24 hours without a visa. However, this is a concession open to abuse by those who are intent on circumventing our immigration controls. A significant number of Algerian nationals who do not qualify for leave to enter or remain in the UK go on to make unfounded asylum claims, some 1,060 in 2002. Therefore from 00.01 hours on <phrase class="date" code="">Friday, 2 May</phrase> all Algerian nationals wishing to transit the UK will require a direct airside transit visa to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.8/3">To avoid undue hardship for those who had already made their travel plans, we have agreed to operate a grace period. Until 23.59 hours on <phrase class="date" code="">6 May</phrase> any transit passenger who bought their ticket on or before <phrase class="date" code="">1 May</phrase> will not be refused transit solely on the basis of not holding a valid transit visa. Also, any person on the return leg of a journey they commenced before <phrase class="date" code="">1 May</phrase> and who passed through the UK on the outward leg of their journey will be allowed to transit the UK without a visa.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/1">It is our view, subject to the results of ongoing work, that there are a number of factors which have contributed to the increase in the recorded figures for passports lost, stolen or unavailable since 1998. Key among these are likely to be an increase in identity fraud and an increase in the number of reports being made to and recorded by the United Kingdom Passport Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/2">As recognised by the Cabinet Office Identity Fraud: A study published in July 2002, identity fraud is a serious and growing problem for the UK and it is possible that this has contributed to the increase in passports being reported as lost and stolen. However, there is no evidence currently available which could establish the degree to which the increase in identity fraud has resulted in the increase in reports of lost and stolen passports.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/3">Both the United Kingdom Passport Service and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have undertaken campaigns in recent years to encourage members of the public to report the loss or theft of passports. These campaigns will also have contributed to increased reporting and will be reflected in the figures we have given.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/4">Furthermore, the current passport issuing system, which was installed in UK passport offices between October 1998 and November 2001, provides for a more consistent and structured way of recording reports of losses than was available on the previous system. This provides figures which more accurately reflect the true extent of reported losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/5">The UK Passport Service is far from complacent about the large number of passports, which become separated from their rightful bearer. Instances of forgery and manipulation of the UK passport are kept under constant review as are the security features in the passport book itself. The current digital passport has a number of very advanced security features which makes it extremely difficult to alter or replace the genuine details.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/6">The number of passports reported stolen, lost or unavailable in the first quarter of 2003 was 46,273.</p>

The regulations provide that people discharged from the Armed Forces may in future count days of absence from duty on health grounds while in service towards the higher rates of incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/2">For many years there have been special pay arrangements in place for members of the Armed Forces which recognise their unique position. Veterans with continuing health problems are able to make a claim for incapacity benefit immediately on discharge. However, until now, they were required to be in receipt of incapacity benefit for 28 weeks before qualifying for the higher rates. The new regulations, which take effect from <phrase class="date" code="">5 May</phrase>, bring ex-members of the forces into line with civilian claimants who have been in receipt of statutory sick pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/3">We are grateful to DWP Ministers for making this change, which serves as an illustration of the power of the Veterans Initiative launched by the Prime Minister with the aim of joining up the Government's response to veterans' concerns. We would also like to pay tribute to ex-service organisations such as South Atlantic Medal Association (82), who first brought this matter to my attention, for the valuable work they do in the interests of ex-servicemen and women and their dependants.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.8/1">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is being set up to deal with the civil nuclear liabilities that relate to the public sector&mdash;specifically in relation to UKAEA, BNFL and Magnox sites. As explained in the White Paper, Managing the Nuclear Legacy, published in July 2002, the NDA (formerly referred to as the Liabilities Management Authority (LMA)) will be responsible for ensuring that these &quot;legacy&quot; sites are cleaned up safely, securely, cost effectively and in ways which protect the environment. Its role will be to develop an overall strategy for clean up of the sites for which it is responsible and to drive work forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.8/2">The NDA will be funded directly by government through a statutory segregated account. The energy Minister announced on <phrase class="date" code="">3 April</phrase> that, following consideration of responses to the White Paper, the Government had concluded that this represented the best way of satisfying its funding objectives, which had received almost universal support. In particular, the Government are determined to establish funding arrangements that, subject to appropriate budgetary and public expenditure controls: underline the Government's commitment to clean up and help to build public confidence in the NDA; give the NDA the flexibility required to drive forward the clean-up process effectively; and encourage competition for clean-up contracts by giving the market confidence that funding will be available to support substantial work programmes over the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.8/3">Legislation to set up the new authority will be brought forward at the earliest opportunity. As announced in the Queen's Speech last November, the draft Bill will be published in the course of the current Session.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.8/4">The term &quot;Nuclear Liabilities Fund&quot; (NLF) refers to a proposed new funding mechanism for the nuclear liabilities belonging to the private sector company, British Energy. This fund would be set up as part of the company's restructuring. The proposal to set up the NLF was first announced in BE's detailed statement on restructuring on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November 2002</phrase>. The NLF and the statutory segregated account to be set up for the NDA will be quite separate&mdash;the former deals with BE's liabilities, and is paid into by the company; the latter is for public sector nuclear liabilities and will be funded by government.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.8/5">British Energy (BE) already pass into a ring-fenced fund, the &quot;Nuclear Decommissioning Fund&quot; (NDF), which was set up specifically as a means of funding the decommissioning of BE's nuclear stations once they have ceased generating electricity. The idea behind the NLF is to take the ring-fenced fund approach a step further to cover more of BE's nuclear liabilities, including their uncontracted nuclear fuel liabilities (such as dealing with spent PWR fuel at Sizewell B). The full details of how the NLF will work are still being drawn up, and it has not yet been decided whether the NLF will, in effect, be an extended and enlarged version of the NDF, or whether there will be a separate NLF running alongside the NDF. Either way, BE will make financial contributions towards meeting the cost of its own nuclear liabilities. The arrangements for these financial contributions are set out in the <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> statement and are summarised in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.122.8/8"> <td colspan="2">Financial Contributions</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.122.8/9"> <td>NDF value</td> <td>The existing value of the NDF(valued at &pound;332 million in BE's September interim accounts) will remain available to the NDF or new merged NDF/ NLF.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.122.8/10"> <td>New Bonds</td> <td>At the point of restructuring,BE will issue &pound;275 million of bonds to the NDF/NLF.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.122.8/11"> <td>Decommissioning Payments</td> <td>Each year BE will make apayment of &pound;20 million towards decommissioning costs (but this payment will taper off as stations close).</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.122.8/12"> <td>PWR Fuel</td> <td>BE will contribute &pound;150,000 to the funds for every tonne of Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) fuel loaded into Sizewell B. This is in line with the principle that BE should pay its own way going forwards.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.122.8/13"> <td>Cash Sweep</td> <td>BE will have to pay 65 per centof available cash into the fund, subject to conditions.</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.122.8/16">In return, government will agree to underwrite the cost of BE's nuclear liabilities, to the extent that the funding of the NLF/NDF is not sufficient to cover these. The Government have already made clear that they wish to protect taxpayers' interests and avoid handing BE a &quot;blank cheque&quot;. As part of this, the Government propose to put in place a series of controls and incentives to ensure that British Energy runs its nuclear power stations as though it were exclusively responsible for the discharge of its nuclear liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.8/17">As the centre of public sector expertise on nuclear decommissioning, we would expect the Government to seek the NDA's advice on issues relating to BE's nuclear liabilities&mdash;particularly in the context of the controls on BE mentioned above.</p>

The circular asks all National Health Service trusts to ensure participation in the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) scheme by December 2002. We will be carrying out an audit to review the implementation of this guidance later this year. From the start of the current reporting year, participation in the SHOT scheme by NHS Trusts will be verified by means of a confidential personal identification number. SHOT also encourages awareness of reporting all adverse events, including transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), by holding an annual educational symposium.

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">To date there is no evidence worldwide that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has ever been transmitted through blood. As a precautionary measure all fresh frozen plasma (FFP) produced by the United Kingdom blood services uses single unit plasma from UK blood donors which has been leucodepleted to remove the white cells which evidence suggests may carry the greatest risk of transmitting variant CJD. Although most UK FFP is not virally inactivated, high levels of safety are achieved by using single unit, as opposed to pooled plasma, by screening out potential high risk donors and by testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C before it is released to hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.2/1">As the Government made clear on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase>, we are taking into account wider policy objectives in responding to the OFT report.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/2">The OFT report argues for abolition of entry controls on the grounds that there would be consequent benefits for consumers in terms of reduced prices, improved quality of services and better access. The Government strongly support these objectives. We want to improve access and choice (including improving out-of-hours access for NHS patients) so that more NHS patients can use the skills of community pharmacists, who are trained clinicians, for advice, information and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/3">The OFT report also noted that in a more competitive environment problems could arise through the possible effect of deregulation on the ability of patients in some areas to access high quality pharmacy services, and that these problems could be addressed through targeted measures. It was not in the OFT's remit to examine how mechanisms such as the Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme could be developed to address a more competitive environment, and we therefore propose to examine these issues further before reaching a final decision on a balanced package which most effectively promotes competition, new entry and increased choice alongside our wider social and health objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/4">We therefore favour change to open up the market and improve quality and access without diminishing the crucial role that pharmacies play, especially in poorer and rural areas. The Government intend to come forward with proposals before the Summer Recess and will publish a progress report at the end of June. All changes will then be the subject of a full consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.3/1">Council Directive 90/667/EEC (the Animal Waste Directive) already classifies shellfish and fish waste as an animal by-product and applies to all member states. The directive will be replaced by Regulation 1774/2002 (the Animal By-Products Regulation) which maintains the same principle. The regulation will be applying to all shellfish products which are not intended for human consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/2">The Sea Fish Industry Authority was consulted during negotiations on the regulation and a number of other fish and shellfish industries were sent the consultation document of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January 2003</phrase> on enforcing the regulation. As landfill is not currently a permitted disposal route for most shellfish waste, we have not asked the Commission for a transition period to allow that practice to continue.</p>

It should be noted that a number of CITES species are traded quite legitimately for human consumption and it is the responsibility of the host's officials to ensure that such products are legally obtained from a sustainable source.</p>
