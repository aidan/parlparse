	<p pid="b.119.1/2" qnum="HL855">What money United Kingdom farmers will receive under the rural development schemes in 2006, compared with the England rural development programme.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-07-11b.119.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="119"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050711/text/50711w01.htm#50711w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.119.2/1">The planned expenditure available to farmers and other beneficiaries under EU co-financed rural development schemes in 2006 is set out in the England Rural Development Programme for 2000&ndash;06, as amended following the introduction of environmental stewardship. Full programme documentation, including expenditure tables, is available from the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/2">If the noble Baroness would like information on expenditure under the rural development programmes for 2007&ndash;13, that will depend on decisions yet to be taken on:</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/3" class="indent">funds allocated to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development under the negotiations on the future financing of the EU;</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/4" class="indent">the share of that funding allocated to the United Kingdom and, within the UK total, to England;</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/5" class="indent">the extent to which the UK is permitted to make transfers from subsidy payments to rural development schemes (&quot;modulation&quot;); and</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/6" class="indent">national co-financing of the EU expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/7">The share of rural development support allocated to individual measures under the Rural Development Regulation will depend in part on the overall total of expenditure available, and in part on ministerial decisions following a consultation later this year on how the rural development regulation is to be implemented in England. Some parameters have, however, already been set: the draft Rural Development Regulation on which political agreement was reached at the Agriculture Council meeting on 20 and <phrase class="date" code="">21 June</phrase> establishes minimum percentages for the contribution from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to each of three priority areas: improving competitiveness of farming and forestry (10 per cent), environment and land management (25 per cent), diversification and broader rural development (10 per cent) and leader (5 per cent).</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/8">It is likely that the great majority of funding in England will be allocated to agri-environment schemes and to other measures covered by the environment and land management axis (which includes the measures listed at points (a) to (b), by the noble Baroness).</p>

The professional performance of our armoured fighting vehicle crews in Iraq demonstrates that we already have an effective training system. However, we are always seeking ways to improve that experience at better value for money. AVTS was one option we pursued. We intend to ensure that any other procurement strategies provide value for money and maintain the effectiveness of training for our Armed Forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.128.0/1">The partners involved in the development of the national school sport competition framework are: the Department for Education and Skills; the Department for Culture, Media and Sport; the Youth Sport Trust; the National Council for School Sport; Sport England; county sport partnerships; national governing bodies of sport; national school sports associations; and school sport partnerships and their schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/2">The national governing bodies for the following sports were consulted in connection with the national school sport competition framework: angling; archery; athletics; badminton; basketball; bowls; canoeing; cricket; cycling; equestrian; football; golf; gymnastics; hockey; judo; karate; mountaineering; netball; orienteering; rounders; rowing; rugby league; rugby union; sailing; squash; swimming; table tennis; tennis; triathlon; and volleyball.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/3">School sport competition development bulletins provide regular updates of latest developments concerning about the national school sport competition framework. These can be found at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/pe">www.teachernet.gov.uk/pe</a>. A copy of the latest bulletin will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/4">The following school sport partnerships have been sent grant letters authorising them to put in hand arrangements for appointing competition managers: (Cornwall) Callington; Mounts Bay; Penryn; Poltair; (Greater Manchester) Brookway; Our Lady's; Tameside; Wright Robinson; (Hampshire) Bridgemary; Hamble; Henry Cort; Toynbee; (East Sussex) Beacon; Dorothy Stringer; Hailsham; William Parker; (West Yorkshire); Oakbank; Priesthorpe; St Mary's; and Thornton. All of these partnerships are in the process of appointing competition managers which will be in place by September 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/5">It is for individual School Sport Partnerships to decide precisely how they deploy the &pound;37,500 grant for managers. In doing so, they will take into account local needs and circumstances. However, as a rough guide, my department has suggested that a salary range of between &pound;25,000 and &pound;28,000 would be appropriate. The remainder of the grant will then make up a modest budget which the competition managers will use to help them plan, manage and implement a programme of inter-school competition within their School Sport Partnership and to reach out into national governing body school sport competitions.</p>

In addition to these implemented safeguards, the NHS maintains an effective liaison with the United Kingdom's information security authorities and others for the sharing of relevant advice and guidance on known information security threats and vulnerabilities.

	<p pid="b.132.8/1">The Prison Service's training and development group (TDG) has a current year budget of &pound;17,482,000 for staff training. In addition to direct spend on training, this figure is inclusive of running costs for the training estate, salaries of TDG staff and other non-training expenses. In addition to this central training budget, other Prison Service headquarters groups provide training (for example, finance and health and safety) and a significant amount of local training is carried out at individual prison establishments, which carry a separate budget. A breakdown of these budgets for the current year indicates an additional budget of more than &pound;5 million for staff training.</p>

Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allows police to direct rave goers to leave an event. If they refuse, police are provided with a power of arrest. They also have powers to seize sound equipment in certain circumstances. The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 extended these powers so that they apply to trespassory indoor raves and raves of 20 or more people. It is also an offence for a person given a direction under Section 63 to attend any other trespassory rave within 24 hours.</p>

These do not permit additional days (above the basic monthly allocation) to be granted to vessels subject to the sole recovery arrangements in the western English Channel. They do, however, provide slightly more flexible controls for sole (for example with regard to storage) which is considered to be a less vulnerable stock than cod.</p>
