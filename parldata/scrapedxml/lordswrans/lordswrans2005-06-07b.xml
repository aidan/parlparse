	<p pid="b.49.2/1">We have repeatedly made clear to the government of Sudan that all returns and relocations of internally displaced persons (IDPs) must be entirely voluntary and take place in full consultation with the established international monitoring mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/2">This need was highlighted when violence erupted during an attempt to move IDPs from the Soba Aradi camp near Khartoum on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-18">18 May</phrase>, causing the deaths of three civilians and 14 police officers. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-19">19 May</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development issued a statement expressing the UK's grave concern. He called on all sides to prevent any further loss of life and urged the government of Sudan to respect the human rights of the IDPs, protect its citizens and bring those responsible to justice. Our Ambassador in Khartoum has also raised the incident with the government of Sudan and pressed them to investigate the incident in consultation with the Joint National Transition Team under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and to take the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence in the future.</p>

The review will be undertaken later this year in consultation with key stakeholders in the agricultural sector and will aim to establish whether there is an on-going need for SAWS in light of the use of alternative sources of labour, such as nationals of the new EU accession states. The review will ensure that any approach adopted is consistent with policies on reducing illegal working and on the employment of asylum seekers.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.2/1">Carers and severely disabled adults have access to the full range of social security benefits: carer's allowance, incapacity benefit, jobseeker's allowance, income support, disability living allowance, attendance allowance, industrial injuries benefits, bereavement and widow's benefits, maternity allowance, state pension and state second pension, pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit, which are dependent upon their individual circumstances. They may also have access to payments under the tax credits and war pensions schemes, and to statutory sick pay, statutory maternity pay or statutory paternity pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.2/2">A carer's allowance, currently &pound;45.70 per week, can be paid to a carer whose weekly earnings, net of allowable expenses, are &pound;82 or less and who regularly provides care for at least 35 hours a week to a severely disabled person in receipt of attendance allowance or the middle or highest rate of the disability living allowance care component. Extra money can be paid with carer's allowance for a partner whose net earnings are no more than &pound;27.30 per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.2/3">Carers and the disabled people they care for may also be entitled to income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance or pension credit. These entitlements are assessed separately unless they are partners living in the same household, in which case they are subject to a joint assessment. In either circumstance, the assessment can include a carer premium (carer's additional amount in the case of pension credit) on account of the carer's entitlement to carer's allowance, and one or more disability premia (disability additional amount in the case of pension credit) on account of the disabled person's eligibility for attendance allowance or disability living allowance. Receipt of attendance allowance or disability living allowance is ignored in the assessment of entitlement to income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance or pension credit. The maximum levels of housing benefit and council tax benefit are available to recipients of income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance or pension credit who are liable to pay rent or council tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.2/4">Overall, households which include a carer and/or a severely disabled person can receive significantly more benefit than other households receiving income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance or pension credit. These benefits are set at levels which ensure that recipients should be able to meet their normal daily living needs. To protect their purchasing power, they are increased each year in line with the movement in the general level of prices or, in the case of the pension credit guarantee credit, in line with earnings up to and including 2007&ndash;08. The higher levels at which the benefits may be paid to carers, and to those for whom they provide care, are part of the package of support available to severely disabled people and their carers. Further help, including means-tested domiciliary services or direct payments in lieu of such services, may be available from local authority social services departments.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.2/1">The board of the Pension Protection Fund may invest for the purposes of the prudent management of its financial affairs, as provided by Section 113 of the Pensions Act 2004. While the Board is obliged by Section 114 of the Act to produce a statement of principles governing determinations about investments made by or on behalf of the board, it is for the board to determine what those governing principles should be. There are no statutory limits or restrictions on the board's power to determine its own investment policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.2/2">When the board of the Pension Protection Fund assumes responsibility for a pension scheme the property, rights and liabilities of the scheme are transferred to the Board. This is made clear in Section 161 and Schedule 6 to the Pensions Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.2/3">If the board assumes responsibility for a pension scheme the assets of which include an equity stake in the company which used to be its sponsoring employer, then this equity stake would transfer to the board of the Pension Protection Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.2/4">During a PPF assessment period, while the PPF is assessing whether it must assume responsibility for a scheme, the board of the Pension Protection Fund takes over the role of creditor of the employer on behalf of the trustees of the scheme. This is a power the board has under Section 137 of the Pensions Act 2004. During this time the board may be involved in negotiations with the employer in respect of the debt owed to the scheme. As part of these negotiations the board may agree that the scheme make take an equity stake in the employer's business.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.5/1">The Government are committed to promoting equality of opportunity in sport for men and women and are implementing a range of measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.5/2">In schools, the National Strategy for PE and School Sport is reaching out to all pupils and the target is to ensure that 85 per cent of five to 16 year-olds doing at least two hours' high-quality PE and school sport each week by 2008. At local level, we expect school sport partnerships to make provision for targeting girls, where that is necessary, by broadening opportunities and tailoring delivery to girls' needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.5/3">To date, more than 1,200 secondary schools have benefited from the Youth Sport Trust/Nike Girls in Sport initiative. This seeks to encourage greater participation by girls through changing or relaxing kit specifications, extending the range of activities and improving showers and changing rooms. All schools in school sport partnerships are encouraged to adopt these principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.5/4">For community sport, we know that participation in sport and physical activity by women is lower than for the population as a whole. For example, the General Household Survey 2004 reported that during 2002 36 per cent of women had taken part in at least one activity other than walking, four weeks prior to being interviewed. This compared with 51 per cent of men.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.5/5">We have a specific PSA target to increase participation within priority groups, including women, by 3 per cent by 2008. We are tackling access issues for women through various initiatives. An example is the Horton Grange project in Bradford (supported by the Sport Action Zone). This is aimed at increasing opportunities for Asian women with health and weight problems to participate in sport and physical activity and get advice on healthy lifestyle choices.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.5/6">The Equality Standard for Sport, launched last year, is a framework to guide sports and community organisations towards achieving equality. Its aim is to widen access and increase the participation and involvement in sport and physical activity from under-represented individuals, groups and communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.5/7">With regard to elite sport, UK Sport has co-ordinated the development of the UK Strategy Framework for Women and Sport, its main principle being to &quot;change sporting culture in the UK to one that values the diversity of women and enables their full involvement in every aspect of sport&quot;. The framework will cover participation, performance and excellence, as well as leadership issues for women within sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.5/8">In terms of athlete numbers, the latest figures show that (as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-24">24 May 2005</phrase>) 40 per cent of athletes on the UK World Class Performance Programme (WCPP) are women. However, it is important to acknowledge that athletes are selected for inclusion on the WCPP on performance grounds alone, with the same standards applying to male and female athletes.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.6/1" class="italic">Framework for the Future, the first ever national public libraries strategy document, published in 2003, called for library services to be offered in premises fit for purpose and there have been many fine examples of new or refurbished library buildings in recent years. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), one of DCMS's non-departmental public bodies, has also highlighted the benefits of good library design through two excellent reports, <i>Better Public Libraries </i>and 21st Century Libraries: Changing Forms, Changing Futures.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.6/2">These reports show that high quality building design can help libraries meet the challenge of providing services to 21st century citizens and communities. Peckham Library, the Idea Store in Bow, and Bournemouth library (winner of the 2003 Prime Minister's Better Public Building Award) are all examples of how modern libraries are changing, reinventing themselves to become beacons for civic pride, as well as social and economic regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.6/3">DCMS has allocated &pound;90 million of PFI credits to library projects to date; and bids are currently being considered for a share of the &pound;130 million in credits that we are making available over the next two years. Public libraries are one of the priority areas for these bids.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.6/4">Nevertheless, ultimately, the replacement and refurbishment of public library buildings is a matter for library authorities.</p>
