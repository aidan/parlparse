	<p pid="a.3.2/1">The White Paper has been published today. It is entitled Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation work for the Poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">This White Paper stands alongside our first White Paper published in 1997. It reaffirms our commitment to the elimination of poverty and the achievement of the International Development Targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/3">We are living at a time of profound historical change. One in five of the world's population--two-thirds of them women--live in abject poverty, at a time of growing material plenty. If the poorest countries can be drawn into the global economy, and get increasing access to modern knowledge and technology, we could move forward to a period of massive progress and the removal of abject poverty from the human condition. But, if this is not done, we shall see growing poverty, marginalisation, conflict and environmental degradation.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/4">We need to work collectively to tackle the problems of conflict and corruption, boost investment in education and health, spread the benefits of technology and research, strengthen the international financial system, reduce barriers to trade, tackle environmental problems and make development assistance more effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/5">This White Paper sets out the Government's policies in these areas. It reflects our commitment to work across all parts of government in order to work with other governments and international institutions significantly to reduce poverty. It provides an agenda for managing globalisation in a way that will help to ensure that the new wealth, technology and knowledge being generated brings benefits to the world's poor.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/3">The council contracted out its benefit administration and customer service activity to an external supplier but retained counter-fraud work in house.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/4">The BFI reports that at the time of its on-site visit there were backlogs of work in many areas and there had been a consequent deterioration in customer service and processing new claims. The council and the contractor were working together to resolve problems in service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/5">The council's verification of evidence for new claims was found to be fairly robust but renewal claims verification was much weaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/6">Inspectors report the council has an effective checking regime that provides a high level of assurance that benefit determinations are correct but there was no formal risk analysis to identify high risk claims.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.2/3">Inspectors found Lewisham provides a high quality customer service. In particular the council's public enquiry service is the best the BFI has so far seen. It includes a video conferencing system that allows members of the public to see and talk to council officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/4">The report notes that the council has introduced all recent government initiatives designed to secure benefits administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/5">The council introduced the verification framework in October 1998 and the report notes this was achieved without the backlogs and frustrations reported by other London boroughs. Inspectors found verification work to be very thorough.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.2/3">The BFI reports that the council is one of the best performing authorities that have been inspected so far. Inspectors commended the high standard of verification of claims, in particular for effectively applying the verification framework. It rigorously applies statutory checks on National Insurance numbers and regularly completes management checks on determinations.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/4">The report notes the council's effective monitoring mechanisms such as developing performance indicators and assessing error rates in benefits administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/5">BFI found that officials and elected members are committed to countering fraud and had fostered a counter-fraud culture within the council. Inspectors considered that the council could build on this by setting a clear target for reducing fraud and error, and increasing the use of counter-fraud sanctions. In addition counter-fraud activity could be better co-ordinated.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.5/2">The report records BFI's findings and includes recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter-fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/3">The council contracted out its benefit service in October 1998. The report's main conclusion is that, partly due to the failings in the contract but mainly due to the council's inability to manage and enforce it, claimants in Islington are receiving an extremely poor benefit service.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/4">Inspectors found long delays in claims being processed and report there would be considerable difficulties for anyone wanting to make an enquiry on the progress of his or her claim. The report also notes the high number of complaints to the council and the local government ombudsman which had been sustained over a period of two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/5">The BFI found counter-fraud work had been in decline due to under-resourcing and the lack of managerial control, and offered minimal deterrence to fraudsters.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/6">The report contains a number of fundamental recommendations for the council reflecting the gap between the poor quality service provided and that which claimants can reasonably expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/7">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/2">The Government are committed to improving standards of care and treatment for prisoners with mental health problems. All prisons and the local health authorities in which they are situated have been asked, in line with the programme of reform set out in The Future Organisation of Prison Healthcare (March 1999), by March 2001 at the latest, to assess jointly prisoners' health needs and identify appropriate services to meet them and effective means of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/3">These should include in-reach into prisons from community health teams as part of the broader development of mental health services as set out in the National Service Framework for Mental Health. Implementation of improvements through individual prison health plans is scheduled to begin from April 2001, although reforms are well under way in a number of prisons already.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/4">The NHS Plan includes commitments that, by 2004, the 5,000 prisoners with a serious mental illness who are at any one time in prison should be receiving more comprehensive mental health services; all prisoners with severe mental illness will be in receipt of treatment; no prisoner with serious mental illness will leave prison without a care plan and a care co-ordinator; and within the new NHS/Prison Service partnership some 300 additional staff will be employed.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.5/1">Prison Service establishments were instructed in November 1999 that only a limited range of alternative or complementary therapies (acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractic, yoga and meditation) may be made available to individual prisoners, on the recommendation of the prison doctor. Other such therapies may be made available only in circumstances where a good case can be shown and with the prior approval of the joint Prison Health Policy Unit. Information is not routinely collected centrally about the provision of alternative or complementary therapies at individual establishments under these arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.8/1">The Children (Leaving Care) Act received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-30">30 November</phrase>. Local authorities will need sufficient time to prepare thoroughly for implementation once the regulations and guidance are published. Following representations from local government, the Action on Aftercare Consortium (AOAC), Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS), Local Government Association and others, we have therefore decided that the legislation will take effect from October 2001, to allow sufficient time for these processes. In the meantime, we shall continue to use the Quality Protects programme and the Quality Protects Special Grant to encourage and finance local authorities' work to bring their local policies into line with the Act and to put systems in place to be ready for full implementation. My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister will shortly be announcing revised details of Revenue Support Grant allocations for 2001-02.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.2/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture Council on 20 and <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-21">21 November</phrase> and the special meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-04">4 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/2">The special meeting had been called to follow up and build upon the measures to combat the spread of BSE decided at the November Council's meeting in response to developments in several continental member states. As a result of the decisions at these two Councils, as well as those taken in the interim by the Commission under its own powers, the EU has put in place in the 14 other member states strengthened protection against BSE which in key respects reflects measures already applying in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/3">At its November meeting the Council agreed to introduce BSE testing for bovine animals of over 30 months that were either at risk or entering the food chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-21">21 November</phrase> the Standing Veterinary Committee voted in favour of a Commission proposal giving effect to the Council agreement by requiring among other things random samples of at risk animals--6,500 in GB and 2,500 in NI annually--to be tested from <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>, and by requiring all animals over 30 months of age which we slaughtered for human consumption to be tested by a rapid BSE test from <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-01">1 July 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-30">30 November</phrase> the SVC agreed Commission proposals to extend the definition of specified risk materials to include all bovine intestines. This has relatively little effect in the UK, where bovine intestines of animals over six months were already defined as SRM.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/6">More recently, the special December Council further extended these public health protection measures and also took steps to restore consumer confidence in European beef and support the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/7">By qualified majority (Germany and Finland opposing) the Council adopted a proposal temporarily extending across the EU the prohibition on the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to all farm animals, introducing similar prohibitions related to most other processed animal and poultry products and prohibiting the use of fishmeal in ruminant rations.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/8">The Council also agreed to support a scheme for the removal from the market of over thirty month animals which have not been tested for BSE. By analogy with the over thirty month scheme already applying in the UK, this will both aid public health by preventing untested older animals from reaching consumers and support the market by removing from sale animals which, in the current low state of consumer confidence in Europe, have no viable outlet. The detailed rules of the scheme will be discussed at a Beef Management Committee meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-12">12 December</phrase> with a view to coming into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January</phrase>.</p>
