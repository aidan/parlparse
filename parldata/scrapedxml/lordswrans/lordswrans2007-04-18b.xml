	<p pid="b.71.0/1">We are in close touch with our international partners and aid agencies regarding the situation for displaced Iraqis both within Iraq and in neighbouring countries. We have regular meetings with UN agencies, in particular the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), and the International Red Cross.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.0/2">In January, UNHCR launched a $60 million appeal to address the influx of refugees into Iraq's neighbouring countries, of Syria and Jordan and the plight of displaced people inside Iraq (this is over 50 per cent funded). The money will go towards the provision of basic services and protection for internally displaced Iraqis and refugees, registration, and needs assessments. DfID has contributed &pound;1.5 million to this appeal, part of &pound;10 million that we have spent on humanitarian assistance in 2007. Inside Iraq, our support is providing urgently needed medical supplies, improved health facilities and restoring water and sanitation infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.0/3">Neither Kuwait nor Saudi Arabia are signatories to the 1951 refugee convention or its 1967 protocol. While promoting accession to the 1951 convention, UNHCR is working to strengthen both countries' adherence to the principles of refugee law, to improve protection and to advocate for the introduction of domestic asylum legislation. Thus its role for Iraqi refugees is one of monitoring and lobbying for protection rather than direct assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.0/4">Under the auspices of UNHCR, a meeting of international partners, including the US, UN agencies, representatives from regional governments and donor representatives will take place in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-17">17 April</phrase> to discuss the caseload of refugees in the region and to agree the best ways to respond.

	<p pid="b.77.0/1">The Northern Ireland Prison Service operates a pre-release home and resettlement leave scheme which facilitates sentenced prisoners to apply for periods of temporary release during the last 12 months of their sentence. Pre-release leave is not an entitlement, but a privilege to be earned. The underlying principles are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.77.0/2">the decision on whether to grant leave is critically dependent on the outcome of a risk assessment. This will assess the risk of harm/danger to others, the risk of reoffending and/or engaging in illegal activity on release, the likelihood of absconding and whether the conditions of release will be honoured;the decision on whether to grant leave must take account of evidence of behaviour while in custody, including behaviour on previous periods of pre-release leave and/or compassionate bail, and of whether effective use is being made of time in prison. For example, this could be reflected by attendance at resettlement and reoffending programmes offered and/or by pursuit of educational and other constructive activities; every period of leave applied for takes account of a prisoner's pursuit of a resettlement plan. Leave taken should be relevant and structured to complement reintegration and resettlement; the amount of leave for determinate sentenced prisoners, where granted, is governed by the length of time continuously in custody; leave for life sentenced prisoners will vary, subject to a yearly maximum, to complement the agreed release programmes;leave is subject to specified conditions signed up to by the prisoner prior to a period of release; for example, return to prison, conduct self in a lawful manner, no alcohol or drugs, no contact with victims; and victims' interests, where the victim has registered with the Victim Information Scheme, are considered in the decision on whether to grant leave and in the conditions specified where leave is granted.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.0/3">The decision to release prisoners under this scheme has been delegated to dedicated local prison Home Leave and Resettlement Boards. Home Leave Boards are multidisciplinary and are comprised of representatives from the security, probation, resettlement, psychology departments, the prisoner's residential location, and if appropriate the multi-agency strategy risk assessment management team (MASRAM&mdash;relating to sex offenders). The board is chaired by a nominated prison governor, on behalf of the governing governor<sup>*</sup>. Home Leave Boards convene weekly to consider applications made by prisoners for home or resettlement leave. Prisoners on occasions are permitted to appear before the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.0/4">The final decision to release a prisoner or otherwise is taken by the Home Leave Board chairperson after full and careful deliberation by the board members of all relevant factors pertaining to the application. The board is also required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to give effect to the rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).</p>
	<p pid="b.77.0/5">Ultimately the governing governor of the prison takes responsibility for the decisions of the Home Leave Boards. The governing governor and his deputy have the right to overturn any decision(s) made by the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.0/6">The Prison Service also operates a compassionate temporary release and home visits scheme for prisoners to visit close family relations who may be critically and/or terminally ill. The same consideration will apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.0/7" class="indent">* The governing governor is the overall governor in charge of the prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.2/1">Before a Northern Ireland prisoner is temporarily released from prison custody he/she must agree to the conditions of his/her release.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.2/2">All prisoners who have breached pre-release home or resettlement leave conditions, on returning to prison, are charged with an offence under prison rules where there is prime facie evidence to support a charge. The prisoner is then adjudicated on by a governor during a disciplinary hearing. If found guilty of breaching prison rules, the prisoner will be the subject of an adjudication award(s). Adjudications awards range from a maximum of 14 days' cellular confinement, to loss of association with other prisoners, to loss of prison earnings. In addition to cellular confinement there are other losses of privileges for varying time periods.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.2/3">Since summer 2002, following a European Court ruling, an adjudicating governor no longer has the power to increase a prisoner's sentence by awarding loss of remission. However, on returning to prison the prisoner's release date is recalculated and extended by the length of time the prisoner has been unlawfully at large.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.2/4">Where prisoners have absconded and failed to return to prison by the designated date and time the adjudicating governor may decide to deal with the matter internally or can adjourn the hearing and refer the matter to the PSNI for investigation and consideration for prosecution. The matter is referred under the provisions of Section 25 of the Prison Act, which carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment for the offence of being unlawfully at large while under sentence. The Prison Service has a memorandum of understanding with the PSNI and PPSNI that any prisoner, who has absconded for a substantial period of time, normally over eight weeks, can be considered for prosecution. The majority of cases are dealt with internally by the Prison Service under the adjudication process without recourse to the PSNI and PPSNI. Resorting to the courts has rarely resulted in a fresh sentence.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.2/5">Finally, each individual prisoner's pre-release and resettlement leave quotas under the pre-release home and resettlement scheme are based on the length of sentence and continuous custody. If a prisoner breaks continuous custody by remaining outwith the prison unlawfully for an entire calendar day or more, the prisoner will have been deemed to have broken continuous custody. As a result the prisoner's entitlement to pre-release and resettlement leave will be recalculated from the day on which he returns to prison, and consequently his home leave quotas will significantly reduce.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.2/6">In any fresh application for home or resettlement leave, account is taken of any previous leave failures by the Home Leave Board as part of its consideration.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.2/2">While the service seeks to reduce the risk to the public to the minimum by screening out less suitable candidates for temporary release, it is not possible to predict with absolute certainty that a prisoner will return to prison at the specified time.

	<p pid="b.81.0/1">The chief executive of Roads Service (Dr Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the noble Lord in response to these questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/2"><I>Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird, dated April 2007.</I></p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government two Parliamentary Questions regarding:</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/4">i. whether they have any evidence that illegal waste from the Republic of Ireland is being deposited under the carriageway which is currently being constructed between Newry and Dundalk; and, if not, whether they will carry out tests to verify whether such dumping has taken place.; and</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/5">ii. what are the security arrangements for guarding the carriageway currently under construction between Newry and Dundalk during the hours of darkness.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/6">As this issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/7">I can advise that neither Roads Service, our technical advisors, who are monitoring the construction of the A1 Cloghogue to the border dual carriageway (part of the A1/N1 Newry to Dundalk link road), nor the contractor, have any evidence that illegal waste from the Republic of Ireland is being deposited under the carriageway currently being constructed. Therefore, in the absence of any evidence that might indicate the location where such waste may have been deposited, I regret that I am unable to justify the significant costs of carrying out tests along the 4.5 km stretch of the road scheme located within Northern Ireland, to investigate whether such dumping has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/8">However, I can advise that the new dual carriageway is being constructed through the site of a rubbish tip in an old quarry at Mount Pleasant in County Louth, in the Republic of Ireland. I am advised that the material that is below the footprint of the road at this location is being processed on site. This is in line with current good practice and in consultation with Louth County Council (the client for the section of the road scheme south of the border, and the local authority with responsibility for matters relating to waste). While suitable material arising from this process is being incorporated in the works south of the border, unsuitable waste material is being removed to a licensed landfill site in County Louth.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/9">As regards the security arrangements for the dual carriageway construction site between Newry and Dundalk, I should advise that, while Roads Service's technical advisers are on site monitoring the construction, this is not normally during the hours of darkness. Security of the site is primarily a matter for the contractor, and in this respect the contractor advises that the site is secured at the end of each day and security personnel are engaged to patrol during the hours of darkness.</p>

Road traffic signs must either meet the requirements of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002, or be authorised by the Secretary of State. Signs indicating a prohibition of motor vehicles are already prescribed in a wide range of sizes. While signs should not be intrusive, they must be conspicuous in order to be effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.3/2">Decisions about the placing of road traffic signs at particular locations are the responsibility of the relevant traffic authority.
