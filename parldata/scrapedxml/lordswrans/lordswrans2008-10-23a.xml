	<p pid="a.118.5/1">The Government believe that the code of conduct provides an excellent framework within which decisions on conventional arms exports can be made. It produces clear statements of principle on issues relating to export control (including on human rights, conflict and sustainable development), and these set benchmarks for licences to be judged against. However, the code of conduct is currently only politically binding. We believe it should be given legally-binding status. This can be done by adopting it, at EU level, as a common position. We continue to press other member states to try to achieve the necessary consensus to enable this to happen. The text of the common position has already been subjected to UK parliamentary scrutiny, so the Government could move quickly to adopt it once consensus is reached.</p>

So far, neither Russia nor Georgia has indicated an intention to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions that was adopted at Dublin in May. We believe the new convention is strong and will help to make the world a safer place. We will work with other countries that were not present at Dublin to encourage the widest possible support for the new convention and its norms.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/2">The Government have contributed &pound;2 million to relief efforts in Georgia, part of which is for clearance of mines and unexploded ordnance, including cluster munitions, the legacy of the recent conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/3">That these weapons were used in Georgia underlines the need to use all international fora available to secure action on cluster munitions. We therefore continue to work hard to ensure a meaningful protocol on cluster munitions is adopted within the framework of the United Nations (UN) Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, where both Russia and Georgia are engaged. Adherence to it would be an important early step towards joining the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</p>

The new Homes and Community Agency which will come into existence in December 2008 brings together the functions and activities of English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation.

The UK has contributed to this by providing &pound;30.45 million to the EC temporary international aid mechanism and to its successor PEGASE in 2008. In addition, the UK accounts for 15.6 per cent of the EC's overall 2008 budget by providing core funding. The EC recently pledged an additional &euro;82 million in financial support to the Palestinian Authority's budget. Of this, &euro;10 million will be used to pay for fuel to the Gaza power plant. To keep fuel supplies to the power plant stable for the rest of the year, the EC needs an additional &euro;12 million. It has requested additional funding from donors. So far only Belgium and Germany have come forward with additional funds but we are hopeful that others will too. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.5/1">Ministers take seriously their responsibilities to Parliament and aim to respond to Parliamentary Questions on time wherever possible. The nature of some Parliamentary Questions requires consultation with other parts of Government which inevitably takes time. The Summer Recess has also been a factor. However, I can assure the noble Lord that the Cabinet Office is working to answer the outstanding Questions as quickly as possible.</p>
