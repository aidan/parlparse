Officials are aware of the findings of the University of Sheffield. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) currently uses a fairly similar model to the Sheffield work. However, the Sheffield model was designed to investigate the relationship between alcohol pricing, promotions and alcohol-related harm. HMRC and HM Treasury need a model to estimate revenue implications of duty rate changes and so use their own model designed specifically for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.6/1">The Ministry of Justice and Department of Health have worked together to establish a range of services for dangerous offenders with severe personality disorder in prisons, high and medium-secure National Health Service (NHS) facilities and the community. The programme was announced in 2001 as a commitment to provide at least 300 places for offenders who fell into the dangerous and severe personality disorder category. Across the NHS and the National Offender Management Service, the current annual revenue expenditure incurred is &#163;60 million. This cost includes the provision of assessment, treatment, management, accommodation, a research and evaluation programme, and for the central joint policy team responsible for the development and management of the programme. The total number of admissions into the dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) programme to date is 456 individuals (source: DSPD Common Data Set, as managed at Broadmoor Hospital, which excludes a small number of females held in a DSPD unit at Low Newton prison).</p>
	<p pid="a.59.6/2">The DSPD programme was established to pilot methods of working with the most dangerous offenders and patients in society. The programme has considered a range of challenges in terms of the assessment, treatment and the management of this most difficult population. Its purpose has always been to improve the mental health outcomes and reduce the risk of serious harm presented by this group. Progression from the DSPD units into mainstream criminal justice and mental health services is also a core component of the programme. Services being piloted through the programme have been in full operation since 2005; treatment is expected to last between three to five years, and therefore, only a few prisoners and patients have progressed from the units. Consequently it is too early to determine improvement in outcomes for prisoners and patients across the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.6/3">There are two linked evaluations of the DSPD programme which are due to report shortly to the stakeholder departments; the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health. The first evaluation is being carried out by the University of Oxford and focuses on treatment offered and responses to treatment at the four DSPD sites in high secure hospitals and the high secure prison estate. The second evaluation, by Imperial College, is concerned with staffing and organisation within the four sites. These two studies will provide a preliminary assessment of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the DSPD Programme and will help inform the work to consider the strategic options for the future provision of DSPD and personality disorder services for offenders. These are due to be published in the autumn.</p>
