Six pilot offices will be used initially to assess the viability of the project. The first three of these will open in April 2001. The Government and the Legal Services Commission proposed in the consultation document on salaried defenders published in June that, during the period of assessment, a member of the commission, who is an experienced criminal practitioner of high standing, should act as the head of professional service for the six offices. The heads of each office will have direct access to him. The commission member who will undertake this role is Mr Tony Edwards, a distinguished defence lawyer of great experience. He is senior partner of a substantial criminal law firm and is a specialist in the professional conduct and management of criminal law work.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.0/1">Although the UK decision not to join the Council of Europe Development Bank (CoEDB) was taken long ago, the Government have been prepared to reconsider. Last year, the FCO consulted the Department for International Development and the Treasury on the merits of joining at that stage. From the UK point of view, the CoEDB appears to fall between the two stools of aid agency for Central and Eastern Europe and source of loans to its members on highly favourable terms. Since the bulk of the fund's lending is to Western European countries, the UK could not justify charging the very large membership costs to our development aid programme, where we are confined to participating in programmes which benefit aid-recipient countries. Nor could we justify the costs in terms of commercial benefit, either on grounds that such loan facilities are not otherwise available or that the benefits warrant transferring the resources required from other activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.5/1">It has always been the intention that, when the Criminal Records Bureau comes into operation, it will be expected to recover its costs through charges that it makes in relation to the certificates that it issues, on application, to individuals. Voluntary organisations, and employers, will be able to reimburse applicants if they so wish. In the case of Criminal Record Certificates and Enhanced Criminal Record Certificates, applications will need to be countersigned by a person registered with the Bureau for this purpose. Work is continuing on determining the fees for certificates, taking into account a number of elements, including costs incurred by police forces in undertaking searches of local police records in connection with Enhanced Criminal Record Certificates and the bureau's running costs, and fees for registration. The fees will be set by regulations, which will be laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.5/2">Waiving charges in respect of those applying from the voluntary sector would inevitably increase the cost to the public purse or for other applicants. We have made clear our determination to keep fees as low as possible. An impact assessment will address the implications for the voluntary sector and others. This exercise will provide an up-to-date assessment and the results will be made known.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">The last Chief Medical Officer's report was published in August 1998 by Sir Kenneth Calman shortly before he left office. The present Chief Medical Officer came into post in late September 1998. He has taken stock of the publications issued by the Chief Medical Officer and introduced a number of changes.

	<p pid="a.50.2/2">After listening to a wide range of views, he also intends to introduce changes to the format of his annual report. Although the previous format served its purpose well in the past, it is very detailed and it is not always clear in what areas action is being called for. The practice of the CMO's annual report containing descriptions of a wide range of government policies which are contained in other documents added to the detailed nature of the reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.5/1">The World Health Organisation recognises the United Kingdom as one of those countries that have eliminated indigenous polio due to wild virus. The last case of indigenous wild virus poliomyelitis was seen in the United Kingdom in January 1982. However, cases of wild virus poliomyelitis that have been acquired overseas have continued to occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/2">The whole of the Americas has been declared free of polio. However, the Indian sub-continent and central and west Africa continue to have relatively high rates of wild virus polio. These are areas of the world with which many residents of the United Kingdom have frequent contact. The United Kingdom therefore currently recommends oral polio vaccine (OPV), since this provides a greater degree of community protection than inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is used in the United States and which provides protection only for the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/3">The World Health Organisation has set a target for eradicating polio world-wide. The Government are keeping the situation under review and, once we can be confident of the control of wild virus polio in the Indian sub-continent and central and west Africa, will seek advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on future polio immunisation policy. Until such time we will continue to provide OPV.</p>

Under the terms of these sponsor ticket promotions, NMEC forecast that over 1 million people will benefit. The company has calculated that, on the basis of ticket yield of offers made, against the ticket yield under the non-discounted pricing structure, approximately 190,000 visitors would be needed to deliver the level of revenue which theoretically would have been achieved had the sponsor promotion not been in place. Discounted ticket promotions of this kind, which are an integral and normal part of the visitor attraction industry, provide an opportunity for NMEC to enhance its own marketing and sales efforts, enabling the company to reach a great many families across the UK. The promotion also enables a number of people to visit and enjoy the Millennium Experience who might not have had an opportunity to do so otherwise.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.8/1">With the information made available to the board at <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-02">2 August</phrase> the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) considered that it was trading solvently. On <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-03">3 August</phrase> the Millennium Commission confirmed the offer of a further lottery grant of &pound;43 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/2">The PricewaterhouseCoopers report dated <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-22">22 August</phrase>, which was commissioned by the NMEC board following confirmation of the further lottery grant, states that the company was at the time of the report technically insolvent. A copy of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report has now been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The report states clearly that &quot;the Company should seek to bridge the identified funding urgently&quot;. On receipt of this information, it was therefore the immediate responsibility of the board and its directors to seek to remedy the company's insolvent status.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/3">The NMEC board, on the advice of its licensed insolvency practitioner, continued to trade whilst insolvent in accordance with the provisions of Section 214 of the 1986 Insolvency Act. This places a particular responsibility upon a board and its directors to continue to trade, even though they may be insolvent at that time, if there is a reasonable prospect that they may be able to introduce sufficient funds to correct the insolvency, and in doing so therefore eliminate any risk to creditors or other parties who would suffer in the event of a default.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-05">5 September</phrase> the Millennium Commission confirmed to the NMEC an additional lottery grant of &pound;47 million. In securing this grant the board of NMEC and its directors therefore discharged their responsibilities under the provisions of Section 214 of the 1986 Insolvency Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">I understand that David James, the Executive Chairman of the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), was referring to the aggregate operating costs incurred by the NMEC from its inception to its projected orderly wind-up in 2001. This indicates that operating costs will have overrun by perhaps as much as &pound;40 million against the original budget of May 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/2">However, the figure to which Mr James was referring includes not only the costs of operating the Dome as a visitor attraction, but also the costs included in the original May 1997 budget covering the National Programme and various other corporate expenditure items. The NMEC has calculated that, if the costs of operating the Dome as a visitor attraction for the 12 months since it opened on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January</phrase> to its projected closing on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-31">31 December</phrase> are addressed exclusively, the present projection is that operating costs will show a saving of some &pound;8 million above the figure included in that original budget.</p>

NMEC has advised that it has never proposed to sign unlimited liability contracts with Zee TV. The proposal is that NMEC will contract with Zee TV for the ticketing arrangements for the Miss World event. Zee TV will contract directly with the caterers, and the NMEC will contract separately with Endernol Entertainment for the life of the Skyscape value.</p>
