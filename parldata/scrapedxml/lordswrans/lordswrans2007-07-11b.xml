<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-07-11b.215.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="215"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70711w0001.htm#070711102000031">
	<p pid="b.215.2/1">The Government have signalled to our European Union partners that constraints on production such as set-aside should be eliminated as part of the CAP reform &quot;health check&quot;, the results of which would come into force, at the earliest, in 2009. It is important that any implications for the environment and the Rural Payments Agency's administration of the single payment scheme, to which set-aside is directly linked, are fully considered as part of the health-check discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.2/2">Farming organisations have argued that the set-aside rate should be set at 0 per cent for 2008, and the Commission are considering this. With the main UK harvest yet to get under way, the Government are still assessing the situation before taking a view on whether such a temporary change, in advance of a more fundamental review in the health check, would be appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.216.0/1">Local authorities have statutory duties for local air quality management (LAQM) under the Environment Act 1995. They are required to carry out regular reviews and assessments of air quality in their area against standards and objectives in the national air quality strategy and which have been prescribed in regulations for the purpose of LAQM. Where it is found these are unlikely to be met, authorities must designate air quality management areas (AQMAs) and prepare and implement remedial action plans to tackle the problem. Under LAQM, local authorities that have air quality management areas must produce an action plan between 12 to 18 months following designation of their AQMAs, as set out in policy guidance LAQM.PG(03). Authorities have been required to take account of the guidance in carrying out their duties since February 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.0/2">Defra also encourages authorities whose draft action plan primarily relates to local road transport to integrate them into their local transport plans (LTP). A number of local authorities have taken this opportunity and have integrated their action plan in their LTP.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.0/3">Most local authorities have met the deadlines and have submitted their action plan to Defra. To date, Defra has received 134 action plans from local authorities. However, 24 authorities have yet to produce an action plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.0/4">Where local authorities are late in providing plans, Defra engages with them to seek to understand the reasons for such delays. Defra has established contact with the majority of the authorities that are late in providing action plans. The table below sets out their progress to date. In some cases, Defra has agreed extensions to the original deadlines.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.0/5">LAQM is an ongoing system and local authorities are continually endeavouring to protect the health of citizens in their areas through improving air quality. At the same time, the Government are committed to delivering cleaner air to protect peoples' health and the environment.</p>

It includes increased investment in programmes to help parents make the most of the time they spend with their children and play a full and positive part in their children's learning and development. This can take a variety of forms including structured parenting programmes in the growing number of schools offering extended services, the new National Academy for Parenting Practitioners ensuring the workforce has the skills necessary for supporting parents, and informal advice provided by Parentline Plus.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.6/2">In 2005, the joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office/Home Office Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) was established as the UK's one-stop shop for developing government policy on forced marriage, co-ordinating awareness-raising projects and providing support, information and protection to those at risk. The FMU handles approximately 250 to 300 cases per year, 15 per cent of which involve men.

More information on the work of the FMU, and copies of these guidelines, can be found at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/forcedmarriage">www.fco.gov.uk/forcedmarriage</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.229.2/2">There have been significant improvements in services for frail older people since the publication of the<I></I><I>National Service Framework</I><I> for Older People</I> in March 2001. By removing age as a barrier to accessing specialist care, older people have been among the main beneficiaries from the investment in national health services. This is reflected in increased access to services and treatments relating to key conditions associated with old age, and the investment in community services such as intermediate care, which have helped bridge the gap between hospital and home as well as reduced delayed discharge.</p>

In addition to this the department aims to ensure, through the Dignity in Care campaign, that all older people in all care settings are treated with respect for their dignity by promoting changes to culture, system and outcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.2/4">The department's service development guide, <I>Everybody's Business</I><I>,</I> sets out the components of a comprehensive older people's mental health service for health and social care services to implement.</p>

	<p pid="b.231.0/1">The A329(M) and the A322 are both roads which are not part of the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network, and as such are maintained by the relevant local highway authorities. They are designated as primary routes under Section 1 of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002, and in the opinion of the Secretary of State for Transport provide, outside of the motorway and trunk road network, the most satisfactory route for through traffic between places of traffic importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.0/2">The Department for Transport does not hold records of the suitability of the A322 or A329(M) to accommodate abnormal loads, as these roads are the responsibility of the local highway authorities through which they pass. For abnormal loads falling within the terms of the Road Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) Order 2003, it is for the haulier to notify the relevant local highway authorities, owners of structures and police of the route over which an abnormal load would pass, and to propose an alternative route if its initial route is refused. Structure owners and highway authorities are notified to ensure that abnormal loads will not pose a danger to structures and highways during a move.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.0/3">The assessment of the congestion on the M25 motorway between the M3 and M4 motorways, in line with the PSA journey time reliability target, is that the worst 10 per cent of journeys travelling clockwise experience a delay of five minutes and 44 seconds, and anti-clockwise a delay of eight minutes and 22 seconds, for each 10 miles.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.0/4">Congestion may be caused by incidents, planned roadworks and limited capacity. To reduce incident-related congestion, Highways Agency traffic officers now patrol the M25, helping to clear incidents more quickly. Roadworks are planned to keep as many lanes as possible open and work is carried out at night whenever possible. This section has recently been widened to five lanes to address capacity issues and has variable compulsory speed limits which smooth traffic flow. The Highways Agency manages information for customers through a telephone information line and the internet to enable journeys to be planned to avoid congestion where possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.0/5">In addition, the Highways Agency is conducting a trial new road layout at the junction between the M25 and the M3 (junction 12, M25) to give an extra lane to traffic joining the M3 coastbound from the M25. This reduces traffic queuing to leave the M25 at this junction, especially in the anti-clockwise direction. The Highways Agency is also considering schemes at either end of the stretch of the M25 between junctions 12 and 15 in order to alleviate congestion.</p>

	<p pid="b.232.0/1">The maximum time for which a vehicle is permitted to park on lay-bys which are part of the public highway will depend on whether there are any waiting or loading restrictions. It is for the relevant highway authority to consider whether any restrictions should apply. Such restrictions require a traffic regulation order and may apply to different classes of vehicle and can provide for both the time of the day, and the duration, for which specified vehicles may or may not park.</p>

	<p pid="b.232.3/1">The royal prerogative is the only currently available basis to legislate in respect of ceded overseas territories, and may continue to be used for the exercise of reserved powers in relation to other overseas territories. To rework the system by which overseas territories are governed would require the introduction of primary legislation in Parliament, perhaps in relation to each overseas territory. Such a course of action would require careful consultation with the Executive, legislature and population of each of the populated overseas territories. There is very little impetus behind such a venture from the populated overseas territories, many of which are currently in the midst of, or have recently completed, a constitutional review process with the United Kingdom under the current governance arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.233.3/1">In August 2005, the Government of Uzbekistan announced that the death penalty would be abolished from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.3/2">While this is a significant step, the legislation does not state clearly what will happen to those prisoners already on death row. According to the Uzbek Government, no executions have been carried out since February 2005. Some human rights groups claim that the Uzbek authorities have begun to commute the sentences in certain cases from the death penalty to life imprisonment, though we have not been able to verify this. Concerns remain about the conditions in which prisoners on death row are kept. Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS are identified as particular dangers. There have also been reports that prisoners have not had proper access to legal assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.3/3">Our embassy in Tashkent monitors the human rights situation in Uzbekistan closely. Our ambassador, Iain Kelly, discussed UK concerns on human rights in Uzbekistan with both Foreign Minister Norov during his introductory meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase>, and President Karimov during the presentation of his credentials on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-08">8 June</phrase>. The EU has made regular representations urging the Government of Uzbekistan to stop the use of the death penalty, pending full abolition. This was last discussed at the EU-Uzbekistan human rights dialogue in May. However, the position of the Government of Uzbekistan is that a freeze on the use of the death penalty would be inhumane&mdash;that their policy is to go straight to full abolition, and in the mean time to focus on measures to prepare for the abolition of the death penalty such as legislative amendments, education and training.</p>

	<p pid="b.238.2/1">The processing of visa applicants' personal data by contractors is governed by obligations set out in a specific schedule in contracts entered into with the contractors. The obligations in the current contract require the contractors to meet all the requirements of the Data Protection Act. These contracts contain sensitive commercial information. Their release would damage the Government's ability to gain maximum value for money from the contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/2">The subject of alleged security breaches relating to a contractor's online visa application facility is currently being investigated by an independent investigator. A report of this investigation will be laid before Parliament. As such it is not appropriate to comment further in advance of the investigator's report. We will respond to all the recommendations of the independent investigator, including any in relation to a possible code of practice or amendments to the contracts.</p>
