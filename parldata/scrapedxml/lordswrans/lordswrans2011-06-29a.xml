Any requirement to collect these data in the future would be subject to the department's review of central returns process. This is intended to ensure that central collections of information are appropriate to their purpose, do not duplicate existing collections, and minimise the burden on the NHS of submitting the data.</p>

	<p pid="a.419.5/2">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' evidence-based guideline, <I>The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion</I>, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, highlights that abortion service professionals must be able to provide the degree of support and counselling required by each individual and identify those who require more support. For the minority of women who need formal, therapeutic counselling, services should have agreed care pathways in place, with access to trained counsellors with appropriate expertise. We are considering how the provision of counselling can be strengthened to support improvements to women's health and wellbeing.</p>

	<p pid="a.422.0/1">The capital of the European Central Bank (ECB) is provided by the national central banks of all EU member states. The key for capital subscription or capital key determines the share of the total capital (currently &#8364;10.76 billion) paid by each member state. It is based on a weighting of each member state's share of the European Union (EU) population and share of EU gross domestic product.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.0/2">Euro area member states pay 100 per cent of their subscribed capital. Non-euro area member states pay a much smaller percentage (currently, and since <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-29">29 December 2010</phrase>, 3.75 per cent). This reflects the fact that the national central banks of all member states, including the United Kingdom, participate in the European system of central banks. However, the Bank of England contributes a relatively small amount (&#8364;58.5 million) to the ECB's capital, specifically as a contribution to its operating costs. The Bank of England makes no other contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.0/3">Changes to the ECB's subscribed capital may lead to adjustments to the individual contributions from all EU member states. The ECB last increased its subscribed capital in December 2010 by &#8364;5 billion, in line with the Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) Council Regulation No. 1009/2000 of <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-08">8 May 2000</phrase>, which granted the ECB's governing council with the power to decide on an increase up to this amount. At the same time, the percentage of subscribed capital that non euro area national central banks are required to pay was adjusted down from 7 per cent to 3.75 per cent; as a result, the Bank of England contributed an additional &#8364;40,473.51. Any further increase to the ECB's subscribed capital would require EU member states at ECOFIN to agree on a new council regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.0/4">Net profits and losses of the ECB are allocated among the euro area national central banks. The non-euro area national central banks are not entitled to receive any share of the distributable profits of the ECB, nor are they liable to fund any losses of the ECB.</p>

	<p pid="a.438.2/1">Using information from the department's 2009-10 Family Resources Survey, we estimate that the number of households claiming housing benefit who have a spare room is approximately:</p>

	<p pid="a.438.2/6" class="indent">1. Data for the 2009-10 Family Resources Survey was collected between April 2009 and March 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.2/7" class="indent">2. The Family Resources Survey is a nationally representative sample of approximately 23,000 households across Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.2/8" class="indent">3. The Family Resources Survey is known to under-record benefit receipt so the estimates presented should be treated with caution.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.2/9" class="indent">4. Figures from the Family Resources Survey are based on a sample of households that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors. These align the Family Resources Survey to regional population estimates by age and sex. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining non-response error.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.2/10" class="indent">5. All figures have been rounded to the nearest 100,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.2/11" class="indent">6. The number of claimants with spare rooms has been estimated by applying the bedroom criteria that applies to most housing benefit claimants living in the private rented sector. Some current housing benefit claimants would be assessed against different criteria, whilst some would have no restrictions currently applied to the size of their accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.2/12" class="indent">7. This question has been answered at a household level rather than an individual level. In a small number of cases there are multiple housing benefit claimants living in a single household. This would apply to joint tenants in receipt of housing benefit. Where there are multiple housing benefit claimants in a single household containing a spare room, these have been counted once the above figures rather than for each individual housing benefit claimant.</p>

	<p pid="a.438.5/2">The remaining &#163;210 million has been allocated differently and is based upon the department's estimates of the total gross reductions in housing benefit entitlement in each local authority that will result from the local housing allowance reforms that came into effect in April 2011.

	<p pid="a.449.6/1">Soft exclusions, or unofficial exclusions, are unlawful. The department does not condone the use of unofficial exclusions by schools and has made it clear that unofficial exclusions are unlawful. If a pupil has committed a disciplinary offence and needs to be removed from school, formal exclusion, whether fixed-period or permanent, is the only legal method of removal. The exclusion guidance sets out the only ways in which a pupil can be legally removed from the school premises. Guidance on the procedures to be followed is available on line at <a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupportlbehaviour/exclusion/">http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupportlbehaviour/exclusion/</a> a0076478/exclusion-auidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.6/3">We do not have any research on the usage of unofficial exclusion. However, we will be testing a new approach to managing permanent exclusion-where schools take responsibility for finding and funding the pupil's placement-in almost 300 schools in 20 local authorities from this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.6/4">One of the detailed issues to be assessed through the trial will be the prevalence, and impact on pupils, of unofficial exclusion. Evidence from the trial will directly inform future policy development.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.6/5">The department does not hold statistics on soft exclusions or unofficial exclusions. The latest published statistics can be found in the &quot;Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions from Schools in England 2008-09&quot; Statistical First Release at: <a href="http://www.education.dov.uk/rsdateway/DB/SFR/s000942/index.shtml">http://www.education.dov.uk/rsdateway/DB/SFR/s000942/index.shtml</a>.

	<p pid="a.452.8/1">Entitlement to employment and support allowance (ESA) is based on an assessment of functional capability, not on medical condition or diagnosis. The medical condition recorded on a claim form does not therefore in itself confer entitlement to ESA. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming ESA on the basis of a mental health condition would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities assessed by the work capability assessment. It is also important to note that, where someone has more than one diagnosis or disabling condition, only the predominant one is currently recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.8/2">There were 132,800 Fit for Work decisions for new ESA claims made up to the end of February 2010, where the primary health condition was classed as mental and behavioural disorders. There have been 50,100 appeals heard against these decisions, of which 21,200 (42 per cent) were cases where the decision was overturned in favour of the appellant.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.8/3">The data presented above come from benefit claims data held by the Department for Work and Pensions, functional assessment data from Atos Healthcare and appeals data from the Tribunals Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.8/4">Data on appeals heard are published for new ESA claims starting between October 2008, when ESA was introduced, and up to the end of February 2010 (the latest month where there are sufficient volumes of appeals heard). Appeals data are included only where the person claiming has been found Fit for Work, they have subsequently appealed against the department's decision and the appeal has been heard by the Tribunals Service. Figures are only available for appeals that have been completed and not those that are currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.8/5">Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted to the Tribunals Service and heard, it is likely that there are more appeals that have not yet been heard. As a result these figures should continue to be treated as emerging findings and not final at this stage.</p>
