	<p pid="a.16.6/1">This Answer is in respect of England only, as flood defence is a matter for the devolved authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.6/2">In England, measures to reduce the risk of flooding from main rivers and the sea are undertaken primarily by the Environment Agency. In 1998-99 the agency's total expenditure on flood defence was &pound;277.0 million. The agency's major sources of income for flood defence are government grants towards approved capital works (&pound;33.5 million in 1998-99) and levies from local authorities (&pound;192.6 million in 1998-99). Local authority levies are included in the Standard Spending Assessments of the local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.6/3">In the agency's Anglian Region, a general drainage charge is levied on occupiers of agricultural land, the income from which totalled &pound;2.9 million in 1998-99. This provided nearly 5 per cent of the agency's expenditure on flood defence in that region of &pound;58.9 million, and 1.5 per cent of the agency's total expenditure in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.6/4">Flood defence works to reduce the risk of flooding from non-main rivers and the sea may be undertaken by local authorities or internal drainage boards (IDBs) but a breakdown of expenditure is not readily available. Part of the IDBs' expenditure is financed by drainage rates charged to owners of agricultural land within their districts.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.5/1">Due to severe manufacturing problems with Celltech Medeva, who provide the only United Kingdom licensed source of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG) against tuberculosis, the routine schools BCG immunisation programme was suspended across the UK in October 1999. Once we are confident about stocks and continuity of supply, the programme will be restarted.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">In response to this problem, the department has identified other manufacturers of BCG vaccines worldwide and is investigating these possibilities together with experts from the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control, the Medicines Control Agency and NHS Supplies. This work is still ongoing due to the complex nature of ensuring the safety and efficacy of any alternative source. We are not yet in a position to be able to confirm when, or if, an alternative source will be available.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.8/1">The UNICEF report shows that in the last 20 years child poverty trebled in the UK (the data used in the report relates to 1995 and reflects the situation under the previous administration).</p>
	<p pid="a.19.8/2">We have already made a commitment to eradicating child poverty in the next 20 years, and this report agrees that we have made a very good start--measures we have already announced will lift around 1 million children out of poverty by 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.8/3">The report also highlights the importance of work--for most people, the best route out of poverty is through employment. We are already tackling this through the New Deals, working families' tax credit, and the minimum wage. Increases in the income-related benefits and child benefit will help those for whom work is not yet an option.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.8/4">Since the debate in July last year we have implemented another above-inflation rise in child benefit, launched the working families' tax credit, and significantly improved the child allowances in the income-related benefits. In all, by the end of this Parliament, we will be spending an extra &pound;7 billion per year on tax and benefit measures for families with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.8/5">This Government are determined to tackle the problems of poverty and social exclusion, and, as I said last July, we believe our strategy is the best way to achieve that aim.</p>
