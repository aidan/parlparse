	<p pid="a.154.8/1">The Secretary of State for International Development, Hilary Benn, represented the United Kingdom at the Donors' Conference on Iraq held in Madrid on 23 and <phrase class="date" code="">24 October</phrase>. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury and my noble friend Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean also attended.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.8/2">The conference was opened by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. A total of 73 countries attended, with 20 international organisations and 13 non-governmental organisations. The Iraqi Governing Council was represented by its President, Dr Ayad Allawi, and a number of other members. Iraqi Ministers also participated. The conference was characterised by a strong and visible Iraqi presence, as well as by a sense of the international community coming together to focus on how it can help Iraqis to secure a stable and prosperous future.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.8/3">Over 33 billion US dollars in grants and concessional loans was pledged towards Iraq's reconstruction for the period 2004 to 2007, significantly exceeding expectations. Twenty billion dollars was pledged by the USA, 5 billion dollars by Japan, 3 billion to 5 billion dollars by the World Bank, 2.5 billion dollars by the IMF, and the rest by other bilateral donors, mainly from European and Arab countries. Additional pledges were made by way of export credits and assistance in kind.</p>

This commitment will not result in any reduction in DfID's planned development expenditure for low-income countries, or affect our commitment of &pound;1 billion for Africa by 2005&ndash;06.

	<p pid="a.155.2/1">My right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, has previously indicated that changes would be made to planned future programme allocations for middle-income countries over the next two years. This results from decisions taken on financing for Iraq and the Government's commitment to increase the proportion of our direct assistance going to the poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/2">As reported in the Department for International Development's 2003 annual report, we are planning to increase significantly total bilateral allocations for DfID's country and regional programmes over the next two years from this year's estimated total of &pound;1.429 billion to &pound;1.762 billion in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;2.078 billion in 2005&ndash;06. This includes meeting the Prime Minister's commitment to increase our spending for Africa to &pound;1 billion annually by 2005&ndash;06; and increasing our spending in Asia by some 45 per cent to nearly &pound;800 million by the same year. Overall, the UK's aid budget will grow to nearly &pound;4.6 billion by 2005&ndash;06, an average annual increase over the 2002 spending review period of 8.1 per cent in real terms. The UK's level of official development assistance is set to reach 0.4 per cent of national income by 2005&ndash;06&mdash;a 93 per cent increase in real terms since 1997. This is evidence of this Government's continued commitment to make progress towards meeting the UN target of an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/3">As set out in the 2003 departmental report, responding to changes in circumstances is an integral part of DfID's work, and financial allocations for future years are subject to change. We had already planned to reduce the overall allocation to middle-income countries in order to allow an increase in spending on the poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/4">Over the next two years, funding for the reconstruction of Iraq includes &pound;50 million reallocated from planned programmes, together with DfID contingency funding of &pound;115 million and contributions from other government departments. Our public service agreement includes the commitment to increase the share of our bilateral programme going to low income countries to 90 per cent by 2005&ndash;06. As a consequence of the temporary increase in funding for Iraq, which we expect to return to middle-income status soon, we will also need to move a further estimated &pound;50 million from middle-income country programmes to low-income country programmes. This is in line with our commitment to the 90 per cent target.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/5">The total effect of these changes will be a reduction in planned bilateral spending in middle-income countries in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 of around &pound;100 million. Funding for programmes in middle-income countries during the current financial year will not be affected. Our budget for humanitarian activities will remain as planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/6">We will continue to provide substantial support to middle-income countries through our contributions to multilateral institutions. In 2001&ndash;02 this amounted to some &pound;600 million, of which some &pound;350 million was for middle-income developing countries. The rest was for middle-income countries in transition.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/7">These changes in planned bilateral allocations will involve withdrawal from programmes, earlier than we had previously decided, from a number of middle-income countries, which are less dependent on UK bilateral aid. Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Egypt are in this category. Our planned programme in Jordan will be re-phased. Our current programmes in Anguilla and TCI will now close in 2004&ndash;05, a year earlier than originally planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/8">We will be continuing with our bilateral programmes, with some reduction in spending levels and in some cases an adjustment of focus, in the following countries/regions: South Africa, China, Sri Lanka, Russia, Jamaica, Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo and the Caribbean. Our small programme in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will close by 2005&ndash;06, as will the small programmes in Peru and Honduras. We will be developing a new approach to regional involvement in Latin America. Our programmes in the Palestinian Authority, Montserrat and St Helena will remain unaffected; and we will retain a programme in Nicaragua.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/9">The Secretary of State for International Development also proposes to increase, from 2005&ndash;06, our partnership funding for NGOs, including those working with middle-income countries and Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/10">DfID officials are in touch with all of the countries affected by these changes in plans. We are also talking to the multilateral agencies and some other bilateral donors about the scope for increasing our co-operation with them. This will be reflected in the new middle-income country strategy that the department is preparing in consultation with other departments in Whitehall. My right honourable friend will report further to the House of Commons on the impact on individual country programmes once these discussions are complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.2/1">The safety of blood and blood products used in the National Health Service is of paramount importance. Although most United Kingdom sourced fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not virally inactivated, high levels of safety are achieved by using single unit, as opposed to pooled plasma, by screening out potential high-risk donors and by testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C before it is released to hospitals. In addition, the National Blood Authority (NBA) is conducting an options appraisal of means to minimise the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury from FFP. The NBA is currently looking at the practicalities of producing FFP from male donors, and a plan has been produced for implementation in the new year.</p>

The NBA is involved in arranging for supplies of FFP from male donors for this group of patients. A commercially produced, pooled FFP product sourced from the United States is also available for the National Health Service to purchase.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/3">The Government's Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Blood and Tissue for Transplantation (MSBT) will continue to review the risk of new emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the blood supply. There is no evidence at present that SARS can be transmitted by blood transfusion. The minutes of MSBT meetings will be published on the Department of Health website around the end of the year.</p>

The meeting was constructive. EFSA representatives indicated that applicants should submit data establishing the identity and purity of the nutrient source, and any available safety data. EFSA would then advise whether further data were required, taking into account similarities with substances which have already been approved either as nutrient sources or as additives. This, together with advice that combined dossiers for similar substances are welcome, means that dossier preparation costs for many of the &quot;missing&quot; substances will be significantly lower than previously estimated. The Food Standards Agency is writing to inform interested parties of the outcome and will continue to liaise with EFSA and European Commission representatives on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.3/1">Of the 6 million families expected to benefit from the new tax credits in the full year, it is estimated that 5.9 million families were benefiting from the child or working tax credits, or were receiving the equivalent level of child support through income support or jobseeker's allowance, at <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/2">A high-profile publicity campaign has been running since September 2002 to alert people to their entitlement to child tax credit and working tax credit and to encourage them to claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/3">The campaign has so far included national television advertising, local radio advertising across the UK, advertisements in the national press as well as online publicity and the use of direct mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/4">Leaflets and posters in English and nine community languages have been produced and are available free to community organisations, post offices, doctors' surgeries and libraries. Leaflets are available in large print, and can be obtained on request in braille or audio.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/5">An information pack, including sample material and ordering details has been sent out to intermediaries. A similar pack has also been sent to Members of both Houses of Parliament and the devolved administrations. Further publicity will include television, press, radio and online advertising as well as direct mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/6">Pension credit was introduced in October 2003. I understand from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that the latest information for its predecessor, minimum income guarantee, is for 2000&ndash;01. The amount unclaimed for that year in Great Britain is estimated to lie between &pound;470 million and &pound;820 million, as published by DWP in Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-up in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/7">The Government have a target for at least 3 million pensioner households to be in receipt of pension credit by 2006. We want all those eligible for pension credit to take up their entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/8">A direct mail pack to pensioner households is at the heart of the DWP's marketing campaign for pension credit. The Pension Service began writing to pensioner households in April, to explain pension credit and to invite advance applications. In addition, around 1.8 million people in receipt of the minimum income guarantee were told at the beginning of the year that they would be transferred automatically to pension credit ready for payments to be made from October. By June 2004, all pensioner households will have been contacted.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/9">These direct mail arrangements are being supported by a national TV and press advertising campaign, which began on <phrase class="date" code="">3 September</phrase>. The controlled and measured marketing campaign is designed to produce a steady build-up of pension credit applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/10">The pension credit application line, which became operational on <phrase class="date" code="">7 April</phrase>, enables trained staff to help pensioners through the application form and complete it for them over the telephone. Calls are free (except for some mobile phones) and friends and family can use the application line and apply on pensioners' behalf if they are unable to make the call themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.3/11">The Pension Service is able to offer alternative ways of applying to suit individual circumstances, including a textphone number and a paper application form. An application form can be downloaded from the pension credit website. Pensioners can also be put in touch with the Pension Service's local service and can be seen face-to-face either in a local surgery or, where appropriate, in the pensioner's home. The Pension Service is also working with partner organisations at national and local level to encourage take-up of the new entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.2/4">Prior to publication, it was decided that the General Register Office would assume responsibility for publishing and distributing the consultation document. This would allow us to sell copies on a cost-recovery basis at a price of &pound;10 per copy. It was hoped that, by setting as low a price as possible, the document would be more widely accessible to the many individuals and small groups who have an interest in civil registration issues, thereby encouraging responses to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/5">It was an oversight on our part whereby the House of Lords Printed Paper Office did not have sufficient published copies of Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change. Once my officials were made aware of this problem it was arranged that, as a temporary measure, photocopies of the web version would be made available for Members of the House.

	<p pid="a.168.5/2">The individual yield adopted for each property typically ranged from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. The actual percentage adopted in each case was derived from the investment yields of sales of comparable let properties in the open market and reflected the construction, condition, user and location of the properties. In some cases a direct comparison of capital value was made with comparable properties. The poor letting prospects of most of the properties reduced their final values.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Richard Bennett, Board Director of the Highways Agency, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-10">10 November 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.6/3">Lord Davies of Oldham has asked Stephen Hickey to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Highways Agency's plans to upgrade the A14 trunk road between Felixstowe and the A1 including the timescales and costs anticipated. I am replying on Stephen's behalf as he is currently away from the office.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.6/4">Our current targeted programme of improvements includes the following schemes for the A14:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.6/5" class="indent">A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton Improvement&mdash;a public consultation will start in spring 2004 with an anticipated start of works date in 2008. The project is estimated to cost &pound;490 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.6/6" class="indent">A14 Haughley New Street to Stowmarket Improvement&mdash;public consultation was held earlier this year and a preferred route announcement is expected early in the new year. The start of works is anticipated in 2007. The cost of the scheme is estimated at &pound;29 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.6/7" class="indent">A14 Rookery Crossroads&mdash;a public inquiry was held in March and Highways Act orders will be published in early November. Start of works is expected next year. The cost of the scheme is estimated at &pound;8 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.6/8">In addition, the London to South Midlands multimodal study recommended widening the A14 to dual three lanes between Cambridge (Fen Ditton) and the A11 in the longer term. The Secretary of State for Transport, in his response to the study to the regional assembly, stated that the longer-term measures, for delivery beyond 2015, provide a useful indication of future investment needs, but it is too early to take a definitive view on the priorities for which we might provide funding in the latter part of the next decade and beyond. The Highways Agency was not asked to prioritise work on the scheme at this stage.</p>

Ascertaining the full implementation costs of all the water directives, some of which date back to the 1970s, would be highly complex and disproportionately expensive. However, recent regulatory impact assessments have been published in respect of: the Water Framework Directive (see Appendix D of the third consultation paper on the implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)); the Nitrates Directive (see final RIA published June 2002), the European Commission proposals to revise the 1976 Bathing Water Directive (see Explanatory Memorandum 13789/02), and the proposed new designations under the Freshwater Fish Directive (78/659/EEC) (see appendix 4 of the consultation document issued by Defra/WAG in June 2003).
