Sport England has not at this stage identified any specific regeneration budgets which might be applicable to Sport Action Zones. However, the managers of each zone will seek to identify opportunities locally for sport to be included in regeneration strategies and budgets. The delivery of the Sport Action Zone objectives will require very close co-operation between Sport England and all local interests, including local authorities, sports associations, governing bodies, community groups, TECs and those involved in work on Housing Action Zones and Education Action Zones. Through such co-operation it is hoped to attract additional finance, both public and private, into the area aimed at increasing sporting opportunities and participation.</p>

The average weekly shortfall per pensioner is &pound;25.79. These figures are reflected in estimates of benefit expenditure. Notes: 1. All figures are for those pensioners resident in Great Britain only. 2. Figures include women who are receiving a full rate Category B pension either based on their own or their spouses' contributions. These include women who have paid no contributions themselves or a reduced rate contribution under the married woman's option. Figures also include pensioners on other categories of the basic state pension who are receiving less than the full Category A rate. 3.

As part of the Government's legal aid reform programme, I intend to focus resources on priority areas, one of which will be advice on social welfare work, including employment rights. In addition, the Community Legal Service will bring in new providers such as not-for-profit advice agencies and law centres, which have particular expertise in these areas of law.

The Government are currently reviewing the procedures of all tribunals to assess how they comply with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and EU law. Once we have better control of the scheme through the legal aid reforms, it will be possible for us to consider extending representation to tribunals if a need for it is established.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">The grant of British citizenship under the British Nationality Act 1981 requires certain statutory requirements to be met and, in some cases, involves the exercise of discretion. Although some registration provisions statutorily exclude certain applicants on the basis of nationality (for example, British nationals alone have an entitlement to British citizenship if they meet certain residence requirements) an applicant's national origin is, for the most part, irrelevant when it comes to the exercise of discretion. Exceptions have been made in the past in relation to one or two groups of people in Hong Kong for reasons connected with the territory's special circumstances. Similar flexibility may be needed in the future.</p>
