	<p pid="a.99.2/1">An important role of the Service Police is to investigate alleged offences by members of the UK Armed Forces. Service Police investigations are competent, impartial and effective. Service Police work to Home Office standards, are advised by professional lawyers, and are required by statute to follow civilian police force procedures. It is very difficult to see what added value a civilian body would bring to these investigations. In addition, there would be practical difficulties associated with a civilian body working in a hostile environment. We have every confidence in existing arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">Claims made by Iraqis for losses that do not arise in connection with combat operations are handled in accordance with the direction of the Coalition Provisional Authority&mdash;specifically Section 18 of CPA order number 17.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/1">The International Committee of the Red Cross report of February 2004 was an interim one based on findings from visits made by the ICRC to detention facilities in Iraq between March and November the previous year. By the time the report was submitted the UK's Divisional Temporary Detention Facility had opened and the few concerns relating to UK forces the report raised had been or were being dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/2">The UK's commitment to the protocols of the Geneva conventions covers the noble Lord's points at (a), (b), (c), (d), (f) and (g).</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/4">Regarding (h), all UK forces personnel are briefed on the law of armed conflict which includes guidance on basic prisoner handling. Each major unit also has a number of personnel trained to a greater degree in prisoner handling and UK personnel at the Divisional Temporary Detention Facility, which holds UK internees, are given further specific training.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.5/1">Cancer Research UK has been commissioned by the United Kingdom health departments to provide the SunSmart skin cancer prevention campaign for the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/2">The importance of seeking advice from health professionals on skin changes and the appearance of lesions is stressed in our key messages of the campaign&mdash;the SMART code, which is used in all campaign strategies:</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/3" class="indent">Stay in the shade between 11&ndash;3</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/4" class="indent">Make sure you never burn</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/5" class="indent">Always cover up</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/6" class="indent">Remember to take extra care with children</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/7" class="indent">Then use factor 15+ sunscreen</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/8" class="indent">Also report mole changes or unusual skin growths promptly to your doctor.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/9">These messages are widely seen on our range of posters, leaflets, press and PR activities, and through partnerships with our corporate partners. These materials have been sent in various forms to every nursery, primary and secondary school, health promotion units, primary care and Sure-Start co-ordinators in the UK. As an indication of the scale of this distribution, in 2004, over 175,000 posters and over 2 million postcard-sized message cards have been printed for active distribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/10">In the first phase of the campaign, we are aiming to raise awareness of our key messages to all people, with particular emphasis on parents and carers of children. At every opportunity we emphasise the increased risk for people with fair skin, many moles, a history of sunburn and/or a history of skin cancer in the family. We will then increase the focus on teenagers who exhibit high-risk sun seeking behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/11">We are working closely with the Tanning Industry to promote our key messages to at-risk groups of sunbed users, and encouraging people to seek early health professional opinion on any suspect moles.</p>

Reducing population intakes of salt and saturated fat, to improve heart health and bring about health benefits, are a priority for government. One of the three key strands in the NHS implementation plan is to offer a better service for a healthier and fitter population. Details of the public health element of this will be contained in the White Paper. This also builds on the commitment in the NHS Plan to work with the food industry to improve the overall balance of diet including salt, fat and sugar in food, working with the Food Standards Agency.</p>
