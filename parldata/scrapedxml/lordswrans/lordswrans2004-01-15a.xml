	<p pid="a.95.2/1">Donors in Afghanistan are encouraged to provide funding for programmes that appear in the Afghan Government's National Development Budget (NDB). The Community Organised Primary Education Programme is listed as a programme for donor funding in the NDB. This shows that the Ministry of Education itself sees this programme as a priority. Donors can fund this programme either by providing funding to the Ministry of Education or by providing funding directly to the implementing agency, which in this case is CARE.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/2">DfID provided a total of &pound;550,000 to CARE for it's work in Afghanistan in financial years 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03. In line with the Afghan Government request that donors concentrate on key areas of support, we are no longer providing funding to the education sector although we continue to provide funding to the Afghan Government budget, which includes teachers' salaries. A number of other donors are focusing on education. They include the US, Denmark and Sweden.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.1/2" qnum="HL646">To what extent they are satisfied with the level of security surrounding former Soviet Union nuclear, chemical and biological legacies; what schemes for increasing security are planned; and what contribution from Western and Asian governments is promised.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.2/1">Ensuring the security of sensitive materials is an integral part of many projects currently being carried out as part of the G8 Global Partnership. Work is also being carried out specifically on physical protection. The UK recognises the importance of helping Russia ensure that its stocks of proliferation-sensitive materials are protected to international standards from the risk of sabotage and theft. We will be identifying a portfolio of high priority projects in collaboration with the Russian authorities and other G8 Global Partnership donor countries, which will enhance nuclear security at key buildings and infrastructure. Once identified we expect to spend at least &pound;1 million per annum on these projects as part of our commitment to the Global Partnership. Some pilot projects have already been completed including a physical protection system for a nuclear-propelled cargo ship in north-west Russia in collaboration with Sweden, and physical protection systems for two nuclear powered ice-breakers in collaboration with Sweden and Norway.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">During the International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference in 2002 the UK pledged &pound;500,000 to its nuclear security fund. The fund contributes to meeting the UK's objective of improving the security of nuclear and radioactive material and nuclear facilities in the former Soviet Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/3">A number of other countries have provided, or plan to provide, assistance with improving the security of nuclear, chemical and biological facilities and materials. For example, during the last financial year, the US spent 39.8 million dollars on nuclear weapons storage security, 19.6 million dollars on nuclear weapons transportation security, and 199.5 million dollars on nuclear material protection, controls and accounting, and some 20 million dollars on security at the Kizner and Shchuch'ye chemical weapons storage sites. Canada has committed 65 million dollars to strengthen nuclear and radiological security. Germany has committed 170 million euros by 2009 for the physical protection of storage sites for fissile material. France has committed up to 5 million euros in 2003&ndash;04 towards security and safety in Russian biological facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/4">Copies of the UK's first annual report on the G8 Global Partnership published in December 2003 have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

In order to become qualified, all teachers need to demonstrate an awareness of, and an ability to work within, the statutory frameworks relating to teachers' responsibilities.

	<p pid="a.104.2/1">The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) discussed its forward work plan in September 2003. Various topics, including obesity, were discussed. A general summary of the committee's discussions and a formal work plan will be placed on the SACN website following the next committee meeting in February 2004.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-01-15a.104.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="104"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040115/text/40115w03.htm#40115w03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.104.5/1">The Health Development Agency (HDA) has indeed taken into account the full range of weight management and reduction options in its recent review of the literature in this area. Both the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the HDA follow an open and transparent methodology where high quality evidence is extensively gathered in order to assess the effectiveness of interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/2">A transparent and open approach will be taken during the development of the joint NICE/HDA guideline on obesity, referred to them by the Department of Health and the Welsh Assembly. It would therefore be inappropriate for either agency to have dialogue with any individual organisation. NICE/HDA expects to be consulting on the scope (exactly what the guideline will and will not cover) for this guideline from <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-27">27 January</phrase>&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-02-24">24 February 2004</phrase>. All interested parties are encouraged to register as stakeholders on the NICE website by <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-23">23 January 2004</phrase> in order that they may fully contribute towards the development of the guideline. The Obesity Awareness and Solutions Trust has registered as such a stakeholder and will therefore have an opportunity to engage with this process at that stage.</p>
