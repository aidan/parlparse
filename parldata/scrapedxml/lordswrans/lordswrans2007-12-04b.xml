Improvements will include a 48- hour turnaround on the postal service, as opposed to the current 10 to 15 working days. This will obviate the need for most of our customers to attend the office in person.</p>

	<p pid="b.178.3/1">In October 2007, the UN Secretary-General reported that Israel has not provided the details of any of its cluster munition strikes to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, or to any other part of the UN. The UK continues to call on Israel to provide all necessary information to assist the UN in the rapid clearance of cluster munitions in South Lebanon.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.3/2">The Mine Action Co-ordination Centre&mdash;South Lebanon (MACC-SL) set a target to clear all cluster munitions from the 2006 conflict by the end of 2007. However, this has not proved possible, largely because more cluster munition strike locations have been found as clearance efforts continue. MACC-SL's objective is now that by the end of 2007 the explosive remnants of the 2006 conflict do not directly impact the lives of those living in the affected areas. They expect that they will have cleared 70 to 75 per cent of the contaminated areas by the end of 2007. They predict that they will clear remaining areas of contaminated land by the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.3/3">The UK has been strongly supportive of efforts to clear cluster munitions in South Lebanon. The Government have pledged more than &pound;3.7 million for the clearance of unexploded ordnance in Lebanon, including cluster munitions, since last year's conflict.</p>

	<p pid="b.178.6/1">The latest statistics suggest the number of adults drinking more than double the recommended limits has decreased among men and remained stable amongst women. However, these figures cover 2005 and largely relate to the period before the 2003 Act came into effect. Recent statistics on underage consumption suggest that fewer young people aged 11 to 15 are drinking alcohol, but those who are drinking are consuming more alcohol more often. There is no evidence that these changes are due to the 2003 Act, particularly as this trend predates the introduction of the new legislation and the majority of alcohol drunk by children is given to them by family and friends and drunk at home rather than purchased by them in licensed premises. We have no evidence linking the 2003 Act with incidences of road traffic accidents involving drivers over the legal alcohol limit. Provisional figures published in <I>Road Casualties Great Britain 2006</I> suggest that the number of such incidents fell in the first full year following the implementation of the 2003 Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.182.5/1">The Uganda Human Rights Commission registered a total of 2,901 complaints about torture and cruel or inhuman treatment in Uganda between 1997 and 2006. In 2006 the commission experienced a decline in the number of complaints.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.5/2">We continue regularly to raise human rights issues with the Government of Uganda. The UK takes an active role in Kampala in the Partners for Democracy and Governance Group (PDG) and its sub-group the Human Rights Working Group. Both groups regularly raise concerns with both the Ugandan Government and civil society. Human rights issues were last raised through the PDG with the Foreign Minister of Uganda on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-24">24 October 2007</phrase>. I raised these issues with Foreign Minister Kutesa during his visit to the UK in July 2007.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-12-04b.183.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100955" speakername="Lord Malloch-Brown" colon=":" colnum="183"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71204w0002.htm#07120461000107">
	<p pid="b.183.2/1">The Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, <I>Nowhere to Turn</I>, assesses Uzbekistan's record on torture, co-operation with the UN agencies and new legislation in preparation. It looks at the effectiveness of current legislation, the complaints mechanism and punishment for perpetrators, the criminal justice system and the actual behaviour of law enforcement and others. The report goes on to provide details of individual cases. These details tally with the reports that we receive in Tashkent from victims, their families and lawyers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and human rights defenders. We therefore share HRW's assessment that despite some positive steps in criminal justice reform, which we welcome, there has been no significant change in the widespread use of torture. Fundamental reform to policies and practices is needed if torture is to be eradicated.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/2">The issue of torture continues to form part of our dialogue on human rights with the Uzbek authorities. During the EU-Uzbekistan Human Rights Dialogue in May 2007, the EU expressed its concern at persistent reports that torture continues to be widespread. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 2006 annual human rights report also details our concerns. We stand ready to assist Uzbekistan to fulfil its obligations under the convention against torture. For example, our embassy in Tashkent funded the participation of an Uzbek human rights NGO at the UN committee against torture session on Uzbekistan. We will also continue to work with the Uzbek authorities towards improved respect for human rights in other areas, for example with the implementation of recent legislation on the abolition of the death penalty and the introduction of habeas corpus.</p>
