	<p pid="a.173.2/1">All fingerprint experts commence their training with a foundation course of four weeks. They then need to complete five modules which should normally be completed within 12 to 18 months and are followed by a short assessment. Twelve months later, after a consolidation of skills and work experience on the job, they attend a two-week advanced course in which the emphasis is on court presentation and preparation of evidence. Even after the advanced course has been passed successfully, which is usually not less than three years after entering the training programme, the person will be permitted to attend court to give expert testimony only with the approval of their head of fingerprint bureau and chief constable.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">In determining whether or not a latent mark or impression left at a crime scene and a fingerprint have been made by the same person, a fingerprint examiner must apply set criteria in carrying out their comparison. The criteria are objective and can be tested and verified by other experts. It is the method which is of universal application by practitioners on behalf of either prosecution or defence, and has been in use from the first application of fingerprint/mark identification. Once the first fingerprint examiner has reached a conclusion that the mark or impression at the crime scene and a fingerprint have been made by the same person, that decision is subject to verification by two other fingerprint experts before the investigating officer is informed of the result. Any identification evidence presented in court will have been subject to these procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2">Instructing solicitors or barristers representing defendants can and regularly do ask that finger identification evidence be subjected to scrutiny by nominated fingerprint experts from outside the Police Service. Details of those experts can be obtained from registers maintained by the Law Society, the Expert Witness Institute or through the services of private companies who undertake independent forensic examinations. This is an external examination of Police Service practice and procedures which has been on going for many years.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.2/1">The Government attach great importance to maintaining the safety and serviceability of the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons. The Strategic Defence Review in 1998 confirmed the need for a robust capability to underwrite the safety and reliability of Trident in the absence of nuclear testing. A scientific methodology is being developed to continue to give this assurance with high confidence. A detailed technical review of the scientific methodology behind this programme will be published shortly in a major scientific journal.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">To ensure that we continue to be confident of the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, it is essential to understand the properties of warhead materials such as high explosive and plutonium under a very wide range of physical conditions and how these properties change with age. Confidence in the safety and performance of Trident is based ultimately on predictions from high fidelity numerical models run on supercomputers. The Atomic Weapons Establishment has recently announced a major investment in a new supercomputer that will substantially upgrade its capability. However, experimental studies are still essential to validate the computational models and improve understanding of basic theory. As a continuing part of this programme the UK will shortly collaborate with the US in conducting a plutonium hydrodynamic experiment at their U1A facility in Nevada. This experiment will not produce nuclear yield and will be fully consistent with our obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Historical nuclear test data and information from the forensic examination of warheads withdrawn from the stockpile provide further information for the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has identified 53,462 UK service personnel who deployed to a state in the Gulf region at some time between <phrase class="date" code="1990-09-01">1 September 1990</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1991-06-30">30 June 1991</phrase>. The precise number who received an anthrax immunisation is not known but it is estimated that over 75 per cent of all UK service personnel deployed to the Gulf at that time are likely to have had one anthrax immunisation and in many units this approached 100 per cent. Uptake of the second anthrax immunisation was less and varied between and within formations. Uptake of the third anthrax immunisation was rare. Our assessment is that none of the UK service personnel deployed was subject to attack by, or exposed to, biological warfare agents, including anthrax, during the Gulf Conflict.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">Immunisation is one part of a package of capabilities which protect our troops and enable them to respond effectively to chemical and biological threats. This package includes detection capabilities, protective clothing and equipment, decontamination procedures, other medical countermeasures and training. The immunisation currently available to protect UK service personnel against exposure to biological warfare agents is a voluntary immunisation programme against anthrax. This is offered to specific units of our Armed Forces on the basis of an assessment of the threat they face, which in turn depends on their deployment and role. Currently the programme includes personnel deployed to the Gulf and in specialist NBC units. We continually review whether it is appropriate to offer immunisation against anthrax to personnel who may be involved in other deployments as part of their wider package of protective measures against chemical or biological attack.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.3/2">The NHS Plan also says there will be electronic booking of appointments for patient treatment by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>. There is no target for 100 per cent electronic booking by 2005, although it is clear that a high level of electronic booking will be essential to meet the NHS Plan targets. The wording in Building the Information Core: Implementing the NHS Plan is intended to reflect this aim, not to create an additional target to those in the NHS Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/3">An outline business case (OBC) for electronic booking systems has been completed. Further business cases will be completed as the project progresses beginning with the procurement business case. The proposed approach to procurement is to use the NHScat&ndash;IT catalogue to list services and products that can be &quot;called off&quot; by local health communities as they implement local transaction broking solutions. Plans are that a catalogue of implementation services will be in place by autumn 2002, with hardware and software products in the catalogue by winter of 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/4">The OBC proposes a framework for implementing electronic booking systems. The framework was developed in consultation with stakeholders. It is based around local health communities, not individual trusts, and will allow them to implement locally based solutions within a consistent common national framework. It builds on the national information and IT infrastructure. The OBC can be found at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/nhsplanbookingsystems/">www.doh.gov.uk/nhsplanbookingsystems/</a>. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/5">Estimated costs are included in the OBC. Funding for 2003&ndash;04 will be mainly included in general allocations. However some funding will be met centrally. The method for issuing funding in future years will be determined in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/6">The proposed framework for electronic booking includes a booking management service component. This is a call centre-based service linked with NHS Direct. It will support patients and healthcare professionals in making, amending and cancelling appointments on a 24-hour, seven days per week basis. This will also provide a convenient and flexible way for patients to book their appointments. Bookings made via a call centre will be booked electronically by the call centre with the relevant provider, using the same sort of computer systems as support direct booking by general practitioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.2/10">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from the take-up of end year flexibility &pound;120,000,000 for health authority allocations as set out in Table 6 of the Public Expenditure 2000&ndash;01 provisional outturn White Paper Cm 5243 published in July 2001; a claim of &pound;30,000,000 on the reserve for variant CJD compensation; an additional &pound;6,267,000 from HM Treasury as a result of technical adjustments following changes in accounting arrangements for some PFI schemes; a net transfer to the National Assembly for Wales of &pound;2,493,000, &pound;3,683,000 for out-of-area treatment costs, dental service increment for teaching, cross border flows and high security psychiatric services, partially offset by a transfer of &pound;1,190,000 for regional re-costing and post-graduate education; transfers from Northern Ireland totalling &pound;2,030,000, &pound;68,000 for post-graduate training, &pound;1,941,000 for out-of-area treatment costs and &pound;21,000 (of which &pound;7,000 administration costs) for contributions to committees and non-departmental public bodies; transfer to the Home Office of &pound;1,569,000, &pound;2,767,000 for drug action teams and match funded social care projects, offset by &pound;1,098,000 for costs arising from the Victoria Climbie inquiry and &pound;100,000 for medium secure units; a net transfer to the Department for Education and Skills of &pound;613,000, comprising &pound;750,000 for the National Institute of Psychiatry and &pound;100,000 for a learning and development website package, offset by a transfer of &pound;237,000 for the costs of Protection of Children Act tribunal and Care Standards tribunal; transfer to the Lord Chancellor's Department of &pound;164,000, (of which &pound;123,000 administration costs) for Care Standards tribunals and Family Health Services Appeals Authority recruitment; a transfer to the Department for Work and Pensions of &pound;1,095,000 for the road traffic accidents work of the Compensation Recovery Unit; a transfer from the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions of &pound;80,000,000 for building care capacity offset by &pound;1,000,000, for the Rough Sleepers' Unit.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.5/1">The reports will be published today. Both reports emphasise how rare this accident was and responses to the risks of a similar accident must be measured. The reports of the two groups contain 19 separate recommendations. We have accepted all of them and, in one case, have asked the Highways Agency to adopt the recommended approach more widely and, in another, have asked for the recommended work to be expedited. I must stress how important it is that highway authorities and rail infrastructure providers work together to assess the sites on their networks where vehicles might get on to the rail network and to take what action, if any, they consider necessary to try to prevent this. We commend to them the risk assessment framework prepared by the CSS and Railtrack to prioritise any necessary work at local roads over rail bridges. This framework will be developed to cover other circumstances where vehicles might get on to the rail network.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.5/2">We accept the conclusion of the Highways Agency report that there are no serious shortcomings in the current standards for safety barriers, but nevertheless commend its plans to convene a technical project board to take forward any necessary changes to barrier standards for national roads. We welcome the recommendation of the working group for a clearer and more open procedure for updating the standards relating to safety barriers and have asked the agency to adopt this more open approach for all standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.5/3">We have asked that the HSC's recommended timetable for the development of a protocol to apportion responsibility and costs of improvements made at locations where roads meet, cross or run close to railways should be expedited. This is so as not to delay the carrying out of any necessary work. We have, therefore, decided that the protocol should be developed for England by June 2002. We will review the working of this protocol, as recommended by the HSC, once action on the other recommendations is underway. The work necessary to implement the 19 recommendations of the two reports will be steered by the department and we have asked for a report on progress by <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-25">25 July 2002</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is the foremost international forum for all aviation issues. Environmental issues are considered by ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP). My department is represented on CAEP and most of its six current working groups. These are looking at ways of limiting noise and gaseous emissions from aircraft by better design and better operating procedures matters, and at ways of incentivising the industry to limit emissions and/or accelerate the introduction of cleaner aircraft by market-based options, such as emissions permit trading, environmental charges and voluntary agreements, for reducing emissions from aviation.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.5/1">Research on aircraft emissions has been commissioned by several government departments since the early 1990s in support of the UK's call for tougher action within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and International Civil Aviation Organisation. Currently the Government are supporting a number of national projects and UK participation in collaborative international research aimed at understanding and mitigating the effects of aircraft emissions upon the atmosphere and local air quality. These research projects are intended to explore technology options for low emissions combustion; increase understanding of the nature and extent of particle formation in jet engine combustion; narrow the uncertainty regarding the impact of aviation on climate change; examine the possible trade-offs between different pollutants that would arise from potential measures to reduce emissions; contribute to the development of an EU database of global aircraft emissions; establish the feasibility of using carbon isotopes to identify the source of unburned hydrocarbon deposits; and examine the relationship between certificated noise and emissions performance and operational practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/2">Research by the UK aviation industry with government support into the possible scope for biofuels as an alternative to kerosene is also currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/3">In addition, two further programmes of research are relevant. One is assessing the impact of climate change on the Upper Troposphere Lower Stratosphere (UTLS). This programme is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and managed by Cambridge University. Some projects in this programme are also concerned with better understanding the potential impact of aviation on the upper atmosphere. The other is the Civil Aviation Research and Demonstration programme (CARAD) which is funded and managed by DTI. Some projects in this programme are concerned with reducing emissions by improved combustion technology.</p>

London Underground has conducted such a competition for the Tube modernisation contracts.

	<p pid="a.200.9/2">The amendment to Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act in October 1998 was brought in to halt the policy of forcing schools to sell off playing fields. Local authorities and state schools now need to ask consent for the sale of school playing fields from my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (DfES). In making her decision my right honourable friend will take into account a number of criteria, including consultation with the community and user groups, whether the proceeds will be used for education or used to enhance sports provision and whether the remaining playing fields fully meet the needs of local schools and the communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.9/3">My right honourable friend gave approval for: six applications to dispose of or change the use of 109,345 square metres of school playing fields in England in 1998; 37 applications to dispose of or change the use of 540,300 square metres in 1999; 28 applications to dispose of or change the use of 351,394 square metres in 2000; 27 applications to dispose of or change the use of 401,705 square metres in 2001; and five applications to dispose of or change the use of 90,500 square metres in 2001. Of these approved applications, over one-third were in respect of sports pitches at closed or closing schools.
