	<p pid="a.197.2/1">The non-European Union member states of the European Economic Area are affected indirectly by decisions of the Commission that are EEA-relevant. As soon as a relevant EC legal act has been formally adopted on the EU side, the EEA Joint Committee takes a decision concerning whether an appropriate amendment to the EEA Agreement is required &quot;with a view to permitting a simultaneous application&quot; of legislation in the EU and the EEA EFTA States (Art 102(1) EEA). The EEA EFTA states can negotiate adaptations to Community legislation when this is called for by special circumstances and agreed on by both sides.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">Decisions of the ECJ do not have direct effect in the non-European Union member states of the European Economic Area. However, the EFTA court must take into account relevant case law of the ECJ in interpreting the EEA agreement. The EFTA court deals with infringement actions brought by the EFTA Surveillance Authority against an EFTA state with regard to the implementation, application or interpretation of an EEA rule, and with the settlement of disputes between two or more EFTA states.</p>

We also raise religious freedom with the Chinese during our biannual UK/China Human Rights Dialogue, the latest round of which was held in London in May.

The remainder is being spent on future enhancements to the portal, including delivery through other media; development of the JourneyWeb protocol (that allows different systems to communicate with each other); development of internationally recognised technical standards; further development of real-time information; publicity and marketing.
