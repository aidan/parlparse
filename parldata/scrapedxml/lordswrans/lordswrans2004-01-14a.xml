	<p pid="a.87.5/1">Substantial progress has been made on implementing the recommendations. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) expects to commence its full environment field survey in Iraq&mdash;of which depleted uranium (DU) is a part&mdash;in spring 2004. However, this will depend on the local security situation. The Department for International Development (DFID) has, in principle, agreed to part-fund this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/2">In support of the UNEP survey, the Ministry of Defence has provided UNEP with details of UK DU target locations and has offered to provide advice on carrying out risk assessments on DU within urban areas and on long-term monitoring of the DU in the environment, including water. In June 2003, MoD scientists completed a preliminary technical assessment of a number of Iraqi tanks thought to have been struck by DU rounds. These tanks have been clearly marked pending further detailed examination by an MoD scientific team when the security situation allows. Preliminary findings indicate very low levels of DU in the vicinity of the tanks. The MoD is sharing the information obtained on these tanks with UNEP as well as the Royal Society.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/3">All surface-lying DU fragments are being removed from the battlefield as they are discovered. Iraqi locals have been warned by signs and leaflets that they should not go near or touch any debris they find on the battlefield. All UK Armed Forces personnel are being offered a test for total uranium in their urine followed up by an isotope test if this gives anomalous results, to determine whether the uranium is depleted. Personnel who are identified as being most likely to have received high level exposure to DU are being offered both tests from the outset. jenny</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">Continence services play an important role in the health and education of children affected by problems of incontinence. Good Practice in Continence Services, issued by the Department of Health in April 2000, provides guidance to primary care trusts (PCTs) on continence services. This includes the advice that PCTs should have specialist continence services in place, which provide patients with an individual assessment of their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">It is estimated that 10 per cent of five to 15 year-olds have a mental health disorder. Among children with a mental health disorder, an estimated 5 per cent suffer from enuresis as a physical complaint and 1 per cent from soiling. The department does not collect data on continence problems in children with learning disabilities, in care, or children with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.5/1">There has been no occurrence of marburg, tularemia or plague as biological weapons and therefore the characteristics of the agents as naturally occurring infections are given in the answer as follows. Marburg Marburg virus disease does not occur naturally in the United Kingdom. Symptoms include headaches, fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, haemorrhaging, conjunctivitis, sensitivity to light (photophobia), skin rash and jaundice. The incubation period is five to seven days and method of spread is via direct contact with infected bodily secretions, organs or blood of a person or animal. Samples from patients are submitted for laboratory testing (virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). There is no specific treatment and prevention relies on the isolation of infected individuals and animals to prevent transmission. The fatality rate is about 25 per cent. Tularemia Tularemia does not occur in the UK. There are two groups of symptoms which depend upon the route of infection. If infection is by the inhalation route, the symptoms are characterised by sudden onset of chills, fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of body fluids. If infection is via the skin, this is characterised by deep ulcers on the skin with swelling of regional lymph nodes. The incubation period is one to 21 days. Method of spread is via blood or tissue of infected animals or bites of infected deer flies, mosquitoes or ticks. Less commonly infection can result from inhalation of contaminated dust or ingestion of contaminated food or water. Samples from patients are submitted for laboratory testing (microbiology, serology and PCR). Antibiotics such as streptomycin or gentamicin are effective in treating tularemia. There is a vaccine for the disease (produced in the United States and not licensed) but it does not appear to protect against the airborne form of the disease. There are two forms of the organism&mdash;type A which causes more serious disease in humans, and type B. If untreated, the mortality rate of type A infections ranges from 4 per cent for the skin form, to 30 to 60 per cent for the inhalation form of the disease. Plague Plague does not occur naturally in the UK. There are two forms of plague which depend upon the route of infection&mdash;bubonic plague and pneumonic plague. Both types are associated with high fever, headache, general aches, extreme weakness, glandular swelling and pneumonia. The incubation period is two to six days for bubonic plague and one to six days for pneumonic plague. The bubonic form is spread from rodents to humans by the bite of an infected flea. The pneumonic form is spread by inhalation of the organism. Samples from patients are submitted for laboratory testing (microbiology and PCR). Antibiotics such as streptomycin, doxycycline, gentamycin and ciprofloxacin are effective in treating disease. No vaccine is available and prevention is primarily via control of the rodent population. If untreated, both forms of plague are usually fatal.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/24">The financial model used assumes: (i) that the athletes' village is based at Mill Meads and (ii) a main stadium with a football legacy. The financial model includes all attributable costs and revenues covering: the bid, staging, construction and infrastructure, land assembly and elite sports funding. The figures in the table are forecast to outturn figures (assuming an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent pa) and are rounded to the nearest million pounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/25">Arup's work was used to inform the Government's own detailed analysis of the costs and risks associated with a London Olympic Games, which was based on a critical appraisal of risk and contingency, probability analysis and benchmarking past games. This work led to the development of a public sector funding package of &pound;2.375 billion, which bridges the &pound;1.1 billion gap between expenditure and income identified by Arup and provides further contingency to cater for foreseeable risks in staging the games.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/26">The Arup model includes total figures of &pound;399 million and &pound;491 million for land assembly and land disposal respectively. These activities account for much of the income and expenditure in 2004 and 2005. Under the memorandum of understanding between the Government and the Mayor governing Olympic funding, the London Development Agency (LDA) will meet the costs of the required land assembly during the bid period and beyond. Income from the sale of this land will be at the disposal of the LDA. During the bid period the LDA will only acquire land which could be used for regeneration purposes should the bid not be successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2" qnum="HL675">Whether they are able to trace recent purchasers of plants susceptible to phytophthora ramorum from nurseries that have been found to be infected; and to what extent they undertake this.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-01-14a.92.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="92"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040114/text/40114w03.htm#40114w03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.92.3/1">Emergency measures put in place in May 2002 required the notification of any movement of rhododendrons and viburnums, the two types of plant which in Europe have been most often found to be infected. These were superseded in November 2002 by EU-wide measures to ensure that consignments of these plants intended for trade are accompanied by a plant passport. This passport will identify the registered producer from whom any infected material originates. The registered producer is under an obligation to keep records of consignments despatched. Host material purchased by the premises where infection is found can therefore be traced back to the original supplier and an inspection of those premises takes place. Similarly, all commercial premises to whom infected material has been distributed will be inspected. This would include any material sold on for general landscape purposes where the buyer is known.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/2">Clearly tracing of plants sold on to the general public is more problematic. Buyers of host species have been advised to check plants before purchase for symptoms of the disease and to contact their garden centres if these subsequently develop. Any confirmed findings will then be subject to the tracing procedures outlined above. A number of initiatives have also been instigated to raise public awareness including a poster and information sheet which is available on Defra's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/graphics/sod.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/planth/graphics/sod.pdf</a>. Copies have also been placed in the Library of the House. jenny</p>

	<p pid="a.92.5/2" qnum="HL676">Further to the answer by the Lord Whitty on 6 January which indicates that the number of nurseries with material infected by phytophthora ramorum has doubled since the Written Answer by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 12 February 2003 (HC Deb, col. 852&ndash;3W), whether they would consider issuing for the reassurance of the public certificates of freedom from the disease to nurseries that have had no evidence of infection.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.0/1">Plant passports must be attached to all rhododendrons and viburnums going to retailers or landscapers. Authorisation to issue plant passports is given to nurseries which have been officially inspected and at which either no symptoms of P ramorum have been seen, or plants found to be infected, and those in a surrounding cordon sanitaire, have been immediately destroyed under official supervision. Nurseries are free to publicise their authorisation if they wish, to provide an assurance of their disease-free status. As indicated in my answer to Lord Greaves in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-06">6 January</phrase>, action at sites where there is persistent infection will in future include notification of those responsible for adjoining land. Further consideration is being given to the appropriate balance between the need for transparency and the need to avoid a disproportionate reaction to isolated findings which have been swiftly eliminated. A map of outbreaks is already maintained on Defra's website and is available at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/graphics/sod.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/planth/graphics/sod.pdf</a>.
