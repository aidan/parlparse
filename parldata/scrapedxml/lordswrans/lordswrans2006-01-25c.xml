	<p pid="c.169.8/1">Document COM (2005) 172 has nothing to do with giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights legal force, or anticipating implementation of the treaty. It simply sets out improvements to internal Commission procedures, which the Commission has been implementing since 2001, to ensure that, when it proposes legislation to the Council, that legislation respects the rights and principles set out in the charter. Given that all the member states are politically committed to the charter, it is a useful part of the Commission's impact assessment and enables the Council to make better informed legislative decisions. This is something that the Government welcome.</p>

The Home Office works with the International Organisation for Migration to facilitate voluntary returns of failed asylum seekers. Where an individual does not return voluntarily, removal may be enforced. Returns of failed asylum seekers are considered on an individual basis, and the circumstances in the country are taken fully into account. We would not remove anyone if there were reasons under the European Convention on Human Rights for allowing them to stay.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.2/1">The Government work closely with the European Union in all areas of proliferation, including on areas falling under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

	<p pid="c.185.2/2">The UK, along with France, Germany and the Office of the EU High Representative, have undertaken negotiations with Iran for the past two years with regard to the latter's obligations under the NPT. It has always been our intention to find a negotiated settlement to this issue which is consistent with the verification mechanisms of the NPT. We regret that the Iranians have chosen to take the decision to restart research and development activities related to uranium enrichment, which amounts to yet another breach of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.2/3">The US-India Joint Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase> indicated India's willingness to separate its civilian and military facilities, and place the former under IAEA safeguards. We welcome the initiative, which offers the prospect of a significant gain for non-proliferation, and would extend the IAEA's monitoring framework within India, where there are already some sites under IAEA safeguards. We are discussing the detail of the US-India initiative with EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.2/4">Although not party to the NPT, Israel has a safeguards agreement with the IAEA which gives the IAEA access to certain nuclear sites for monitoring.</p>

	<p pid="c.187.8/1">The Act has resulted in a clearer focus on race equality among a wide range of public authorities and sectors. There has been a particular benefit from the requirement which is placed on such authorities to prepare a race equality scheme setting out a three-year vision for their work on race equality. Such schemes provide a clear measure against which the public and the Commission for Racial Equality can hold these organisations to account. There is evidence also that the requirement to carry out race equality impact assessments is having a significant effect on the way in which policy is developed across a number of sectors and is ensuring that race equality considerations are addressed at an earlier stage, are built into policy development and are better monitored after implementation. Specific examples of these benefits are set out in the Commission's 2004 annual report.</p>
