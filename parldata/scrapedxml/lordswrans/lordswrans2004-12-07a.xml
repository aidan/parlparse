	Metric Units of Measurement

	<p pid="a.31.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/2" qnum="HL158">Why the Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 provide that delivery drivers and their passengers are exempt &quot;while on a journey which does not exceed 50 metres&quot; when it is required that imperial measurements be officially used in all matters relating to vehicle traffic on public highways.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.2/1">The EU requirements for harmonisation of units of measurement are set out in Council Directive 80/181/EEC as amended. The directive requires member states to adopt metric units as the primary system of measurement for economic, public health, public safety or administrative purposes (including the making of legislation). Amendments made by Directive 89/617/EEC provide for the continuation in use for specific purposes of certain units, which for the UK include the mile and yard in the context of road traffic signs, until a date to be fixed by the member state concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/2">The Government's guidance issued by the Department for Trade and Industry in 1995 for public sector bodies advises the use of metric units for the conduct of all public sector business, except where the continuation in use of imperial units is specifically permitted. Distances in government publications and statutory instruments other than those relating to road traffic signs are generally expressed in metric units.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/3">The draft Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 therefore use metric units of measurement.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="1998-10-01">1 October 1998</phrase> to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields that occurred in the 1980s and early to mid 1990s. Earlier this year, on <phrase class="date" code="">27 August</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced his intention to tighten up the criteria against which applications for consent to dispose of school playing fields are assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2">The assessment criteria have been strengthened so that:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/3" class="indent">the sale of a playing field is an absolute last resort with local authorities having to demonstrate that they have exhausted all other sources of funding;</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/4" class="indent">sale proceeds must be used to improve outdoor sports facilities wherever possible, so that local authorities will have to provide first class outdoor facilities before introducing new indoor sports facilities; and</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/5" class="indent">new sports facilities must be sustainable for at least 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/6">Following consultation with the independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel, the new guidance was published on <phrase class="date" code="">8 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/7">We want to reduce the number of cars on the school run and are keen that schools, parents and local authorities do what they can do to improve the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/8">This Government are providing over &pound;50 million this year and next to help support the development of school travel plans. These plans help to identify specific measures which could reduce the number of car journeys. They also promote and encourage more walking and cycling to school or the use of public transport for longer trips. If enacted as drafted, the School Transport Bill would require pilot authorities to consider the travel needs of all pupils and could result in improved walking and cycling infrastructure around schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.2/2">The &quot;Chairs' Group&quot; will not be involved in the review as it is concerned with the close working of organisations concerned with the creation of the new integrated agency, namely, the chairs of the Countryside Agency, English Nature, Forestry Commission and the Environment Agency and Defra's Director General&mdash;Operations &amp; Service Delivery, together with a senior Defra official representing the Rural Development Service. However, the chairs of the levy boards will be consulted on the terms of reference for the review. Thereafter, it will be for the reviewer to invite views from stakeholders: and these stakeholders will certainly include the chairs of the levy bodies themselves. The weight given to those views will be a matter for the reviewer to consider.</p>
