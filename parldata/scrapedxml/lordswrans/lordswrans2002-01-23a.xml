	<p pid="a.205.2/1">The Speaking up for Justice report on vulnerable or intimidated witnesses in the criminal justice system published in 1998 proposed a range of special measures available for use at the trial including: video-recorded statements to replace the evidence-in-chief; video-recorded pre-trial cross-examination; live TV links; screens around the witnesses box so that the witness does not need to face the defendant in court; removal of wigs and gowns; assistance with communication if necessary, including the use of an intermediary; and power for the judge to clear the public gallery in cases involving sexual offences or intimidation so the witness can give evidence in private.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">The measures requiring legislation were included in Part II of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/3">Implementation of the special measures will be phased as we have an opportunity to see how they are working.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/4">The implementation in the Crown Court will take place six months from today to allow a lead-in for the agencies to conduct training and preparation. All the special measures will be implemented for vulnerable witnesses, with the exception of intermediaries and pre-trial cross-examination, which will be subject to pilot projects. The same measures, with the added exception of video-recorded statements, will be implemented at the same time for intimidated witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/5">All other measures will be introduced in 2003&ndash;04 for all qualifying witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/6">In magistrates' courts implementation of special measures in July 2002 will be restricted to TV links and video recorded evidence for child witnesses in cases involving sexual offences, violence (including threats) and cruelty. This would provide protection for children in cases involving assaults, muggings and domestic violence. It would also bring the adult magistrates' courts into line with the current provision in the youth court.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/7">Most of the measures will be extended to magistrates' courts by 2003&ndash;04 (after their evaluation in the Crown Court) to bring them in line with the Crown Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/8">A whole range of guidance and training materials for the criminal justice agencies are being published tomorrow including:</p>

In addition, expert evaluation has concluded that the potential for more severe melting of land-based ice which could cause a significantly greater rise in sea level is very remote over the next century.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.8/1">In making their planting decisions farmers will take account of a range of factors relevant to the particular circumstances applying on their farms. However, the decrease in the production of oilseeds in 2000 and 2001 is partly explained by the reduction in the specific aid rate payable for oilseeds under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS). As a consequence of the changes agreed in Agenda 2000, the aid rate for oilseeds will be equalised with that for cereals from the 2002 harvest, thus making planting decisions more market driven and less responsive to the level of subsidy available under the AAPS. In addition, poor conditions in the 2000&ndash;01 season have resulted in much lower oilseed yields in 2001, even though the planted area was higher than in 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">A wide-ranging review of the weighted capitation formula used to allocate resources to health authorities and primary care trusts is currently taking place.

	<p pid="a.213.3/1">The National Insurance Scheme is financed on the pay-as-you-go principle, with current rates of national insurance contributions set to produce the income needed to meet current expenditure on benefits and the costs of administration, as well as maintaining a reasonable working balance in the fund. In addition a Treasury grant from the Consolidated Fund can be used to supplement revenue from contributions and investment income. The cost of the basic state pension is therefore met in full by national insurance funds.</p>
