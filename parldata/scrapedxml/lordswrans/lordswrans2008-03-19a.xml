	<p pid="a.43.0/1">As with all IT systems, an ongoing programme of upgrades ensures that, in addition to any remedial work, changes to the operating model are fully supported by the agency's computer system. The problems with the agency's IT have been well rehearsed, and since March 2005 the agency has successfully introduced eight IT upgrades, which primarily rectified many of the much publicised defects in the system as well as introducing enhancements to improve client service.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.0/2">For the next IT upgrade, the agency chose Easter 2008 as the planning date for implementation, with a clear commitment to its people that the upgrade would not be released until such time as the agency was ready to introduce the changes and the organisation was sufficiently prepared to take full advantage of the benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.0/3">The agency has made good progress in preparing for this upgrade. The development phase is now complete and testing is well advanced. However, being mindful of history, it has decided to undertake another round of testing and to further look at its approach to training to give the sort of assurance we all want that both the IT application and the agency are ready to go live. Following this further testing, the agency will agree a new date for the implementation of the upgrade.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.0/4">It is important to remember that this upgrade is primarily designed to support new ways of working already in place within the agency. These changes have already delivered substantial improvements to the service that the agency provides. Client service is better than it has ever been: the agency is collecting and arranging more maintenance, continuing to reduce the number of uncleared applications and dealing with new cases more quickly than before.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.0/5">Future IT upgrades are planned to support the repeal of Section 6 and the introduction of the information and support service as well as the launch of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission. In addition, the agency is planning a range of enhancements to the current system to support a continuation in improvements in the performance of the agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.0/6">The different elements in these planned upgrades are under constant review and will not be finalised until the agency is in a position to announce the implementation date.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">The Child Support Agency's operational improvement plan, announced in February 2006, sets out the performance improvement expected across all aspects of the agency's operations by March 2009.</p>

The agency now clears more applications than it receives per month and uncleared new scheme applications are at their lowest since October 2003. Over half of all new applications are now cleared within six weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/3">However, the real test is the difference made for children by collecting or arranging maintenance.

	<p pid="a.44.5/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's (HFEA) decision, based on the available evidence, is that outgrowing embryos have ceased to be human embryos. This conclusion was reached in part because an outgrown &quot;embryo&quot; no longer has the organisational structure of a viable embryo, including signs representative of primitive streak formation, and there is no longer a relationship between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass. The embryo outgrowth is therefore not considered an embryo by the HFEA as it is potential-less and would not be able to develop if implanted in a woman.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.5/1">Yes, the Minister of State for Employment and Welfare Reform has recently approved 21 closures in Devon, Cornwall, Dorset and Somerset and four in Cumbria, all of which have been subject to extensive local consultation. In addition, the Minister of State has recently agreed that local consultation can commence on the proposed closure of seven Jobcentre Plus offices in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.5/2">Since its inception, Jobcentre Plus has continued to refocus and transform the way in which it delivers its services. It now provides access to a wide range of services by telephone through benefit delivery and contact centres and provides face-to-face access for customers through a network of modernised jobcentres.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.5/3">These major transformation programmes have improved the quality and breadth of customer service as well as the environment in which it is delivered. They have enabled customers to access many services from the comfort of their own home and at a time convenient to them through the telephone or the internet. This has meant that jobcentres can focus more on working with those people who need more support to move into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.5/4">The changes have resulted in a reduction of the number of jobcentres across England and Wales because some sites were no longer required. All closures have been subject to consultation locally and arrangements have been put in place to maintain provision of the service. Any further closures in other parts of the country would follow a similar consultation and approvals process.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.8/12">All prisoners recalled under the provisions of Section 32(2) have their cases referred to the Parole Board under the provisions of Section 32(4)(b). We do not hold reliable central data relating to the number of referrals to the Parole Board in respect of prisoners recalled under Section 32(1) and Section 32(2) who subsequently make representations pursuant to Section 32(4)(a); to provide such information would require a manual trawl of individual case files and this would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
