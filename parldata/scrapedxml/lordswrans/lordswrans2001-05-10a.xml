	<p pid="a.221.2/1">I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that 72 police officers were deployed to RAF Northolt for the arrival and arrest of Mr Ronnie Biggs. Six of these officers were directly involved in making the arrest and 66 officers were deployed as a response to Ministry of Defence concerns about the security of RAF Northolt being breached by the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/2">It was a matter for the Commissioner and the Divisional Commander for the London Borough of Hillingdon, where RAF Northolt is located, to determine the operational response in the light of available information and intelligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/3">I am told that it is not possible for the Metropolitan Police Service to identify the total cost of the operation as it was undertaken as part of the normal duties for the officers involved. I am, however, informed that the additional costs, mostly overtime, were &pound;12,871.</p>

Deb., col. 1950), whether they believe that manslaughter, attempted murder, wounding and grievous bodily harm are not serious offences; and, if not, what the Home Secretary meant when he said (H.C.

	<p pid="a.221.5/1">No prisoner sentenced to four years or more imprisonment can be released on the home detention curfew (HDC) scheme. The offences referred to by the noble Lord attract a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. That means that the seriousness of any such offence committed by a prisoner released on HDC must, in the judgment of the courts, be at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness. Under the legislation, violent and sex offenders serving an extended sentence (one that will involve extended supervision) are not eligible for HDC, nor are prisoners who are required to register as sex offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.2/1">The key performance indicators (KPI) results for 2000-01 for the Prison Service are given in the table. The data are provisional and subject to final validation.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/2">The results are extremely encouraging. The improvement in security is impressive, especially the reduction in escapes from prison establishments. There were 11 last year, compared with 30 in 1999-2000 and 232 as recently as 1992-93. The downward trend on drug-misuse has continued and performance is well ahead of the public service agreement (PSA) target. The level of drug abuse has fallen by 49 per cent since 1996-97. The service met the overall target for the number of prisoners completing accredited offending behaviour programmes and increased the overall number of completions by 30 per cent on the previous year and by more than 93 per cent on the number achieved in 1998-99. The purposeful activity target would have been met but for a sharp rise in the prisoner population since December, and we believe could have been met despite the increase in population had governors not responded to encouragement to concentrate investment in education and offending behaviour courses which provide high quality activity but for small numbers of prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/3">The Director General of the Prison Service has introduced new arrangements for dealing with the high level of staff sickness in the service and, although the basic skills targets were not met, it is very encouraging to note that prisoners achieved more than 50,000 separate certificates last year, 12,500 of them at basic skills level 2.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.2/1">We can confirm that the food security situation in Nyunzu, Kantanga, has been difficult. The town has been isolated as a result of fighting in the surrounding area, and many of its inhabitants have been prevented from cultivating their fields since last year. Her Majesty's Government have been helping the population of Nyunzu via a &pound;1.5 million contribution to the 2001 appeal of the Red Cross, which has been distributing food in Nyunzu since <phrase class="date" code="">19 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/2">We share the concern about the conflict in the DRC and the appalling impact it has had on the Congolese population. In the financial year 2000-2001, we provided &pound;3.3 million for humanitarian assistance in the DRC which was delivered via a number of established humanitarian agencies and included action in health, nutrition and food security, water and sanitation, protection of prisoners, family tracing, human rights, support to vulnerable urban populations and refugees and work with child ex-combatants. Decisions about where assistance is focused are made on the basis of where needs are greatest, rather than whether or not the area in question is under government control.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/3">In addition, this year the European Community Humanitarian Office is providing 35 million euros of humanitarian assistance to the DRC, of which the UK's contribution will be approximately &pound;4.2 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.2/1">The UK provides assistance to Palestinian refugees in Lebanon primarily through its voluntary contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's (UNRWA) general fund, a share of which is devoted to maintaining 12 camps in Lebanon and in providing health and education services to the refugees. UNRWA also supports similar programmes in Syria, Jordan and the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The UK is a major contributor to the general fund, providing &pound;12,607 million in 1999-2000 and &pound;9,650 million in 2000-01.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/2">In addition, funds are made available through DfID's Small Grants Scheme. These amounted to &pound;34,553 in 1999-2000 and &pound;48,150 in 2000-01. In the past three years, 10 different projects, including vocational training, strengthening of the health sector and support to disabled youth oriented programmes, have been supported.</p>

A summary of our analysis will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The analysis shows that none of the Caribbean's sugar industries is expected to suffer a significant deterioration in its financial performance due to EBA. For bananas the impact will be negligible, and for rice the transition arrangements under EBA will mean that changes in market forces will be phased in gradually and the overall impact will not be very great.</p>

The review has recommended that Forest Enterprise should retain its status as an executive agency of the Forestry Commission. Ministers in the UK Government, the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales have accepted these conclusions and recommendations. They intend to review the options for further decentralising the handling of forestry policy and management in the light of continuing experience of the devolved structure.
