	<p pid="a.36.5/1">The commitment of the United Kingdom to helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild their country is well established. We are already extensively engaged in a range of activities from security to reconstruction to humanitarian aid. In conjunction with our international partners and the Afghan Transitional Authority (ATA), progress has already been substantial, particularly in Kabul.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/2">Looking to build upon that progress, as my right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Mr Ingram) informed the House, in another place, in answer to a Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="">9 April</phrase> (Official Report, Commons, col. 296W) from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1203" name="Joan Ruddock">my honourable friend the Member for Lewisham Deptford (Ms Ruddock)</phrase>, we have been interested in leading a provincial reconstruction team (PRT) and were conducting the necessary preparatory planning work. We have had wide-ranging discussions with the ATA, the United Nations, regional leaders and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). As a result of these talks and planning, we have decided to participate in the coalition's deployment of PRTs. The role of these teams is to aid the extension of the ATA's capacity, the development of a stable and secure environment in the Afghan regions and to stimulate security sector reform and reconstruction. Overall, there are expected to be eight such teams. From July 2003, the United Kingdom will lead the PRT in Mazar-e Sharif and the five surrounding provinces.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/3">The UK PRT will initially be military-led and deploy for up to two years. It will initially comprise some 50 troops who will liaise with Afghan military forces in the region and provide the team's support and protection. The PRT will include civilian staff from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development (DfID) who will be responsible for providing political and development advice respectively. DfID will also provide funding for the PRT to support appropriate development programmes in close connection with the central and local Afghan authorities. We have invited the ATA to provide a representative to work with the PRT, which will also employ directly a small number of local staff. By encouraging and facilitating dialogue between all the polictial groups and militias around Mazar-e Sharif, the team will contribute towards the Afghans themselves creating a safer and more stable environment. We therefore anticipate the structure of the PRT may change over time and we shall in any event be seeking to include personnel from other members of the coalition as soon as is practicable. In the future, we may also look to contribute British personnel to PRTs in other regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/4">The PRTs are not a part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Kabul. Our decision to lead the Mazar-e Sharif PRT is additional to our commitment to the ISAF. We shall retain our current ISAF commitment for the duration of the joint German&mdash;Dutch leadership of the force. We expect to remain a significant troop contributor when a NATO headquarters is deployed in August 2003 as part of the alliance's package of measures to enhance its support to the ISAF.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">In England we are taking a number of steps through the Sexual Health and HIV Strategy and the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy to reduce the rate of unintended pregnancy, which should lead to a reduction in the number of abortions. We are working to improve access to contraceptive services and the range of methods of contraception that are available; for example, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is preparing clinical guidelines for the National Health Service on the effective and appropriate use of long-acting reversible contraception. We are also working with the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) to improve sex and relationships education (SRE). The DfES has issued guidance on SRE against which schools are required to develop their policies and the delivery of SRE is now covered within Ofsted inspections.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">In November 2002 we launched the &quot;Sex Lottery&quot; campaign with an investment of &pound;4 million over two years. The campaign is aimed at 18 to 30 year-olds, and promotes messages around safer sex and the use of condoms. Although the campaign focuses on the prevention of infection, condoms when used correctly are highly effective in preventing pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/3">Policy on sexual health including reducing unintended pregnancies is devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. The Abortion Act 1967, as amended, does not apply to Northern Ireland where it is not legal to carry out a therapeutic termination of pregnancy, other than to save the life of the mother or to prevent serious damage to her physical or mental health.</p>

These NHS trusts will now enter the preparatory stage for NHS foundation trust status. The applicant NHS trusts must satisfy the requirements of the preparatory phase, outlined in The Guide to NHS Foundation Trusts, and must retain three stars in the performance ratings to be published in the summer before they can be approved to become NHS foundation trusts. The objective of the full application process is to help applicants to prepare for NHS foundation trust status, check whether the applicant's vision to utilise the freedoms of NHS foundation trust status is consistent with the aims of the policy, and to test the organisation's readiness.</p>
