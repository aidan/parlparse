	<p pid="a.78.2/1">The United Kingdom is a world leader in stem cell research. This is largely due to the fact that we have legislative regulation which is internationally recognised as supportive, flexible and facilitating. Current legislation and regulation are both in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (paragraph 11) and paragraphs 8.3 and 10.3 of the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Proposals for changes to legislative regulation contained in the recently published Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill will ensure this remains the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.0/1">The main recommendation of the National Research Council's (NRC) committee on fluoride in drinking water that the Environmental Protection Agency's maximum fluoride level of 4 parts per million (ppm) should be lowered is not relevant to the United Kingdom where the maximum concentration permitted is 1.5 ppm. The findings of the NRC report are consistent with our view that water is safe and healthy at the levels used for water fluoridation. However, the committee's report includes a wide-ranging review of the effects of fluoride with a number of recommendations for further research, which are informing the development of our research programme. While we remain of the view that the only risk to infants and young children from their higher exposure to fluoride is the cosmetic effects of dental fluorosis, we will ensure that research and monitoring of the effects of water fluoridation on systematic health is sensitive to any unique effects on this age group.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.5/1">There are no fully reliable or up-to-date figures on child malnutrition in Iraq. The latest joint UNICEF-Government of Iraq multiple indicator cluster survey was published in March 2007. It reported a fall in malnutrition rates since 2000. The proportion of children who were too thin for their age had fallen from 5.9 per cent in 2000 to 4.8 per cent in 2006. The proportion of children too short for their age or underweight had fallen from 22.1 per cent to 21.4 per cent and 15.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/2">The Government of Iraq have primary responsibility for ensuring the welfare of their own citizens, including children. However, the UN, led by UNICEF, continues to support the Iraqi Government to improve nutrition rates through infant feeding campaigns, the provision of medical supplies and other support. DfID is supporting humanitarian agencies providing emergency relief, including food assistance, to children and other vulnerable groups. Since 2003, DfID has committed over &pound;130 million in humanitarian assistance, of which &pound;15 million has been for this year alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.0/1">The Highways Agency does not have flat-rate costs for motorway closures. Instead, a cost must be determined on a case-by-case basis, as it is highly dependent on factors local to the individual stretches of motorway, including duration and time of closure. Such a cost would be in the order of &pound;5,000 to &pound;10,000 per lane per hour and is made up of two parts; the actual cost of the traffic management measures deployed, and the delay and changes in vehicle-operating costs to road users.</p>
