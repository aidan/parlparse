	<p pid="a.213.2/1">The Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir John Beddington, with input from the shadow Nuclear Centre of Excellence and others, recently co-ordinated an assessment of the prospects for research into advanced thorium reactors. This is available upon request from the Government Office for Science. Additionally, the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) undertook a recent, independent assessment, in which it assessed a number of claims made by proponents of thorium fuel. The report can be found at: <a href="http://www.nnl.co.uk/positionpapers">www.nnl.co.uk/positionpapers</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/2">Both reports suggest that the thorium fuel cycle has a number of potential advantages in reducing the cost and radiotoxicity of nuclear power generation, if used in current reactor designs and without full fuel reprocessing. However, both say that the realistic benefits are likely to be too marginal to justify investment in developing thorium technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/3">If a full thorium fuel breeding and recycling operation were to be used, the NNL believes that a substantial reduction in radiotoxicity would be achieved and that this might provide a significant enough incentive in the long term to justify the investment. However, both reports warn that a full thorium cycle reprocessing regime has never been developed on an industrial scale, and that the challenges of doing so present significant technical and commercial barriers.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/4">The Secretary of State has also asked the NNL to investigate the wider benefits of next generation reactor designs and to compare the use of thorium and uranium fuels in them. Results should be available by the summer of 2011 and will include an assessment of these systems' radiotoxicological safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.8/1">Her Majesty's Government welcome the recent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) on the use of expenditure as a measure of living standards and poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.8/2">Her Majesty's Government agree that expenditure is a valuable complementary measure of standards of living, in addition to traditional analysis by income levels. The Government set out in the 2011 Budget report the reasons why expenditure may be a better measure of standards of living than income. Analysis of the income distribution alone can be potentially misleading. Among the reasons for this is that for some households, predominately in the bottom decile, expenditure exceeds current income. This could be because some households-typically those containing students, self-employed and unemployed individuals-experience temporary periods of low income and fund their expenditure from savings or borrowings. Because such households are smoothing their lifetime consumption, expenditure may be a better indicator of their standard of living. In line with this, our distributional analysis for the June Budget 2010 and Budget 2011 included analysis by income decile and expenditure decile, going further than any government before in providing a picture of the impacts on households.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.8/3">The Government are keen to explore complementary indicators of poverty that ensure that the policy response is not just focused on lifting those in poverty above an arbitrary income line, but also tackles the root causes of poverty and deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.8/4">However, the Government are also aware that there are a number of difficulties with collecting data on low-expenditure households. Officials are in discussions with the IFS about extending data collection on expenditure, but these are at a very early stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.2/1">We provide academies with additional funding in recognition of the additional responsibilities they have, which would previously have been borne by their local authority. There are two elements to the grant: the proportion which the department can recoup from the dedicated schools grant that would otherwise go to local authorities, and the proportion that the department cannot recoup because it is in respect of services normally paid from other local authority funds. For the latter, to avoid academies and local authorities being funded for the same services, we have calculated a total cost, and this is reflected in the amounts transferred from local authorities' formula grant of &#163;148 million and &#163;265 million in 2011-12 and 2012-13 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.2/2">The adjustments were based on national averages and estimates applied equally to all local authorities, including those without academies, as we cannot predict at this stage how many academies will be in each particular local authority over the next two years. An exact figure was given for the next two years to give local authorities greater certainty about the deductions they need to manage. The deductions do not affect the schools budget in each local authority, which is funded through the dedicated schools grant direct from the department, rather than through formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.2/3">The Academies Bill impact assessment published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-16">16 July 2010</phrase> identified the present value of local authority central services costs, over a four-year period from 2010-11 to 2013-14, at &#163;430 million. The annual cost was higher at the time of the later formula grant adjustments, in part because of changes in the number of maintained schools which at that stage were expected to convert to academy status.</p>
