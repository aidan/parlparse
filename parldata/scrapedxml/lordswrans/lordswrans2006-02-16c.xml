	<p pid="c.187.2/1">Discussions have been taking place with Liverpool City Council and some other local authorities aimed at providing the Immigration Service with assistance from social workers skilled in assessing age. Funding forms part of these discussions. There are currently around 200 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Liverpool. It is not possible to say if any are former child soldiers or have been intentionally trafficked. I would expect any evidence of this to be brought forward as part of an individual's claim for asylum.</p>

	<p pid="c.187.5/1">The mechanism for reporting contaminated air events is well established through the CAA mandatory occurrence reporting scheme, which is organised to receive reports of incidents affecting airworthiness.</p>
	<p pid="c.187.5/2">In the case of the incident involving flight G-BIKI on <phrase class="date" code="1998-11-09">9 November 1998</phrase>, this was unfortunately not reported to the CAA at the time by the airline involved due to an administrative oversight. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January 2006</phrase> the incident was drawn to the department's attention by a member of the flight crew. The CAA has subsequently contacted the airline concerned. Under the mandatory occurrence reporting scheme, flight crew themselves have the right to contact the CAA directly about an incident if they choose to, and to have their confidentiality respected.</p>
	<p pid="c.187.5/3">We remain satisfied with the effectiveness of this system because it enables both airlines and crews separately to report incidents to the independent regulator.</p>

	<p pid="c.200.2/1">iSoft is not one of the preferred supplier contractors for either the data spine, or the Choose and Book system, under the national programme for information technology in the national health service (NPfIT). Those contracts were awarded to British Telecom and Atos Origin respectively. iSoft is, however, a key subcontractor for three of the programme's five local service providers (LSPs), and has a track record of successful delivery of information technology systems to the National Health Service over a considerable number of years. Choice of subcontractors was and remains a matter for the LSPs concerned. NPfIT is delivering to the NHS a service for clinicians rather than a software package.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.2/2">In the Eastern, North East, and North West and West Midlands cluster areas&mdash;where iSoft solutions are being deployed&mdash;some 900 sites have had iSoft solutions installed, and these are being used by more than 25,000 users. Some LSP local system deployment activity is being rescheduled as a result of LSPs and their subcontractors, including iSoft, taking longer than originally anticipated to deliver software solutions. However, there is no single new deadline. NPfIT is a hugely complex 10-year programme which will see many thousands of further deployments and associated deadlines. Because contracts under the programme are structured so that financing and completion risk rests with the LSPs and their subcontractors, those who deliver get paid; the corollary also applies.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.3/1">Data from a survey carried out by the United Kingdom Renal Registry of the Renal Association show that in June 2004, the multidisciplinary renal teams in all but one of the UK renal units that replied (70 out of 72) included at least one dietician.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.3/2">However, advice on diet in the early stages of chronic kidney disease usually begins in primary care. Part two of the national service framework for renal services (the renal NSF) makes it clear that lifestyle changes that reduce the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, including cutting salt intake, are also likely to reduce chronic kidney disease and minimise disease progression. The guideline <i>Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults: Identification, management and referral</i>, 2005 developed by the Renal Association, the Royal College of Physicians in London, the Royal College of General Practitioners and others, also discusses the benefits of restricting salt intake.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.3/3">People with advanced chronic kidney disease are treated in secondary care. Part one of the renal NSF states that such patients will require nutritional monitoring and dietary advice, approaching and during renal replacement therapy (dialysis and transplantation), and highlights the clinical standards published by the Renal Association and the Royal College of Physicians of London. These give advice on diet, including salt intake, for patients approaching end-stage renal disease, and those with a kidney transplant. For patients on dialysis, the standards make it clear that dietary restrictions are also needed to maintain satisfactory blood chemistry and optimal nutrition, give advice on nutritional management including recommended limits on dietary salt intake and recommend blood levels of substances such as albumin, phosphate and calcium, which are regulated by dialysis. Patients on dialysis are regularly monitored against such recommendations, and investigation of the causes of abnormal test results would include possible non-concordance with dietary restrictions such as salt intake levels.</p>

	<p pid="c.203.0/2">Public procurement is often seen as a lever to achieve economic, social and environmental policy objectives. The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) is working with a range of departments across government, providing advice and guidance on how to incorporate these policy objectives into the procurement process in a way that is consistent with the legal and policy framework governing public procurement. In particular, the OGC has recently published a note on <i>Social Issues in Purchasing</i> which provides guidance on how a range of social issues can be taken into account in the procurement process.</p>

	<p pid="c.204.5/1">Since April 2002, the RDAs have been financed through a single programme budget (the single pot). This consists of money from various departments (DTI, ODPM, DfES, Defra, DCMS and UKTI). Defra's contribution to the single pot in 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;51.5 million. Inflation-proofing will see this increase to &pound;52.5 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;54.5 million in 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.5/2">The single pot is allocated using a funding formula, and is available to the RDAs to address regional priorities (set out in regional economic strategies), whilst at the same time contributing to the delivery of national PSA targets. Funding for administrative overheads is allocated from the single pot using a flat-rate indicator.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.5/3"><i>Rural Strategy 2004</i> announced that, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, Defra intended to devolve decision-making on delivery of economic and social regeneration policies to the regional development agencies, and transfer funding from the Countryside Agency to the RDAs. Funding of &pound;21.3 million per annum has since been allocated for the years 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08 and is distributed outside the single pot mechanism, using the new rural indicator to ensure these resources are targeted according to rural need. However, as with the overall single pot funding, RDAs have the flexibility to utilise this funding to contribute to the targets set by government (including Defra's PSA targets on rural productivity and access to services, sustainable farming and food, and sustainable development) and the priorities in each regional economic strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.5/4">How each RDA utilises its single pot allocation will vary according to regional need. Details of RDA priorities and planned spending can be found in individual RDA corporate plans, with six-monthly reports on performance, setting out what has been achieved. These documents can be found on each RDA website.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.5/5">This move to devolve funding to the regions through RDAs is part of the Government's devolving decision-making agenda. RDAs, working in partnership, will decide how to spend their resources to meet national targets and address regional needs. However, Defra is confident that by devolving these responsibilities to the RDAs and having increased the resources it makes available to them, rural delivery will become more responsive to local priorities and better focused on areas and people that need it most.</p>
