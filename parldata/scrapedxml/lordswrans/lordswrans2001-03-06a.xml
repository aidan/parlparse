Judicial appointments are based solely on merit. The one exception is in relation to the lay magistracy, who are only appointed if they pass a merit threshold, but where Local Advisory Committees also consider political affiliation of candidates, as a proxy for social background, so as to try to achieve lay Benches which are representative of the communities they serve: that has been the longstanding position, under successive governments.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.6/1">We have been engaged in a comprehensive review of the enforcement of civil court judgments since 1998. I announced by way of a Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-26">26 July 2000</phrase>, Official Report, col. WA 67 the completion of Phase One of the review. The rules of court arising from this phase are currently being drafted. I also announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-26">26 July</phrase> last year the terms of Phase Two of the review. These were:</p>
	<p pid="a.20.6/2" class="indent">To implement costed recommendations, including the production of a unified set of rules of court for enforcement, and</p>
	<p pid="a.20.6/3" class="indent">To identify, in the light of the amended procedures and revised powers of bailiffs, the type of agent or form of agency which should be responsible for carrying out those enforcement procedures, and to make costed recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.6/4">I am pleased to announce that Phase Two of the review of enforcement procedures will now be broadened to include structures for, and the regulation of, civil enforcement agents generally, not just within the High Court and the county courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.6/5">It would be a wasted opportunity not to attempt to go further and devise a single model encompassing not just civil court warrant enforcement agents, but other private sector civil enforcement agents collecting money for central or local government. This will involve my officials exploring systems across all areas of enforcement, and they will now examine various possible options, including issues surrounding a new class of enforcement agents who would be officers of, but not necessarily employees of, the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.6/6">For this reason we will publish in late spring 2001 a Green Paper on the structure and regulation of enforcement, and a single piece of bailiff law, followed by a White Paper later in the year, setting out our proposals for legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.6/7">This approach offers the best prospect of ensuring that there are real gains from the Review. Continuing with the narrower focus would pass up the opportunity of achieving a fundamental improvement in our enforcement system.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">We have today published a report giving details of the Government's conclusions following consultation on these proposals. The introduction of these changes to the financial eligibility tests for funding in civil cases will move towards alignment of the eligibility limits for all levels of publicly funded legal services, provide simplified means testing arrangements for both applicants and suppliers and ensure a fair balance between publicly and privately funded litigants.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">We are raising the income and capital threshold for Legal Help so that an estimated 5 million more people can get the advice and assistance on everyday problems that they need. We will not be introducing contributions for Legal Help so all eligible clients will be able to receive legal advice entirely free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/3">We have listened carefully to the responses and we will not be introducing capital contributions from equity at the present time. We believe the implementation of these proposals might deter low-income homeowners from seeking legal advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/4">We will fully equalise the income eligibility limit for Legal Help with Legal Representation as soon as it financially prudent to do so. This will bring a further 2 million people into the scope of the Community Legal Service Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/5">The cost of these changes is &pound;30 million over three years. We have been able to spend this money on increasing eligibility because of the success of our legal aid reforms in controlling and refocusing expenditure on priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/6">We undertook to consult on the new eligibility limits for all levels of service once they were available, and a consultation paper has been published today. Consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-01">1 May 2001</phrase>. These changes will be implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.11/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting a number of projects which are aiding the collection and destruction of weapons and the demobilisation and reintegration of combatants. This activity is regarded as an increasingly critical component of both conflict prevention and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.11/2">In Africa, DFID has funded the Programme for Co-ordination and Assistance for Security and Development, which is operating in West African states. The project includes the collection and destruction of surplus weapons, establishment of a database and regional arms register and training programmes for the military, security and police forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.11/3">DFID is funding Saferworld to develop strategies and programmes addressing the proliferation of small arms and to strengthen the co-operative efforts to prevent conflict in Southern Africa and the Horn of Africa--as well as Central and Eastern Europe, South Eastern Europe and the Trans Caucasus. This programme also involves working collaboratively with southern NGOs, including the Institute of Security Studies in South Africa. As part of the programme two workshops will be held in the Horn of Africa and Great Lakes Region later this year. The workshops will engage officials in the region and will specifically address demobilisation and reintegration as well as weapons collection and destruction. DFID is also continuing support of Sierra Leone's Disarmament and Reintegration Programme, including the provision of technical assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.11/4">Elsewhere, DFID has provided funds for the pioneering United Nations Development Programme project &quot;Weapons in Exchange for Development&quot; in Albania.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.11/5">Under the proposed &quot;Global Conflict Prevention Pool Initiative&quot;, DFID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence have developed a joint strategy for curbing small arms misuse.

	<p pid="a.23.2/1">Affordable prices are a key component of strategies to improve access to essential medicines in developing countries. The Government believe that negotiations with, and providing increased incentives to, the pharmaceutical industry will have a greater impact on prices and access than reducing patent life (which may have a negative impact on research and development investment). At the International Action Against Child Poverty Conference (February 26), the Government announced a proposal for a new and innovative global purchase fund for drugs and vaccines. This will increase access by providing a strong incentive to the pharmaceutical industry to deliver affordable medicines. We are considering a range of policy options with the industry, including tiered pricing agreements (selling drugs more cheaply in poor countries), tax measures including tax credits, and common purchase funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/2">The Government are already contributing to international partnerships between the public and private sectors, which results in reduced prices in developing countries. The Government also welcome the Accelerating Access to HIV/AIDS-related Care and Treatment Initiative. This partnership between UNAIDS and a group of pharmaceutical companies is reducing the cost of anti-retroviral drugs for AIDS in developing countries. This is a useful first step, although more needs to be done in terms of transparency and further price discounts. The price of drugs is one component of access. The Government also continue to work with developing country governments to strengthen basic health systems, without which the poorest will be unable to access the necessary drugs.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/1">The Government make every effort to ensure that the facilities of law enforcement agencies, such as the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol), are used properly and effectively. Interpol was established as an independent agency to facilitate international police co-operation. Ultimately, the Secretary General of Interpol is responsible for the day-to-day management of the organisation and he is answerable to the Interpol General Assembly, its supreme governing body. Under Article 2 of its constitution, Interpol aims to ensure, and promote, the widest possible mutual assistance between all criminal police authorities, within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Among the limits of its actions, which are laid down in Article 3, it is strictly forbidden for the organisation to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/2">The Government attach importance to co-operation with other national and international law enforcement agencies in the fight against crime. Any assistance provided to law enforcement agencies outside the United Kingdom is done in strict accordance with our law.</p>
