	<p pid="a.61.2/1">My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Budget Statement that an additional &pound;220 million would be made available over the next three years to Crime and Disorder Partnerships as part of the Communities Against Drugs initiative. This money, which is to be spent in agreement with local police commanders and Drug Action Teams, will be used to disrupt local drug markets, and tackle drug related crime. All partnerships will benefit from this funding, but those with the largest populations and most serious problems will benefit most.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is now able to announce the allocation of the funding for 2001-02. It is important that partnerships know their allocation for this financial year quickly in order to plan its use. In order to let them know this important information in good time, we have used a simple and straightforward allocation formula based on relevant and readily available information. The formula shares 20 per cent of funds across all partnerships in England and in Wales, allocates 50 per cent on the basis of certain recorded crimes which are often linked with drug abuse (burglary, robbery, theft and theft of and from a vehicle) and 30 per cent on the basis of population levels. Each partnership will receive at least the same allocation of money in the following two years. The final allocations for 2002-03 and 2003-04 will be announced by the end of July.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/3">A new Communities Against Drugs Toolkit is now available on the Crime Reduction website, <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>, and Crime and Disorder Partnerships will find this a valuable tool in helping them use this funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/4">A paper showing the detailed allocations to each partnership, and further information about the funding formula, has been placed in the Library, and my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Home Office, Mr Clarke, will write to honourable members for constitutuences in England and Wales with the same information.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.3/1">Any livestock farmer deliberately infecting his livestock simply to obtain a marginal monetary advantage over the value of his stock would be acting both illegally and against the best interests of all his neighbours in the farming industry and everyone in the surrounding area. No compensation would be available for any consequential loss connected with the compulsory slaughter of infected animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/2">The rates of payment under the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme are aimed at addressing welfare problems. The payments are not compensation, and the scheme is not designed to provide an alternative market. Payment relates to resolving an identified welfare problem, not to the value of the livestock.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-26">26 August 2000</phrase> the Pig Industry (Disposal) Scheme (PWDS) was introduced. The scheme ran until <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-30">30 December 2000</phrase>, by which time it had cost the Government &pound;14 million, of which &pound;9 million has been paid direct to pig producers. Part of the agreement between the Government and the National Pig Association/National Farmers Union on the PW(D)S was that the industry would provide top-up funding. The funding for the top-up would be collected in the form of an industry levy of 20p per pig slaughtered.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">The only vehicle available to introduce a compulsory levy on pig producers was a Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) originated development scheme under the 1967 Agriculture Act. Following formal consultation procedures on a Pig Industry Development Scheme (PIDS), that ended on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-23">23 January</phrase>, an order was progressed through Parliament. This order passed into law on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-14">14 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/3">Partly because of the reduced throughput of livestock for human consumption as a result of the FMD outbreak, producers realised that it could take well over two years to collect the &pound;4 million that was required to meet the industry's obligations under PIDS. To help producers at this time of crisis, my right honourable friend the Minister decided to short-circuit this delay by providing an interest-free government loan so that the top-up could be paid quickly. As he announced at the time, the money will reach producers in the course of April and May.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-04-30a.71.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100399" speakername="Lord McIntosh of Haringey" colon=":" colnum="71"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010430/text/10430w03.htm#10430w03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.71.0/1">My right honourable friend Michael Meacher, the Minister for the Environment, met representatives from British equestrian-based businesses on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-09">9 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">In the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-23">23 April</phrase>, Michael Meacher outlined the positive steps that are being taken by government to help rural businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/3">These include a number of measures to provide relief from business rates. They include increased government funding, from 75 per cent to 95 per cent, to enable local authorities to offer hardship rate relief to businesses in rural areas, targeted at businesses below &pound;12,000 rateable value, and offering reductions of up to &pound;1,290 over a three-month period. A further measure is the deferment, by three months, of the deadline for business rate appeals in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/4">Rural businesses will also be helped by the Government's legislation to extend mandatory 50 per cent. rate relief to all food shops in small rural settlements, and that legislation will also provide a transitional, five-year, 50 per cent. mandatory rate relief for new enterprises on former agricultural land. At the same time, recent regulations have extended 50 per cent. rate relief to sole village pubs and garages with a rateable value of less than &pound;9,000. It has also been arranged that, when a rural local authority agrees to defer payments, my department will in turn defer the payments that the authority is due to make to the national rate pool. The Valuation Office will consider applications from businesses for a reduction in their rateable value to take account of the impact of foot and mouth disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/5">The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise will take a sympathetic approach to requests for deferral or extended time to pay for tax and national insurance contributions, especially for rural businesses in agriculture, transport and tourism, and related retail businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/6">The major banks have made it clear that they will, on a case-by-case basis, consider mechanisms such as extended lines of credit, capital repayment holidays and other measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/7">The types of business that can apply for loans up to &pound;250,000 under the small firms loan guarantee scheme have been extended.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/8">Michael Meacher announced a further &pound;15 million for regional development agencies to help rural businesses in the worst hit areas. To help those who have lost work because of foot and mouth, the Benefits Agency has announced that it will provide quick assessment of applications for jobseeker's allowance from such applicants. My honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has announced a skills boost package to ease the impact of foot and mouth disease on jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/9">The Government have pledged to match public donations to rural charities, to help to address cases of severe hardship and to provide support for organisations responding to rural stress. The scheme is being administered by the Countryside Agency and will apply to personal donations, including the generous donations of the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/10">The Countryside Agency will also make available grants of &pound;3.8 million to help local authorities to open their footpaths. Further advertising by tourism organisations is being promoted by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced additional support of &pound;6 million for the English Tourism Council and the British Tourist Authority to get the message across that Britain is open for business.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/11">That all adds up to a total package of immediate practical help for the rural economy of more than &pound;200 million. The task force will continue to consider longer-term measures to help to get the rural economy moving when the disease has been dealt with.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">Until the 1951-52 Session, Writs of Summons were not returned to Lords. Since then, Writs have been returned to Lords who request them during the Parliament to which they relate.
