	<p pid="a.135.2/1">In England and Wales records are kept by the Administrative Court Office of the number of applications made for permission to apply for judicial review, which include details of claimants and defendants, whether permission was granted or refused, and the final date of disposal. The Northern Ireland Court Service holds a central register which records similar information in respect of Northern Ireland applications for judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/2">Neither the Administrative Court Office nor the Northern Ireland Court Service record the overall cost of judicial review. This information could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/3">Information on which public bodies in England and Wales were subject to judicial review, including who were the complainants, has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Information on which public bodies in Northern Ireland were subject to judicial review, including the number of applications made against each public body, has also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, together with a separate list of the complainants.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/4">The Legal Services Commissions for England and Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for the granting and payment of legal aid in relation to judicial reviews issued in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/5">The Legal Services Commission for England and Wales is not able to determine, without incurring disproportionate cost, which solicitors received legal aid for judicial review work. However, the total number of judicial review certificates for which a main bill was paid in the calendar year 2003 was 5,740, at a total cost of &pound;20,510,068.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/6">In Northern Ireland during 2003 a total of &pound;696,000 was paid out of the Legal Aid Fund for judicial review work in respect of 134 cases. A breakdown of the solicitors to whom payments were made cannot be provided for Northern Ireland cases without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/7">It should be noted that not all judicial reviews are funded by legal aid.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.3/1">The Army's manpower requirements are dynamic, and subject to change in light of evolving doctrine, the strategic environment, changing commitments, equipment, and technology. To maintain a proper balance in Army manpower numbers it is sometimes necessary to make minor adjustments to inflow and outflow. Controlling when recruits enter the training system is a means of doing so as this determines the point at which they are taken on to trained strength.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/2">There is currently a pause on some recruits starting their phase 1 training. Some of those who have successfully passed through the recruit selection procedure may be given a date to commence phase 1 training later in the year. This is a short-term measure that has been introduced to help maintain balance in Army manpower numbers, and is likely to continue until October. It does not equate to banning recruitment. There is no ban, freeze or cap on Army recruitment and no one expressing a wish to join the Army is turned away.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.6/1">Last year the Government invested an additional &pound;70 million over three years and recurrent funding thereafter of over &pound;20 million per annum to improve neonatal intensive care services. We are also launching later this year, a Children's, Young People and Maternity National Service Framework, the maternity module of which will focus on securing the best achievable outcomes, including very pre-term and low birthweight deliveries which are sadly associated with longer-term morbidity and compromised performance at school.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.6/2">The Government's Sure Start initiative covers children from conception through to age 14, and up to age 16 for those with special educational needs and disabilities. This initiative includes the creation of a growing network of children's centres providing integrated early education, childcare, health services, family support and help into employment. The Government are committed to providing children's centre services to all pre-school children and their families in the most disadvantaged areas of England and to those facing the greatest adversity&mdash;with a long-term vision of a centre for every community.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.6/3">There is a need however to improve ways in which morbidity from these causes can be countered. The Confidential Inquiry into Maternal and Child Health will continue the existing programme of inquiries into maternal, perinatal and infant mortality and extend its remit to encompass childhood morbidity and the establishment of a new national enquiry into child health. We expect this will inform an even more focused series of healthcare interventions in childhood.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.3/1">The Government have recently conducted a major consultation exercise on improving public health. The consultation covered a range of lifestyle issues, including diet and physical activity. Response to the consultation exercise will inform the development of a public health White Paper, due later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/2">High intakes of saturated fat can raise cholesterol levels. The Government provide practical guidance on how consumers can reduce the saturated fat in their diets through healthy eating advice. As part of a balanced diet, foods rich in saturated fat need to be replaced with unsaturated fats such as oil rich fish and foods containing oils such as sunflower, rapeseed and olive oils. The Department of Health also funds a range of non-governmental organisations to increase awareness of the benefits of eating a healthy diet and of active lifestyles.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/3">The pharmaceutical industry also conducts its own campaign to raise awareness of the benefits of statins in moderating the risk of coronary heart disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">The Government have recently conducted a major consultation exercise on improving public health. The consultation covered a range of lifestyle issues that would help reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, including diet and physical activity. Responses to the consultation exercise will involve the development of a public health White Paper, expected later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">Smoking is the major preventable cause of cardiovascular disease. The Government have a comprehensive programme of awareness raising, advice and information to help individuals. This includes: the recent Department of Health funded British Heart Foundation &quot;fatty cigarettes&quot; campaign; new stark health warnings on tobacco products, including &quot;Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes&quot;; and nationwide NHS Stop Smoking Services.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/3">Diet and lifestyle information is provided at present within the 5 A DAY programme, which includes a number of communications initiatives to inform consumers of the benefits of eating of at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables a day for heart health as well as other health benefits. Regarding physical activity, a campaign to increase exercise is being piloted this summer in the north-east of England. Led by Sport England, the campaign will encourage people to include more physical activity in their daily routine.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/4">The Food Standards Agency, as part of its Nutrition Action Plan, supports a wide range of initiatives aimed at improving the diet and nutrition of the population. The Department of Health also funds a range of non-governmental organisations to increase awareness of the benefits of healthy diet and active lifestyles, including a campaign to make the public aware of the importance of knowing their blood pressure numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.1/2" qnum="HL3689">What claims of damage to health caused by tobacco smoke in the environment have been made by the medical doctors who have recently requested a complete ban on smoking tobacco in indoor public places; what clinical and statistical evidence they provided to support their request; what are the sources of such evidence; and whether they have been tested by any objective expert body.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.2/1">The Government received 4,500 letters from doctors on the need for smoke-free public places as a result of the initiative of the British Medical Association (BMA).</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/2">There is clear evidence of the harm done by secondhand smoke. In 2002, the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer published a summary of its monograph on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans, which concluded that &quot;there is sufficient evidence that involuntary smoking (exposure to secondhand or 'environmental' tobacco smoke) causes lung cancer in humans&quot;. The full monograph <i>Tobacco Smoke and Involuntary Smoking</i> was published in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/3">The Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) in 1998 concluded that secondhand smoke is a cause of lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory illness and asthma attacks in children, and is a cause of sudden infant death syndrome.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/4">SCOTH is undertaking a review of studies since 1998 and its report is expected shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/5">The BMA has included its views on smoke-free public places in its response to the <i>Choosing Health?</i> consultation. We are currently considering all the many responses we have received. These will inform the development of a White Paper on improving health that we will publish later in the year.</p>
