These details will also be noted by consular officials on individual electronic case files.

	<p pid="b.182.3/1">The Government hold information concerning the total amount of assets frozen in the UK only of those who are subject to targeted measures under the EU common position. To date, 42 accounts have been frozen, containing approximately &pound;172,000. Regular and ongoing co-operation with EU partners occurs in order to prevent those subject to the EU's targeted measures moving their assets to or from accounts elsewhere in the EU. Where suspicious transactions are identified, they are investigated by the appropriate national authorities, which in the case of the UK are HM Treasury and the Serious Organised Crime Agency.</p>
