	Animal Welfare: Fur Imports

	<p pid="b.231.1/2" qnum="HL3288">Whether they have made an assessment of the extent to which the European Commission's proposal to ban the commercial importation of the fur of companion pets sets a precedent in the use of trade measures to protect animal welfare.</p>

	<p pid="b.231.2/1">The Government examined the case on cat and dog fur and concluded that the way in which these animals were treated to obtain their fur was unacceptable. We successfully called for EU-wide action as this will be more effective than national legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.2/2">The UK strongly supported the European Commission's animal welfare action plan published in 2006. The ban on the import, export and sale of cat and dog fur was one of the first measures announced under it. We are currently working to ensure that the proposed legislation will be effective in line with the Government's Better Regulation Agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.2/3">Within the WTO DDA agricultural negotiations, &quot;non-trade concerns&quot; are recognised. This could include animal welfare provisions, but there has as yet been little discussion on this. However, the UK continues to work on this issue in other fora. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) that has traditionally set guidelines on animal health has agreed its first ever codes on animal welfare.</p>

	<p pid="b.231.7/2" qnum="HL3173">Whether they have received scientific advice or evidence about the accuracy of the traditional test for tuberculosis in cattle, or suggestions for an improved test; what are the annual costs, direct or indirect, of the existing test; and how much compensation has been paid in each of the past four years to owners of cattle reacting to the test.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-05-03b.232.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="232"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70503w0001.htm#07050367000035">
	<p pid="b.232.0/1">The single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, commonly known as the tuberculin &quot;skin test&quot;, is the primary screening test for TB in cattle in Great Britain and other parts of the European Union (EU). The skin test, which is used throughout the world to screen cattle, other animals and people for TB, is the internationally accepted standard for surveillance for infection with mycobacterium bovis and is considered the best screening test currently available for detecting TB in live animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/2">No diagnostic test is 100 per cent accurate, but the current skin test is effective. Published research from studies around the world shows that skin testing will detect approximately 80 per cent of all infected cattle (at standard interpretation). This is known as the test's sensitivity. Occasionally, reactions to the tuberculin test can be caused by exposure to other mycobacteria; when the skin test is applied to cattle without TB, there is a one in a 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test's false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is to say that the skin test has a specificity<sup>1</sup> of 99.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/3">In October 2006, the Government extended the use of the gamma interferon blood test, alongside the skin test (as permitted by EU legislation), to improve the sensitivity of the testing regime for controlling disease in infected herds by identifying more infected animals more quickly. It is being applied mainly in herds disclosing TB infection in low-risk areas to help ensure infection does not become established in cattle or wildlife. It will also continue to be available for use as a disease control tool in areas of higher incidence. In line with recommendations from the scientific community, Defra continues to fund further research into improved diagnostics for bovine TB.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/4">The cost to government of cattle testing in Great Britain for 2004-05 was &pound;36.4 million and for 2005-06 it was &pound;36.7 million. These costs include: tuberculin costs, arranging, assessing and monitoring tests, conducting investigations of incident herds and meeting the costs of private vets&mdash;local veterinary inspectors&mdash;who carry out most of the TB testing work. The cost to government of surveillance activity by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, which includes tuberculin costs, was &pound;4.9 million in 2004-05 and &pound;7.5 million in 2005-06. We cannot provide an estimate of &quot;indirect costs&quot;, which are difficult to define, although we certainly acknowledge that the farming industry also incurs costs to support the TB testing programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/5">Compensation paid for TB reactors and contact animals compulsorily slaughtered across Great Britain in the past four years is shown in the table below. Figures include salvage money received by the Government for those carcasses permitted to go into the food chain or eligible for the Over Thirty Months Scheme.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.232.0/8"> <td>Year</td> <td>2002-03</td> <td>2003-04</td> <td>2004-05</td> <td>2005-06</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.232.0/9"> <td>Compensation paid  (&pound; million)</td> <td>31.9</td> <td>34.4</td> <td>35.0</td> <td>40.4</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.232.0/12"><sup>1</sup> Specificity is the ability of a test correctly to identify non-infected animals identified as negative (the higher the specificity the lower the probability of false positives). Sensitivity is the proportion of infected animals detected as positive (the higher the sensitivity the lower the probability of false negatives).No diagnostic test, including the tuberculin test, is totally accurate, ie 100 per cent sensitive and 100 per cent specific, as there is a trade-off between these two properties.</p>

	<p pid="b.233.2/1">There are a number of reasons for the decline in the number of Chevening scholarships awarded since 2003-04. The introduction of the Chevening Fellowship scheme in 2004-05 changed the focus of the overall programme and diverted funds from the scholarship scheme. A rationalisation of sponsorship schemes has led to a decrease in numbers of scholars and co-sponsorship funding as schemes that no longer meet objectives have fallen away. Inflation has also raised the costs of the programme as a whole. A new director of Chevening Sponsorship has recently been appointed to seek new partners for co-sponsorship of scholarships.</p>

	<p pid="b.233.5/2">As part of the Government's reforms of the children's workforce, the common core of skills and knowledge has been developed and in conjunction with national bodies, is being incorporated into national occupational standards. The common core specifies the skills and knowledge that all those who come into regular contact with children, young people and families should have. The common core was consulted on extensively and parenting groups were involved in its development. Social workers must also sign up to a code of practice that sets out how they work with service users. This means that those working with parents and children are required to respect their rights and promote their independence while also protecting from harm.</p>

	<p pid="b.236.8/1">The Government are supporting the NHS cord blood bank with approximately &pound;10 million which involves collection from Barnet General, Northwick Park and Luton and Dunstable Hospitals and soon Watford General Hospital. Comprehensive information about cord blood banking, and its clinical use, is provided to inform mothers at these hospitals. These hospitals have been selected as they are in areas of greater ethnic diversity. Approximately 40 per cent of samples are collected from black and minority-ethnic mothers thus improving the coverage of the NHS cord blood bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.8/2">The Government are also supportive of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which has provided advice and guidance to professionals and mothers about private cord blood collection. In particular, the Government endorse the advice to National Health Service trusts to consider local policy around private and other cord blood banking, and in particular to maximise the safety of the mother and baby. For this reason, the NHS cord blood bank employs additional staff to undertake cord blood collection in order not to burden the local midwife with additional responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.8/3">The Government have also noted the recommendation of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to consider the future funding infrastructure for cord blood banking in light of future developments.</p>

	<p pid="b.238.3/1">The Government do not collect figures of the quantity of cord blood collected across the United Kingdom. However, the British Bone Marrow Registry also contains information about the number of units banked in Northern Ireland (189). Scotland is now planning to set up a cord blood bank but there is nothing in Wales so far. The NHS cord blood bank has collected more than 9,000 cord blood samples for clinical purposes since it started in 1996. Since 2005 it has collected 4,554 samples, of which 2,615 were banked, indicating that 42 per cent of collected samples were discarded. This is consistent with the rates in other countries and is caused by a variety of reasons such as small volume, incomplete information from the mother or bacterial contamination. The units that cannot be banked may be made available for research if the mother has given her consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.3/2">There are no central records of patients who go abroad for cord blood transplantation. If National Health Service patients require a cord blood transplant which is not available in the NHS cord blood bank it can be imported from a suitable overseas bank for NHS treatment.

	<p pid="b.239.2/1">The Commons Refreshment Department took the decision recently to cease the purchase of fair trade bananas. As a result, the Lords Refreshment Department will be unable to procure fair trade bananas from the Commons. The Lords Refreshment Department investigated alternative supply routes and identified a potential supplier. The supplier proposed purchasing terms that would have required the House to order a minimum of 18 to 19 kilogrammes of fair trade bananas per delivery. This is three times in excess of the House's daily needs and would have resulted in significant wastage. The supplier was also unable to guarantee consistent quality and a regular supply of bananas.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.2/2">Based on this information, the department took the decision not to pursue the contract on the grounds that it would not prove cost-effective or meet the practical needs of the House.
