	<p pid="a.180.8/1">The average time between a child entering the care system and being adopted has remained fairly stable over the past three years. But there has been some decline in the timeliness of placements for adoption once the adoption decision has been made, and there is considerable variation at a local level. This is disappointing given that there are many prospective adopters ready and able to adopt a child.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/2">The Government expect the adoption system to work effectively for all looked after children who would benefit from this option, and wants to see all local authorities performing at the level of the best. That is why we have set up a ministerial advisory group on adoption to provide expert advice on a range of practical proposals to remove barriers to adoption and reduce delays. Proposals include making better use of the adoption register and extending its matching role.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/3">We are also disseminating key messages from the adoption research initiative to front-line practitioners. This research provides a robust evidence base for adoption practice, including permanence planning and family finding. It can be found at: <a href="http://www.adoptionresearchinitiative.org.uk">www.adoptionresearchinitiative.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.2/1">Adoption law and statutory guidance require that due consideration is given to a child's ethnic background. But it also stresses that it is unacceptable for a child to be denied adoptive parents solely on the grounds that the child and prospective adopters do not share the same racial or cultural background. This is a very important message. Ministers have recently made clear their position that ethnicity should not be a barrier to adoption if there are loving, stable and secure families ready to adopt children.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/2">The Government want to see more children adopted when it is in their best interests, fewer delays in reaching decisions and improved matching in particular for black and minority ethnic children. That is why we have established a ministerial advisory group on adoption to provide expert advice on how to remove barriers to adoption and to reduce delay in placements. In January we shall issue revised statutory guidance on adoption. This will underline the requirements in respect of the matching of children and prospective adopters from different backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/3">Work commissioned under the adoption research initiative provides a robust evidence base for adoption practice, including family finding and matching. The research can be found at <a href="http://www.adoptionresearchinitiative.org.uk">www.adoptionresearchinitiative.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.5/1">The Lamb inquiry made 51 recommendations. Many have already been implemented, including legislative changes to provide parents a right to appeal where the local authority decides not to amend a statement following an annual or interim review, and to route SEN complaints to the Local Government Ombudsman. A new statutory requirement on Ofsted to report on how well schools are providing for children with special educational needs and disabilities as part of school inspections was taken forward through the Children, Schools and Families Bill and commenced in September 2010. In addition, a range of activity has already been implemented, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/2">the Achievement for All programme in 455 primary, secondary and special schools in 10 local authorities;the National Strategies training for LA officers on statement writing;the National Parent Partnership Network work to enhance parent partnership services; advice from an Expert SEND Group to the Commissioning Support Programme; and work to improve parental experience of the Special Educational Needs Tribunal, which includes new guidance for tribunal chairs and the production a DVD guide for parents on the tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/3">The Government are considering any outstanding recommendations as they develop their detailed policies in this area and have announced that they will be publishing a Green Paper on special educational needs and disabilities. The overall finding of the Lamb inquiry was that by addressing support needs early, ensuring parents were listened to and that there was a real focus on improving outcomes, parental confidence increased. The Green Paper will be informed by the inquiry's findings and explore how we can improve support for all children with special educational needs and disabilities and their families. It will cover a range of services and settings including schools and the early years, where we know from recent research that pre-school education acts as a protective factor, so that the risk of SEN decreases from one child in three on entry to pre-school, to one in five by the time children start primary school. In doing so it will draw on recommendations such as those covering the school workforce and child well-being; the outcomes of the Council for Disabled Children's review of SEN information; and findings from the local authority projects to develop innovative practices in involving parents at a local level.</p>

We work with the local authorities to ensure that the use of surplus MoD property in this way does not inadvertently disadvantage the service leaver's position on social housing waiting lists. The MoD has also gifted land and provided financial support for supported housing projects at Aldershot and Catterick.</p>

Any decision on the future of the UK's bilateral programme in India will be made in close consultation with the Government of India.</p>

For example, the Indian Government's Education for All scheme, which is supported by the UK, has helped bring the proportion of Dalit children in school into line with their proportion in the general population. The UK has also supported the Government of India to reduce maternal and infant deaths among Dalits and tribal people by training community health workers to provide health services in remote rural areas. Through our civil society programmes, the UK is also supporting excluded groups, including Dalits, in India's 120 poorest districts to access benefits and services.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.5/1">We receive regular feedback from individuals and companies who use the SPIRE system through various channels of communication. Recently, we received comments about the SPIRE system through responses to a customer satisfaction survey. The survey was issued by the Export Control Organisation (ECO) through SPIRE and ran between January and April 2010. A questionnaire was sent to 1,618 individuals asking for feedback on services provided by the ECO. Of the 657 individuals who responded, 40 per cent were from small and medium-sized enterprises. One question asked respondents to rate the usability of SPIRE and, while some respondents commented that SPIRE should be improved to enhance usability, most (75 per cent) respondents said that SPIRE is easy to use. Customers were also invited to provide comments and suggestions specifically about the SPIRE system. On the whole these comments support the view that SPIRE is a good, workable system for exporters to use. Comments include, for example, &quot;the SPIRE process is generally very good and easy to use&quot; and &quot;SPIRE is a good tool to use&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.2/1">The coalition Government take the threat of online extremist or hate videos very seriously. Where such unlawful videos are hosted in the United Kingdom, the police seek their removal and also have the ability to sanction this under the Terrorism Act 2006. In cases where unlawful videos are hosted overseas, we work closely with our international partners and the internet industry to effect their removal.</p>
