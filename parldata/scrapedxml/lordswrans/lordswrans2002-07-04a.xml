	<p pid="a.51.1/2" qnum="HL4871">Whether they agree with the Audit Commission (Route to Justice, 2002, paragraph 49) that the separate funding of the criminal justice system through three government departments &quot;runs the risk of detracting from an integrated strategic approach&quot;; and, if so, what action they will take to tackle the problem identified by the commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">While recognising and accepting the independence of the component parts of the criminal justice system, the Government have a whole-system approach to provide clear strategic direction for the criminal justice system and to encourage closer working. The CJS business plan sets out system-wide aims, objectives and targets to which all CJS organisations work.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">To oversee the delivery of the Government's policies for the management and reform of the CJS, a Ministerial Committee on the Criminal Justice System has been set up, chaired by the Home Secretary. Ministers are advised by a recently established strategic board, made up of the most senior officials from across the CJS organisations and chaired by the Home Office Permanent Secretary. Other trilateral boards have been created to focus on CJS performance, resourcing and planning. This process of working together has helped highlight where policy and process change is needed, both within the individual organisations and across the CJS. The Government do not wish to deflect effort on direct service delivery improvements by going for major departmental reorganisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">To encourage closer trilateral working, the 2000 spending review introduced the CJS Reserve&mdash;&pound;525 million over three years (&pound;200 million in 2002&ndash;03)&mdash;that is jointly managed by the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General. This reserve is used to fund initiatives which contribute to jointly agreed objectives. It provides CJS Ministers with funding flexibility and the ability to respond to changing pressures on the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">As part of the investigations into the crash of Chinook ZD576, Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, was asked to conduct simulations to model the likely flightpath during the final seconds prior to impact. The House of Lords Select Committee was critical of certain aspects of these simulations, which did not include full FADEC parameters, although the engineers who conducted the original simulation factored in known FADEC performance criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/2">Boeing was commissioned in early March 2002 to revisit its original analysis to include full FADEC performance parameters. Boeing is the sole manufacturer and design authority of the Chinook. Only Boeing possesses the necessary detail about the design and material and its capabilities.</p>

We intend to make the results of Boeing's work available as part of the Government's response to the Select Committee report, although there may be matters of commercial sensitivity which would preclude the publication of some elements. It remains our intention to produce our response before the Summer Recess.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">The current estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme, with payments already made expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred and future spend at the current financial year exchange rate (the hybrid) estimate, is now &pound;9,800 million. Since the 2001 estimate and leaving aside the effects of price inflation and exchange rate variation (+&pound;11 million), there has been a real cost increase of &pound;25 million. This increase derives principally from additional costs associated with dockyard projects and with missiles and related equipment, offset by a reduced acquisition cost for the four submarines. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-30">30 September 2001</phrase> represented over 98 per cent of the total estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is brought up to this current year's economic conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &pound;14,376 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">The programme continues to show an overall reduction in real terms on its original 1982 estimate. This reduction, including the savings resulting from the decision to process missiles at the United States facility at Kings Bay, Georgia, now stands at over &pound;3.7 billion at current prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">The proportion of the estimate for work undertaken in the United Kingdom continues to be around 70 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">Three in-service Vanguard class submarines are successfully maintained continuous at-sea deterrence, with the fourth, HMS Vanguard, now undergoing planned major overhaul.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.5/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Energy and Construction has announced today that the White Paper Managing the Nuclear Legacy&mdash;A Strategy for Action is being published today. Copies are available in the Library and the Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.5/2">The White Paper sets out plans for radical change to current arrangements for the clean up of the public sector civil nuclear legacy, including the creation of a new body, the liabilities management authority, responsible to government and with a specific remit to ensure that clean up is carried out safely, securely, cost-effectively and in ways which protect the environment for the benefit of current and future generations. It makes clear the Government's determination to drive clean up forward systematically and progressively, using the best available skills to get the job done and, through competition, to promote the development of the supply chain and skills base required to sustain the clean up programme over the long term. It also underlines our commitment to ensuring that management arrangements are open, transparent and command public confidence. Implementing legislation will be brought forward at the first available opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.5/3">In the interim, a Liabilities Management Unit (LMU) has been established in the DTI to drive forward the clean-up work and to prepare the ground for the LMA. Membership of the LMU is drawn from the private and public sectors. The appointment of Bechtel as partner contractor adds international experience to the LMU, reflecting the Government's intention to ensure that the best skills are brought to bear on legacy clean up.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.5/4">In line with the commitment to openness and transparency, the Government have consulted widely with stakeholders in the preparation of the White Paper and would welcome views on the proposed new arrangements and the way in which they should be implemented. Views should be submitted to the DTI by <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>. Contact details are provided in the White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.0/1">The Government have pledged in the NHS Cancer Plan that funding for specialist palliative care services in England, including hospices, will increase by &pound;50 million per annum by 2004. This investment is included in the overall National Health Service investment for implementing the Cancer Plan. How the &pound;50 million is deployed locally will depend on the needs of the area. Cancer networks have drawn up service delivery plans on palliative care to review the level of services offered in their area and these will ensure that each network has a range of palliative care services available. We are currently reviewing the outturn position for 2001&ndash;02 and the progress in that year.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.6/1">The Government's policy on funding for coronary heart disease (CHD) is set out in its NHS Plan, published July 2000, a copy of which is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.6/2">The National Service Framework for CHD published in March 2000 set an immediate priority that by April 2002 the total number of revascularisation procedures, over the 1999&ndash;2000 baseline, would increase by 3,000. More than 8,000 extra procedures had been carried out by April 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.6/3">Future plans are based on reducing waiting times for heart operations. By April 2002, no patient had been waiting more than 12 months for revascularisation. The NHS Plan targets are for a maximum six-month wait for surgery by 2005 and a three-month maximum wait by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.6/4">It would not be appropriate for the Department of Health to pre-empt the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) by issuing interim guidance. The absence of guidelines from NICE does not prevent the NHS using new drugs or technologies. Standing guidance to the NHS (Health Service Circular 1999/176) asks NHS bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from NICE is not available at the time the new technology first becomes available.</p>
