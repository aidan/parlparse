Current estimates suggest neither a significant rise nor fall in unemployment over the last year. The United Nations and World Bank social and economic needs assessments on Iraq last year estimated that the unemployment rate before the 2003 war was around 30 per cent. Unofficial estimates of the current unemployment rate are in the range of 20 to 30 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.8/1">Until the Gulf War in 1991 safe water was accessible by over 95 per cent of the urban and 75 per cent of the rural populations of Iraq. The last reliable pre-conflict figures are for the year 2000 and indicate that by that time coverage had dropped to 92 per cent and 46 per cent respectively. Deterioration of the system was particularly bad in the south, including Basrah, due to the policies of the former regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.8/2">As a consequence of the conflict and subsequent looting it was estimated that the water sub-sector coverage deteriorated by an additional 50 per cent in some governorates, leading to intermittent supply and further degraded water quality. Overall, approximate estimates indicate that the immediate post-conflict coverage had fallen to 60 per cent of the urban and 30 per cent of the rural populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.8/3">In Baghdad, compact water treatment units have now been rehabilitated. Measures to secure water treatment plants and prevent further looting have also been implemented. Hundreds of critical breaks in the water network have been repaired, increasing flow by 2 million litres per day. Additional new construction is ongoing at Baghdad's Sharkh Dijlah plant, which will add 40 per cent or 2.25 million litres per day to the water supply of eastern Baghdad by May 2004, benefiting 640,000 residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.8/4">In Basrah, rehabilitation work has restored the water supply to pre-conflict levels and by spring 2004 the quality and volume of fully treated water supplied to Basrah will surpass the pre-war conditions of 17,000 cubic metres per hour of partially treated water. By the summer of 2004 rehabilitation of the Sweet Water Canal, which supplies water to Basrah, will be completed. This will allow its design capacity to be achieved, further benefiting 1.75 million residents.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/2">The Connexions Service is on course to meet its main target of reducing the proportion of young people aged 16 to 18 who are not in education, employment or training by 10 per cent by November 2004. Research commissioned by the Department for Education and Skills has concluded that joint working between agencies providing services for young people has improved since Connexions was launched. In another departmental survey, young people rated the Connexions Service highly: over 90 per cent of those who had used Connexions were satisfied with the services provided.</p>

In offering development opportunities and personal support, Connexions works with youth and social services, health services and a range of voluntary and community organisations. The service is available in Connexions one-stop shops and community access points; and in schools and colleges. Over 2 million visits were made by young people to Connexions front-line services in 2003. All young people will have access to advice and guidance through Connexions Direct (18 hours a day 365 days a year) by April 2004.</p>

A formal in-service date will be set at the main investment decision point due later this year but we plan to deliver capability from 2006. Operational requirements are regularly reviewed and decisions on equipment acquisition are made on the basis of what military capability we need and how best to provide it. If we decided there was a requirement to provide this capability before WATCHKEEPER comes into service, it would be normal practice to consider a range of solutions, of which equipment acquisition and, if appropriate, the acquisition of a UAV would be one possibility.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.8/1">There are no plans to set up a joint Franco-British defence force. There have, however, been recent trilateral proposals to develop capabilities in support of the EU's ability to undertake rapid crisis response operations. These advance the declaration made on <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> at the Anglo-French Summit, and the greater demand for rapid reaction peacekeeping forces from the UN. As part of the Helsinki Headline Goal, member states agreed to develop rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness. The British, French and German Governments are proposing that EU member states create battle group-sized forces (1,500 strong including combat support and combat service support), deployable within 15 days, and sustainable for 30 days (but extendable up to 120 days). These battle groups would be available by 2007, and designed for compatibility with typical UN Chapter VII mandates (to restore international peace and security). Member states would be able to offer such formations individually&mdash;as is likely to be the case for the UK&mdash;or on a multinational basis. There is, however, no standing European army or European rapid reaction force, nor any EU agreement to create one.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.2/1">No. While precise numbers are impossible to calculate we believe that the 210,000 estimate&mdash;extrapolated from a telephone poll conducted on behalf of AXA in August&ndash;September 2002&mdash;overstates non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/2">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recently commissioned a survey of 18,000 businesses. This showed:</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/3" class="indent">0.9 per cent of micro firms (1 to 10 employees) reported non-compliance;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/4" class="indent">0.37 per cent of small firms (11 to 49 employees) reported non-compliance;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/5" class="indent">0.6 per cent of large-sized firms (250 plus employees) reported non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/6">This equates to 0.5 per cent non-compliance or about 10,000 organisations out of about 1.2 million enterprises with employees in the UK. Further research conducted by the Small Business Service (SBS) while falling short of 99.5 per cent compliance also suggests a much higher level of compliance than the AXA estimate.</p>

In general the usage split is 80 per cent community use and 20 per cent elite. This balance gives elite athletes the dedicated training time they need while ensuring that the centres are viable and are also a real community asset, motivating young athletes to aspire to high standards of performance. However, where EIS facilites are based at university sites, where there are relatively large numbers of elite athletes, then the split between elite and non-elite use is 40 per cent elite and 60 per cent student/community.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.0/4">The ONS Pensions Contributions Statistics Review (published in October 2002) identified a lack of clarity with how insurance companies record data on pensions contributions in the ONS survey of insurance companies and pension funds, and recommended a study into how insurance companies are completing the survey questionnaire. The results of this study confirm past expectations of double counting and extended the range of possible reasons. As a result, the Office for National Statistics has reviewed the questionnaires. The study provided no information about the total level of double counting, or any ways in which this might be offset by under-coverage. The revised questionnaires include more detailed guidance for insurance companies and ask for more detailed data. New questionnaires have been prepared for use from the first calendar quarter of 2004 and for the 2003 annual survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/5">The quarterly results will be reported on the new basis during 2004. The effect of any double counting will not be known precisely until early in 2005 when the annual survey for 2003, using the new questionnaire, can be compared with the original quarterly results for that year.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/1">The Government have received representations from various sporting bodies about the proposal to raise the minimum pension age to 55 by 2010. Having considered these, the Government propose to allow sports-people and others in pension schemes at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase> (A Day) to keep any existing right to take benefits before the new minimum pension age. This is subject to those rights being tested against a reduced lifetime allowance and the full pension being vested at the early retirement age.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/2">However, the Government continue to believe that the new minimum pension age of 55 should apply to all pension schemes by 2010. So, sports-people and others not covered by above relaxation, and who believe their career is likely to end before they reach the new minimum pension age, will need to make financial provision in addition to their pension savings to cover the cost of retraining and other needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.2/4">Information in relation to England and Wales has been compiled from the 2001 Census. The 2001 Census question on ethnic group did not include a tick box for 'Roma' but provided the opportunity for people to describe their ethnic group in any way they wished if they considered that none of the tick box categories was appropriate to them. There were 1,710 persons usually resident in England and Wales who wrote in descriptions of themselves as 'Gypsy' or 'Romany' in response to the question on ethnic group. There were a further 509 persons who described themselves as 'Traveller'. These figures have been taken from Commissioned Table M221. It is not possible to identify how many of these were United Kingdom citizens, since the Census did not ask a question on citizenship.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.8/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the National Statistician, Mr Len Cook, to Lord Laird, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-23">23 February 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.8/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about whether the Office for National Statistics treats Ulster Scots as a separate ethnic group (HL1326).</p>
	<p pid="a.22.8/4">There is no single ethnic classification which is used throughout the UK. National Statistics guidance &quot;A guide for the collection and classification of ethnicity data&quot; has recently been published and this recommends ethnic group classifications based on those used in the 2001 Census. However, both Scotland and Northern Ireland used different ethnic group classifications on their censuses from that used in England and Wales and this is reflected in the guidance. This reply relates to the classification used in England and Wales only. The classifications used in Scotland and Northen Ireland are the responsibility of the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.8/5">The guidance does not recommend the use of a separate &quot;Ulster Scots&quot; category when asking questions on either ethnicity or national identity in England and Wales. However, it does recommend that there is always an option for people to describe their ethnicity or national identity in their own words.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.8/6">A central principle of the National Statistics guidance on ethnicity and identity is that people should be able to choose a category that adequately describes them. However, it would be impossible to list every possible ethnic category in our classification, since the list would become too long and unwieldy. Moreover the data collected from any sample survey would not be useable in practice because each category would contain too few people for us to be able to carry out meaningful statistical analyses. Instead we have listed a limited number of categories which reflect and distinguish between the significant groups present in England and Wales today.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.8/7">The 2001 Census in England and Wales did not include a separate tick box for &quot;Ulster Scots&quot; at the ethnicity question. There was however the opportunity for people to write in their own answers if they felt none of the tick box options were suitable. Everyone who wrote in &quot;Ulster Scots&quot; was counted separately. In England and Wales a total of 56 people described their ethnicity in this way.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.0/2">Fitness for Purpose promotes better inspection and regulation of tourist accommodation as a way of tackling poor safety and trading standards to ensure that minimum legal requirements are met. It is targeted at hotels (and the restaurants within them) guesthouses, pubs with accommodation and bed-and-breakfast establishments that are failing to meet minimum legal requirements, in order to help them to improve. It aims to take a lighter regulatory enforcement touch to well-run businesses that are already complying with the necessary regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/3">Six local authorities piloted the scheme last year. These were: Blackpool, Bournemouth, LB Camden, Canterbury, LB Greenwich and West Sussex. Each pilot took a tailored approach to the needs of their area. All the authorities concentrated on better working between different parts of local authority enforcement activity and tourism officers and sharing of information. Canterbury's pilot resulted in the pooling of information held on eight different databases.</p>

Negotiations between EP and Defence Estates (DE), the owners of the site, are continuing. The marketing of the site by DE pre-dated the introduction at the end of October 2003 of revised guidance on the disposal of surplus public sector land. The guidance has been issued to departments and sponsored bodies and will be formally included in Chapter 24 of Government Accounting soon. Now that the new procedures for handling surplus public sector land are in place, in future public sector bodies will have the opportunity to seek to acquire surplus land before it is offered to the open market.</p>

The guidance sets out the new arrangements requiring a department or NDPB wishing to dispose of a piece of land to place the site on the Register of Surplus Public Sector Land.

	<p pid="a.27.2/1">The United Kingdom has signed the United Nations Protocol to Prevent and Punish Trafficking in Persons, but is not yet in a position to ratify the document, as we have not fulfilled our legislative requirements to criminalise trafficking. The Government are committed to tackling human trafficking in all its forms, and to ensuring that these legislative requirements are met. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which we anticipate is coming into force in May 2004, includes offences covering trafficking into, within and out of the United Kingdom. A new offence covering trafficking for the purposes of forced labour and removal of organs, is included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Bill, which is currently before Parliament. These legislative measures, once brought into force, will enable us to ratify the United Nations Trafficking Protocol, as well as fulfilling our obligations under the European Union Framework Decision on Trafficking for the Purposes of Sexual and Labour Exploitation.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.5/1">As my noble friend the then Minister for Criminal Justice, Sentencing and Law Reform stated, in response to a Question by the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-27">27 February 2003</phrase> (Official Report, cols WA 49&ndash;53), the Government welcomed the findings and recommendations of the independent review team. My noble friend said that, as recommended by the independent review team, the Government would seek to renegotiate the contract with Capita so that it reflected the changed environment in which the Criminal Records Bureau would be operating. My honourable friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety made a Statement in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-15">15 January</phrase> (Official Report, cols 41&ndash;42WS) in which she announced that a revised contract had been signed and that this is a major step forward for the CRB and represents a substantial improvement over the previous terms.

	<p pid="a.29.2/1">In general the law applies equally online as offline. Thus legislation covering the legality of published material applies whether the material is published online or off. For England and Wales, the Protection of Children Act 1978 makes it an offence to take, make, advertise, possess in order to distribute or to distribute an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child. Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 makes it an offence simply to possess such a photograph. Downloading an image from the Internet constitutes an offence of &quot;making&quot;, and having such an image even in the form of electronic data constitutes possession. Placing such an image on an Internet site would constitute distribution. There are statutory defences to these offences. Currently a photograph is covered by this legislation if the child depicted is under 16, but this age will be increased to under 18 by the Sexual Offences Act, 2003 when it comes into force later this year. The Sexual Offence Act 2003 also includes a new offence at Section 12, of causing a child to watch a sexual act, which would include showing a child an image of sexual activity, for the purpose of sexual gratification.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/2">The Obscene Publications Act 1959 makes it an offence to publish material that is likely to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to see, hear or read it. Publishing can include showing such material on an Internet site. Possession of such material for gain was made an offence in the Obscene Publications Act 1964.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.5/1">Home Office Research Study 157, Testing obscenity: an international comparison of laws and controls relating to obscene material, which was published in 1996, compared the obscenity laws in England and Wales with those in a number of other countries in order to discover the various ways in which countries define and deal with obscenity in printed material, at the cinema and on video.

	<p pid="a.29.5/2">In the course of negotiations in respect of international initiatives to combat the circulation of indecent photographs of children, such as the Council of the European Union Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, the legislative postitions of member states form the background to discussions. There is an ongoing exchange of information between the UK and other countries both formally, for example, under the auspices of the G8 strategy on &quot;Protecting Children from Sexual Exploitation on the Internet&quot; and informally between officials which continues to add to our knowledge of the legislative position in other countries and supports our co-operation with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">The United Kingdom is fully involved with international initiatives to combat the circulation of indecent images of children via the Internet. The Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention, signed in November 2001, aims to provide for common definitions and minimum standards for offences concerning child abuse images handled on computers. It also seeks to provide for investigative methods appropriate for the offences and for collecting evidence in an electronic form, and to define measures to ensure effective international co-operation. The UK is also signatory to a Council of the European Union Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which is broader as it covers behaviour on or offline. In addition, the e-commerce directive, under Article 19, lays a general obligation on member states to co-operate with each other in dealing with cross-border complaints about online services.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/2">In the G8 group a strategy on &quot;Protecting Children from Sexual Exploitation on the Internet&quot; was adopted in October 2002. The strategy is designed to complement existing national and international initiatives, and has eight key objectives addressing: information and intelligence gathering, dissemination and sharing; victim identification; suspect location; legislation; law enforcement tools and training; industry and NGO co-operation; awareness building and prevention; and international co-operation. An important element of the strategy is an international child pornography image database. The database aims to act as a global respository of images with the capacity to carry out automated analysis. It would be a significant tool for law enforcement contributing to the identification of victims and offenders and analysis of images to establish locations and other linkages. An implementation study is currently being undertaken. The G8 has also established a network operating 24 hours a day for the exchange of information in investigations involving electronic evidence that require urgent assistance from foreign law enforcement, which now involves 33 countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/3">However, there are no specific international initiatives dealing with images involving sexual or violent activities among adults, as there is no international consensus on what constitutes obscenity, or when the freedom of an adult to have access to obscene or pornographic material should be constrained.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.5/1">The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is an industry-funded body which allows anyone to report the presence of images of child abuse anywhere in the world. The foundation determines whether the reported website carries potentially illegal material, and passes details of illegal material to the relevant law enforcement agencies to initiate action against the originators. Where the site is hosted within the UK, law enforcement will seek its removal with the relevant Internet service provider (ISP) and this procedure has been extremely successful in practice. The IWF is providing an invaluable service dealing with 21,341 reports in 2002, 9,602 of which contained potentially illegal content: it is significant that in 2002 only 2 per cent of sites reported to the IWF that contained indecent photographs of children were hosted within the UK, the bulk being hosted in the USA, Russia, and some other European states. In respect of adult pornography, we are confident in the ability of the IWF to identify material that is potentially in breach of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 in response to complaints, and to refer to the police any which is hosted within the UK.</p>

Should any amendments be required, these will be enacted or put in place at the earliest opportunity. It is not possible to indicate when this process will be completed. The UK will be in a position to ratify the convention once the Government are satisfied that the UK can fulfil the convention's provisions.</p>

There is widespread recognition in Iraq of the need for such militias to disband or be incorporated in the new national security forces. It would be provocative, at a sensitive time in the national Iraqi debate on the future of militia, to list specific groups. There is no simple definition of militia in Iraq. There are many groups in Iraq possessing weapons and it is not possible to be certain of membership or numbers. Reporting is often contradictory or attributes membership differently due to changes or variations in group names.</p>

In England and Wales, where responsibility for the legislation lies with Defra and the Welsh Assembly Government, enforcement is undertaken by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) at slaughterhouses, cutting plants etc, and by Local Authorities at points of sale to the consumer. In Scotland, enforcement is by SEERAD and in Northern Ireland by DARDNI. The labelling requirements in Regulation (EC) No. 1760/2000 applies only to fresh and frozen beef and veal, and mince; labelling of other meats and meat products is the responsibility of the Food Standards Agency (FSA).</p>
