	<p pid="b.89.2/1">There are an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 Afghans living with HIV. Although not directly engaged in tackling HIV/AIDS or the wider health sector in Afghanistan, DfID does monitor the situation in consultation with other donors active in this area, and provides funding to the multi-donor Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), which helps to pay the salaries of government-employed health workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.2/2">In support of HIV/AIDs, the World Bank has committed $10 million, the World Health Organisation $1 million, the Asian Development Bank $1.5 million and France $200,000. Additional funds of $11 million have also been requested recently from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria&mdash;GFATM)&mdash;to which DfID contributes.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.2/3">DfID will continue to look to donors active in this sector to provide adequate support as part of its plans to co-ordinate aid behind the forthcoming Afghanistan National Development Strategy&mdash;ANDS&mdash;due in March 2008. The ANDS is the Afghan Government's own plan for development over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.2/4">The Ministry of Public Health established a Department of AIDS Control in 2005. The national strategy for AIDS control, developed by the Government of Afghanistan, which will run until 2010, includes some key elements for the prevention of AIDS in Afghanistan, including: strengthening the country's system for AIDS detection; obtaining political commitments to fulfil the strategy; improving co-ordination; and raising local awareness of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

	<p pid="b.94.0/1">The legal profession is independent and self-regulating. Therefore, the conduct of solicitors who have represented clients claiming under the coal health compensation schemes is the responsibility of the Law Society.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/2">Information from the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) states that 21 solicitors firms have been referred to the SDT. The SDT has considered matters involving our firms. These matters are now concluded with the following outcomes:</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/3">case 1&mdash;one solicitor was fined &pound;7,500 and ordered to pay 80 per cent of the Law Society's costs, <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>;case 2&mdash;two solicitors were each fined &pound;2,500 and three solicitors were reprimanded, <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-12">12 March 2007</phrase>;case 3&mdash;one solicitor was fined &pound;15,000; proceedings against seven other partners were withdrawn with the tribunal's consent, <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June 2007</phrase>; and case 4&mdash;this hearing did not relate to alleged misconduct; the tribunal made compensation enforcement orders that had been requested by the Law Society, <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/4">The combined efforts of the LCS and SRA have led to well over &pound;3 million being repaid to miners. This figure is expected to rise as investigations continue. There are provisions in the Legal Services Act 2007, which will enable approved regulators to deal more effectively with cases of widespread wrongdoing in the future.</p>

We will be funding a national rollout of Fostering Changes, a training package to help foster carers deal with challenging behaviour, and plan through the Children's Workforce Development Council to extend the training, support and development standards for foster carers and to link these to the national minimum standards for fostering service providers.

	<p pid="b.96.2/1">Economic partnership agreements&mdash;EPAs&mdash;can be good for development and help countries trade their way out of poverty. They will provide 100 per cent duty-free quota-free access to European Union (EU) markets, and more simple and liberal rules of origin that will make it easier for ACP countries to export goods.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.2/2">African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are not expected to open up their markets to the European Union immediately. They have transition periods of up to 15 years to remove their tariffs on EU imports, and are able to protect around 20 per cent of their products. This should allow new arrangements to be put into place before the ACP countries open their markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.2/3">In order to be aware of any negative impacts of EPAs, the UK has pushed for appropriate mechanisms for monitoring and reviewing implementation as well as development impacts, with special attention to the most vulnerable ACP countries and communities, to be a key part of the EPA texts.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.2/4">If negative impacts are found or predicted, ACP countries will be able to use the safeguard mechanisms included in EPAs. These provide for the possibility that the market access provisions can be temporarily curtailed where it can be demonstrated that there is a surge of imports and that they are causing serious injury or market disruption to either ACP or European Union suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.2/1">The department has issued a wide range of guidance and best practice to support local health communities in improving the control and management of infections such as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.99.2/2">mandatory surveillance of CDI introduced in 2004 to help to establish the extent of the problem;the<I> Health Act 2006: Code of practice for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections</I> came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase> and requires National Health Service bodies to have appropriate management and clinical governance systems in place to deliver effective infection control. The Healthcare Commission assesses trusts against the code and can issue improvement notices, requiring that failures are remedied where it finds that the code is not being observed in any material respect;Saving Lives: a delivery programme to reduce healthcare associated infections included an updated high impact intervention on CDI and antimicrobial prescribing a summary of good practice, which is particularly relevant for managing CDI; andthe introduction of a new &quot;bare below the elbows&quot; uniform code for NHS staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.2/3">The NHS has been performance-managed at an individual organisational level against the original methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) target, to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections by April 2008. Many measures which tackle MRSA will also affect other healthcare associated infection (HCAI) rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.2/4">In order to increase the focus on tackling CDI, we have now set new requirements for the period to 2010-11 under the new Better Care for All Public Service Agreement, to deliver a 30 per cent reduction by 2010-11 in CDI compared with the numbers in 2007-08. This will be performance-managed at an individual organisational level through local delivery plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.2/5">The department's HCAI improvement teams offer tailored support to individual trusts. We have doubled the funding for the HCAI improvement teams this year and expanded their remit so the teams are now providing support to those trusts that have high numbers of patients with CDI as well as those with the most challenging MRSA targets. The improvement teams have already worked with 146 trusts.</p>

The project will work to ensure that the PCSO role is clear and understood and it will allow forces to learn lessons and enshrine good practice across the country. Since effective community engagement is a challenging and demanding task, requiring both mature and highly capable individuals, the Home Office will also now introduce a code of practice setting out that PCSOs should be at least 18 years old.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.5/1">The latest replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA) is about to conclude. The UK, together with other donors, will agree the level of funding and a policy framework. During this replenishment, discussion has focused on country-level effectiveness, fragile states and IDA's role in assisting countries to tackle climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/2">We consider a number of factors in deciding funding to IDA. These factors include IDA's effectiveness in reducing poverty which in turn is linked to IDA's allocation system, known as the performance-based allocation system&mdash;PBA. Each year IDA allocates the bulk of its resources using the PBA. The PBA gives weight to both the needs and performance of all countries that are eligible to receive assistance from IDA. A country's performance is measured by the country policy and institutional assessment&mdash; CPIA. Environmental sustainability is one of 16 criteria in the CPIA.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/3">The IDA negotiations in 2007 have (a) reaffirmed the centrality of IDA's allocation system; (b) simplified the system to make it more transparent; (c) discussed the link between allocations and country-level outcomes; and (d) confirmed that more IDA resources are being directed to countries where results are being achieved.</p>

In secure children's homes, contractors running these establishments report it is also 15 per cent and in secure training centres it is 11 per cent. The actual spend per pupil in the secure estate in the different types of institution varies between around &pound;8,100 and &pound;27,700. The amount budgeted per pupil in English state schools for 2007-08 is &pound;4,525.</p>
