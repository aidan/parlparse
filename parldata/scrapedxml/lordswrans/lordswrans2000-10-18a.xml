	<p pid="a.87.2/1">We understand from the World Bank that its support to Turkey is focused on key structural and social reforms, in line with the bank's overall mission to reduce poverty and improve living standards. In conjunction with the IMF, the bank is supporting the Government of Turkey in implementing a three-year disinflation which aims to bring inflation below 10 per cent by the end of 2002 and restore economic growth. The World Bank is not involved in the demobilisation of conventional forces or in police training. It is not directly involved in meeting the needs of internally displaced people in Turkey. The bank provided substantial support to help Turkey deal with the aftermath of the Marmara earthquake. DfID does not have a bilateral programme in Turkey.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">The 1.2 million children lifted out of poverty is an estimate, using the Treasury's tax benefit simulation model, of the impact of the measures announced during this Parliament. It is not a forecast of the change in the number of children living in low income families over the Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">The estimate encompasses the income effect of the measures, with one exception. A small adjustment has been made to allow for increases in employment amongst lone parents, which have already been seen since 1997. Other than this, for the purposes of this estimate, no account has been taken of the possible impact of the tax and benefit measures on earnings or employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/3">The impact of each of the key measures on families' incomes is shown in Box 5.1 on page 86 of the March 2000 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report. This shows that changes in the working families' tax credit and income-related benefits have the biggest impact in the lower deciles of the income distribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/4">While it is not possible to break down the impact of the individual measures on child poverty, it is possible to provide some detail on the types of household affected. The estimates suggest that of the 1.2 million children lifted out of poverty, around one-third are in lone parent families and about two-thirds in families with someone in employment.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.3/1">At 0.95 nautical miles, or about 20 seconds before impact, the crew released the on-board navigational computer from its fix on the Mull of Kintyre. At that point the pilots knew how close to the Mull they were. At 15 to 18 seconds before impact, the aircraft's height was only 468 feet as recorded on the tactical air navigation system. The pilots would have seen the same information on their radar altimeter, but even so at that point the aircraft was still climbing only gently.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/2">Evidence from the pilots' pre-flight planning shows they were fully aware of the safety altitude required for each leg of the route under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). If the pilots' intention was to overfly the Mull through cloud, under IFR, they should have established flight at least 1,000 ft above the height of the Mull. This is why the Board of Inquiry concluded that the selection of an inappropriate rate of climb to overfly the Mull safely was the most probable cause of the accident.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">From <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-05">5 April 1999</phrase> a new system of centralised collection of National Health Service charges following road traffic accidents was introduced. The system is administered by the Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU), a part of the Benefits Agency, on behalf of the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">In the first year of operation, the full cost of the new system to the Department of Health was &pound;1.2 million, including capital charges such as the costs of a new computer system. In that year, CRU collected and distributed &pound;26 million to English NHS trusts. In the start-up year, the cost of collection was therefore 4.7 per cent of the amounts collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/3">Six months into the second year of operation, CRU has collected and distributed &pound;30 million to NHS trusts in England, suggesting that a full year figure of at least &pound;60 million is possible. We have budgeted for costs of &pound;1.06 million in the current year, which, if &pound;60 million is achieved, would mean collection costs would be 1.8 per cent of the total amounts recovered.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/4">The performance of CRU, after some initial difficulties associated with the introduction of a new IT system, and the cost of collection expressed as a percentage of income collected, are fully acceptable to the Department of Health. The new scheme has dramatically increased the amounts being recovered and this money is already available to NHS trusts to improve patient care.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for the Environment represented the UK at the Environment Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-10">10 October 2000</phrase>. This was the first Environment Council under the French Presidency. One common position and two sets of Council conclusions were agreed, and a public orientation debate was held on a proposed environmental noise directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/2">Agreement was reached on a Daughter Directive under the Air Quality Framework Directive to set target values and long-term objectives for ground-level ozone, to protect human health and the environment. By 2010, member states will have to attain as far as possible ground-level air ozone concentrations that do not exceed 120 microgrammes per cubic metre on more than 25 days per annum. Some flexibility will be allowed in recognition of the difficulty of reducing ozone formation. The agreement reached is based on the World Health Organisation guideline values and a closely related EC proposal setting national emissions ceilings for ozone precursor pollutants. The directive also lays down monitoring requirements and provides for dissemination of information to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/3">Council conclusions were agreed on common and co-ordinated policies and measures which could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help to ensure that the EU and its member states meet their Kyoto targets. These build on previous Council conclusions, and give guidance to the Commission, and the work of the European Climate Change Programme, on priority areas for action, including transport, renewable energy, combined heat and power, the elimination of environmentally damaging subsides, and economic instruments. The Presidency also reported the outcome of the Lyons subsidiary bodies' meeting on climate change in October. An extraordinary Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-07">7 November 2000</phrase> will prepare for the forthcoming sixth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP6), taking place between 13-<phrase class="date" code="2000-11-24">24 November 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/4">The Presidency gave a progress report on global environmental governance, and a short set of procedural Council conclusions were agreed. Ministers agreed that further consideration of options for improving the existing institutional arrangements was needed and that financing was a central issue. My right honourable friend stressed the importance of a step by step approach, and the need to secure developing countries' commitment to change. The Presidency plans to develop conclusions for adoption at the December Environment Council to guide EU involvement at UNEP's Administrative Council in February and the build-up to Rio + 10.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/5">A public orientation debate was held on a proposed directive to establish common methods for measuring and assessing environmental noise, in order to collate and map comprehensive information about noise exposure levels across the EU. Ministers recognised the significance of noise as a health and quality of life issue and broadly welcomed the proposal, which would enable accurate comparisons of noise levels in all member states to be made. In noting the importance of taking action to reduce noise levels, most commented that plans were already provided for at the national or local level and stressed the importance of local solutions. The Presidency indicated that it intends to reach a common position on this proposal at the December Environment Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/6">The Presidency gave progress reports on two related directives which aim to increase re-use, recovery and recycling rates of waste from, and limit the use of certain hazardous substances in, electrical and electronic equipment. The Presidency aims to reach common position in December, subject to the European Parliament delivering its opinion before then. The Commission updated Council on the development of its planned proposals on the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are expected later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/7">There were a large number of any other business items. Ministers agreed to consider Council conclusions at the extraordinary Environment Council in November setting out the EU position on the revision to the Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Germany proposed that the European Commission should prepare for the early transposition into Community law of the International Maritime Organisation global ban on organotins in marine anti-fouling paints, and the Commission should also submit proposals for extending restrictions on the marketing and use of organotins in a range of consumer goods, such as textiles. They also called for prohibition on the use of the azo-dye Navy Blue. The Austrian delegation reminded Council of its concerns about the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic; the Italian delegation called for a joint Environment/Transport Council to resolve measures to tighten rules on oil tanker safety; and the Finnish delegation outlined its environmental concerns about the construction of a new oil terminal at Primorsk in Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/8">The Presidency updated Council on a proposed resolution on the Precautionary Principle, to be submitted to the Nice European Council in December, and on preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference for the Cartagena Protocol in Biosafety, also taking place in December. The Presidency indicated plans for further ministerial debate on the Commission's White Paper on environmental liability in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/9">Other items included Commission progress reports on revised guidelines on state aids and the environment and the introduction of environmental requirements into public procurement guidelines. The Commission also briefly presented its Green Paper on the environmental issues of PVC, its Communication on water pricing policy, and its Communication on integrated coastal zone management.</p>

Although, for reasons that are well known, we do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, we continue actively to develop a substantial unofficial relationship in the fields of trade, investment, culture, education and science and technology. Taiwan is listed as a target market by Trade Partners UK.

In accordance with this position, neither the staff of the Taipei Representative Office in London nor their counterparts in the British Trade and Cultural Office in Taipei have diplomatic status. The tax and legal status of the staff of the Taipei Representative Office in London have been reviewed on a number of occasions. However, because of the constraints imposed by the special position of the Taipei Representative Office, it has not so far proved possible under UK law to find a way to accord staff working in the office tax and employment concessions comparable to those enjoyed by the UK staff of the British Trade and Cultural Office in Taipei.</p>
