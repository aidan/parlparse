	<p pid="a.415.5/1">The so-called little ice age generally refers to a relatively cool period between the 17th and mid-19th centuries in the north Atlantic region. There is no evidence that this was a global event. Global average temperature has risen by approximately 0.7 degrees centigrade since the late 19th century and the long-term upward trend appears to have begun in the early part of the 20th century. The IPCC's fourth assessment report concluded that human activity was responsible for most of this warming&mdash;in particular, that it is very likely (more than 90 per cent chance) that greenhouse gas emissions were responsible for most of the warming over the past 50 years, and likely (more than 66 per cent chance) that greenhouse gases caused some of the warming during the early 20th century. The average rate of warming over the 20th century was 0.74 degrees centigrade/century and nearly double that (1.28 degrees centigrade/century) in the second half. It is not possible to identify the exact date when an anthropogenic warming signal greater than 0.25 degrees centigrade per century (or 0.025 degrees centigrade per decade) was observed without performing complex analyses, but it is clear that the anthropogenic warming signal has been significantly greater than 0.25 degrees centigrade over the past century as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.416.2/1">Observations collated at the Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit indicate that the rate of increase in global average surface temperature between 1975 and 1998 was similar to the rates of increase observed between 1860 and 1880 and between 1910 and 1940 (approximately 0.16 degrees centigrade per decade). This observation has no implications for our policy on anthropogenic warming.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.2/2">Little can be deduced from relatively short periods in the temperature record taken in isolation from the overall picture. Temperatures fluctuate in response to both man-made factors (such as emissions of greenhouse gases) and natural factors (such as volcanic eruptions, changes in solar activity and internal variability within the climate system), and different combinations of these factors can cause temperatures to change at similar rates for limited periods of time. In its assessment of the whole global temperature record from 1860, the IPCC, in its fourth assessment report, concluded that it is very likely (more than 90 per cent chance) that greenhouse gas emissions were responsible for most of the warming over the past 50 years, and likely (more than more than 66 per cent chance) that greenhouse gases caused some of the warming during the early 20th century. The IPCC also showed that in the absence of actions to limit greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures will continue to rise through the 21st century by between 1.8 and 4 degrees centigrade. This raises the prospect of dangerous levels of climate change, which the Government remain committed to avoid through concerted international and domestic actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Short-term fluctuations in the historic temperature record have no implications for this policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.417.2/1">The Government have a comprehensive set of policies in place to tackle carbon dioxide emissions, set out in the 2006 climate change programme and the 2007 energy White Paper. More recently, the Government have announced further ambitious goals on renewable heat and reducing emissions from transport. In setting policies to reduce emissions, the Government follow the framework set out in the Stern review on the economics of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.2/2">Lord Stern noted that the costs of moving to a low-carbon economy could be minimised with a policy framework that is credible, predictable and flexible, and that is built around three elements. First, establish a carbon price associated with the emissions of greenhouse gases, so that businesses and individuals are able to factor the cost of damages caused by climate change into their decisions. Secondly, encourage innovation in low-carbon technologies, through policies that address separately the market failures associated with innovation and bring forward low-carbon technologies in a timely and cost-effective way. Thirdly, remove barriers to action, as there are many other opportunities to reduce emissions that are unlikely to be taken up without policies to encourage long-term behaviour change, and to overcome other barriers that may prevent or deter individuals and businesses from taking cost-effective action to reduce their emissions, particularly on energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.2/3">The Government provide financial support for the second and third elements of this framework. Some of the main ways that they do this are as follows (figures are budgets for 2008-09):</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.417.2/6"> <td>Carbon Trust</td> <td>&pound;89 million</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.417.2/7"> <td>Energy Saving Trust</td> <td>&pound;35 million</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.417.2/8"> <td>Environmental Transformation Fund</td> <td>&pound;90 million</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.417.2/9"> <td>Act on CO2 campaign</td> <td>&pound;13 million</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.417.2/12">The UK's historical greenhouse gas emissions are recorded in an annual inventory, which is compiled in accordance with international reporting guidelines and best practice guidance, and submitted to the UNFCCC and to the EU. Emissions estimates are produced by multiplying activity data (such as the quantity of fuel sold) by appropriate emissions factors (such as the CO2 emissions per unit of fuel). Encouraging people to choose more efficient vehicles or to drive less, for example, would reduce the quantity of fuel sold, while blending biofuels with petrol or diesel would reduce the net CO2 emissions per unit of fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.2/13">The Government estimate the carbon savings that a policy is likely to achieve before it is introduced. But, ultimately, the carbon savings that a policy is actually delivering show up as lower emissions in the emissions inventory.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.2/14">While targets do not themselves reduce emissions, they are, as the Stern review noted, a key part of the policy framework. They help provide credibility and predictability, which gives businesses and individuals the confidence to invest in energy efficiency improvements and other low-carbon technologies. This is one of the reasons why the Government introduced the Climate Change Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.418.2/1">Observations collated at the Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit indicate that global average near-surface temperatures during each of the years 1998 to 2008 inclusive, relative to the late 19th century (1861-1900), were: 0.80, 0.55, 0.53, 0.69, 0.74, 0.75, 0.72, 0.77, 0.71, 0.69 and 0.60 degrees centigrade. The average for the period was 0.69 degrees centigrade warmer than the late 19th century. Much of this average warming can be ascribed to human activities and nine of the 10 warmest years on record all occurred between 1998 and 2008. It should be noted that short-timescale natural fluctuations in temperature are superimposed upon the long-term underlying warming trend due to increases in greenhouse gases, such that differences between individual years do not fit the underlying trend.</p>

	<p pid="a.421.2/1">Calculating expenditure on taxis reimbursed through the travel and subsistence system for the first two weeks of 2007-08 would involve a detailed manual review of every single travel and subsistence claim submitted for a period of up to four months given that staff are permitted to submit claims up to three months after the month in which the costs were incurred. Therefore taxi costs incurred in April could be claimed up until the end of July.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/2">There were 4,814 claims during 2007-08 so the period to the end of July represents, on average, over 1,600 claims. It is estimated that the process of retrieving, reviewing, calculating the taxi cost and compiling the relevant information would take, on average, two to three minutes per claim. It is estimated that this process alone would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold of &pound;750. In addition it would also be necessary, in order to review the information for accuracy and completeness, to carry a spot check of, say, 10 per cent of claims and there would be other costs involved in preparing the Answer to the Question.</p>
