	<p pid="a.290.2/1">Vaccines based on BCG have variable efficacy and, because they will potentially make cattle react to the current tuberculin test as if they were infected with Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), are illegal under EU legislation. Without a test to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (a so-called DIVA test), cattle from vaccinated herds would be indistinguishable from infected animals and would lose their officially tuberculosis free (OTF) status. When work started on vaccines in 1998, following recommendations made in the Krebs report (1997), it was expected that a non-BCG vaccine would be a candidate and research was conducted in parallel with human vaccine work. However, suitable non-BCG candidates have not been forthcoming for cattle or humans and, from 2005, work effort was concentrated on the identification of suitable antigens/adjuvants to improve the efficacy of BCG, which largely depended on the sequencing of the M. bovis and BCG genomes in 2001, and the development of a DIVA test.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.2/2">Research by its nature takes time. This is compounded by the fact that bTB is a slow-moving disease and animal experiments take a long time to complete. To date no suitable antigen/adjuvant candidates have been identified. Therefore, we are progressing the work necessary for a market authorisation (required under the Veterinary Medicines Regulations) for the use of BCG in cattle and to achieve EU accreditation of the associated DIVA test. Experimental efficacy and safety studies for BCG have already been completed. Additional funding over the next three years will enable us to continue developing DIVA tests, evaluate the duration of sensitisation of cattle to the tuberculin skin test and conduct BCG field safety trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.2/3">In addition to the science, wider acceptability, practicality, trade and legal issues impact the timing of the delivery of a licensed product. We have initiated discussions and will be working closely with the Commission and other member states to minimise the time required to make the necessary changes to allow the use of cattle vaccines for TB and to get the DIVA test integrated into the trade legislation. At this stage it is not possible to say how long these negotiations will take and success cannot be guaranteed.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.0/1">The earliest a fully licensed injectable vaccine could be available is projected as 2010. However, due to the costs associated with trapping badgers for vaccination, it is not likely to be used on a widespread basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/2">The earliest projected date for the widespread use of a BCG oral badger vaccine is 2014. The oral vaccination route is not supported by a proven technology for delivery of BCG, and the difficulties of ensuring that the live vaccine can survive passing through the stomach and be adequately absorbed by the intestines make developing it a much more complex task than the injectable BCG vaccine. Scientific research by its nature takes time. While the programme of research has been designed to minimise the time required to deliver licensed vaccines, a significant proportion of the work can be addressed only sequentially. For example, the majority of safety and efficacy studies required for licensing an oral badger vaccine must use the final formulation and therefore cannot start until this is available. Additional funding will not result in a vaccine being available sooner but will allow further effort to be focused on addressing areas of scientific and policy uncertainty in an attempt to prevent the timeline from slipping. As with all research, there can be no guarantee of success.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/3">Development of a vaccine against bovine TB, the causative agent of which is the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis, in badgers is fundamentally different and cannot be compared to the development of the vaccine against the bluetongue virus.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.5/1">Defra project SE3026, &#147;Bovine TB Transmission in Restocked Herds: Risk Factors and Dynamics&#148;, took advantage of the depopulation caused by the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak and the need to restock herds following the epidemic to consider and identify risk factors associated with the introduction and transmission of bovine tuberculosis. This work was completed in 2006. While restocked herds appeared to be at risk immediately after FMD, both restocked and non-stocked herds had similar bovine tuberculosis incidence during the whole study. The significant associations between herd breakdowns and farm management practices were: purchasing steers, purchasing cattle from markets (versus private sales), increasing herd size, storage of manure in enclosed places compared with storing in the open or spreading immediately, and not feeding supplementary minerals and vitamins. The final report is available on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.5/2">Additionally, an in-depth outbreak investigation by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency into a series of 31 cattle herds that suffered confirmed bovine tuberculosis incidents in the north-east of England between January 2002 and June 2004 showed that, in all but one of those breakdowns, the most likely source of infection was one or more purchased animals. Nine of the herds in that case study had been restocked under the FMD outbreak of 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.5/3">The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) used the nine-month suspension of tuberculosis cattle controls during the 2001 nationwide epidemic of FMD as an opportunity to further evaluate the link between M. bovis infections in cattle and badgers. It found a significant association between the suspension of cattle tuberculosis controls and an increase in the prevalence of M. bovis infection in adult badgers. This rise was observed consistently across all seven proactively culled trial areas. A similar pattern was observed in road-killed badgers, which suggests that the effect was not driven by culling itself. While these observational data do not demonstrate causality, they provide evidence that cattle-to-badger transmission may be an important factor in bovine tuberculosis dynamics. Results are presented in the ISG&#146;s final report, available on the Defra website, and have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.2/1">The number of farmers that were overpaid under the single payment scheme (SPS) in England was 11,454 in 2005 and 7,493 in 2006. Figures are not yet available for the 2007 scheme year.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/2">Detailed analysis of all payments made under SPS is not yet available and so it is not possible to give figures for the east of England and Essex. Once the remaining scheme payments have been completed, a decision will be taken on the level of detail that will be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/3">The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) does not keep separate data on cases where a top-up payment was required after an SPS claim had been corrected, nor can such data now be readily identified. The RPA retains data on changes in claim values but there is no automatic relationship between these and underpayment data because manual or partial payment may have been made to the claimant.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.6/1">In 2003, the Environment Agency commissioned a report on the prioritisation of flame retardants for environmental risk assessment. The aim of the study was to assess the use of and risks associated with flame retardants, in particular to identify substances that might require detailed consideration in terms of their possible impact on the environment.

REACH also has the aim of replacing substances of very high concern, as defined by criteria in the regulation, with suitable alternatives. Industry will have to justify their continued use.

	<p pid="a.295.2/1">HM Government prepared a detailed environmental risk assessment and two addenda on behalf of the European Commission under the existing substances regulation (EC No. 793/93). The most recent of these is dated October 2007. These reports assess the potential risks arising from all known uses of the substance, including its use in polymers (some of which are used in electrical equipment) and textiles. Medical devices have not been explicitly assessed but would be expected to be covered generically by the assessment of polymer use.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/2">The assessments were performed in accordance with a European technical guidance document. Based on this methodology, no risks have been formally identified for use in either polymers or textiles. However, some concerns remain due to its widespread presence in the environment and the possibility that it might degrade under some circumstances to more toxic substances. Consequently, the importers are required to perform further testing under Commission regulation (EC No. 565/2006) of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>. Industry has also initiated a voluntary programme to reduce point-source emissions from the plastic and textile industries.</p>

Alongside 39 other nations as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation-led International Security Assistance Force, we are there to support the Afghan Government in delivering greater economic development to improve the lives of the Afghan people and to ensure Afghanistan is never again a haven for terrorism and narcotics production, which threaten not only Afghanistan but the world. We are taking a comprehensive approach towards Afghanistan. Our Armed Forces, along with diplomats and officials, are in Afghanistan as part of this co-ordinated effort to support the Afghan Government in building the necessary institutions to manage their own security and development.

One of these contracts has been placed with MBDA (UK) Ltd and covers work on the Indirect Fire Precision Attack Loitering Munition (IFPA LM), Future Air to Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy) (FASGWH), Selected Precision Effects at Range (SPEAR), Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS), and Storm Shadow Capability Enhancement (SSCEP) programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.3/2">The second enabling contract has been placed with Thales UK for work on the Future Air to Surface Guided Weapon (Light) (FASGWL) programme. These two contracts are linked through a further contract, referred to as a teaming agreement (TA), which has been signed by the Ministry of Defence and all the industrial members of Team CW. The TA and the enabling contracts will be used to test this innovative approach towards the acquisition and support of complex weapons. These contracts follow earlier concept phase work, particularly on the systems to meet the IFPA LM and FASGW requirements, and related research and technology activity, particularly on technologies for Storm Shadow and on the system proposal to meet the FLAADS requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.3/3">The work associated with these AP enabling contracts builds on the early studies and technology development, and includes elements from continuing detailed concept work to understand and develop system solutions to development activity for those system proposals which are more advanced.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.3/4">The Team CW approach is based on using funding across the six projects flexibly, by treating them as a single programme. The value of the first payment against these contracts is some &#163;17 million. MoD expenditure on the earlier concept phase and research activity against these five military requirements has amounted to some &#163;25 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.307.3/4">The 2007 census test was a voluntary test carried out among 100,000 households in five local authorities, Bath and North East Somerset, Camden, Carmarthenshire, Liverpool and Stoke-on-Trent. The aims of the test were to:</p>
	<p pid="a.307.3/5">compare the effectiveness of hand delivery and post-out of questionnaires;assess the outsourcing of the recruitment, training and pay for the field force;assess the impact on response of the inclusion of an income question; andassess the quality of available address information.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.3/6">The detailed responses to the questions included on the test questionnaires will, as in previous tests, be used only to evaluate the outcomes of the test in order to inform the final design of the 2011 census. We are not planning to release details of the responses to particular questions since these will have little statistical value for the following reasons:</p>

	<p pid="a.308.6/1">Our 2005 common agricultural policy (CAP) vision is clear that securing further trade reform in the WTO, particularly of agriculture, would generate substantial benefits for the global economy and work towards poverty reduction. However, establishing the direct causal link between the CAP and malnutrition in developing countries is likely to be difficult if not impossible to do, considering the complexities both around the impact of the CAP on global and local markets and issues around malnutrition, poverty, entitlements and food security. While the UK does support ongoing research into issues of malnutrition, poverty and food security, it would not seem prudent to divert scarce resources into trying to establish this causal link.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.8/1">Over the last two years Ministers, including the Secretary of State, have had discussions with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) about whether there is scope to extend the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance to more people with severe visual impairments. While we understand the force of the arguments put forward by the RNIB, and support its aim of assisting visually impaired people to return to or remain in work, we cannot agree to amend the existing arrangements for the mobility component of disability living allowance at this time. We have, however, assured the chief executive that we will continue to work with the RNIB to explore the technical feasibility of its proposals.</p>

Currently, around one in four customers of Access to Work is a person with a visual impairment. The additional funding we are proposing will ensure that more disabled people, including people with a visual impairment, are provided with the opportunity to support themselves and their families through paid work.</p>

	<p pid="a.325.2/1">The UK Government will seek appropriate dialogues with a range of partners and organisations when considering the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's concluding observations, including children and young people. This process includes a seminar on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-29">29 July 2008</phrase> that the Department for Children, Schools and Families is jointly hosting with UNICEF UK and Get Ready for Geneva. The seminar will look at the issues raised in Get Ready for Geneva&#146;s children and young people&#146;s report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and consider how they can be addressed. The seminar will be attended by children and young people, representatives from non-governmental organisations working for children's rights, the Minister for Children, Young People and Families and officials from across the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.2/2">It would be at disproportionate cost to disaggregate the full funding spent on activities related to UNCRC over the past five years. However, in England, funding for events, communications and publications solely on UNCRC in 2006-07 was a total of &#163;107,397, and in 2007-08 it was &#163;61,839. There are a wide range of other participatory activities funded by the Government which will have related to UNCRC, but we are not able to disaggregate these to set out the precise spend on the convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.2/3">In addition, the Government have, through the children, young people and families grant programme, provided &#163;181,000 in 2007-08 and &#163;178,000 in 2008-09 to UNICEF UK for an expansion and independent evaluation of its Rights Respecting Schools Award scheme. A further &#163;162,000 has been awarded to UNICEF UK through the grant for 2009-10. The department also provided the British Institute of Human Rights with &#163;24,912 to expand the &#147;Right Hear, Right Now&#148; key stage 3 human rights teaching resource to include specific lesson plans for understanding and applying the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The resource was formally launched in July 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.330.2/1">Reducing accidents involving 14 to 18 year-old road users is a key issue for the department. Currently a variety of organisations, including the department, the Driving Standards Agency, local authorities, schools, the police and fire services, and voluntary bodies provide educational initiatives aimed at improving the safety of young people on Britain&#146;s roads. No central record of initiatives or activities is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.2/2">The department believes there is considerable variability in the nature, quality, content and provision of these road safety education initiatives aimed at young people. In 2007, the department published the results from a one-off survey of pre-driver education provision in local authorities and other organisations in 2006-07. This survey, available at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme2/predrivereducationsurvey.pdf">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme2/predrivereducationsurvey.pdf</a> found that a number of pre-driver education initiatives had not been evaluated. The department also published a review of the literature on the effectiveness of pre-driver education, available at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme2/predrivereducation.pdf">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme2/predrivereducation.pdf</a>. The research found that generally there was limited evidence of the effectiveness of pre-driver education.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.2/3">In order to develop a strategic framework for road safety education for children and young people, the department has recently commissioned a project to review existing materials and then produce a comprehensive set of road safety educational material. It is intended that these resources will cover everything from the time young people first start using the roads to becoming drivers, for all age groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.332.5/1">Information on the number of people who have been detected and found guilty of crimes through use of DNA subject sample profiles on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) taken from persons with no previous convictions is not collected centrally, as detections are achieved through integrated criminal investigation and not by forensic science alone. Some research information is, however, available on the number of DNA profiles taken from those arrested but not charged and from those arrested and charged but not convicted of an offence that have resulted in a DNA match, thus providing the police with an intelligence link on the possible identity of the offender and assisting in the detection of crimes. In April 2004, an amendment to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 came into effect which enabled the police to take and retain DNA and fingerprints from persons who had been arrested for a recordable offence. In the period April 2004 to December 2005, the retention of DNA profiles of arrested persons who had not been charged or proceeded against had resulted in matches with crime scene profiles from over 3,000 offences including 37 murders, 16 attempted murders and 90 rapes.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.5/2">In May 2001, an amendment to PACE 1984 came into effect which enabled the police to retain DNA samples taken from persons who had been charged but not convicted of an offence. In the period May 2001 to December 2005, an estimated 200,000 DNA samples taken from people charged with offences had also been retained on the NDNAD, which would previously have had to be removed because of the absence of a conviction. From these, approximately 8,500 profiles of individuals have been linked with crime scene profiles, involving nearly 14,000 offences. These offences included 114 murders, 55 attempted murders, 116 rapes, 68 sexual offences, 119 aggravated burglaries and 127 of the supply of controlled drugs.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.2/1">We are aware that thefts of valuable metals have been increasing in many parts of the country and we are working closely with the industries affected and the police to develop plans to tackle these crimes. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has set up a metal theft working group chaired by the British Transport Police and with Home Office, other government departments&#146; and industry representation to develop a strategic response to tackle this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.2/2">The working group strategy is based on ensuring that existing legislation (environmental and criminal) is adhered to by legitimate operators and that police tactics focus on identifying and closing down unlicensed operations in addition to developing a good practice guide for local enforcement and other stakeholders. The ACPO group is to examine closely the extent to which the current provisions under the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 are effective and enforced, and assess whether its provisions need to be tightened or replaced.</p>

	<p pid="a.338.0/1">The Government first learnt of the targeted online advertising trials in April this year. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office (ICO) have held discussions with BT on this matter. The ICO is monitoring the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/2">The first request from Phorm (or 121 Media) was received in June 2007 asking about the compatibility of targeted online advertising with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The Home Office circulated a response dealing with the general issue of targeted online advertising and the compatibility with RIPA in February 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/3">Between June 2007 and December 2007 a number of requests for information concerning targeted online advertising were received. The issue was also discussed at an informal meeting with one targeted online advertising company. This meeting informed the response given in February 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/4">The meeting was attended by representatives of Phorm, one policy and one legal Home Office official. This was an informal meeting to improve officials&#146; understanding of the ways in which targeted online advertising could be undertaken. There was no agenda and no minutes were taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/5">It would not be appropriate to provide details of that communication to a legal adviser in Phorm as we believe it is subject to legal privilege.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/6">The Home Office has made no assessment of the legality of BT&#146;s trials or any specific targeted online advertising system.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/7">Online targeted advertising can be provided in a number of different ways, and the security implications of each would need to be considered on an individual basis. The Information Commissioner&#146;s Office is responsible for overseeing the data privacy issues arising from the use of communications, including those raised by targeted online advertising, and for investigating the security of personal data. The ICO has stated: &#147;On the basis of our understanding of the explanation provided to us there does not appear to be any detriment to users in the operation of the Phorm system&#148;. But the ICO is keeping the situation under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.339.3/1">The Home Office has decided not to continue to fund directly the live 101 (single non-emergency number) pilot areas but will continue to provide funding to support the national 101 telephony routing infrastructure to ensure that the number remains available for use by local areas wishing to maintain or develop their own locally funded 101 service. This was a difficult decision taken in the context of significant pressures and competing policing and security priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/2">We acknowledge the many benefits achieved by the five pilot 101 partnerships and the commitment to improving services that these achievements represent.

	<p pid="a.339.3/3">The Home Office has also made available a 101 delivery toolkit which brings together all the work that has been put into 101. The toolkit provides details of the evaluation and lessons learnt from the service to date and gives guidance, example documentation and supporting material to help areas explore, implement and operate the 101 service locally.</p>

The policy advisory group was initially set up in 2006 to provide co-ordinated and consensus-driven policy advice and implementation plans to H.E.

	<p pid="a.343.6/1">Community Legal Advice services (centres and networks) bring together advice services funded by the local authority with those funded by the Legal Services Commission (LSC).</p>
	<p pid="a.343.6/2">CLA services are currently established in Gateshead, Derby, Leicester and Portsmouth and are planned for all the areas listed above. The precise services available through centres and networks to non-eligible clients will depend on each local authority&#146;s priorities for their funding. However, every CLA service will provide general help, advice and information that is available to all people regardless of means. Some local authorities may also choose to fund non-means tested specialist advice as part of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.6/3">If a citizens advice bureau (CAB) is currently funded by a local authority and/or the LSC, then these sources of funding may be affected by a joint commissioning process. However, a CAB can bid for a CLA centre contract either by itself or in conjunction with other organisations. In addition, some CABs have additional sources of funding and would continue to exist even if they did not win a tender.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.6/4">The rationale of joint commissioning is to improve the services available to clients. Services for non-eligible clients may continue but the provider of these services may change. The Community Legal Advice website will continue to provide free information and self-help packs on a number of frequently experienced problems.</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.344.2/11">The numbers awaiting to start a programme on a given day during the year will vary depending on the sentences received, the resources available in the area concerned matching demand, the individual's circumstances eg further court appearance, their motivation, other domestic factors, and possibly an assessment as to whether the programme will in effect meet their risks and needs. There is also a lead-in time while offenders prepare for the courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.2/12">Probation boards meet the cost of delivering accredited programmes through their grant as they see fit to meet their statutory duties. Probation boards' budgeted expenditure on accredited programmes for 2007-08 was &#163;86.5 million. It is not possible accurately to disaggregate the element for accredited domestic violence programmes. The number of offenders undertaking an accredited domestic violence programme has increased and the amount of money spent would therefore increase accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.345.2/1">The attached note provides information for England only because hospital episode statistics do not provide data for the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/2">We have provided two sets of data for this Parliamentary Question: the code W26&#151;contact with a knife, sword or dagger; and the code X99&#151;assault by sharp object. The code W26 is used for such diagnoses as accidental knife injuries and should exclude assault and intentional self-harm. The code X99 includes cases where someone has been attacked using a sharp object of some kind (including but not exclusive to knives). Stabbings with knives cannot specifically be identified by the clinical codes available.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/3">We understand that the intention behind the Question is to clarify how many people were treated in National Health Service hospitals for knife-related assaults and not accidental knife injuries. Therefore, please see the information provided in table on assault by a sharp object. The background analysis is based on this dataset.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/4">Please be aware that there are two other codes which relate to incidents with sharp objects and which have not been used to answer this Parliamentary Question. They are: Y28&#151;contact with sharp object, undetermined intent; and X78&#151;intentional self-harm by sharp object.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/5">The attached table provides data on the number of finished admission episodes for Essex primary care trusts (PCTs). In 2006-07 Essex PCTs merged from 13 into five. This change has been reflected in the attachment. The information provided covers the number of finished admission episodes. This is not the number of patients as a person may be admitted more than once during an episode of care. Please refer to the footnotes and clinical codes when interpreting the data.</p>

Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes.

During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/85" class="indent">Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.352.2/1">As part of its consultation on hybrid embryos, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) carried out an extensive literature review and consulted several leading scientific institutions. The aim was to gather information on which research groups had already created human-animal cytoplasmic hybrid embryos abroad, and to explore the pre-implantation development of human-animal cytoplasmic hybrid embryos. The HFEA did try to correspond with the authors of the paper quoted but they refused to give any additional information. The HFEA did not review the study in order to assess the potential of human cells for reproductive cloning as reproductive cloning is illegal in the United Kingdom. Also, as it is illegal for a cytoplasmic hybrid to be transferred into the womb of a woman, it was not relevant for the authority to look at published work that may have done this in animals.</p>

	<p pid="a.353.5/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority&#146;s scientific and clinical advisory group was asked to consider the various methods of deriving embryonic stem cells from human embryos and whether any of the methods would, potentially, be prohibited under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. This discussion involved the views of and information provided by Dr Daniel Brison and Professor Alan Trounson, leading experts in the field of embryonic stem cells. The view of the group was that none of the methods currently used would be prohibited because entities which form when human embryos are allowed to outgrow their structure are not classed as live human embryos and do not breach Sections 3(3)(a) and 3(4) of the 1990 Act. This is because the entities do not have the organisation structure of a viable embryo and are not representative of a 3D suspended embryo undergoing gastrulation&#151;the stage of development during which the primitive streak emerges.</p>

	<p pid="a.354.2/1">The Medical Research Council provided briefing containing the view that combining gametes or nuclei from animal and human cells could be useful in exploring the mechanisms by which mitochondrial DNA is activated, including when and how much it replicates and how the genes carried by mitochondrial DNA are regulated, and how nuclear proteins influence this.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.2/2">In considering the new provisions in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill relating to the creation of admixed embryos, including the creation of true hybrids, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's (HFEA) scientific and clinical advisory group was asked for views as to what, if any, reasons would scientists wish to create and use these types of embryos.

	<p pid="a.357.2/1">The information requested on the number of people diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia is not available centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/2">The department, in collaboration with the Manchester Heart Centre, has set up a National Heart Rhythm Management Devices Taskforce to consider how it might support and encourage local services to increase their implantation rates. The taskforce also hopes to investigate why there are such large discrepancies between PCT performances in this area. The taskforce issued a guide for commissioners on the use of pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) devices in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/3">In 2006, backed by the department and industry funding, the Network Device Survey Group made public the first systematic survey of the National Health Service in England and Wales in respect of its level and equity of heart rhythm management device provision compared to local relative need. The information is provided by primary care trust area. Information has now been collected, and shared with cardiac networks, for 2003 to 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/4">In 2006, compared with 2005, there was a 9.9 per cent increase in the overall provision of heart rhythm management devices. Although the majority of the increase relates to pacemaker provision, the data also suggest that a greater number of the more sophisticated and complex technologies, like ICDs and CRT devices, are also being implanted. As well as representing the single biggest increase in the 30 years that data have been collected on device provision, the increase is significant as it moves the United Kingdom from a position low in the international rate league table, with lower than average growth to a growth rate higher than the European average.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/5">2007 data are currently being collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/6">The national information can be found on the Network Device Survey Group&#146;s website at: <a href="http://www.devicesurvey.com">www.devicesurvey.com</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.359.2/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has so far received 38 applications from 14 companies to register products under the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme. To date, 17 registrations have been granted and the remaining applications are under assessment. On the basis of discussions with individual companies, the MHRA anticipates that the number of applications will continue to rise steadily.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/2">In its regulatory impact assessment of the THR scheme, the MHRA estimated that typically the costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed. A steadily expanding THR scheme, alongside the availability of licensed herbal medicines, will offer consumers wide choice of over-the-counter herbal medicines made to assured standards of safety, quality and product information. The likelihood of increased consumer confidence in the standards of products, including the reliability of product information, could also be of benefit to responsible specialist manufacturers and retailers.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/3">Companies are not required to notify the MHRA of products marketed under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968; therefore no estimates are available in relation to these products. Following the expiry of the transitional period permitted under directive 2004/24/EC, manufactured herbal medicines placed on the market will require either a marketing authorisation or a THR. As now, there will continue to be some herbal products that potentially can be placed on the market either as medicinal products or under other product regulatory regimes depending on their presentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/4">The MHRA continues to provide a range of help to companies aimed at assisting them to progress plans to register products, including holding meetings with companies to discuss the progress of actual or prospective applications under the THR scheme and providing a range of detailed advice via the agency&#146;s website.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/5">From <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April 2011</phrase> no herbal medicine within the scope of directive 2004/24/EC may be placed on the UK market or distributed by way of wholesale dealing without a traditional herbal registration. As now, there will continue to be some herbal products that potentially can be placed on the market either as medicinal products or under other product regulatory regimes depending on their presentation. We have no plans to ask the European Commission to propose legislation extending the deadline in directive 2004/24/EC.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/6">The current fees for registering applications for products under the traditional herbal registration scheme range from &#163;555 for a single existing ingredient to &#163;7,480 for complex new products. The fees charged by the MHRA are set at a level to reflect fairly the cost related to each activity. These fee levels and costs are reviewed closely every year. This is in line with Treasury guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/7">MHRA fees for registering herbal products are significantly lower than those levied on pharmaceutical companies for the registration of other medicines. The fees are based on an estimate of the amount of time it takes to undertake each of the activities and the costs of the relevant staff required to undertake these activities. Applications that are more complex take longer to assess and can require staff with more experience to undertake the work. These costs are reflected in the fee charged. The fee of &#163;7,480 for processing applications for registration of complex herbal products containing two or more ingredients not previously assessed by the agency reflects the additional work necessary when assessing ingredients for the first time.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.0/1">It is a commercial decision for individual companies whether to apply for a traditional herbal registration (THR) under the provisions flowing from directive 2004/24/EC. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is not in a position to estimate how many applications will be submitted. So far the MHRA has received 38 THR applications, of which 33 are for products containing a single active ingredient and five are for combination products. The MHRA expects that a high proportion of early applications will be for relatively simple products while companies become accustomed to meeting the regulatory requirements of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/2">There is normally no requirement for applicants to submit information on the efficacy of the product under the THR scheme. The quality requirements for herbal medicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products are set out in detailed guidance documents following consultation with industry. The European Pharmacopoeia also sets out legally binding standards for herbal ingredients as well as excipients used in herbal medicinal products. The purpose of the quality tests is to ensure that the herbal medicinal product is safe for use and has a reproducible quality over its proposed shelf-life. Tests are required to ensure that the correct plant materials are used, free from potentially hazardous contaminants such as pesticide residues, fumigant residues, heavy metals/other toxic elements, mycotoxins, bacteria/fungi. Where herbal extracts are employed tests are required on all materials used, including solvents and reagents used for extraction, to ensure that they are as intended and of acceptable quality. The herbal extract undergoes tests to ensure it is of reproducible quality and that it is free from hazardous levels of, for example, residual solvents, micro-organisms or potential contaminants from the starting plant materials. The finished dosage form is tested to ensure that it contains the declared amount of herbal ingredients and that it will remain of suitable quality throughout the proposed shelf-life.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/3">In its regulatory impact assessment of the THR scheme the MHRA estimated that typically the overall costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/4">European and United Kingdom medicines legislation requires manufacturers and/or importers of registered traditional herbal medicines for human use to hold a manufacturer's licence. It is a condition of such a licence that the holder must have a qualified person (QP). The QP must either meet existing specific educational and vocational requirements or attain status through transitional arrangements. The QP has a personal responsibility for certifying that each batch of registered traditional herbal medicine has undergone the appropriate tests, complies with its registered specification and has been manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice. The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that a safe quality traditional herbal medicine is placed on the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/5">The directive on traditional herbal medicinal products requires manufacturers of registered herbal medicines to be authorised by the national competent authority. In the UK, the MHRA authorises and inspects manufacturers. The inspection fee is currently &#163;1,496 for a full day and &#163;920 for half a day. Manufacturers must meet certain conditions and employ a QP in order to be authorised. A number of manufacturers were already authorised to manufacture herbal medicines before the directive came into force. Since the implementation of the directive all of the small number of manufacturers who have applied specifically to manufacture registered herbal medicines have been authorised.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/6">The European Commission launched a public consultation in May 2007 on the review of the operation of directive 2004/24/EC. The consultation included data up to March 2007. It is the European Commission's responsibility to report on the findings of that review and, pending that outcome, we have no present plans to press for an early second review.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.0/3">The Government's objective in relation to over-the-counter herbal medicines is that the public should have access to a range of herbal medicines made to assured standards of safety and quality and accompanied by systematic information about the safe use of the product. The previous regulatory arrangements for unlicensed herbal remedies marketed under Section 12(2) left companies free to decide whether to meet any standards and put responsible companies, and in particular those with specialist expertise wishing to operate to high standards, at a significant disadvantage. Consumers were unable to tell which products were made to acceptable standards. The MHRA will continue to operate the THR scheme in a proportionate way, in line with the principles of better regulation. Thereby we expect to see a competitive market offering consumers a wide range of licensed and registered herbal medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.0/4">Ministers have not visited the facilities of manufacturers to discuss the impact of the directive on traditional herbal medicinal products.

	<p pid="a.364.5/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) would expect some rationalisation in the manufacturing of herbal medicines reflecting the fact that to carry out this activity safely to systematic standards within a regulated environment requires specialist expertise. It is likely that some manufacturers lacking such specialist expertise may withdraw from the market. However, there is no basis on which to make specific estimates. Feedback to the agency from individual companies suggests that many are still developing their plans for registering products under the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme. So far 14 companies have submitted applications to register one or more products in the UK under the scheme and we therefore anticipate that there will be a competitive market. It is not possible to estimate the impact of the THR scheme on retailers. One factor is likely to be improved consumer confidence in products made to assured standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.5/2">The guidelines on the quality of herbal medicinal products prepared by the European Medicines Agency largely reflect good practice identified by the herbal industry. In its regulatory impact assessment of the THR scheme the MHRA estimated that typically the overall costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed.</p>

	<p pid="a.369.0/1">The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal&#146;s case law database contains all reported determinations of the tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.0/2">The reported case law database is an important legal research tool and is like any other set of law reports in that it publishes a selection of decisions that were made by the tribunal. The website does not seek to annotate those decisions thereafter. It is an historical record and does not purport to represent current law.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.0/3">The significance of a higher court decision that overturns a reported case will be known to the parties in the usual way. It should also be noted that the AIT website contains a disclaimer stating that the inclusion of a determination on the database should not be taken as an indication that it represents the current law.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.0/4">UKIAT 00183 been a country guidance case, which it is not, paragraph 18 of the AIT practice directions would have applied. That provides that the tribunal is to maintain a list of &#147;current&#148; country guidance cases on the AIT website. The tribunal, through its legal research unit, does its best to ensure that when a reported country guidance determination is overturned by the higher courts and is no longer &#147;current&#148;, an appropriate &#147;case note&#148; entry is made to the AIT website as soon as is reasonably practicable. The practice directions do not, however, contain a similar requirement for non-country guidance reported determinations.</p>

	<p pid="a.372.3/1">Under the wealth sharing protocol of the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA), a National Petroleum Commission (NPC) has been created to formulate and monitor policies and guidelines for the development of the petroleum sector in Sudan, including the approval of oil exploration and production contracts. The NPC is co-chaired by the presidents of the national Government and the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) and contains four permanent members each from the national Government and GOSS and up to three non-permanent members from oil producing states or regions. A separate technical committee comprising of officials from the national Government and GOSS ministries of finance also exists to determine the monthly distribution of oil revenues between the national Government, GOSS and oil producing state governments on a monthly basis, in line with the agreed CPA revenue sharing formulae.</p>

The main exception has been oil produced in the Abyei region, which lies on the disputed north-south boundary. Revenues from this region have been retained by the national Government and there have been no transfers to GOSS. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-08">8 June 2008</phrase>, the NCP and SPLM agreed an interim boundary for Abyei which should allow future revenues to be shared in line with the CPA formulae.</p>

	<p pid="a.373.5/1">The Government&#146;s <I>Waste Strategy for England</I>, published in May 2007, summarises the Government&#146;s waste policies. Chapter 3 of the strategy covers the main legislation on waste disposal requirements and explains that most waste regulation in the UK is derived from EU legislation on waste. The principal EU directives controlling waste disposal are the waste framework directive, which was first adopted in 1975 and which is about to be revised and updated, and the landfill directive, agreed in 1999, which sets targets for the diversion of municipal waste from landfill. There are a number of other directives; for example, on waste incineration and hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.5/2">The principal objectives of EU waste legislation, which the Government fully endorse, are that waste be managed in a way that does not harm the environment or endanger human health, and that waste policies should contribute to action against climate change.

	<p pid="a.380.0/1">I am unable to provide a precise Answer to this Question. The relevant information is not held centrally. Examination of each individual prisoner's record would involve significant disproportionate cost and would still not necessarily establish whether the change of function of the prisons was the cause of any delay in accessing offending behaviour courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/2">However, as Bullwood Hall and Cookham Wood were in the process of becoming prisons for men, the offending behaviour needs of each prisoner were considered on an individual basis. The aim was not to move any women undergoing accredited programmes or interventions until they had completed them. There was difficulty with the Choices, Actions, Relationships and Emotions (CARE) programme as at that time Cookham Wood was the only prison delivering it. This programme is now provided at Downview.</p>

	<p pid="a.383.5/1">Over 2005-07, the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) received US$ 3.3 billion in oil revenue transfers from the National Government of Sudan and these transfers accounted for over 99 per cent of total GOSS revenue over this period. GOSS have spent US$ 1.16 billion (35 per cent) of these oil revenue transfers on the Sudan People's Liberation Army and other security expenditures. Of the remaining 65 per cent of oil revenues, 81 per cent was spent on public sector salaries and operating costs and 19 per cent on development expenditures.</p>

	<p pid="a.385.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has been involved in the search for a synthetic alternative to black bear fur for a number of years. In the last decade a number of sample materials from a variety of sources have been assessed for their suitability. Only one of these samples, provided by the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals in 2005, was thought sufficiently promising to be subjected to a full-scale evaluation by the Household Division. After extensive trials it was concluded that the material was unsuitable in a number of respects, not least for its inability to retain its shape when wet.</p>

	<p pid="a.391.2/1">A recent report, funded by Defra, estimated that between 1992 and 2004 worldwide carbon dioxide emissions associated with UK consumption of goods and services (including international transportation) rose by about 115 million tonnes, or roughly 18 per cent, from about 647 million tonnes in 1992 to about 762 million tonnes in 2004. This has resulted chiefly from an increase in the total volume and diversity of products and services being consumed, and from a movement of manufacturing from the UK to countries where manufacturing is more carbon-intensive.</p>

	<p pid="a.391.5/1">Cluster munitions are currently controlled under entries ML3 and ML4 of Part I of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods, Transfer of Technology and Provision of Technical Assistance (Control) Order 2003 (&#147;The Military List&#148;) and therefore cannot be exported from the UK without a licence granted by the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR).</p>
	<p pid="a.391.5/2">I would like to clarify the Government&#146;s commitments in this area: at the recent Dublin conference, the UK was one of over 100 states which agreed to adopt the text of the new Convention on Cluster Munitions. That convention has yet to be ratified, but will include a ban. Until that ban is in place, any application to export cluster munitions from the UK would be rigorously assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, which cover, among other things, exports which would be used in the perpetration of human rights abuses or would exacerbate regional or internal conflicts in the destination country; and would be refused if any of these criteria were breached. As the noble Lord will be aware, the convention does however permit the transfer of cluster munitions between states party to the convention for the purposes of destruction, and for the development of and training in cluster munition and explosive submunition detection, clearance or destruction techniques; or the development of cluster munition counter measures. My understanding is, however, that no cluster munitions are produced in the UK, therefore it is unlikely that an application to export will arise in practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.398.2/1">The effect of Letters Patent creating peerages can he changed by legislation which has that specific effect. It cannot be changed by legislation of general application. Thus, the Peerage Act 1963 allowed Peeresses in their own right to sit in the House of Lords regardless of the terms of any Letters Patent creating the peerage. The House of Lords Act 1999 removed the right of anyone to sit in the House by virtue of a hereditary peerage unless they were specifically excepted from the provisions. Conversely, the House of Lords decided in 1922 in the case of Viscountess Rhondda that the terms of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 were not sufficiently specific to allow her to take her seat in the Lords when her Letters Patent allowed her to inherit the peerage, but not the seat in the Lords. I am aware of only one case in which the effect of individual Letters Patent has been changed by Act of Parliament, which is that of the Duke of Marlborough in 1706.</p>

	<p pid="a.398.5/1">When a federal state becomes party to a human rights treaty, all parts of that state are bound by its provisions. Article 50 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) states that &#147;the provisions of the present Covenant shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions&#148;.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.5/2">The UN Human Rights Committee, set up to monitor adherence to the ICCPR, should deal with violations by all tiers of government in the same way. In advance of a state's examination, the committee selects five members of the committee to look into that state's record. Drawing on the periodic report prepared by the state under review, they are able to consult widely, including using the UN network of experts and special rapporteurs, to help determine a list of issues that will be put to the state as well as the questions that the committee will ask on the day of the examination. Non-governmental organisations are also able to feed their concerns in to the UN Human Rights Committee in advance of the oral examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.5/3">In addition, when a state fails to comply with its obligations, other states can raise concerns in the UN Human Rights Council or in the UN General Assembly, either by making statements, formulating resolutions or calling for special sessions or action by special procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.5/4">A new innovation in the UN Human Rights Council is the creation of a universal periodic review which is a state-to-state peer review mechanism with every UN country's human rights record being examined over a four year period, on a rolling basis. This process has just started. The UK is aiming to ensure that all states participate actively in the process and use it as an opportunity to be self-critical about their own human rights record and commit to make improvements. It will take time and effort to build this system into a mechanism that can deliver real improvements in the human rights situation on the ground. However, the UK was one of the first to undergo the process and was therefore in a privileged position to be able to lead by example. We are now working with other states coming up for review to encourage them to engage positively in the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.400.6/1">Jury service is a demanding duty with which members of the public are obliged to comply, and it is enforceable with criminal penalties. It is not therefore comparable with activities which individuals choose to pursue voluntarily. It would be unreasonable and unjustifiable in principle to require everybody over the age of 70 to undertake a compulsory duty of this nature, given that this is already some time after most people would expect to have come to the end of their working lives. The line has to be drawn somewhere and the lower and upper age limits for jury service of 18 and 70 respectively are sound.</p>

Meanwhile, we recognise Umaru Yar'Adua as president and have pursued initiatives in a range of areas to further strengthen the close bilateral relationship between the UK and Nigeria, most recently during President Yar&#146;Adua&#146;s visit to the UK from 15 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-18">18 July</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.5/1">In identifying post offices to propose for closure, Post Office Ltd (POL) acts within the criteria set by the Government in their May 2007 response to the public consultation on the future of the Post Office network (available at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39479.pdf">www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39479.pdf</a>). The implementation of the programme within the Government's framework is an operational matter for POL. I have therefore asked Alan Cook, managing director of POL, to write directly to the noble Lord setting out how the criteria are implemented in the development of each area plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.5/2">In relation to other retail services, it is for sub-postmasters, not Post Office Ltd, to decide whether they wish to operate other services alongside their Post Office outlet. Currently, 80 per cent of rural post offices offer other retail services.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.5/3">There is no requirement to close a specified number of branches in any county or local area plan. In addition, where a closure proposal is withdrawn, there is no requirement to close an alternative branch. However, the future sustainability of many of the remaining offices is closely tied to the migration of custom from nearby offices which have closed. Post Office Ltd therefore reserves the right to identify an alternative office for closure where a closure proposal is withdrawn after local consultation. Any new closure proposal is subject to a further six-week consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.409.2/1">The British-French helicopter initiative has stimulated considerable activity. EU member states and NATO allies have identified, through questionnaires, deficiencies in their helicopter capabilities that preclude them from deploying on operations. Advanced tactical training was identified as one of the areas in which EU member states were deficient and which, if resolved, could assist some member states in their planned operational deployments.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/2">In the short term, urgent work is being undertaken in the European Defence Agency to produce a European helicopter tactics training syllabus and to demonstrate its use in supporting EU member states with tactics training prior to operational deployments. The first students should be available for operational deployment in 2009. In the longer term, all EU member states have offered to work together to address the perceived shortfalls in helicopter tactical training. This work is vital and will build on nations' ability to work together in testing operations. In the longer term, the EDA plans to investigate the possibility of taking a more multinational approach to helicopter upgrades to achieve efficiencies and operational deployability.</p>

	<p pid="a.412.2/1">Air source heat pumps can be an option for reducing carbon emissions from buildings, depending on the efficiency rating of the air source heat pump and the carbon intensity of the electricity it uses. At current prices they will generally be more expensive than conventional sources of heating, and their take-up will depend on future policy, as well as technology developments. The renewable energy strategy consultation published recently includes considerations of the role that microgeneration, including air source heat pumps will play going forward and considers a range of possible initiatives such as financial or regulatory instruments. We will also be consulting on a low-carbon heat strategy later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.2/2">In spring 2009, we plan to outline the measures we will need to meet our share of the EU targets by 2020 but also to achieve our longer-term renewable and carbon targets. In this strategy we will look further at microgeneration as part of our renewable energy policy and in the context of the UK's wider energy generation mix.</p>

Within this category there are examples of technologies that may be considered as part of a low- or zero-carbon emission solution, and air source heat pumps (ASHP) are included in this list. Developers decide what solutions, if any, to use in a development and may choose ASHPs if appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.413.2/1">The Government believe that priority access should remain an option for member states. In considering whether this is the right approach for our market, the issue is not simply whether we can connect more renewable generation but whether we can also maintain a reliable network and encourage essential investment in other generating technologies. Much variable renewable generation, such as from wind and wave power, requires a significant amount of responsive generation as back-up. We need to be sure that both are available. From the perspective of a renewable generator, knowing that a grid connection will be available when needed is likely to be more important than whether there is priority access over other technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.2/2">The recently published transmission access review (TAR) report (web address: <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file46774.pdf">www.berr.gov.uk/files/file46774.pdf</a>) sets out a package of measures that, we believe, when taken together could remove or significantly reduce grid-related barriers to renewable and other forms of generation. These include short-term measures to connect more generators, enduring reform to grid access arrangements and acceleration of the way in which new grid infrastructure is planned and developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.415.6/1">In its regulatory impact assessment of the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) estimated that typically the overall costs of registering a product under the scheme, including the cost associated with chromatographic testing, could be several tens of thousand pounds. It was anticipated that this figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.6/2">Ministers have not met representatives of the European Commission to discuss the impact of the traditional herbal medicines directive. However, the Government do take the issue of regulatory impact very seriously and continue to seek ways of minimising its impact. In its response to the Commission's 2007 review of the early operation of the directive, the MHRA stressed the need to carefully manage and minimise regulatory impact while not compromising public health. MHRA's response to the Commission is available on its website at: <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/Consultations/CON2031524">www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/Consultations/CON2031524</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.425.8/1">The <I>Financial Times</I> ratings referred to were based on the results of the first Capability Review of the Home Office, which was published in July 2006. Following that review the department produced and implemented a Reform Action Plan to tackle the issues highlighted. A second capability review was carried out in June 2008 which found that there had been significant improvement, rating the Home Office at 25 out of 40. It noted that the Home Office had improved on seven of the 10 capability indicators, four of them by two places. There are no longer any areas which are of &#147;serious concern&#148; or require &#147;urgent development&#148;. The external reviewers recognised the department's &#147;very substantial progress&#148; since 2006 and commented on the &#147;strong leadership team&#148; and &#147;clear strategic direction&#148; that have now been put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.426.5/1">The Northern Ireland Office currently operates three types of bonus scheme:</p>
	<p pid="a.426.5/2">A non-consolidated bonus scheme for Senior Civil Service (SCS) staff;A non-consolidated bonus scheme for staff below the SCS; anda non-consolidated special bonus scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.5/3">Non-consolidated bonuses were introduced as they are non-pensionable, result in no additional future pension liability, and reward staff for performance in a particular year rather than being consolidated into their pay for future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.5/4">In relation to SCS staff, the Government decided in 2002 that a non-consolidated bonus scheme should be phased in, on the basis of recommendations from the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB). This scheme is an integral part of all Whitehall and Northern Ireland government departments&#146; pay arrangements for their SCS employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.5/5">Recommendations are made in successive annual SSRB reports, to which the Government respond. In 2002, the bonus pot was introduced at 2.3 per cent of the overall SCS paybill. It has increased in subsequent years and in 2008 is 8.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.5/6">In 2004 the NIO introduced a non-consolidated bonus scheme for staff below SCS, in line with broader government policy. The amount allocated was 0.54 per cent of overall paybill for staff below SCS and it has remained at this level.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.5/7">In 1989, a non-consolidated special bonus scheme was introduced for all staff with an allocation equalling 0.1 per cent of the overall paybill. The bonus pot increased in subsequent years. Since 1996 it has been 0.4 per cent of overall paybill. The scheme was introduced to reward individual contributions during the year which were considered to be particularly meritorious. Such schemes are common in government departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.428.5/1">The control of common ragwort (senecio jacobaea) and four other injurious weeds is covered by the Weeds Act 1959 which allows the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to take statutory action to control their spread. While it is not illegal to have the weeds growing on land, the occupier of land where they are growing may be served with an enforcement notice under the Act requiring them to take such action as may be necessary to prevent the weeds from spreading.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/2">There are no statutory obligations on either public authorities or individual landowners and occupiers to control Japanese knotweed or Himalayan balsam. However, Japanese knotweed is listed on Schedule 9 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and Defra is considering whether to add Himalayan balsam and other species to the schedule. Listing a plant on this Schedule 9 makes it an offence to plant it, or otherwise cause it to grow, in the wild. Both the police and local authorities have enforcement functions for the 1981 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/3">Control of invasive species is primarily a matter for landowners and other parties affected by them. Local authorities have a discretionary power to require landowners to clean up &#147;land adversely affecting the amenity of the neighbourhood&#148; under Section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and this is potentially applicable to the control of Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam. Local authorities also have the power to undertake clean-up works under Section 215 and to recover costs from the landowner.</p>
