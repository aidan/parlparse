	<p pid="a.67.8/1">Action is being taken in a wide range of areas with the aim of increasing Army recruiting, both for officers and soldiers, co-ordinated by the Army Training and Recruiting Agency's Recruiting Group. This includes television advertising, work experience and &quot;Look at Life&quot; courses, graduate recruitment seminars and undergraduate army placements. In addition, concentrated recruitment drives have been trialled in two specific areas. The first in the London area last year showed a 24 per cent increase in inquiries and the latest drive in the North East in February showed an increase in inquiries of 31 per cent, although it is too early to assess the effect on actual enlistments. Similar events are planned for Scotland in June this year, a further London campaign in October, and the home counties and South East also in October. Changes to the recruiting process are being implemented in selected areas using more non-uniformed staff to process applications, allowing uniformed personnel to be more mobile and go out to the potential audience rather than expecting them to come to the recruiting offices. Other initiatives include Camouflage Magazine, which is aimed at 13 to 17 year-olds and aims to cultivate and maintain an early interest in the Army; there are currently nearly 90,000 members of whom nearly half are 15 and 16 year-olds. Also, a Commonwealth selection team is being set up with effect from April 2002 to serve the increasing interest from Commonwealth countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/2">As from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> there will be 93 regimental recruiting teams (RRTs), encompassing existing RRTs and the former mobile display teams. These will be staffed by Field Army personnel, but funding will be from both recruiting group and the Field Army. The level of funding will vary according to the team's size and the recruiting need of their particular capbadge. Funding includes the provision of vehicles and trailers, portable computers, mobile telephones, travel and subsistence costs, with fuel costs and marketing support also provided. Janice</p>

	<p pid="a.69.5/1">The European Court of Human Rights delivered its judgment in the case of Morris v the United Kingdom on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-26">26 February</phrase>. The Court noted that the changes to the court martial system made by the Armed Forces Act 1996 have gone a long way to meeting the concerns it had expressed previously, in the Findlay case. However, it found that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which concerns the right to a fair hearing, as regards certain aspects of Mr Morris's trial by court martial in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.5/2">The Court was concerned about the potential for undue external influence over certain members of a court martial panel; and about the procedures for involving non-judicial authorities in the review of court martial findings and sentences. We are assessing the implications of the Court's judgment for the future conduct of courts martial and whether any changes that may be necessary require the legislation to be amended. At present, Army and Royal Air Force courts martial scheduled for the near future are being postponed. We regret the inconvenience this is causing to accused and their representatives and to witnesses. The possible resumption of courts martial is being reviewed on a week-by-week basis. For the time being, trials in the Royal Navy are continuing in view of the nature of the regulations in that service concerning the position of court martial members.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.5/3">We shall make an announcement as soon as our assessment of the implications of the judgment has been completed. However, we do not consider that the judgment fundamentally affects the court martial system, which we intend to retain as an effective and fair means of administering discipline and justice in our Armed Forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.3/1">The Doha Development Agenda, agreed by Ministers at the fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Doha in November 2001, strongly reaffirmed the WTO's collective commitment to the objective of sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/2">The ministerial declaration states: &quot;We are convinced that the aims of upholding and safeguarding an open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, and acting for the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development can and must be mutually supportive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/3">The declaration assigns a new role to the WTO's Committee on Trade and Development and Committee on Trade and Environment to act as forums to identify and debate the developmental and environmental aspects of the negotiations in order to support the objective of having sustainable development considerations appropriately reflected during the course of the new trade round.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/4">The declaration also explicitly supports &quot;the efforts by Members to conduct national environmental assessments of trade policies on a voluntary basis&quot;. This reflects the view which is strongly held by the majority of WTO members that environmental or sustainability impact assessments should be entirely voluntary in nature and should be conducted at the national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/5">The United Kingdom and the European Union strongly support the use of environmental or sustainability impact assessments as a tool to assist the development of countries' trade policies with a preference for sustainability impact assessment as this allows the full range of economic, environmental and social impacts to be considered in a balanced way.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/6">The EU is, therefore, undertaking its own sustainability impact assessment (SIA) of the new round. The European Commission has recently awarded a contract to the Institute for Development Policy and Management at the University of Manchester to conduct a detailed and rigorous SIA of the new round. The results of the SIA, when available, will be used by the EU to inform its approach to the negotiations. Regular consultations with civil society on the scope and findings of the SIA will be convened by the European Commission. A dedicated website has been set up to provide easily accessible reports on the progress of the SIA. Lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.76.2/2">As well as providing information on a wide range of non-lethal anti-predation measures, DEFRA issues licences to allow the shooting of a limited number of cormorants as an aid to scaring where it can be demonstrated that the cormorants are having a serious effect on the performance of a fishery and where there is no other satisfactory solution.
