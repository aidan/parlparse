	<p pid="a.165.2/1">The Chief Constable announced the standing down of the PSNI band on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-16">16 December 2002</phrase>. One of the key factors considered in reaching this decision was the release of 40 officers back to policing duties across Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/2">Financial restraints was another factor: the current operating costs of the band averages &pound;10,000 per engagement with the band performing at approximately 150 engagements per year. The projected financial savings as a result of this decision will be &pound;1,677,522 which reflects the total cost of the band and operating costs of &pound;130,000. These costs which are currently met from the overall police budget will now be utilised for other frontline policing functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/3">While the PSNI band has responded to requests from all sections of the many communities that make up society in Northern Ireland, approximately 90 per cent of performances undertaken were as a result of invitations from the Protestant community. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-16">16 December 2002</phrase> the band performed in a primary school in Belfast followed by an event in Belfast city centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/4">Representations have been made by several individuals and groups regarding the decision to stand down the band, and inquiries have been made from existing and retired police officers regarding the formation of an association to enable a voluntary band to be established. Should this occur I understand that the PSNI will make available to it the instruments and other equipment associated with the former band and provide some finance.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.2/1">The US has said that the detainees are enemy combatants captured in a continuing armed conflict and held in that capacity by the US military authorities.

	<p pid="a.167.2/2">We remain in regular contact with the United States, at both ministerial and official level, about the situation of the detainees. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has raised the issue several times with US Secretary of State Colin Powell, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>. We have been encouraging the US to move forward with the process of determining the future of the British detainees. We shall continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/3">The discussions between British officials and the detainees are confidential as they contain personal information about the detainees. I am withholding further details of the visits by British officials to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay under exemption 1a of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, (information whose disclosure would harm national security or defence).</p>

	<p pid="a.168.5/1">The current policy and criteria for extended closure or retention by a department of records more than 30 years old was set out in Chapter 9 and Annex C of the White Paper Open Government (CM 2290) in 1993. Records containing such advice are reviewed on their merits, and extended closure or retention is only sought where the information contained in the advice is, in itself, sensitive. In other cases the records are opened when they are 30 years old. This is in accordance with the provisions of the Public Records Acts 1958 and 1967.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.5/2">When the right of access under Section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act comes into force in January 2005, it will not be possible for information to be exempt from disclosure on grounds of legal professional privilege unless the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs that of disclosing the information. Furthermore, from then, information cannot be exempt from disclosure on grounds of legal professional privilege if it is contained in an historical record, (broadly speaking those which are more than 30 years old). However, other exemptions from the right of access may continue to apply depending on the content of the advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.3/1">The Government agree with the European Court of Auditors that the Commission's accounting framework and systems are in need of reform. A major instrument to achieve this is the new Financial Regulation, which came into force in January 2003 and which the UK Government played a leading role in shaping. It requires general accounts and financial statements to comply with internationally accepted accounting principles. The Commission has now submitted a timetable for implementing the reform of its accounting framework and supporting IT systems: these are to be in place by 2005 as required by the Financial Regulation. When the reforms are complete, the accounts will be on an accruals basis and contain the information on assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities for which the European Court of Auditors has called. The Government will monitor this project closely and the Commission has promised to provide member states updates of progress every six months.</p>
