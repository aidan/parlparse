Iraq thus has full authority and control over its financial and natural resources, including the disbursement of funds in the DFI.

	<p pid="a.127.5/1">The definition of pornography involving children is not the same in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/2">In England and Wales, the Protection of Children Act 1978, as amended, deals with indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children under the age of 18. This includes anything which appears to be a photograph of a child, in any form. Whether the photograph is indecent is left for the courts to decide, applying common standards. It is an offence under the Act to take, make, distribute, possess with intent to distribute or to advertise such material. The Criminal Justice Act 1988 (s 160) makes simple possession an offence. In addition the Sexual Offences Act 2003 includes at Sections 48 to 50 offences of causing or inciting child prostitution or pornography, arranging or facilitating child prostitution or pornography, and controlling a child involved in pornography. Pornography in this context arises when an indecent image of the child is recorded. The law in Scotland and Northern Ireland similarly deals with indecent photographs and pseudo-photographs of children, at present up to the age of 16.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/3">According to their government website, in the Republic of Ireland the relevant definition is contained in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998: the definition covers four types of pornographic material featuring children under 17, irrespective of the medium used. These can be summarised as follows: visual material which either shows a child (or in the case of a document relates to a person who is or is depicted as being a child) engaged in or witnessing explicit sexual activity, or the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of the genital or anal regions of children; material which is capable of being heard and which represents a child engaged in explicit sexual activity; visual or audio material that advocates, encourages or counsels unlawful sexual activity with children; information relating to a child that indicates or implies that the child is available to be used for the purpose of sexual exploitation within the meaning of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/4">A visual representation includes any photographic film or video representation, any accompanying sound or any document.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.8/1">The problems of invasive non-native species are recognised internationally and have been identified as one of the major threats to global biodiversity by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Article 8h of the CBD requires contracting parties, as far as possible and appropriate, to prevent the introduction of, control or eradicate those alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats or species. Decision VI/23 of the Conference of Parties adopted Guiding Principles on Invasive Alien species and urged parties to address the threats posed by invasive alien species when revising and implementing their national biodiversity action plans. Decision VI/23 also urged parties to review relevant policies, legislation and institutions in the light of the guiding principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.8/2">The department, with the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, convened a working group in 2001 comprising government, nature conservation, and trade representatives to undertake a fundamental review of policy and practice on non-native species. The report took account of CBD Decision VI/23. The working group report of the Review of Non-native Species Policy has been published and is available from the Defra website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.132.8/3">The department published the government response to the working group's detailed report in October 2003. It was accompanied by a public consultation exercise. The outcome of the consultation is helping my department and the devolved administrations prioritise action and develop an overall strategy for dealing with invasive non-native species. The establishment of a coherent overall strategy will assist in prioritisation of key actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.8/4">The CBD does not refer specifically to any individual species such as the grey squirrel. I refer the noble Earl to the Starred Oral Question on <phrase class="date" code="">27 May</phrase>, (HL Deb, Col. 1440), that grey squirrels are well established and the approach we adopt towards them is clearly different from the approach we would adopt to a new threat. A Species Action Plan (SAP) for the red squirrel was published in 1994 as part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP). The UK BAP was prepared in response to our commitment to the CBD. The SAP identifies spread of grey squirrels, habitat fragmentation and disease as current factors in the decline of the species and sets objectives and targets to maintain and enhance existing red squirrel populations and to re-establish populations where appropriate. Delivery of the SAP is taken forward through the UK Red Squirrel Group, led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.9/1">The standard for travelators at Heathrow airport is that in each month they should be available for 98 per cent of the time. For the first six months of 2004, Terminals One, Two and Three each achieved the standard in all but one month. In the months that travelator availability was below the standard for these terminals, it was above 95 per cent. Terminal Four failed to meet the standard in two of the first six months when availability was above 90 per cent in one month and above 95 per cent in the other.</p>
