	<p pid="a.45.2/1">The Prison Service does not maintain a central record of all the establishments where housing advice is available in advance of release. From the available information those establishments include Birmingham, Brinsford, Buckley Hall, Bullingdon, Bullwood Hall, Cardiff, Doncaster, Drake Hall, Feltham, Forest Bank, Garth, Glen Parva, Haverigg, Hewell Grange, High Down, Highpoint, Hindley, Holloway, Holme House, Kirkham, Lancaster Castle, Lancaster Farms, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Low Newton, Manchester, New Hall, Norwich, Onley, Pentonville, Portland, Preston, Risley, Stafford, Standford Hill, Stoke Heath, Styal, Thorn Cross, Wandsworth, Wealstun, Winchester, The Wolds and Wymott.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">The Prison Service's Custody to Work initiative, with an additional &pound;14.5 million a year from April 2003, is geared towards increasing the number of prisoners getting jobs or training or education places after release, and the number with stable accommodation. We expect some of this investment to be used to extend the housing advice services available in prison, including those provided by non-governmental organisations experienced in this work.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.2/1">Through development education we aim to develop pupils' knowledge and understanding of global issues, including the political, economic, environmental and social implications; and their effects on individuals, communities and societies. They will also develop the skills and attitudes to contribute to sustainable development. Pupils study international development issues as part of both the citizenship curriculum&mdash;now statutory in secondary schools&mdash;and within geography. Primary pupils learn about living in a diverse world through citizenship, and about less economically developed countries through geography as part of studying water, settlements and environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/2">The DfES made about &pound;2 million available to fund organisations to produce resource materials to support schools. For example, we worked with the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Development Education Association (DEA) to produce a guide Developing a Global Dimension in the school curriculum. Detailed guidance produced by the QCA, sent to all secondary schools, includes a unit&mdash;&quot;Debating a global issue&quot;&mdash;which encourages pupils to develop international understanding. In addition, DfID is ensuring that teachers have effective local support to enable them to incorporate the global dimension into both the curriculum and the wider life of schools. DfID also supports, through its Development Awareness Fund, a number of projects which promote and demonstrate the value in education terms of the inclusion of the global dimension.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.0/1">The Audit Commission is responsible for developing the CPA framework and applying it to local government. In doing so, it is concerned to ensure that the principles of sustainable development and the factors that contribute to a good local quality of life are built into both the way in which individual services are assessed and the way in which authorities' corporate performance is rated.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/2">With county and unitary authorities, some service assessments, for example waste services, based on specific performance indicators and inspection results, appear to have reflected these principles reasonably well. Further work is needed in other areas ahead of the next round of CPAs for these authorities. For all of them, the corporate assessment included judgments about the way in which sustainable development principles underpinned council activity, although specific scores were not given for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/3">In the case of CPA for district councils, it is also proposed to include a specific assessment of performance in securing a high quality local environment: trials are currently continuing among West Sussex district councils to test the approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.3/1">The Government set out their policy on audit and access powers for the Comptroller and Auditor-General (C&amp;AG) in our response, published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-13">13 March 2002</phrase> (Cm 5456), to Lord Sharman's report Audit and Accountability in Central Government. The Government stated their intention to make two orders under the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000 (GRAA). The orders have been laid before Parliament today, following the completion of a consultation process seeking the views of those bodies and individuals affected by the orders. The orders reflect the outcome of the consultation exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/2">The first order provides for the C&amp;AG to become the statutory auditor of those non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) that are currently audited by private firms or where the C&amp;AG is currently appointed by agreement (other than companies). The order includes a schedule listing the bodies affected and sets out the legislation that is being amended and the amendments to be made. The Government accepted Lord Sharman's recommendation that the C&amp;AG would take over the audit responsibility as existing contracts with auditors expire. NDPBs which are also companies and which need to be audited by a Companies Act auditor are not included in this order. Further legislative changes will be needed to remove statutory barriers that currently mean that the C&amp;AG cannot carry out Companies Act audits.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/3">The second order provides the C&amp;AG with statutory access rights, for the purpose of his audit of government accounts and the accounts of NDPBs, to bodies and individuals in receipt of grant, registered social landlords, train operating companies and bodies contracted or subcontracted to provide goods and/or services to government and NDPBs, and to Entrust (the regulator of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme) where the existing non-statutory access will be made statutory under the terms of the Government's response to Lord Sharman's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/4">A regulatory impact assessment (RIA) setting out the impact the orders are expected to have on bodies and individuals potentially affected by them has been deposited today in the Libraries of both Houses. The RIA notes that the impact of the orders is not expected to be significant, with the overall cost of the new arrangements expected to be broadly the same as if the current arrangements had continued. It acknowledges that the new arrangements may not be completely without cost in each individual case. However, the RIA concludes that, in the light of assurances given by the C&amp;AG, the Government are satisfied that on balance the advantages and disadvantages of these arrangements add up to a clear and continuing net gain for Parliament and the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/5">It is the Government's further intention that the C&amp;AG should have access on a non-statutory basis for his value for money (VFM) examinations to the same bodies as are designated under the order in respect of his financial audit functions. Access to such bodies would not be for the purpose of conducting a VFM examination of the bodies themselves; the access would be exercised solely in connection with VFM examinations of public sector bodies. The Government will provide this access through conditions on the award of grants, conditions in contracts and other agreements as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">The department, with the National Assembly for Wales (NAW), has overall policy responsibility for flood and coastal defences in England and Wales and administers grant-aid for capital defence schemes. Operational responsibility for flood measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency (EA) and local councils, which decide which projects to promote and their timing.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/2">The aim of Defra and NAW policy is to reduce the risks to people and the developed and natural environment from flooding and erosion: by encouraging the provision of adequate and cost-effective flood warning systems; by encouraging the provision of adequate, technically, environmentally and economically sound and sustainable flood and coastal defence measures; and by discouraging inappropriate development in areas at risk from flooding or coastal erosion.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/3">Defra and NAW encourage operating authorities to look strategically at flood risk areas in relation to river catchments. The EA is currently preparing a catchment flood management plan for the Upper Severn and any options for flood alleviation measures arising from this plan must satisfy essential criteria to qualify for either Defra or NAW grant.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.0/1">The interaction between game licensing and gun laws is not straightforward. For instance, the legislation governing game licensing permits certain birds and animals, including deer, to be killed using a gun or by other means, within specified dates, by a person holding the proper game licence. The Night Poaching Act 1828 makes it an offence to take or destroy any game or rabbits by night in any land with any gun or other instrument. Under the Poaching Prevention Act 1862, courts may in certain cases order the forfeit of any game or gun found on an offender. The Ground Game Act 1880 gives an occupier of land certain rights to kill ground game with firearms. The Deer Act 1991 prohibits the use of certain types of firearm for the purpose of taking, killing or injuring deer.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/2">The main control on firearms in England, Wales and Scotland is the Firearms Act 1968. Firearms described in Sections 1 and 2 of the Act, including most hunting and target rifles, and shotguns commonly used for game shooting, may be held on a firearm or shotgun certificate respectively. Such certificates are issued by the local police. Game shooting is generally considered to be among the good reasons for which the police would issue a certificate for the possession of firearms.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/1">The number of days of poor air quality fluctuates from one year to the next because of differences in weather conditions. Adverse weather conditions can increase the number of high pollution episodes, which can cause an increase in the number of poor air quality days. The increase in the number of days of poor air quality in 2001 compared to 2000 was due to differences in the weather between the two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">There has been a long-term decline in the number of urban air pollution days mainly due to decreasing pollutant emissions from road traffic, electricity generation and industry in response to progressively tighter government standards and controls in these sectors. There is no clear trend in the number of rural air pollution days. This reflects the variability of ground level ozone, the main cause of pollution in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/3">The long-term improvement in urban air quality continued in 2002. In urban areas in 2002, days when air pollution was recorded as moderate or higher are provisionally estimated to be 14 days on average per site, compared with 24 days in 2001, 19 days in 2000 and 59 days in 1993. In rural areas, the provisional figure for 2002 is 23 days on average per site, compared with 30 in 2001. The number of days has fluctuated between 19 days in 1987 and 48 days in 1990.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.2/1">Defra, together with the Department for Transport, is contributing a small amount of funding to a Transport 2000 study to model various transport distribution scenarios for a basket of three food products. The study is examining whether a shift to sourcing these products more locally would lead to greater or fewer CO2 emissions in the supply chain overall. The research is due to report shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/2">The research forms part of Transport 2000's Wise Moves initiatives and follows some initial modelling work carried out last year and funded by DfT. The report from the earlier modelling work is available on the DfT website at <a href="http://www.freight.dft.gov.uk/wisemoves/index.htm">http://www.freight.dft.gov.uk/wisemoves/index.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.5/1">The working group completed a series of meetings in May 2002. We think that a combination of a levy and voluntary top-up insurance could provide a basis for a way forward. My officials are working on detailed proposals with a view to launching a wide-ranging consultation exercise in the summer 2003.</p>
