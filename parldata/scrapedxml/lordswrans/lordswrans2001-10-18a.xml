It will indicate the broad direction of travel over what will be a 10-year programme, starting in April 2003. We will publish the delivery strategy (including milestones) for the Diabetes NSF next summer. We shall also be setting up an implementation group this autumn, which will work with the National Health Service and other interested parties to develop a delivery strategy for the Diabetes NSF that takes account of the changing roles and responsibilities of NHS organisations emerging from Shifting the Balance of Power. The agreed delivery strategy, including milestones, service models, performance indicators and underpinning programmes, will be published next summer.</p>
