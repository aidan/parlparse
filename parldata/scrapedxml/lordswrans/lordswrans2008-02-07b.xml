However a strength estimate is only necessary in the calculation to convert pure alcohol clearances to quantities for the small proportion of total beer clearances which are not home produced. This is in contrast to clearances of spirits for which we only produce data on pure alcohol and not total clearances and an average strength is not needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.196.3/1">Travel concessionary authorities' (TCAs) responsibilities for implementing the statutory minimum travel concession will generally result in costs in three areas: issuing passes, reimbursing operators, and administering the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.3/2">The Government are paying a grant of over &pound;31 million in total to TCAs in England outside London in this financial year (2007-08) to cover the cost of issuing concessionary travel passes. The amount of grant to London is to be confirmed. The grant to each TCA is based on &pound;4 per pass currently in circulation, uplifted by 20 per cent to recognise that the new concession is likely to be more attractive than the existing one. It is not possible to say how much it will cost each TCA to produce passes as this will depend on a number of factors, including the state of their existing data on concessionaires and who they have contracted with to produce their passes. Details of the grant to cover the cost of passes are available in a supplementary table to this Answer in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.3/3">The costs of reimbursing bus operators and administering concessionary travel schemes are generally covered by amounts included in the formula grant settlement for each TCA. TCAs do not separately identify the costs of administering the scheme in their returns to Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.3/4">The department is also paying a special grant in the following three years (2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11) to cover the cost of improving the statutory minimum bus concession from free off-peak local travel to free off-peak travel anywhere in England. The proposed distribution of this grant is set out in a further supplementary table. The final distribution will be subject to a parliamentary debate in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.0/1">The Government's spending priorities are not, in general, determined by the way in which the money is raised. Hypothecating revenues to particular spending programmes imparts inflexibility in spending decisions and can lead to a misallocation of resources, with reduced value for money for taxpayers. The spending review process ensures that resources are allocated efficiently to deliver government objectives and ensures priorities, such as education and health, receive the increased levels of funding, as set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR).</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/2">The CSR increases Defra's budget by 1.4 per cent in real terms, from &pound;3,508 million in 2007-08 to &pound;3,960 million. This increase allows the Government to allocate substantial resources to tackle climate change including the Environmental Transformation Fund, and increased resources for flood defences to help the UK adapt.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.5/1">Appropriate gender separation on mental health units is essential for privacy, dignity and safety. The environment plays an important part in this, however policy, practice and training are equally important. Good progress on mixed-sex accommodation in mental health has been made; 70 per cent of available beds across the mental health estate is in single rooms. Recent guidance to the National Health Service makes it clear that men and women in mental health units should never have to share bedrooms, or bed bays, with the opposite sex. However, we know that further improvements can be made and consequently have included mixed-sex accommodation in the operating framework for the NHS this year to make sure that it is at the top of the agenda. Primary care trusts have been asked to assess the situation in all their trusts and to agree and publish stretching plans for improvement.</p>

	<p pid="b.202.5/1">Patients are able to comment on the food they receive in hospitals in several ways. The Healthcare Commission National Inpatient survey (due to be published this year) asks a sample of patients, how they would rate hospital food and if they were offered a choice of food. The Healthcare Commission's Maternity Survey 2007 also asked women for information about the quality and quantity of food they received during their time in hospital. Additionally, patients are able to comment directly to the nursing staff on the ward. This will facilitate an immediate resolution to any problems at source. Trusts may also conduct their own patient satisfaction questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction with hospital meals.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.5/2">All hospital inpatients are entitled to have their meals provided free of charge in National Health Service hospitals. Some patients may wish to bring their own food into hospital and individual trusts will advise patients on whether this is appropriate. They will also advise on the safe management of food they bring in.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.5/3">Patients who have identified food allergies should be provided with an appropriate meal that meets their dietary needs. The patient's name and diet type is normally clearly identified on the meal.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.5/4">The Food Standards Agency has issued best practice advice to help food retailers and caterers selling foods that is not pre-packed to give information on the allergen content of the foods they provide. These principles are applicable to healthcare caterers. The guidance is voluntary.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.5/5">Local National Health Service trusts are responsible for nutrition screening policies. To help trusts devise their policies we have produced Essence of Care which sets benchmarks for screening and assessment to identify patients' nutritional needs in health and social care settings, and helps healthcare professionals form appropriate care plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.5/6">We have also produced the Improving Nutritional Care, which outlines a range of actions to tackle malnutrition and ensure the nutritional needs of older people in hospitals and care homes are better met. It aims to ensure that health and social care staff and managers are well informed, equipped and supported to provide good nutrition and effective nutritional care.</p>

	Southampton Docks: Container Crane

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-02-07b.205.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="205"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80207w0002.htm#08020769000097">
	<p pid="b.205.2/1">The immediate impact of the collapse of the crane (and the subsequent withdrawal from service of a number of other similar cranes, pending inspection) has been that around 40 per cent of vessels have had to be diverted from Southampton to other European container ports. However, by increasing the productivity of other cranes, Southampton Container Terminals Limited (SCT) has continued to serve the larger turnaround vessels from China and the Far East, minimising the impact on customers and the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/2">SCT are working with the crane inspectors and the HSE to ensure that the affected cranes are phased back into operation as soon as possible. In addition, two new &quot;super post panamax&quot; gantry cranes are expected to become operational during June 2008. On this basis, it is unlikely that the incident will have a significant impact on UK container capacity beyond the short term.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.0/1">The Government hold regular discussions with mobile phone companies operating in the UK at which a number of issues are discussed. The regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), holds discussions with all the UK mobile phone operators regarding the roaming regulations generally, including compliance with the pricing caps.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/2">The Mobile Roaming (European Communities) Regulations which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-30">30 July 2007</phrase> set a downward path for the cost of both calls made and received in each of the next three years. Moreover, the regulations require regulators to report on progress in the roaming market and the EU Commission is obliged to bring forward proposals by December 2008 on whether it wants to extend regulation beyond time period of three years. The Government would continue to welcome comment from either business or consumers on the implementation and future of regulation in this area.</p>
