Its remit as a group is not to receive representations from and to meet outside individuals and organisations.

	<p pid="a.55.2/22">The department's Arts in Health group has met once since <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-16">16 September 2008</phrase>. At that meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-10">10 November 2008</phrase> the issue of embedding arts and health into department's policy was discussed. While the department supports several arts-related programmes, the group recognised that further work needs to be done to establish arts and health firmly within departmental policy. There has been difficulty in identifying a single clinical lead to add legitimacy to the work and there have been no dedicated resources available. Since the November meeting, funding has been secured for 2009-2010 to provide expert advice to support the development of the department's internal structure in relation to arts and health.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/23">Professor Louis Appleby and Professor Rob Smith have been appointed the department's joint leads on arts in health. Several briefings have been offered to Ministers relating to Arts in Health matters, however, there have been no direct policy submissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/24">Progress on the eight recommendations of the 2007 Report of the Review of Arts and Health Working Group include the following.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/25"><I>Recommendation 1</I></p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/26">The Secretary of State for Health made a statement that the arts have a key role to play in healthcare in his speech at the Wallace Collection in London on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-16">16 September 2009</phrase>. Since resources have been made available for 2009-2010, the department is now in a position to consider how arts and health can be included more regularly in its policies, and whether systems and incentives should be adapted to reflect the contribution of arts and health.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/27"><I>Recommendation 2</I></p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/28">The joint publication of the department and Health and Arts Council England <I>A prospectus for arts and health </I>was published in 2007 and this has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/29"><I>Recommendation 4</I></p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/30">The department has had initial discussions with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and other interested organisations in relation to identifying funding sources and identifying how arts and health can contribute more fully to health and wider government objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/31"><I>Recommendation 8</I></p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/32">The department currently encourages NHS organisations proposing new build and refurbishment schemes to build in provision for arts and health through its existing guidance and the capital investment process.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/33">The funding secured for 2009-2010 will enable the department to call on specific arts and health expertise, which will support the development of objectives over the coming year relating to both internal policy development and external liaison with stakeholders and co-ordination of work in the expanding field of arts and health.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.3/1">Details on the number of public (local authority) housing schemes are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/2">However in calendar year 2008, there were 395 local authority housing starts, and 450 local authority housing completions.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/3"><I>Source: New build starts and completions from P2 quarterly returns submitted by local authorities to Communities and Local Government.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/4">Although no formal assessment has been made as to the direct effect of local authority house building on homelessness, all local authorities have a homelessness strategy in place to tackle and prevent homelessness. The latest set of homelessness statistics (October - December 2008) show that homelessness acceptances are down by 21 against the same quarter in 2007 and those being placed in temporary accommodation had also reduced by 15 per cent over the same period. The Government have provided over &pound;150 million of homelessness grant from 2008-2011 to local authorities to tackle and prevent homelessness effectively, the biggest ever cash injection provided for homelessness services.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/5">Although RSLs are private sector bodies, many receive grant through the Homes and Communities Agency to provide affordable homes for either social rented or low-cost home ownership. Since the early 1990s RSLs have been the major providers of low-cost, sub-market, rented housing and the main developers of new social housing for people on low incomes and in housing need.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.3/1">We are committed to providing protection for those individuals found to need it in accordance with our obligations under international law. We closely monitor the situation in Sudan and, based on the latest available evidence, do not accept that all Darfuris should be afforded asylum in the UK. Neither do we accept that it is unsafe to return all Darfuris to Khartoum. Protection needs vary between individuals, which is why each asylum claim is carefully considered on its individual merits.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.3/1">In January 2009, the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) and the Research, Information and Communications Unit (RICU) commissioned a creative media agency, Bold Creative, to develop a communications toolkit for local delivery partners. This built on work that had been done by Bold Creative the previous year under the auspices of the West London Alliance (led by the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham), which included a 12-month period of research and consultation with West London communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/2">The communications toolkit is intended as a practical reference manual for local authorities and partner agencies, including members of local strategic partnerships, to help them to implement effective communications around the Prevent agenda. The toolkit provides step-by-step guidance on best practice in areas such as developing and implementing local Prevent communications strategies, identifying target audiences and the most effective channels for reaching them, planning effective campaigns and communications activities, and reacting to media and wider community interest in Prevent-related issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/3">The first draft of the toolkit will be circulated among key stakeholders for their comments in the coming weeks, with a view to publishing the final document by the end of May.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.2/1">During the last three years at Hydebank Wood, 635 young offenders have been screened for indicators of dyslexia. Of these, 197 had one or more indicators for dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/2">Screening is carried out by teaching staff as part of a wider educational assessment and it is not therefore possible separately to identify the costs. Staff at Hydebank Wood use Quick Scan, a computerised screening tool developed for students in further education. As well as identifying indicators for dyslexia, it also provides an analysis of students' strengths and weaknesses in a range of educational disciplines.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/3">Relevant information from the assessment is passed to those teachers who will be working with the individual, enabling them to make appropriate, reasonable adjustments to their lessons. This information is also made available to agencies working within Hydebank Wood, via the prisoner's individual resettlement plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/4">Individuals are not screened for indicators of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but where a prisoner self-reports, or where staff believe this may be beneficial, they can be referred to specific programmes within the prison facilitated by Northern Ireland Attention Deficit Disorder. These programmes are designed to help them manage their condition. Prisoners can also be referred to a GP if healthcare staff and the prisoner believe that medication may be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/5">The Criminal Justice System does not monitor separately reoffending rates for those showing indications of dyslexia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/6">NIPS do not currently hold information on how many prisoners screened for indicators of dyslexia have self-reported learning difficulties other than dyslexia, or what those difficulties are. However it is hoped to trial additional screening tools at Hydebank Wood in the autumn, which will give better information on prisoners displaying indicators of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
