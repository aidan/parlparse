	<p pid="a.1.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2" qnum="HL1786">Whether they are aware of the recent article in the New York Times (23 March) referring to reports of the transfer of Scud weapons by Iraq to Sudan to avoid detection by United Nations inspectors and current proposals for the building of a ballistic missile plant near Khartoum by North Korea, with financial support of 475 million dollars from Iraq; and, if so, what is their response to these reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.2/1">Allegations that Iraq has hidden Scud missiles in Sudan have been circulating for at least two years. While it was able to operate in Iraq, the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) reported no evidence of any missile transfers by Iraq to any other country since the Gulf conflict and the imposition of sanctions in 1991. Likewise, we have no evidence to suggest that such transfers have occurred. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about substantial gaps in Iraq's disclosures to UNSCOM. For this reason, and because UN inspectors have been unable to operate in Iraq since December 1998, we cannot be sure that some transfers have not occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">We are concerned about the allegation that Iraq is financing the building of a ballistic missile plant by North Korea in Sudan and are monitoring the situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.5/1">The UK remains committed to the OSCE arms embargo against both Azerbaijan and Armenia, which the UK interprets as covering all goods and technology controlled under entries in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 (commonly known as the military list).</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">We have recently approved the export of 60 protective vests for demining operations to Azerbaijan. These will be used by the United Nations Development Programme during humanitarian landmine clearance operations. While the grant of this licence constitutes an exception to the UK's interpretation of the scope of the embargo, it is in no way inconsistent with the purpose of the embargo and our continuing commitment to uphold it. It also reflects the determination of the Government to eliminate the scourge of landmines.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.2/1">Poverty elimination depends on a level of sustainable economic growth which outstrips population growth. Investment is key to achieving the economic growth necessary to meet international development targets. CDC's investment policy focuses on investment in poorer countries. This policy is entrenched under the framework designed for the public/private partnership and which became effective at CDC's transformation into a plc last December (when CDC was registered under the name of CDC Group plc). This requires that over a rolling five year period a minimum of 70 per cent of new investments by CDC must be made in poorer countries (defined for this purpose as having a GNP per capita of less than 1,740 US dollars on World Bank data published in 1998). It also requires that CDC should seek to make at least half its investments each year in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. CDC's annual report for 1999 records that over the last five years 83 per cent of CDC's new investments were made in poorer countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.8/1">Racist incidents have been significantly under-reported by the public and under-recorded by the police in the past. Figures from the 1996 British Crime Survey indicate that in 1995 of 382,000 racist incidents reported by the respondents to the survey, only 172,000 were reported to the police, compared with 12,222 recorded by the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/2">The police service as a whole has been working to increase reporting and recording of racist incidents. In 1998-99, 23,049 racist incidents were recorded by the police, an increase of 66 per cent on the previous year. Actions taken include the adoption of a new, simplified definition of a racist incident as recommended by the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report; and guidelines recently issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers on the recording of racist incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/3">While the City of London's increase of 367 per cent seems large in relation to the national increase of 66 per cent, the actual figures involved are small. The numerical increase is from six recorded incidents in 1997-98 to 28 recorded incidents in 1998-99.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.0/1">Live and blank ammunition is allocated to Army cadet force (ACF) and combined cadet force (CCF) units on a slightly different basis because of the different training patterns they follow. ACF units are allocated a higher quantity of ammunition per head because they train on a continuous and regular basis throughout the year. CCF units are allocated a slightly lower quantity because they generally train only during school term time, but the CCF receives an additional central pool allocation of ammunition which individual units are able to draw on if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/2">The actual amounts of ammunition issued and drawn are matters for each individual unit. This varies considerably from unit to unit, both in the ACF and the CCF. There is no shortage of ammunition available for the use of cadets.</p>

It is one of a number of EU instruments currently delayed on this issue. The issue is the subject of ongoing discussions between Spain and the UK, in consultation with the Government of Gibraltar.

	<p pid="a.18.2/1">The Government fund health and medical research in a number of ways. The Department of Health funds research and development to support its work on policy development and evaluation in health and social care. The department also manages the National Health Service research and development funding which is used to support research and development of relevance to the NHS in hospitals, general practice and other healthcare settings and to fund the NHS research and development programme. In addition, the Medical Research Council (MRC)--which receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the office of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry--funds medical research as part of the Government's funding of the science and engineering base.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/2">The table given in col. WA 166 gave estimates of expenditure for six different cancers. The latest figures available for Department of Health and MRC expenditure in those six cancers are for financial year 1998-99. The figures are:</p>

	<p pid="a.19.2/1">It is HSE policy that all allegations of ill health as a result of pesticide exposure are fully investigated. HSE has followed and continues to follow this policy with respect to the complaints regarding Mersley Farm.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">HSE's Employment Medical Advisory Service has been involved with the investigations of these complaints arising from the illegal use of pesticides, also in accordance with HSE policy. Its role is to consider whether or not the ill- health is consistent with exposure to pesticides. As part of this process it consults with general practitioners, consultants and hospitals to evaluate the medical records of complainants. With this information, a professional decision is made as to what additional clinical investigations are warranted on an individual basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">It is also HSE policy to refer cases of alleged pesticide related illness to the Pesticide Incidents Appraisal Panel (PIAP) which has the role of contributing to epidemiological surveillance of pesticide safety. By taking an overview of these cases, a statistical picture can be obtained which is used to inform the approvals process. The majority of Mersley Farm cases have now been referred to PIAP. All will be assessed by the panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/4">More specific epidemiological studies are not a routine part of HSE's investigation work. They would not normally be appropriate in the context of complaints of this type involving usually no more than a few individuals. However, HSE is currently considering whether there would be any benefit gained from an epidemiological study relating to Mersley Farm. The feasibility of undertaking an informative epidemiological investigation will be assessed over the next six months. The findings will be made public and followed up as appropriate.</p>

The aim of the proposed schemes, for which &pound;26 million has been provided, is to enable the pig industry to restore its long-term viability. It is intended that the scheme will have three elements--a total exodus element, an outgoers element and a restructuring element for those who wish to remain in pig production.

	<p pid="a.22.11/6">The Business Excellence Programme uses benchmarking to compare business performance against the competition and the best companies in the sector; the International Partnership Programme can help companies achieve global success through a strategic alliance with an overseas company; and Trade International, IDB's marketing arm, offers companies assistance in finding new markets via a programme of participation in overseas trade shows, visits to new overseas target markets, meet-the-buyer events, exporting seminars and the Overseas Trade Adviser Programme. For companies with under 250 employees, Trade International's market entry grant scheme may also be appropriate to stimulate marketing development.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.11/7">In addition to IDB's range of assistance, the Industrial Research and Technology Unit (IRTU) can offer grant assistance towards eligible R&amp;D and new product development projects.
