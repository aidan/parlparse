	<p pid="a.319.2/1">Requirements in respect of the recruitment and training of aviation security staff, including supervisors are set out in European and domestic regulations and include requirements for appropriate pre-employment checks (including security vetting). The Department for Transport (DfT) aviation security inspectors monitor compliance with the EU and UK regulatory requirements. EU regulations are, in addition, monitored by EU inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/2">The regulations do not cover numbers, recruitment and disciplinary processes, specific requirements for supervision or terms and conditions for security staff. These are operational matters for individual airport operators to determine. The DfT therefore does not hold information on the numbers of security staff employed in the industry or the number of staff dismissed. This information is held only by the operators themselves.</p>

Quality is also subject to scrutiny through departmental audit, the quality assurance framework, the National Audit Office and the Chief Inspector. The Integrated Casework Programme due to be fully implemented by 2015 will introduce a degree of automation into decision making thereby reducing discretion and the scope for errors.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-09">9 February</phrase>, the Chancellor announced a new commitment by the UK's biggest high street banks on lending expectations and capacity. As part of this commitment, the banks will make available appropriate capital and resources to support &#163;190 billion of new credit to businesses in 2011, up from &#163;179 billion in 2010. If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more, including creating the balance sheet capacity necessary to do so. &#163;76 billion of this lending capacity will be available to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is a 15 per cent increase on 2010 lending of &#163;66 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/2">The banks have entered into the commitment on an aggregate basis. The Bank of England will report the banks' performance against the commitment on a quarterly basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/3">Project Merlin targets gross committed lending. The Government inherited a position where businesses and households are over-indebted. The economy needs to rebalance and businesses and households need to delever. The economy, therefore, needs both a large volume of repayments and a substantial amount of gross new lending. While banks cannot control the rate at which businesses want to delever, they can focus on supplying the finance that UK businesses need to grow. It is therefore appropriate to target gross committed lending. As set out in the published agreement, this definition includes refinancing activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.333.2/1">The Government considers that the current environmental regulatory framework is sufficiently robust to deal with any risks to groundwater that may arise from fracking operations. Operators wishing to undertake fracking within England or Wales are obliged to notify the Environment Agency (EA) of this intention under Section 32 and/or Section 199 of the Water Resources Act 1991. The EA takes a risk-based approach to the regulation of fracking activities under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 (EPR), and will assess the permitting requirements for each proposal on a site-by-site basis, considering the design of the fracking operations and its proximity to ground and surface waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.333.2/2">A permit will be required where fluids containing pollutants are injected into rock formations that contain groundwater. A permit may also be needed if the activity poses a risk of mobilising natural substances that could then cause pollution. The permit will specify limits on the activity, any requirements for monitoring, the chemicals to be used and in what maximum concentrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.333.2/3">If the activity poses an unacceptable risk to the environment the EA will not issue a permit. If the EA decides that the activity cannot affect groundwater, a permit will not be necessary. However, such activities are still subject to the EPR. If a significant risk or an actual impact becomes apparent, the EA may issue a notice under the EPR requiring the operator to obtain a permit, or in extreme situations, a notice to prohibit the activity.</p>

The public consultation process enables patients and the public to have the opportunity to make their views known. This is an open process and is not predetermined.

In response to concerns that have been set out by the board of the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation about the potential impact to paediatric respiratory services at the Royal Brompton Hospital, the JCPCT has convened an expert clinical panel to investigate the issues and report to it in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/4">We would expect the JCPCT, before taking a decision, to consider this report as well as an independent analysis of the consultation responses, reports from overview and scrutiny committees, and a health impact assessment.

	<p pid="a.340.3/1">The quantifiable additional costs to the House of Lords of the sittings on 3-<phrase class="date" code="2011-10-06">6 October</phrase> are estimated as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.340.3/4"> <td>Members' finance</td> <td>&#163;496,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.340.3/5"> <td>Works</td> <td>40 per cent of &#163;25-30,000 (the other 60 per cent will fall to the House of Commons)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.340.3/6"> <td>Catering</td> <td>&#163;7,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.340.3/7"> <td>Other administrative costs</td> <td>At least &#163;3,000</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.340.3/10">There will be additional costs to the Parliamentary Estates Directorate and the Department of Facilities, which cannot be quantified. And there may be additional administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.3/11">The figures set out above assume that the House will sit to 10 pm or beyond on Monday-Wednesday; that attendance, Members' finance claims and catering business will be average; that the House will not sit on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-07">Friday 7 October</phrase>; that there will be no Grand Committee; and that the House of Commons will not sit.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.3/12">The 40 per cent of &#163;25-30,000 quoted above for works is the likely cost of the impact on the mechanical and electrical programme, the purpose of which is to refit the mechanical and electrical building services within the Palace of Westminster. During the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-03">3 October</phrase>, work is planned to renovate the lift from Peers' Cloakroom to the Principal Floor, so there will be disruption to this service during that period. The fact that the House will be sitting in the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-03">3 October</phrase> also means that there will be some disruption to the programme for occupation of Millbank House. Members will be notified about this in due course.</p>

For students and their dependants, in the absence of suitable similar data, the output effect was captured by a proxy measure derived from their average expenditure. The breakdown of the annual costs and benefits each year, including the output effects, is set out on page 24 of the Impact Assessment. The need to provide housing for students was considered but we were unable to estimate the precise impact this might have, for example on rents or capacity.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.5/2">The UK remains extremely concerned by the human rights situation in Iran: there have been over 250 executions in 2011; more journalists are in prison than in any other country in the world; two opposition leaders have been held incommunicado since February without justification; the state continues to persecute religious, ethnic and linguistic minorities; and the regime has brutally suppressed peaceful protests, such as those on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-12">12 June</phrase> to mark the second anniversary of the disputed 2009 Presidential Elections. These actions are contrary to Iran's international obligations and its constitution. We frequently call on Iran to respect human rights and will continue to highlight abuses internationally including at the UN. We support the recent appointment of Dr Ahmed Shaheed as UN Special Rapporteur on Iran and encourage Iran to co-operate with him to improve the situation.</p>

The building of settlements and actions to restrict Palestinian movement and access in the West Bank by Israel, including establishing a secondary road system to separate Palestinian and Israeli traffic, represents an attempt to create facts on the ground which makes a two-state solution, with Jerusalem as a shared capital, harder to achieve. We are seriously concerned about continuing restrictions on freedom of movement in the OPTs and their impact on Palestinian economic development and quality of life. These concerns can only be addressed properly by removing settlements and their infrastructure, which are illegal under international law, re-routing the barrier to within the Green Line and removing check points. We continue to make this clear to the Israeli Government.</p>

The majority of Orders and Instructions are available via the Ministry of Justice website which is in the public domain. For Orders and Instructions that are not published on the website there are locally agreed mechanisms to ensure that the contracted prisons staff can either access the NOMS intranet or are provided copies of the Orders and Instructions by the on-site NOMS Controllers' Teams.</p>
