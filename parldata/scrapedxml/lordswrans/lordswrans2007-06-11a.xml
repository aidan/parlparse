	<p pid="a.230.2/1">Health visitors and nurses working in the community have a key role in assessing local health needs and demonstrating to commissioners their contribution to better health outcomes, in particular for disadvantaged groups. Health visitors provide a progressive universal service to all families and identify health needs to enable them to work closely with the most vulnerable children and families. They focus on early intervention and prevention and much of the work of health visitors involves identifying where children are at risk, and in their contribution to child protection plans for specific children and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/2">We have introduced a number of policies aimed at the strengthening of prevention and the integration of services which has been consistently endorsed in <I>Every Child Matters</I>, the Chief Nursing Officer's review of the nursing contribution to vulnerable children; the national service framework for children, <I>Young People and Maternity Services, Our Health, our care, our say, Maternity Matters</I>, and, the policy review of children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/3">We are reviewing the role of health visitors. This review is being informed by the views and experiences of a wide range of stakeholders, including frontline health visitors, which have been gathered through a series of regional events called &quot;Let's talk about health visiting&quot;. These events engaged with practitioners, local leaders and commissioners in clarifying the role of health visitors for the future. This work is closely linked to the Modernising Nursing Careers career pathways and educational preparation of all nurses working in the community, ensuring the community workforce is fit for the future.</p>

The department is trying to ensure that there is transparency for the NHS between the reimbursement price for items and remuneration for services provided; there is none today. The department also wants to ensure that the NHS and the taxpayer are getting value for money. In addition, a key objective is to maintain and improve the quality of patient care.</p>

Here the intent was to ensure fair remuneration of valued services provided by the pharmacy and appliance contractors. It was also designed to make sure that the services provided by all dispensing contractors are to the same standard no matter where in England a user of appliances may live.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.6/1">No assessment has been made. The sponsorship of specialist nurses by dispensing appliance contractors is not part of the scope of the Part IX review.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.6/2">The review of Part IX of the Drug Tariff is concerned with what the National Health Service pays for items and for services. The department is trying to ensure that there is transparency for the NHS between the reimbursement price for items and remuneration for services provided; there is none today. The department also wants to ensure that the NHS and the taxpayer are getting value for money. In addition, a key objective is to maintain and improve the quality of patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.6/3">The most recent consultations closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April 2007</phrase>. Given the volume of the responses to the consultation, the department has decided that it needs more time to analyse the information provided. Consequently, no changes will be implemented in July 2007 as proposed in the consultation documents.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.2/1">Local National Health Service organisations in England are responsible for the development of maternity services. The 2007-08 NHS operating framework requires them to undertake reviews of their maternity services, identify the gaps and barriers to service development and set out their local strategy for delivery of the recommendations in <I>Maternity Matters&mdash;Choice, access and continuity of care in a safe service</I><I>,</I> published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-03">3 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/2">Distance should not be the only factor, as safety, risk and travelling times are equally important. Wherever women have their babies, the local maternity network will ensure easy access to, and transfer between, all levels of care in a responsive and timely manner.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.3/1">The average length of stay for women at Rampton Hospital, including those on trial leave, was 4.5 years as of April 2007. It should be noted, however, that this average figure is based on a broad variation among individual patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.3/2">Patients are discharged from Rampton Hospital when their assessed level of risk is such that their treatment can be continued in conditions of lesser security. This typically involves patients transferring to medium secure units, but in the near future will also include the new women's enhanced medium-secure services available in London, Leicestershire, and in the north-west. There are regular care programme approach meetings, at least yearly but initially six months after admission, where the patient's care pathway is reviewed in the presence of commissioners and representatives from the regional secure units. The progress of individual patients is also subject to independent review by mental health review tribunals, which have the power to discharge patients, albeit with the need for agreement of the Ministry of Justice for those patients on restriction orders. A small number of patients, who are not responding to treatment, may be returned to prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.0/1">Recent research by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NfER), co-sponsored by the Department for Education and Skills, suggests that provision for learning outside the classroom has either stayed broadly the same or increased over the past five years. Within this, visits to field studies centres, nature reserves, and other natural environments remain a popular and significant element, particularly in primary and special schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/2">Through the <I>Learning Outside the Classroom Manifesto</I> launched last November, we have formed a partnership dedicated to increasing the quality and quantity of out-of-classroom learning opportunities for all children and young people. This builds on a range of previous work, including the popular growing schools programme which has helped a large number of schools to make greater use of their own grounds and visits to farms and the countryside to support teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/3">The work now being taken forward as part of the manifesto promotes the use of out-of-classroom opportunities across the whole curriculum. To support this, the department is now commissioning a major &quot;out and about&quot; package of training and guidance to support schools and early-years settings to provide more and better opportunities for learning outside the classroom. We are also working closely with provider organisations to help them co-ordinate their efforts and meet schools' needs more effectively.</p>
