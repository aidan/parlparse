	<p pid="a.232.3/4">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) uses the International Passenger Survey (IPS) to estimate flows of international migrants into and out of the United Kingdom. The IPS is a sample survey and cannot provide monthly estimates of migration. However ONS does provide annual estimates of migrants entering and leaving the UK for work-related reasons. The latest migration estimates, for 2007, show that 243,000 people entered the UK for work related reasons and 173,000 left.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-07">7 February 2009</phrase>, following violent demonstrations that included the fatal shooting of 28 protesters in Antananarivo, we advised against all travel to Madagascar. As tensions eased following meetings between the two parties, we subsequently lowered the level of travel advice to advise against all but essential travel on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-24">24 February 2009</phrase>. Our decisions were based on reports from a range of sources across Madagascar, including reports from our honorary consuls in Antananarivo and Toamasima, the resident diplomatic community, the British Interests Section in Antananarivo, and a temporarily seconded member of staff based in Port Louis. We also followed reporting closely in the local media and made extensive use of an innovative &quot;wiki&quot; website through which British citizens in Madagascar could report what was happening on the ground in towns and cities across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/2">Almost all international travellers arrive and leave Madagascar via Antananarivo, which has, of course, been the focal point for the recent demonstrations between the Government of President Ravalomanana and former-Mayor of Antananarivo Andry Rajoelina's opposition. Although tourists were not specifically targeted, outbursts did occur in the vicinity of hotels and areas in which tourists could potentially be situated.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/3">The safety of British Citizens travelling overseas is our overriding concern and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's travel advice is written with this in mind. The decision to advise against all or all but essential travel is not taken lightly and is ultimately made at ministerial level, with input from our overseas network and consular advisers using their expertise to take a global perspective on such crises. The political situation in Madagascar was highly volatile, with the opposition openly stating an intent to overthrow the Government, possibly through means of mass protests and seizures of government property. During periods of unrest such as these we review our travel advice at least once a day.</p>

Where services or roles and duties transfer from the current provider to a new provider, either during the creation of a joint waste authority or following contracting/re-tendering exercises post-vesting, then the staff working in these areas are likely to transfer to the joint waste authority. Accordingly, the TUPE Regulations 2006 and the Cabinet Office Statement of Practice on Staff Transfers in the Civil Service 2000 (COSOP) are likely to apply. Further detail is available in the statutory guidance which accompanies the Joint Waste Authorities (Proposals) Regulations, available on Defra's website.</p>
