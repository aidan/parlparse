Five Afghan women also attended the Prince of Wales' reception on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-27">27 January 2010</phrase>, where they used the opportunity to lobby President Karzai, Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton, Richard Holbrooke as well as the Foreign Ministers of India, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, Norway, Afghanistan, Belgium, France, UK Ministers, and senior North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials. These events were followed by the presentation of a statement by Afghan women to the London conference itself, delivered by Arzo Qanih, one of the civil society representatives and spokesperson for the Afghan Women's Network. A written statement on behalf of Afghan women was also circulated to all conference participants.</p>

The error did not have any implications for any other parts of the report such as the overall estimate of the cost and risks of climate change. When it was spotted, it was corrected in the electronic version of the report on the HM Treasury website and the subsequent version of the report published by Cambridge University Press. The change was also flagged in the &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; (FAQs) document. This was available online before <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-09">9 December 2006</phrase>, less than six weeks after launch on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October 2006</phrase>.

These figures should have been 0.13 per cent (0.06 per cent) as they were obtained from a paper by Nordhaus (2006). This was a typographic error. Indeed the text on page 130 of the ring-bound version in box 5.3 stated the correct figure: &quot;Nordhaus (2006) shows that just a small increase in hurricane intensity (5-10 per cent), which several models predict will occur 2-3&#176;C of warming globally, could alone double costs of storm damage to around 0.13 per cent GDP&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.6/1">The UK's Government Computer Emergency Response Team (GovCertUK) and Combined Security Incident Response Team (CSIRTUK) provide response and analysis to the public sector and critical infrastructure providers respectively. The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) and CESG (the national technical authority for information assurance) also provide advice and guidance on electronic attack/cyber attack to the critical national infrastructure and to government departments. Organisations such as the Ministry of Defence also run their own CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams).</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/2">The Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) was set up in September 2009 with staff drawn from a range of government and other key stakeholders. It provides a hub for strategic analysis of developments in cyberspace, and improving the co-ordination of the UK's response to cyber incidents. CSOC's work will draw together a broad range of sources to enable a better understanding of the risks and opportunities of cyberspace, ensure information is coherently distributed to government, industry, international partners and the public, and help inform strategic decision-making.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/3">The Office of Cyber Security (OCS) was set up at the same time as CSOC to provide coherence and strategic leadership across the Government's cybersecurity policy interests. This includes horizon scanning to consider impact of an evolving cyber landscape for the UK's cybersecurity, and working with partners across government to identify and implement the appropriate policy responses.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.0/1">We are concerned about human rights in Syria. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has raised human rights when he has met Syrian Foreign Minister Muallem. My honourable friend the Minister of State at the Foreign Office, Mr Lewis, reiterated in a Westminster Hall debate on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-24">24 June 2009</phrase> that Kurdish rights were still not legitimised within the Syrian constitution. We have highlighted our concerns about the general situation of Kurds in Syria in our 2008 annual human rights report.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/2">My officials in Damascus have regular contact with Kurdish human rights defenders and monitor the situation closely, including the rights to citizenship and language rights. They have been following the cases of Hassan Ibrahim Saleh, Mohamed Mustapha, Maroof Mullah Ahmed, Anwar Nasso, Dilbireen Osei Hamdeen and Havraz Mohammed Amin Hassan. We have not raised their cases specifically-among the many hundreds of political prisoners in Syria-but with the EU are focusing our lobbying on small number of high-profile individuals (such as the prominent human rights lawyer Haitham al Maleh).</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/3">The criminal justice system in Syria is in need of reform and, where possible, we have sought to push this process forward. Unfortunately, it is common for detainees to be denied access to legal representation for some time while in custody. Of particular concern is the Supreme State Security Court, a special court that exists outside the ordinary criminal justice system to prosecute those perceived as challenging the Government. This court is exempt from the rules of criminal procedure that apply in Syria's criminal courts. Defence lawyers usually see their clients for the first time on the day of the trial and the court denies them the opportunity to engage in oral defence or call on witnesses. Most trials consist of four short sessions, often less than 30 minutes each. Defendants have no right to appeal their verdict to a higher tribunal.</p>

The presidency noted there was credible information to suggest that the sentences appeared to be politically motivated. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-20">20 January 2010</phrase>, my honourable friend Ivan Lewis raised the cases directly with the Iranian ambassador, expressing concern at reports that they faced imminent execution. Mr Lewis reiterated our long-held concerns about the trials not meeting international standards, and urged the Iranian Government to show clemency.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.3/3">These executions undermine Iran's claimed commitment to justice, human rights, and democratic values. Our long-standing opposition to capital punishment under all circumstances is clear; we raise these concerns with the Iranian authorities bilaterally and through the EU at every appropriate opportunity. We did so on over 70 separate occasions last year, and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">There are two incentives available specifically for bus travel to work. The first exempts an employee from tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) on the benefit of an employer-provided work bus service, subject to certain conditions. There is a second exemption from tax and NICs where an employee benefits from an employer giving a subsidy or other support to a bus service provider to introduce, continue or improve a local public bus route. This exemption is subject to certain other conditions and does not apply where a subsidy is provided for local bus services generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/2">There are no specific incentives for rail travel to work. However, an employer can provide an interest-free loan, or a loan with a rate of interest below normal commercial rates, to an employee. Subject to certain conditions about the amount of the loan, the interest foregone on the loan is not treated as a taxable benefit. This loan may used to assist the employee in the purchase of a season ticket for public transport by bus or rail but is not confined to this purpose.</p>
