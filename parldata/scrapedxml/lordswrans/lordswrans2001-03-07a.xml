The results, which are currently being collated, will be published in the 10th annual report by the Prison Service Race Relations Group to the Prison Service Management Board, due out in early summer. The Prison Service will also be discussing this issue further with members of the Advisory Group on Religion in Prison, in particular to consider drawing up guidelines for prisons on the requirements and use of such rooms.</p>

A Prison Service Order on the Management of Prisoners with Physical, Sensory or Mental Disabilities has been published to ensure that the Governors of all prison establishments, including those holding life sentence prisoners, are aware of the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. A working party has been set up to develop a strategy for the reasonable adjustment of prison service premises in order to remove physical barriers to access to services and facilities by 2004, as required by the third stage of the Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.8/17">In overall terms, the number of air traffic controllers employed by NATS broadly meets the budgeted manpower requirement. However, there are some shortfalls in particular areas. At the end of January, the Area Control operation had four controllers in excess of the total requirement for 467 controllers, including 33 in training. The Terminal Control operation had 13 controllers less than the total requirement for 322 controllers, including 42 in training. Scottish area control operations had a shortfall of eight against the total requirement of 239 controllers, including 22 in training, and Manchester area control operations had a shortfall of nine against the total requirement of 121 controllers, including four in training. The NATS airports were six controllers above the total requirement of 527, with 45 staff in training. NATS will still be able to cope safely with expected levels of air traffic without a significant increase in delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.8/18">The training system is prioritised to allocate trainees to areas of shortage. The intake of student controllers is being increased from 120 per year to 180 per year from the middle of 2001. This is to provide for the replacement of retiring controllers and to meet the ongoing growth in traffic.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.2/1">No funds are provided directly for Olympic athletes from tax financed resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/2">Funding for sport, in general, is provided from the exchequer and from the National Lottery and is distributed by UK Sport and the home country sports councils. Many Olympic sports benefit from exchequer grants which are directed towards developing the sporting infrastructure. Funds specifically for Olympic athletes are made available from the Lottery.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/3">Our elite athletes, including Olympians, benefit from funding from the Lottery through programmes such as the World Class Performance Programme, which is administered by the Sports Council's UK Sport for UK governing bodies and includes athletes from all parts of the United Kingdom; and Sport England is responsible for English governing bodies and English athletes. In addition, the home country sports councils also provide lottery support to our top athletes in home country based sports through Wales' Elite Cymru and Scotland and Northern Ireland's Talented Athlete Programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.5/1">The agreement to suspend the Bow Wave Process is welcomed as it indicates that Local Loop Unbundling is moving into a more settled phase. BT has stated that it is able to resource all requests for unbundling facilities on a &quot;business as usual&quot; basis. This will allow operators to implement their business plans on a more flexible basis and make it more straightforward for operators to achieve the geographic footprint they need in order to launch commercial broadband services. Oftel is also working with BT and operators in order to reduce the timescales for providing unbundling facilities in order to accelerate the delivery of local loop unbundling.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/2">Requests for co-location facilities at BT exchanges are currently being progressed and it is anticipated that the construction work at the first sites will begin around Easter. Orders for distant location from operators can proceed at a faster rate than preparation of co-location space within BT exchanges. High speed Internet access is already available in many areas to consumers over the networks operated by BT, Kingston, and the cable companies.</p>
