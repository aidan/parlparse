	<p pid="a.85.5/1">Policy towards rural poverty is a part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle deprivation and social exclusion and deliver high quality services for everyone. Initiatives to tackle poverty, deprivation and social exclusion, such as the Connexions service or Sure Start, are piloted in rural as well as urban areas so that in developing policies and disseminating best practice, rural impacts are fully taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/2">It must be pointed out that poverty levels are generally lower in rural areas and tend to be hidden within largely prosperous areas. This makes it difficult to quantify and target those who need help. Defra is undertaking work on this with partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/3">The Government have introduced a series of initiatives specifically to develop rural areas with a dynamic and inclusive economy, strong rural communities and fair access to services:</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/4" class="indent">(i) A new policy framework to provide a fair deal on services, help in regenerating the rural economy, and a strong voice for rural communities, set out in the Rural White Paper, accompanied by &pound;1 billion of additional funding in 2001&ndash;04 and underpinned by Defra's target for increased productivity and improved access to vital public services for all rural people.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/5" class="indent">(ii) Increased opportunities for access and enjoyment of the countryside through a comprehensive overhaul of legislation on access, rights of way and protection of biodiversity set out in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/6" class="indent">(iii) Creation of the role of Rural Advocate&mdash;currently Ewen Cameron, also Chairman of the Countryside Agency&mdash;who attends meetings of the new Cabinet sub-committee and acts as a voice for rural concerns within and outside government.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/7" class="indent">(iv) Setting up the Rural Affairs Forum for England to ensure that key rural stakeholders are involved throughout the policy-making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/8">The &pound;1.6 billion, seven-year England Rural Development Programme to help farmers and other rural businesses diversify and obtain support for conserving and enhancing the countryside contributes to the same objective.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.2/1">We have made a pledge to tackle age discrimination and we are committed to introducing age legislation covering employment, vocational training and guidance by 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/2">We are already encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practices through our Age Positive Campaign. The campaign raises employers' awareness of the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and encourages a flexible approach to retirement to open up choice and opportunity for individuals to stay in work longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/3">In 1999 we published the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment which sets out the standards for non-ageist approaches to recruitment, training, promotion, redundancy and retirement. The code was developed with leading organisations, including the CBI, TUC, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent to 13 per cent and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent to 7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/4">Older workers have a wealth of skills and experience that can benefit individual businesses and the economy as a whole. Our policies will help to improve further the employment rate of people over 50, which has risen considerably since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">There are no rules about admission to maintained schools that relate specifically to service families. Nor is there a requirement for service families to be back in England for six weeks before places can be reserved for their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/2">All parents have the right to express a preference for the school they wish their child to attend. But service families, in common with all parents who apply for school places outside the normal time of admission, may find it difficult to obtain places in their preferred schools, as popular schools will already have filled all their places.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/3">Admission authorities are not allowed to reserve places for blocks of children from service families but may allocate places to such children in advance of their families return to the UK if the Ministry of Defence can supply details of where the family will be living. The statutory Code of Practice on School Admissions, currently being revised following the new Education Act 2002, also advises local education authorities and school admission authorities to ensure that the needs of service families are taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.8/1">We welcome the recognition by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) that they must work to reduce the number of accidents involving police vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.8/2">Measures already in place include a new police driver training course, introduced in December 2000. An essential element of the course is that officers should recognise the need to give priority to public safety above all other considerations such as attending an incident or apprehending a suspect. Where pursuits are concerned, there is a nationally agreed ACPO pursuit code of practice and it is already police policy to consider continuously the consequences of a pursuit and whether to break it off. Operational measures to avoid pursuits or curtail them include the use of helicopters, the early deployment of tyre deflation devices across the carriageway, and tactical pursuit and containment in which a number of police vehicles box in the target vehicle and bring it safely to a halt.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.8/3">ACPO are working closely with the Police Complaints Authority to identify why there appears to be an upward trend in police vehicle accidents and how this might be avoided. Useful information can be expected from the increasing use by forces of automatic data recorders (ADR) and vehicle accident data recorders (VADR). The ADR and VADR operate in a similar way to aircraft black boxes, providing data on such issues as speed, gear changes, braking, vehicle performance and the use of blue lights.</p>

To introduce a system that provided a clear financial advantage in employing a particular group of employees based on their age would be unfair to other employees and contrary to the universal nature of the scheme.

	<p pid="a.95.5/1">Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a licence to export demining equipment to the United Nations Office for Project Services in mine clearance operations in northern Iraq. The export included an electronic hand held exploder that appears on the Military List. The conclusion that this export does not represent a proliferation threat has been reached after careful assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/2">The UN Iraq Sanctions Committee approved this export to Iraq under the Oil for Food programme (OFF). Under OFF, Iraq is allowed to export unlimited quantities of oil to fund the purchase of humanitarian goods. The export is consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.2/1">The noble Lord makes a useful suggestion. Transport for London states that it will be possible to pay the congestion charge at retail outlets across Greater London, though it is not yet clear what form these &quot;retail outlets&quot; will take and whether it will be possible to locate one within the Palace of Westminster. Other options for payment outlined by Transport for London include payment by credit or debit card at self-service machines, and the purchase of weekly, monthly or annual &quot;season tickets&quot;. Once we have more detail on these options, the two Houses will explore ways to facilitate payment by Members and staff. I shall write to the noble Lord again when the position is clearer.</p>
