	<p pid="a.213.5/1">A number of possible humanitarian consequences might arise from an increase in conflict between the Burmese army and armed ethnic groups in Burma. The Governments of countries neighbouring Burma are aware of the potential for increased flows of refugees following any upsurge in fighting, as are the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which provide assistance to Burmese refugees in Thailand. Members of the NGO Committee for the Co-ordination of Services to Displaced Persons in Thailand (CCSDPT) have undertaken contingency planning for possible increased humanitarian needs on the Thailand-Burma border. The Department for International Development (DfID) is providing about &#163;1.6 million this financial year to two CCSDPT member organisations for food, housing, other supplies and improved access to legal assistance for Burmese refugees in Thailand.</p>

Researchers are exploring the possibility of testing the polar bodies. This method would, however, be limited in its reliability as mitochondria do not segregate equally between oocytes and the polar body and there would be quite a high risk that the polar body was not representative of the whole oocyte. In addition, polar bodies are very small and degenerate very easily so this would be a very difficult technique to develop.

	<p pid="a.219.5/1">The Medical Research Council (MRC) and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) held a scientific workshop on a topic of mutual interest. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) represents a research area with a relatively small number of researchers, and where international collaboration might offer advantages due to the technical difficulties being tackled. The MRC and CIRM wished to examine the progress of the science in this area, and form a view as to whether human SCNT offered any specific opportunities compared to other methods of cellular reprogramming, and whether there might be a need for funding agencies to collaborate specifically in this area. The conclusion from the assembled expert working group was that although human SCNT remained technically challenging, much progress was being made and that there were several potential benefits that could emerge through SCNT.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.5/2">The forthcoming government review will be looking at current progress and the future trajectory of regenerative medicine, with a view to identifying how best to support UK scientists in delivering stem-cell based therapies and maintain the UK at the forefront in this area. It is not evident at present which area of stem cell research may deliver the most effective treatments for particular conditions, and the review will therefore consider all types of stem cell research.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.5/3">In keeping with the Haldane principle, prioritisation of an individual Research Council's spending within its allocation is not a decision for Ministers. Such decisions are rightly left to those best placed to evaluate the scientific efficacy of proposed research.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.2/1">The regulatory framework contained in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, as amended, safeguards the status of the human embryo and its use in treatment and research. These safeguards will remain in place regardless of any change in the regulator. This is clear and has been acknowledged by leading assisted reproduction professional bodies and clinicians following Professor Jardine's comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/2">One of the bodies to whom it is proposed to transfer functions currently carried out by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) is the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The CQC is the independent regulator of health and adult social care in England and has a key responsibility in the overall assurance of essential levels of safety and quality of health and adult social care services. It also has responsibilities for:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/3">providing independent assurance and publishing information on the safety and quality of services;registering providers of regulated activities (including National Health Service, adult social care and independent sector healthcare providers);monitoring compliance with a set of registration requirements;using tough enforcement powers, if necessary, to ensure service providers meet requirements;assessing the performance of providers and commissioners;undertaking special reviews of particular services at a national level, looking across providers and commissioners of health and adult social care;monitoring the use of the Mental Health Act; andhelping manage the impact of regulation on service providers and commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/4">Discussions are taking place between the department, HFEA, CQC and other regulatory bodies on the transfer of the functions currently carried out by the HFEA and how they will be discharged in the future, including the scope for streamlined and lighter touch regulation. The proposals will be subject to a public consultation later in the year. Subject to the ongoing discussions over the forthcoming months, we envisage that the consultation will include seeking comments on the body or bodies best suited to take on the range of information functions currently discharged by the HFEA.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/5">Around 80 per cent of the centres currently licensed by the HFEA are either also regulated by the CQC or are in premises the CQC regulates. The streamlining of regulatory functions, with the resulting removal of overlap between the regulatory bodies, is expected to generate savings from the rationalisation of support functions, including human resources, information technology, legal services and communications. In the financial year 2009-10 the HFEA's operational budget was &#163;7.2 million. We envisage savings not only in these costs but also in the cost to the regulated bodies of having to demonstrate compliance with the current regulatory systems. Analysis of this will develop during the consultation process.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.2/1">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) carried out a study on the emissions from commercially available compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), which included both visible light and ultraviolet emissions. The results have been published (<I>Optical Radiation Emissions from Compact Fluorescent Lamps</I> M Khazova and J B O'Hagan, Radiation Protection Dosimetry, 2008, 131(4):521-525; doi:10.1093/rpd/ncn234).

	<p pid="a.223.2/2">The results did not suggest that the emissions were likely to cause health effects in the general population, although HPA issued precautionary advice because approximately 20 per cent of the open (single envelope) CFLs studied emitted levels of ultraviolet radiation that could result in the guideline levels recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection being exceeded by people exposed within less than 30 centimetres (one foot) of the light bulb. In encapsulated (double envelope) light bulbs, the ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by the outer glass container. This advice is available on the HPA website at: <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/">www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/</a> 2008PressReleases/081009Emissionsfromcompactfluorescentlights/.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/3">The HPA continues to monitor technology developments in this area, including the various other types of energy saving lights, as part of its ongoing research programme on optical radiation safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/4">The independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation prepared a comprehensive review of the health effects from ultraviolet radiation (Documents of the NRPB Volume 13, No. 1, 2002), available at: <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/Publications/Radiation/NPRBArchive/DocumentsOfTheNRPB/Absd1301/">www.hpa.org.uk/Publications/Radiation/NPRBArchive/DocumentsOfTheNRPB/Absd1301/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/5">This report recognised that some people are particularly sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and light. The European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks is currently updating its opinion on light sensitivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/6">Rashes have many causes, which can only be ascertained following clinical investigation. The HPA has offered to work with clinicians who are treating photosensitive patients to assess the ultraviolet and light exposure that is implicated in adverse effects.</p>

UKFI's objective is to protect and create value for the taxpayer as shareholder, with due regard to the maintenance of financial stability, and to act in a way that promotes competition. The framework document agreed between HM Treasury and UKFI sets a requirement that UKFI will not intervene in the day-to-day management decisions of investee companies, and the companies continue to be managed by their own independent boards.</p>

We agree with the assessment by the United Nations office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that despite its legal framework of protection there remain many human rights challenges. A low awareness of human rights results in only those with sufficient resources being able to access the justice system. Insufficient human and financial resources mean that the police and judicial systems are not always in a position to enforce the rule of law. The police lack the capacity to investigate serious crimes, especially those relating to domestic violence, which is of particular concern. Our High Commission provides financial assistance to the Meri Seif Pies, a women's organisation that provides domestic abuse victims with a safe haven.</p>

This process allows for a review of the human rights records of Papua New Guinea and provides the opportunity for Papua New Guinea to declare what actions it has taken to fulfil its human rights obligations. The UK will respond to the reports submitted and provide recommendations to the national government.</p>

Primary legislation is required for the transfer (we aim to legislate at the earliest opportunity) and, of course, Parliament will have a full opportunity to scrutinise our proposals for transferring powers to the Mayor during that process. We have no plans for further formal debate on the framework document-it will have to be consistent with the primary legislation in any case, since it must reflect the will of Parliament-but its details, and the way it is applied, will be subject to scrutiny both through the newly reformed Board of the Royal Parks Agency, and the Mayor will be democratically accountable to both the London Assembly and to the London electorate in the normal way as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.2/1"><I>Efficacy of UKTI</I></p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/2">As part of the Government's Business Support Simplification Programme (BSSP) an internal government review was carried out of UKTI's service and product offers, which concluded that the services are effective in meeting a core need of UK business. UKTI has also been subject to a number of external assessments. In January 2010, the Business Innovation and Skills Committee (BISCOMM) inspected what needed to be done by Government to sustain and increase Britain's export strengths. The report (<I>HC 266 I/II</I>) described UKTI as a successful agency and a highly adept organisation whose services are valued by businesses. It praised UKTI's dedicated and professional staff. In October 2010, following a peer review by global international trade promotion organisations' UKTI won the award for best trade promotion organisation from a developed country, at the Trade Promotion Organisation (TPO) Network Awards. The biennial awards recognise institutional excellence among national export promotion agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/3"><I>Assessment of &#163;19:&#163;1</I></p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/4">The National Audit Office has reviewed UKTI's performance system-performance and impact monitoring system (PIMS), which is used to calculate UKTI's value for money statement &quot;for every &#163;1 of taxpayers' money spent our customers tell us that this generates &#163;19 of additional profit for business&quot;, in the context of its regular annual audits of methodologies used to report against spending review targets and value for money statements; and has consistently given UKTI its highest assessment, fit for purpose, for all measures and statements reported through PIMS. In April 2009, the National Audit Office published a report (<I>HC 297 2008-2009</I>) that carried out an in-depth review of the value for money of UKTI trade services and found that UK Trade and Investment has in place a robust system of assessing delivery and has put in place extensive arrangements to obtain regular and systematic feedback on the quality of its services.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/5"><I>Measurement of &#163;19:&#163;1</I></p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/6">UKTI commission independent research into the quality and satisfaction of its services, into any benefits companies' business may have experienced, including both qualitative benefits, such as access to contacts not otherwise available or improvements to their overseas marketing strategy, and into any financial benefits arising. A detailed technical note of how this is measured is published in UKTI's departmental resource accounts reports (<I>HC 3</I>) pages 71-76 and can be found at: <a href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/aboutukti/ourperformance/officialreports/depa">www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/aboutukti/ourperformance/officialreports/depa</a> rtmentalreportresourceaccounts.html.</p>
