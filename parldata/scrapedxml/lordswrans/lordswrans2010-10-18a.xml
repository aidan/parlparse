Seventy-five per cent of the developing world's poor, some 2 billion people, live in rural areas. The great majority depend on agriculture to provide them with jobs and incomes and to lift them out of poverty. Agriculture also contributes to wider economic growth and wealth creation in developing countries, for the benefit of all. In addition, agriculture contributes to increased food availability, helping to address the problem of high food prices and price volatility in developing countries, which hurt the poor most.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.8/2">We supported the millennium ecosystem assessment, which looked at the links between environmental sustainability and agriculture. The fourth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reviewed the link between agriculture and climate change. In addition, the UK has accepted the findings of the International Assessment of Agriculture Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), which made recommendations on water conservation, food security, ecosystem maintenance and climate change.</p>

This will set out how the international community can ensure an equitable and sustainable food supply between now and 2050, when it is estimated that the world's population will have reached 9 billion. The report will include an assessment of the choices that need to be made in maintaining biodiversity and minimising impact on the environment.</p>

The Department for International Development (DfID) has committed over &#163;1 billion to food security and agriculture over the next three years, which will indirectly support the World Bank's agriculture action plan, particularly those areas which focus on increasing agricultural productivity, linking farmers to markets, reducing risk and vulnerability and enhancing environmental sustainability.</p>

We recognise the importance of documenting this traumatic period in the Democratic of Republic of Congo's (DRC) history. The report highlights the need to tackle impunity in a comprehensive manner. The report contains a number of important recommendations. It is now for the UN, the DRC and other states involved to take these forward.

	<p pid="a.109.0/1">The Government have not set a target to install 12 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2012. It does not set targets for individual energy generation technologies but takes a market-based approach to energy generation. The actual amount of offshore wind delivered, and the timing, will depend on a range of factors, including market uptake, the relative cost of offshore wind compared to other options, the ability of other technologies to deliver, the potential for energy exports to other countries and the need for increased renewables capacity beyond 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/2">For reference, there is currently 1.3 GW installed capacity of offshore wind in the UK (source: Restats, https://restats.decc.gov.uk ).</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/3">Looking forward, the current pipeline for offshore wind projects show there is currently:-</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/4">1.8GW under construction;1.9GW awaiting construction;2.3GW where planning applications have been submitted; andand some 40GW of offshore wind projects at the scoping stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.3/2">Life cycle analysis conducted by Vestas suggests that the turbines of the type used in the Thanet wind farm will achieve energy payback within seven months, implying that over their lifetime they will produce 35 times more energy than used in manufacture and installation. This is consistent with the range of estimates in the literature on the performance of wind turbines in general.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/1">The UK Government's support to the reconstruction and regeneration of Haiti will be almost entirely through our share of the programmes of multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and European Union. This will be over $100 million in 2010-11. In addition, the UK will contribute at least $53 million in 2010 for the UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti. Our bilateral support for reconstruction will be restricted to &#163;2 million for disaster risk reduction. The UK Government made a &#163;20 million bilateral contribution for humanitarian relief in Haiti after the earthquake.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/2">Reconstruction programmes of the scale needed in Haiti inevitably take time to design and approve. We have been concerned at the pace of the multilateral effort and the flow of funds pledged. The pace of delivery by the multilaterals is now increasing. The World Bank, for example, has now approved $233 million of the $479 million it pledged to deliver by June 2011, and the Interim Commission for Haiti Reconstruction has now approved projects worth over $1.6 billion. We remain concerned about the pace at which the lives of those affected by the earthquake are being improved, for example, through provision of permanent shelter for those currently living in camps, and will continue to encourage speedy implementation of approved multilateral projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.5/1">Global oil demand is set to continue to rise, and it is important to ensure that the supply of oil remains sufficient to match this. 2009 saw huge progress in the Iraqi oil industry in this regard, with the success of two major oil licensing rounds, covering reserves of around 65 million barrels of crude oil. This represents approximately 5 per cent of the world's total proven reserves. It is clear therefore that the Iraqi Government have already managed to attract significant investment. The role for HM Government is now to use their diplomatic and other resources to assist, where appropriate, with the further development of Iraq's energy sector (including, for example, skills development) and with the fulfilment of contracts emanating from the licensing round. To these ends we will continue to work closely with the Iraqi Government as well as UK commercial entities.</p>

The UK Government, through the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), currently contribute 14.6 per cent of the CERN budget, which is determined in Swiss francs, and this equates to approximately &#163;96 million per year. Due to the economic situation facing the UK and some other CERN members, the UK initiated a debate with CERN members on a reduction in contributions.

STFC also analysed the value of industrial contracts won by UK organisations over the LHC construction period from 1995 to 2008. This averaged around &#163;19 million per annum or about 7.5 per cent of contracts placed and is in addition to contracts placed by the UK and other countries in relation to the LHC experiments.

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">Strategies for developing and growing the UK steel industry are a matter for the commercial judgment of the companies concerned. However, we recognise the vital role that the UK steel industry plays in the supply chain in the UK, supplying steel to a range of key industries which underpin many parts of manufacturing. High technology industries like aerospace, automotive and construction require high-value continually improving steel products. The Government's role is to create the right business environment in which the steel industry can prosper and grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">As a key component of manufacturing supply chain, we will seek to ensure that the UK steel industry benefits from the Government's plans to encourage investment in the UK's productive capacity and infrastructure, which will be critical to driving future growth. The Government can play a role in encouraging investment by minimising uncertainties and correcting sources of market failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/3">We work closely with the steel industry to minimise unnecessary regulatory burdens by involving the sector in discussions on regulatory policy and other issues that impact on them, for example on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, energy supply, climate change and environmental protection. Our aim is to avoid unintended consequences and harness the sector's many creative ideas for alternative, lighter touch approaches.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/4">The steel industry also has opportunities to participate in collaborative R&amp;D projects funded by the Technology Strategy Board, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the EU Research Fund for Coal and Steel.</p>

Where avoidance is identified, HMRC responds quickly by advising on legislative changes to close loopholes and by challenging avoidance schemes vigorously. Disputes between HMRC and taxpayers are time-consuming and expensive for both sides and HMRC will always seek to resolve issues without recourse to litigation, if possible. However, as Dave Hartnett has made clear, HMRC will not hesitate to pursue litigation where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.0/1">Estimates of the amount of underpayments and overpayments resulting from Pay As You Earn (PAYE) processing errors can be found in part 2, paragraph 2.35 of the report by the Comptroller and Auditor-General on HM Revenue and Custom's (HMRC) 2009-10 accounts (<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/hmrc-accs-0910.pdf">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/hmrc-accs-0910.pdf</a>). This report states that HMRC estimates that PAYE processing errors in 2009-10 resulted in &#163;132 million of underpayments (compared to &#163;114 million in 2008-09) and &#163;238 million of overpayments (&#163;96 million in 2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/2">It is a normal part of the PAYE cycle that changes in circumstances that cannot be reflected in in-year tax deductions need to be reconciled annually. This is not an HMRC error, but the PAYE system not being able to react quickly enough to changes. PAYE works well for the majority of people, particularly those with stable circumstances, but because the processes remain fundamentally unchanged since they were introduced in 1944, there are limitations. The Government are looking at how to modernise PAYE and make it more efficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/3">HMRC estimates that 4.3 million taxpayers will receive income tax repayments worth &#163;1.8 billion, and 1.4 million will have an underpayment worth &#163;2 billion following the reconciliation of the 2008-09 and 2009-10 PAYE records.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.0/6">For individuals who have underpaid tax by less than &#163;2,000 HMRC will, where possible, collect this through salary deductions by 09 and 2009-10 underpayments that cannot automatically be paid through their salary deductions-generally those who owe &#163;2,000 or more. Individuals in this position will be offered the same length of time to pay as those with smaller underpayments and not face interest, provided they engage with HMRC and agree to pay their underpayment. Individuals who owe &#163;2,000 or more will also have the option where possible of paying up to &#163;2,000 through their salaries.</p>

This included sourcing a volume of imported salt to establish and manage national strategic stockpiles of up to 250,000 tonnes, reflecting the exceptional re-stocking challenges for local highway authorities for this coming winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/3">The review panel's final report, which will take a longer-term view on improving resilience in the salt supply chain, as well as the resilience of the rail and aviation sectors, is expected to be published shortly. The Government will then respond, including providing an update on actions taken since the July 2010 interim report.</p>
