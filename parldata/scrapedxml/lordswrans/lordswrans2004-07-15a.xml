	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.159.2/4"> <td></td> <td>CTS (&pound; million)</td> </tr>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.159.2/13">The animal movements licensing system (AMLS) was introduced in September 2001. Enforcement of the livestock movements rules and data input to AMLS by local authorities constitute the main cost of running the system. It is not possible to separate these costs precisely from each other, or from payments made to local authorities for other work relating to animal health. We estimate, however, that in 2002&ndash;03 this work cost approximately &pound;3.8 million and in 2003&ndash;04 &pound;3.0 million. Figures for 2004&ndash;05 are not yet available because invoices come into the department in arrears, but systems are now in place to provide a more precise breakdown of costs once invoices have been received.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.5/1">The cattle tracing system (CTS) is being migrated to a new information platform in order to improve its reliability. The business case that supports the change did not seek to identify direct staff savings at the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) in Workington. However efficiency savings and the completion of short-term projects has enabled the BCMS to reduce the number of staff employed from 858, comprising 505 permanent and 353 agency staff, in November 2003 to 669, 492 permanent staff and 177 agency staff, in July 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/2">A long-term target employment level has not been set as this will depend upon the uptake of direct reporting by customers to the database via the CTS website. However, numbers are expected to decline further. Procedures are being put in place to extend the central database to cover the tracing of sheep, pigs and other farmed species but the impact of these changes on staff numbers has yet to be established.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/3">The BCMS also delivers call centre services across core Defra. It merged with the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) in April 2003 and is an integral part of the RPA's corporate structure.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.2/1">Mapping is one of the Countryside Agency's responsibilities under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The agency's estimate at the end of 2000 for its total costs in implementing the new right of access was &pound;28 million over four years. At that stage, the regulations covering public consultation on the draft maps had not been framed, nor had decisions been taken about the regional commencement of the new right of access. In the event, publicity arrangements and the consultation exercise for the draft maps were much more extensive than originally envisaged. The agency received eight times its initial estimate of the number of public comments on the draft maps. This was welcome for the scrutiny it gave the draft maps, but had a major impact on the overall mapping costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/2">To the end of May 2004 the Countryside Agency has spent &pound;30.19 million consisting of &pound;0.75 million in 1999&ndash;2000; &pound;0.92 million in 2000&ndash;01; &pound;5.17 million in 2001&ndash;02; &pound;8.30 million in 2002&ndash;03; &pound;13.25 million in 2003&ndash;04; and &pound;1.8 million to date in 2004&ndash;05. The agency expects to spend a further &pound;14.9 million in the current financial year, and estimates expenditure of &pound;8.9 million in 2005&ndash;06. These costs include the agency's work on mapping, public consultation, the appeals process, restrictions and exclusions administration, communications and public information and salary costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/3">Defra has also funded the Planning Inspectorate to deal with appeals against the inclusion of land on provisional maps and restriction appeals: &pound;0.11 million in 2001&ndash;02; &pound;0.84 million in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;1.20 million in 2003&ndash;04. The Planning Inspectorate expects to spend no more than &pound;2 million in the current financial year.</p>
