	<p pid="a.5.5/1">Given the limited access afforded to international and other independent observers, it is difficult to estimate how many Zimbabweans were disenfranchised for the recent presidental election. However, the Commonwealth observer team concluded in its report that &quot;thousands&quot; were unable to vote as a result of inadequacies in the registration process.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/2">A number of observers, both local and international, were impeded by Zimbabwean authorities and partisan members of the Zimbabwean public from carrying out their duties. Despite this, many of the international observer teams (eg the Commonwealth, Southern African Development Community&mdash;Parliamentary Forum, Japanese and Norwegian) concluded that the election was not free and fair. This indicates a high degree of impartiality. We believe that a sufficient number of the international teams' approach was impartial to give an accurate overall picture of the election process and outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/3">We have not sent any message to Mr Mugabe since the Zimbabwean presidential election on 9&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-03-10">10 March</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-14">14 March</phrase> that we did not accept that the election was free and fair and that the outcome did not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people. The views of the Government on this issue have therefore been made very clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.0/1">The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 provides the required statutory protection for badgers. The Act makes it an offence to cruelly kill, injure or take a badger or to attempt to do so, or to wilfully ill-treat a badger, or, intentionally or recklessly, to interfere with a badger sett by damaging it or any part of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/2">These offences are recordable on the Police National Computer, although they are not notifiable to the Home Office for the purposes of the recorded crime statistics. These statistics are restricted to offences which are indictable or triable either way and a few closely associated summary offences. Although these arrangements may be changed without legislation, we do not consider that the additional workload on the police which would be entailed by a requirement to notify summary offences would be justified.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.11/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on what efforts have been made to ensure the compilation of accurate figures on the number of babies born with birth defects.[HL3457]</p>
	<p pid="a.11.11/4">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) collects information on live born babies and stillbirths with congenital anomalies through the National Congenital Anomaly System (NCAS). This system has been monitoring congenital anomalies in England and Wales since 1964. Its primary purpose is to detect changes in the frequency of reporting of congenital anomalies rather than to estimate exact prevalence at birth.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.11/5">Reporting to NCAS is voluntary, and it has long been recognised that there is under-notification. A review in 1995 recommended that where good congenital anomaly registers existed outside ONS, information should be exchanged with these to improve the completeness and validity of both local and national data. ONS began data exchange in 1998 and now receives high quality data from Wales and three English regions where there are local registers. These registers obtain details of cases from a wide variety of sources before sending the notifications on to ONS. These registers cover all births in Wales and 23 per cent of births in England. Reports for the remainder of England are sent directly to ONS by NHS Trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.11/6">In January 2002 two further local registers began providing information to NCAS. ONS is also currently working with national condition-specific registers where these exist, to improve notification levels. These improvements in the notification system have increased the numbers of babies with congenital anomalies reported. The recent increases in National Statistics' numbers of congenital anomaly notifications have all coincided with the timing and location of these improvements.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.2/1">The Preston judgment means that many employers must give all their part-time employees and certain of their ex-employees, retrospective access to membership of their occupational pension schemes from April 1976 or in some cases later. The employers concerned have a responsibility to settle with their employees and ex-employees how this should be achieved in each case. There are outstanding cases before employment tribunals which are designed to determine how employers and employees should meet their liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/2">Where employees are entitled to membership rights in an occupational scheme in respect of past periods of employment, the normal rules about tax relief on contributions continue to apply. That is: all employers' contributions to occupational pension schemes, including any for past service, qualify for corporation tax relief; employees' contributions up to 15 per cent of their salary from the employer concerned in the year the contributions are paid qualify for income tax relief, irrespective of whether any part of the contribution is in respect of previous years' service; employees may make contributions to their schemes above 15 per cent of salary in any tax year but any such contributions do not benefit from tax relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/3">In some cases, employers and employees may prefer to agree on lump sum settlements rather than additional membership rights in occupational schemes. In these cases, the lump sums are not taxable as income under Schedule E but will be liable to capital gains tax subject to the normal annual exemption.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.5/1">A project team was appointed early last year to look at potential sites for the memorial and to consider the qualifying criteria for those to be commemorated. Extensive research was carried out on suitable sites both in and outside London. There has been wide consultation with the service and ex-service organisations on both the siting and eligibility criteria. There is general support for the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/2">We are delighted to be able to confirm that the Armed Forces memorial will be sited at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The names of those commemorated will either be engraved on the memorial or in rolls of honour that will be kept close by in the Millennium Chapel at the arboretum. The design of the memorial will be decided following an architectural competition that will be held later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/3">The qualifying criteria for inclusion on the memorial are:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/4" class="indent">&quot;All those Service personnel who were killed on duty whilst performing functions attributable to the special circumstances and requirements of the Armed Forces, or as a result of terrorist attack, and all those who died whilst deployed on designated operations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/5" class="indent">&quot;Those members of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and the Merchant Navy who were killed in conflict zones while in direct support of the Armed Forces will also be included on the memorial.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/6">An additional part of the project will be to erect a memorial plaque in the Cloisters of Westminster Abbey to those members of the Armed Forces killed in conflict since the end of the Second World War. Finally, there will be rolls of honour recording the names of all members of the Royal Navy and the Army who have died in service during this period. These will be kept in suitable churches in London and will be similar to those for the Royal Air Force that are kept in the Church of St Clement Danes.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/7">Trustees of the Armed Forces memorial trust will now be appointed to take this project forward. They will take on the ownership of the memorial and will be responsible for its funding and construction. Funds will be raised by public subscription.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/8">This is a very important national project that will also provide a platform to help educate our younger generations about the value of our Armed Forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.9/2">The farms selected for the evaluations include a wide range of conventional agricultural practices, from intensive to extensive. The research programme should therefore also reveal the impact of conventional practices on biodiversity and contribute to our understanding of the relationships between farming practice and wildlife abundance generally.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.2/1">The separation distances are set to limit the interaction between genetically modified (GM) crop plants and other plants. The distances set for any particular trial take full account of the potential effects on private gardens and allotments.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">The GM crops being grown in the farm scale evaluations, oil and seed rape, fodder beet, sugar beet and forage maize, are not grown in gardens and allotments. The forage maize could potentially cross pollinate with sweetcorn varieties of maize, so a separation distance of 200 metres has been specified between GM maize and sweetcorn. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment has advised that at this distance the incidence of cross-pollination should be less than 0&middot;5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.8/1">All consignments of products of animal origin currently imported from third countries into the UK are subjected to a documentary check of the veterinary certification and an identity check to match the goods to the certification. A percentage of consignments are also subjected to a physical check, which may include organoleptic checks, temperature checks and laboratory tests for pathogens or contaminants. Where import checks reveal that any product of animal origin does not comply with Community import conditions, it is re-exported or destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.8/2">Defra's plant health and seeds inspectors aim to inspect all commercial imports of plants from non-EU countries and a proportion, according to risk, of imported consignments of fruit, vegetables and cut flowers, including &quot;organic&quot; produce. These inspections take place at ports of entry and at suitable sites inland. Plants and plant produce of EU origin, including &quot;organic&quot; produce, are inspected at distribution points and nurseries. Appropriate action is taken when pests and diseases are found which pose a risk to plant health, regardless of whether the produce is &quot;organic&quot;. Measures may include destruction, re-export or treatment. Interceptions are notified to the exporting country.

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">Crufomate was used as an active ingredient in veterinary medicinal products for the treatment of warble fly from the 1950s onwards. This predates the introduction of the current controls under the Medicines Act 1968 and so our information on such products is very limited. With the entry into force of the Medicines Act in 1970 these products would have been issued with licences of right that permitted their continued marketing pending a formal review of their safety, quality and efficacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">Evidence from the marketing authorisation holders indicates that these products were removed from the market prior to 1978. They would not therefore have been included within the formal review of all pharmaceutical products that began in the mid-1980s.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">The attached table shows the monthly volume of UK trade in meat and meat preparations between January 2000 and December 2001. The monthly data for February cannot be split before and after the FMD outbreak. Monthly data are provided so that normal seasonal patterns of trade can be taken into account and to show the effects of the gradual lifting of the export ban.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">The importation of meat is permitted from a limited number of third countries where foot and mouth disease is present and where the veterinary authorities have contained the disease in specified regions. European Community rules permit imports from certain regions of those countries that are not considered to pose a risk to human or animal health. Fully matured boneless beef, which does not post a FMD risk, may in some cases be imported from other regions subject to veterinary certification. Countries to which these controls currently apply are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. All meat imported from third countries is subject to veterinary checks at border inspection posts to ensure that import requirements are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/3">The importation into the EU of meat from vaccinated animals is not permitted from African countries. Imports of meat from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay may be from vaccinated animals, but the meat must be deboned and matured so as to remove any risk of live FMD virus being present. No record is kept on whether the meat imported from these countries is derived from vaccinated or unvaccinated animals.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.8/1">Pesticide approvals may be revoked for a variety of different reasons. The most important would be the identification of safety concerns but often include an approval holder's failure to meet data submission deadlines or the withdrawal of the product by the company for commercial reasons. Provided the approval is extant at the time the request is made, an extension can be considered. There are no set procedures when considering an extension beyond the intended revocation date. Each request is considered on its merits, taking into consideration the reason for the original revocation decison and, where applicable, whether any data requirements should be met before granting any extension.</p>

Since its creation in 1995, the company has, for example, achieved an expansion of woodland cover in the national forest area, covering 200 square miles in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire, from 6 per cent to 12 per cent. Detailed changes to the company's operations will be made in order to maximise effective delivery and value for money.

	<p pid="a.26.0/1">In the event of a school company failing financially, we would expect the liability of each company member to be limited to a nominal sum. In the case of a company limited by guarantee, this would be the nominal guarantee figure of perhaps &pound;10. In the case of a company limited by shares, this would be any amount outstanding on the shares, which we would anticipate to be a nominal sum. For member schools, the liability would not rest with individual governors or the head teacher. We expect joint venture companies to operate under the same principles as school companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/2">Other partners could include other company members whose liability would be limited in the same way as school company members. The situation of LEAs would differ depending upon the type of company. Just as schools spend their delegated budgets as agents of the LEA, so a purchasing company, when spending those delegated budgets, would also be acting as an agent of the LEA. This would not be the case for service provider companies, who would be spending income from contracts.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.3/1">Chapters 2 and 3 in the Education Bill refer to earned autonomy and powers to form companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/2">We intend to consult widely on which flexibilities under Chapter 2 will be available as of right and which on a discretionary basis before regulations are laid. Until consultations have been completed, it is not possible to say precisely how many additional staff will be required, but the intention is to design procedures to minimise bureaucracy and extra staff and enable as many flexibilities as possible to be made available automatically.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/3">Under Chapter 3, the relevant LEA has a role in determining whether or not schools may form or join school companies. However, the LEA may only refuse schools permission to join in limited circumstances, to be set out in regulations. We therefore do not expect this task to be an onerous one and so do not expect there to be a need for LEAs to employ additional staff.</p>
