	<p pid="a.171.5/1">An EU import ban on captive birds (including wild-caught birds) from third countries has been in place since October 2005 as a result of the worldwide avian influenza situation. It does not affect trade from other member states and there are limited exceptions for pet and zoo birds. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-04">4 July</phrase>, the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH), with the support of the UK, voted to extend the ban until <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/2">This takes account of the fact that the European Commission has requested the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to carry out a review of the animal health and welfare risks associated with the import of captive wild birds. We are awaiting this report with interest and the UK will play an active and constructive part in EU discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/3">Without clear scientific evidence, a long-term ban, whether a unilateral UK ban or an EU ban, is unlikely to be justifiable on the animal and public health permitted ground in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, or on any another permitted ground. In order to comply with the WTO agreements, it is also necessary to ensure that any ban is not, in effect, a disguised restriction on trade or arbitrary discrimination between countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/4">With EU legislation already in place to address both conservation and animal health issues, any departure from an EU-wide position could be held to be in breach of trade rules under European Community law and result in infraction proceedings. In view of this, we believe that any decisions on a permanent ban should be addressed at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/5">The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species does allow countries to impose stricter, unilateral measures regarding the trade in specific convention-listed species.. However, as mentioned above, with the convention implemented at a Community level, any UK ban would need to be compatible with EC Regulation 338/97/EC and in accordance with Article 176 of the EC treaty. In view of this, it would be very difficult for the UK unilaterally to ban the trade in all wild birds.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">While there are no decisions now taken in the legal fora of the UK which were formerly taken in the legal fora of the EU, the principle of subsidiarity ensures that:</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2" class="indent">&quot;In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action ... only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/3">The principle of subsidiarity, now well recognised in Union law, was first enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and elaborated in the interinstitutional agreement of 1993 and later in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997. The Government believe that the institutions are actively applying the principle in practice as part of the policy-making and legislative process and in that context welcomes the Commission's recent commitment to make all new proposals and consultation papers directly available to national parliaments so as to improve the process of policy formulation. The June 2006 European Council conclusions also ask the Commission duly to consider comments by national parliaments&mdash;in particular with regard to the subsidiarity and proportionality principles.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.5/1">We understand that for some Muslims the state of the Middle East peace process remains a genuine source of anger and that it can distort the view of what the UK and other governments stand for and believe in. We share the desire to see a peaceful solution. The international community is committed to progress towards a viable two-state solution. But to get to that objective, on which we all agree, there needs to be clear acceptance by Hamas that the two-state solution is the only one; a renunciation of all violence; and then a move back into the road map.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.3/1">Water supply and sewerage services are devolved matters, so I will confine my reply to England and Wales, which use the same regulatory frameworks. The Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive was adopted by the Council of the European Communities in May 1991; its implementation would not have incurred any expenditure prior to this date.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/2">Since privatisation the water industry has invested more than &pound;55 billion (between 1990 and 2004-05) in water and wastewater services, asset maintenance, environmental improvements, and securing supply and service improvements. This is an average annual capital investment in the water industry of more than &pound;3.7 billion over the past 15 years. During the 1980s, the equivalent investment figure was &pound;2 billion per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/3">Around &pound;26.5 billion of the investment which has taken place since privatisation is directly related to sewerage service and water quality improvements. Because expenditure often meets multiple objectives, however, it is not possible separately to distinguish the expenditure needed to meet individual European directives.</p>
