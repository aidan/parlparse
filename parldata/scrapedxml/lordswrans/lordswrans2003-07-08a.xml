	<p pid="a.21.2/1">The office of Lord Chancellor is an ancient one under the Crown. In latter days the Lord Chancellor has been a Minister of the Crown and head of the judiciary as well as Speaker of your Lordships' House. The office has a wide range of powers, duties and privileges which have been conferred over time by the sovereign, by law, by custom and usage, by charters and other instruments, and by your Lordships' House. They can be alienated by primary or secondary legislation, by agreement with the conferring authority and others, or by amendment of the relevant legal instruments. The Government will be publishing a consultation document in September setting out the issues to be addressed in relation to the Lord Chancellor's roles that do not relate to the Speakership, his functions as departmental Minister or his judicial capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">None of the important powers, duties or privileges of the Lord Chancellor has been alienated since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-30">30 January</phrase>. Although it was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase> that the Office of Lord Chancellor is to be abolished in its present form, I have been appointed as Lord Chancellor in order that I may continue to exercise the powers of that office for the transitional period. Certain responsibilities in relation to children and families including responsibility for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) are to be transferred to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. These changes have not yet been given formal legal effect. An initial transfer of functions order under the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975 is expected to be made at the Privy Council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-17">17 July</phrase> and will be laid before Parliament in the usual way. This order is intended to transfer from the Lord Chancellor to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs only certain of the Lord Chancellor's principal ministerial responsibilities specifically in relation to legal aid and legal services, regulation of the legal profession, freedom of information, data protection, human rights and elections, and certain powers in the Courts Act 1971 in relation to the administration of the courts. The order will not deal with any functions relating to the judiciary.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.6/1">Unemployment statistics at district council level are only available from the claimant count. At May 2003 the number of claimants in the Strabane District Council area stood at 1,147, which represents 5.0 per cent of the resident working age population. This compares with a rate of 3.3 per cent for Northern Ireland as a whole. Over the past 12 months the number of claimants in the Strabane District Council area has decreased by 7.9 per cent compared with a 5.4 per cent decrease for Northern Ireland as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.6/2">Government is using a variety of methods to help reduce the level of unemployment in the Strabane area. It is one of the areas for targeted initiatives drawing together the relevant statutory, voluntary and community organisations and employers in a new level of partnership aimed at helping individuals who are jobless, particularly the long-term unemployed, to identify and address their particular barriers to employment and thereby making them more ready to take up available job opportunities. Staff from Strabane Social Security Office actively work with unemployed people and numerous groups in the Strabane area to encourage and support the movement from benefits to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.6/3">Invest NI is also working with Strabane District Council to deliver a Business Start programme specific to the area. This programme falls within the auspices of Invest NI's Accelerating Entrepreneurship Strategy which aims to encourage an increase in the rate of business start-ups throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.6/4">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is also contributing to reducing unemployment in the Strabane area. Several economic community-based projects have been funded in the area over the past six years and recent initiatives include the new West Tyrone Rural Leader + Programme, the Natural Resource Rural Tourism Initiative for the Sperrins and Farm Family Reskilling and Diversification Programme.</p>

Although not all of these responses raised issues in respect of the draft race regulations, a significant number did. The issues raised covered the full range of amendments to the Race Relations Act 1976 encompassed by the regulations, as well as questions about the Government's implementation policy generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/2">The aim of the consultation exercise was to elicit constructive views on the draft regulations in order to help to ensure that they properly implement the directives. Changes were made to three specific race issues&mdash;seamen recruited abroad, charities and small dwellings&mdash;as a result of suggestions made during the consultation process. These changes were reflected in the draft regulations. Where suggestions were rejected, they were rejected on the basis that they were inappropriate, that they did not add to the existing implementation strategy, or that they went back over issues where the Government had reached a decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.8/1">In 1998 we instituted a series of recruitment goals to ensure that appropriate levels of recruitment from Britain's ethnic minority communities took place. Running for four years, the goals aimed at increasing the recruitment of ethnic minority young people incrementally by 1 per cent each year until the forces reached 5 per cent. In the event the outcome for 2001&ndash;02 was a very creditable 4.4 per cent, although this figure contains a large number of Commonwealth nationals recruited in this country. Given the nearness to publication of the national census, and therefore access to new and up-to-date research data, an interim goal of a further 1 per cent from the previous year's outcome was agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/2">We have found that quite significant numbers of young people travel to the United Kingdom and join the Armed Forces, particularly the Army, which has the greatest number of trades open requiring relatively low security clearances. An internal provisional estimate of the recruiting outcome for 2002&ndash;03 makes this clear:</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/3" class="indent">Royal Navy&mdash;2.01 per cent UK national and 1.06 per cent Commonwealth recruited in UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/4" class="indent">Army&mdash;2.8 per cent officers and 2.4 per cent other ranks UK nationals and 5.3 per cent Commonwealth recruited in UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/5" class="indent">Royal Air Force&mdash;2.47 per cent overwhelmingly UK nationals.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/6">All figures exclude Commonwealth personnel joining as the result of RN and Army in-country selection team visits. All figures have yet to be statistically validated.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/7">The numbers of Commonwealth nationals of all ethnic backgrounds seeking to join the Armed Forces is a clear indication of the success of our race equality policies in recent years. Although we welcome the resulting increase in the diversity of the forces, we should not forget that the original intention of the recruitment goals was to increase the proportion of UK ethnic minority recruits; this remains the objective today. Accordingly, the aim for the next three years is for each service to increase incrementally each year the proportion of UK ethnic minority recruits by at least 0.5 per cent with the tri-service aim of reaching 5 per cent as soon as possible. We will in addition seek to report the numbers joining from the Commonwealth in order to maintain the transparency of the recruiting process.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/8">These proposals have been discussed and agreed with the Commission for Racial Equality.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.0/1">The United Kingdom is obliged to implement the provisions of Directive 2002/46/EC into national legislation. The conclusions of the regulatory impact assessment undertaken in relation to the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 were that making the regulations was the best option available. Doing so allowed the UK to fulfil its Community obligation to implement the provisions of the directive, maintain the widest possible consumer choice of safe and properly labelled food supplements consistent with the directive, and impose the minimum burden on industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/2">The lists of permitted vitamins/minerals and vitamin/mineral sources in the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 can be extended if additions are made to the permitted lists in the annexes to the Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC on which the regulations are based. These annexes remain open pending safety assessment of additional vitamins and minerals and their sources. Industry is currently working to compile safety dossiers for some of the vitamins and minerals and vitamin/mineral sources currently omitted from the annexes.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/3">The Food Standards Agency, in recognition of the difficulties associated with dossier production and the timescale for dossier submission, is pressing the European Food Safety Authority for an urgent, substantive meeting with relevant parties to discuss dossier requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.2/1">The Government's Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Blood and Tissue for Transplantation have considered the relative efficacy and risks of the different types of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) available.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.2/2">Occasionally, FFP causes a rare condition called transfusion-related lung injury. This can happen if the donor plasma contains antibodies that can react with the patient's white blood cell. Donors generally produce these antibodies after pregnancy or transfusion. The National Blood Service (NBS) is considering plans to produce FFP from male donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.2/3">There are two types of FFP available to the National Health Service. Clinicians have a choice of which products to use. United Kingdom sourced single unit FFP available from the NBS is more commonly used by the NHS. Each unit of FFP available from the NBS is made from plasma from single donations from donors who have been previously tested for viruses to minimise the risk of infection.</p>
