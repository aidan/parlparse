	<p pid="a.35.5/15">The figures for 1993&ndash;94 and 1994&ndash;95 were &pound;6,464,000 and &pound;6,328,000 respectively but it is important to note that the accounting treatment of administration costs prior to 1995&ndash;96 was on a different basis and these amounts are therefore not directly comparable with those for later years.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.5/16">The increase in costs in the past two years were due in part to non-recurring costs such as redundancy payments, backdated job evaluation payments and maintenance costs. These additional costs were funded from reserves and did not impact on the amount available for distribution to school budgets, which were increased in line with departmental guidance. It is forecast that expenditure for 2003&ndash;04 will return to a level more in line with previous years.</p>

The operational deployment of police officers is a matter for the Chief Constable, but the numerical strength of the service will not change due to the incidence of a particular crime or crimes. However crimes against the elderly are taken seriously by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and a number of initiatives have been introduced in an attempt to impact on such crimes.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.6/1">The recent announcements on reductions in Civil Service numbers arise from the Government's efficiency review in Whitehall and so do not directly affect Northern Ireland. However, the Government are pursuing a similar focus on delivering greater efficiency in the delivery of public services, with the aim of releasing resources for reallocation to front-line services. This will be a core element of the Northern Ireland priorities and budget process, which will run throughout the rest of 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">The average cost of a 40-hour community punishment order is &pound;706. This figure is derived from a costing exercise carried out last year with all probation boards and includes overheads of local board HQs and training of probation officers. This is the minimum duration of a community punishment order, and therefore the minimum cost of such an order.</p>

The grant is available on a pilot basis in 10 local learning and skills council areas and we plan to double the size of the current pilot from September by making the adult learning grant available across the south-east and north-east regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.6/2">Proposals for improving the package of financial support for undergraduates were announced in January at Commons Second Reading of the Higher Education Bill. This includes introduction of a non-repayable grant of up to &pound;2,700 pa for students from poorer economic backgrounds. We are improving the package of support for part-time students, many of whom are mature. In 2004&ndash;05 students on low incomes will be able to get a grant of up to &pound;575 for fees and a grant of up to &pound;250 for course costs. We will continue to provide additional, targeted financial support for vulnerable students, through higher education institutions, to ensure that more of them are able to access and remain in higher education. jenny</p>
