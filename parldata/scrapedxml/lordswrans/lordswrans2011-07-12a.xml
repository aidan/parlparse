	<p pid="a.151.2/1">In 2010, the National Policing Improvement Agency published guidance on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to assist policing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The guidance to police was issued as part of the Public Order Act 1986. The Public Order Act introduced a number of new offences relating to public order including harassment, intentional harassment and alarm or distress.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/2">The Equality Act 2010 does not cover the types of conduct which constitute harassment under the Public Order Act. The Government Equalities Office has published general guidance on the Equality Act 2010 which includes harassment as a form of prohibited conduct under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/3">There are currently no plans to publish guidance specifically on harassment under the Equality Act for specific sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/4">Some sectors publish their own guidance and codes of conduct, outside of the Equality Act, in relation to harassment. For example, the NHS Constitution states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/5">&quot;Every organisation should have in place a bullying and harassment policy that is easily accessible to staff and managers. This should be monitored on a regular basis by senior managers. It should include details on how such issues will be investigated in a fair and timely way.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.155.5/1">The Merlin statement commits the banks to give more weight to the expectations, capacity and willingness relating to lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the performance metrics of each bank's chief executive and of those senior managers responsible for lending to SMEs. More weight will be given to these aspects than the SME lending contribution to each bank's profits might otherwise imply.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.5/1">Under Financial Services Authority rules, European Economic Area (EEA) Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) management companies, which are passporting into the UK in order to operate a UK-authorised UCITS fund, are required to contribute to Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) levies. This is to ensure that they are treated equivalently to UK authorised firms that carry out the same activity. It is up to individual member states to decide whether to apply their compensation arrangements to United Kingdom UCITS managers operating UCITS funds in their jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.5/2">Only managers within EEA member states are eligible to passport into the UK in order to operate a UK-authorised UCITS fund. It is the responsibility of home state regulators to ensure that management companies comply with the capital requirements in the UCITS directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">Dame Sue Street has considerable practical experience of the administration of youth justice. As director general of the Home Office's Criminal Policy Group from 1999-2001 Dame Sue oversaw the initial years of the Youth Justice Board. During this period Dame Sue also led the delivery of the then Government's persistent young offender pledge which succeeded in halving the time between arrest and trial for young people who had offended. As part of her leadership role, Dame Sue visited the youth secure estate, youth courts, youth offending practitioners, the police and met with young offenders themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/2">This experience led to Ministers in the previous Government asking her to chair the review of the Youth Justice Board which reported in 2010. As part of the review Dame Sue met, or spoke with, a wide range of stakeholders with an interest in youth justice and made a number of visits to secure establishments and youth offending teams.</p>
