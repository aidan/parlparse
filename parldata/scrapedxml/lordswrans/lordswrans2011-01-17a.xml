<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-01-17a.4.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100286" speakername="Lord Henley" colon=":" colnum="4"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110117w0001.htm#1101172000016">
	<p pid="a.4.2/1">Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) contain a small amount of mercury in order to operate. This is limited by the restriction of hazardous substances directive to 5 mg (and will be further tightened over the next two years). Before the ban on placing 100W incandescent light bulbs on the market came into force in September 2009, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) reviewed the potential health effects of mercury exposure from broken CFLs, and found that the exposure was likely to be small and very unlikely to cause harm. The HPA has published a factsheet on mercury and CFLs containing precautionary guidance on how to deal with any broken bulbs which is available on the HPA website.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/2">CFLs also cause less mercury to be emitted to the environment over their life time than incandescent light bulbs. This is because mercury is emitted from power stations during electricity generation. As CFLs are more energy efficient, less energy needs to be generated. Nevertheless, they should be disposed of responsibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/3">The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) requires CFLs to be recycled. WEEE requires distributors to take back used electrical equipment. In the UK many retailers have opted instead to pay into a central distributor take-back scheme, which has funded many local authority recycling sites. From these sites, manufacturers are obliged to fund the transport, treatment and recycling, where most of the mercury can be recovered.</p>

Figures for the last quarter of 2010, which will show the proportion of energy, and electricity, supplied by all UK wind generation, will be published in March. DECC's latest quarterly figures show that in Q3 2010, all UK wind farms contributed 0.7 per cent of total UK primary energy output, and 3.5 per cent of UK electricity generation.

It has recently concluded the home access programme which has provided help for over 270,000 disadvantaged households with children in years 3-9 in state-maintained education in England. The programme has provided free computers and a broadband internet connection for one year in their home. Independent research has shown that this has helped both eligible children and their parents who have, for example, developed their online job search skills. In terms of schools we know that over 99 per cent of all schools now have broadband internet access. Outside schools, there are other ways in which people can get online, for example by visiting a UK Online Centre, and we will continue to review how to make the most effective use of technology to support learning for all children.</p>
