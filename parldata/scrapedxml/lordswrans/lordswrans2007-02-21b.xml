	<p pid="b.241.14/1">The defence logistics transformation programme continues to deliver significant benefits to the UK's Armed Forces. It is not only driving improvements in the effectiveness of the logistics support provided to the front-line commands, but also reducing the costs associated with providing that support.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.14/2">Against the Defence Logistics Organisation's (DLO's) strategic goal of reducing output costs by 20 per cent, the programme had delivered audited savings of &pound;755 million by the end of 2005-06. This enabled the DLO to exceed its strategic goal target by &pound;100 million. In 2005-06, the programme also contributed a further &pound;660 million of audited savings against an in-year efficiency target of &pound;538 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.14/3">The principles of logistics transformation instigated by the programme are becoming increasingly embedded throughout the MoD including the front-line commands. They will also be at the heart of Defence Equipment and Support, the new integrated procurement and support organisation that forms in April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.17/1">The visibility in transit asset logging (VITAL) system has been improved by enabling it to link with other systems (such as the GLOBAL stock control system and the unit supply and accounting system), through software updates, data cleansing, by making it more user friendly and by improving training. CONVIS stage 1 has just been rolled out across defence and ensures the supportability of VITAL beyond 2007, bringing increased practical benefits to users with a more responsive and automated system. CONVIS stages 2 and 3 will continue to deliver improvements through to early 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.17/2">The expectation is that management of the joint deployed inventory (MJDI) initial pilot operating capability will be rolled out in March 2007, with contract award in late 2007, followed by system development and roll-out. MJDI full operating capability is currently planned for 2010, but this is dependent on approval and implementation of the suppliers' proposals, which are currently being developed.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.23/1">Significant improvements have been made since 2003 to the joint supply chain. The core tracking system, VITAL (visibility in transit asset logging), has been integrated with deployed inventory systems, and VITAL terminals have been located alongside the unit quartermasters in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Improvements to training, policy and process have made it easier for troops to operate the system. Further improvements to VITAL are planned to enable a simpler, more streamlined method of tracking consignments. These changes will also improve the quality and coverage of the data held by VITAL.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.23/2">Additionally, the joint demand tracking system has been successfully rolled out to the three services, which allows any unit with access to the intranet to retrieve data relating to a demand and its location.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.53/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence and Minister for Veterans (Derek Twigg) recently received a letter from the vice-chairman of the National Gulf Veterans and Families Association about &quot;Gulf War syndrome&quot; and the department's handling of war pensions claims from veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict. The vice-chairman has accepted an invitation to discuss these and other issues with the Minister for Veterans. The Minister has offered a number of dates and we hope that a meeting will take place shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.71/1">Operation Sinbad is a joint multinational force (MNF)/Iraqi operation to improve security in Basra City. When the operation began in September 2006, Iraqi forces were employed in a supporting role but, as Op Sinbad has progressed, they have gained valuable experience and expertise, which has seen them taking on the lead role. As a consequence, the number of UK troops involved reduced from approximately 650 in the early phases of the operation to fewer than 150 troops in the latter phases of the operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.71/2">Over the course of Op Sinbad, more than $70 million is being invested in a host of reconstruction activities including water and electricity infrastructure projects, hospital and school refurbishments and resupply and road network improvements. In order to achieve this, security forces &quot;pulse&quot; into a particular focus area for 36 hours to allow civilian and military engineers, and Iraqi civilian workers to carry out a variety of immediate impact reconstruction activities and to initiate a number of medium and longer-term projects. Following the initial pulses the medium and long-term projects are carried forward by Iraqis. There are currently more than 100 Op Sinbad medium/long-term projects, worth tens of millions of dollars, still ongoing and it is estimated that the majority of the medium-term projects will be completed in the next two months while the longer-term projects are likely to remain ongoing for three to six months. In addition to the reconstruction work, a MNF police training team visits local police stations during Op Sinbad to assess the abilities of the police services and provide training and mentoring.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.71/3">Op Sinbad will continue to be conducted in other parts of Basra province, including more rural and provincial areas, with Iraqi forces taking the lead for delivering the operation in these areas. The projects for these focus areas are still being developed and it is not possible to say accurately at this stage what further investment will be made in these areas. However, outwith Op Sinbad, five major projects are planned to improve roads, water and sewage treatment in the multinational division (south-east) area. It is estimated that the total cost of this investment will be some $23 million.</p>

If prospective customers are unhappy with these they can attempt to re-negotiate the terms in question or go elsewhere. However, we keep issues such as this under review, and if we see any evidence of this being a major problem then we will consider what steps we might take when necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.113/1">The historic enquiries team began work in January 2006. Its aims are to assist in bringing closure to families of victims and to ensure that all investigative and evidential opportunities are examined and exploited in a manner that satisfies the obligation of an &quot;effective investigation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.113/2">The HET is tasked with re-examining 3,268 murders committed between 1968-98. The HET generally examines cases in chronological order and is currently working on cases from 1969 and the early 1970s.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.113/3">To date no one has been charged with murder as a result of the HET's work. However, many families have been helped as a result of the detailed information about the death of a relative provided by the HET.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.113/4">The HET comprises 110 staff including nine police officers: two detective chief inspectors, one detective superintendent, three detective sergeants, and three detective constables.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.113/5">The remaining staff are supplied by agencies on a contract basis and include retired police officers who assist in carrying out review, investigation and family liaison work and administrative staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.113/6">The HET project has been allocated &pound;34 million over six years. Estimated expenditure to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> is &pound;10.5 million.</p>
