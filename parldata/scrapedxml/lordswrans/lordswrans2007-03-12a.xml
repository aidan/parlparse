	<p pid="a.77.5/1">UK troops are in Afghanistan as part of the UN-mandated NATO International Security Assistance Force, and at the request of the Afghan Government, to establish the secure environment necessary for reconstruction and development to take place. Reconstruction of a country ravaged by more than 25 years of conflict is a long-term endeavour. Challenges remain, particularly in the south. But Afghan people are starting to see results across much of the country, particularly in regions where security has been restored. An ABC News/BBC World Service poll published last December shows that 74 per cent of Afghans consider that their living conditions are better than under the Taliban and eight in 10 Afghans support the presence of international troops in their country. While life in Afghanistan is far from easy, most Afghans are conscious of the important amount of resources allocated by the international community to the security and reconstruction of their country. Most Afghans continue to rely on international forces to re-establish the security necessary for reconstruction and development. The enduring unpopularity of the Taliban (89 per cent of Afghans view them unfavourably) and the levels of support for the current Government are testament to the fact that the Afghan people consider that Afghanistan is heading in the right direction. International troops, including close to 6,000 British soldiers, are assisting the Afghan Government and their people along the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/2">The ABC News/BBC World Service poll is available at: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/l/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07_12_06AfghanistanWhereThingsStand.pdf">http://news.bbc.co.uk/l/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07_12_06AfghanistanWhereThingsStand.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs) are locatedwithin NHS hospitals at Derriford, Frimley Park, Peterborough, Portsmouth, Northallerton and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) at Selly Oak hospital in Birmingham. The primary purpose of these units is to provide medical training to military medical personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">The precise number of military patients diagnosed with MRSA in NHS hospitals is not recorded separately. This information could be obtained only by searching through individual medical records with that person's permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">The total number of patients of all types who have been diagnosed with MRSA at the hosting NHS hospital can, however, be found on the Health Protection Agency website: <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/hai/mandatory_report_2006.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/hai/mandatory_report_2006.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/4">In the case of our remaining military hospitals outside the UK (The Princess Margaret Military Hospital in Akrotiri, Cyprus, and the Royal Navy Hospital, Gibraltar), where the numbers of service patients are small, there were no recorded cases of MRSA in military personnel in 2005 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/5">It is rare for patients to remain in field hospitals for more than a day or two. Medical staff will provide any immediate surgical treatment that is required, but any patients needing further surgery or longer-term hospital care will then be aeromedically evacuated back to the UK. We estimate the prevalence of MRSA to be very low tending to negligible. As a result, medical personnel screen a patient only if they have clinical indicators of an infection. There are no known cases where a patient has shown signs of infection or tested positively for either organism in UK military field hospitals in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/6">The NHS has standard infection control and hygiene measures in place, combined with the prudent use of antibiotics to prevent and control any outbreak of infection. The Defence Medical Services has robust and stringent infection control procedures which fully meet NHS requirements. We take the issue of infection control seriously and work to ensure the best possible healthcare for all service personnel. Standards of infectious disease control at our field hospitals are at least equivalent to those within the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/7">The military-managed ward which has been established at Selly Oak hospital, Birmingham is contained in a block where NHS patient treatment takes place. We consider that the control and prevention of MRSA in a military population is not so much a case of segregating military patients from the general public rather it is about the observation of infection control procedures for which detailed instructions are prepared and promulgated within the NHS. The MoD is not aware of any evidence published that suggests that military patients are more susceptible to MRSA than general patients, and therefore this was not a factor when the decision to close the Royal Hospital Haslar was taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">The national service framework for mental health (1999) identifies excessive stress as one of the factors that can reduce mental well-being and, in some cases, lead to physical and mental ill health. As such, stress is part of <I>Making it possible: improving mental health and well-being in England</I> (2006), which provides good practice to support the development and delivery of action to improve mental health and well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">The Shift anti-stigma workplace campaign, <I>Action on Stigma</I>, is in line with our emphasis on improving mental health for the whole community. Shift, which is being run from 2004-09 by the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE), and is funded by the department, is an integral part of NIMHE's work in tackling stigma and discrimination in mental health. Through <I>Action on Stigma</I>, Shift is helping employers to reduce the discrimination faced by people with mental health problems in the workplace. The initiative has included a listening exercise involving more than 500 employers and Shift will be producing an action plan for employers in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">The Government recognise the importance of tackling work-related stress (WRS) to both the economy and the health of the nation, with the topic also being covered in both the <I>Health Work</I> and <I>Wellbeing Strategy</I> and the Department for Work and Pension's work on welfare reform. WRS is also one of the priority topics identified in the Health and Safety Commission's strategy for workplace health and safety 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">In 2004, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) launched the management standards for tackling work-related stress (MS) and is supporting organisations through the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">Nearly 1,500 organisations in the HSE's target sectors (central government, local government, health, education and financial services) have received support via sector implementation plans (SIPs). The first (SIP1) saw nearly 80 organisations provided with direct support from an HSE inspector and access to nearly &pound;300,000 of Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) adviser time. SIP2 started with a series of 69 workshops in late 2006/early 2007 with more than 1,400 organisations represented. Support for SIP2 organisations is provided via a telephone helpline, a series of master classes and guidance on how to choose professional assistance if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6">For employers outside the target sectors, help is still available. Workplace Health Connect is a pilot initiative providing advice to small and medium organisations on a number of occupational health issues, including WRS.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7">A wealth of guidance is also available on the HSE website at <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk">www.hse.gov.uk</a> with content being added regularly. This is in addition to the free printed guidance, also available on the website: <I>Making the stress Management Standards work: How to apply the Standards in your workplace which gives an overview of the process and the stressors identified</I> and <I>Tackling stress: the management standards approach&mdash; a short guide</I>.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.5/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February 2007</phrase>, UK Forces were holding 113 individuals in Iraq, at the divisional temporary detention facility (DTDF) at Shaibah logistics base. Eight are on remand while their cases are heard by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI). One has been convicted by the CCCI and is being held while arrangements are made for his transfer to the Iraqi prison service. The remaining internees are held under the authorisation contained in letters annexed to United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1546, as carried forward by resolutions 1637 and 1723.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/2">Since its opening in December 2003 UK forces have interred in the region of 1,500 persons. As would be expected, the numbers of internees have fluctuated in accordance with the type and tempo of operations. Generally, since 2004, the numbers held range between 30 and 130.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/3">Of the 118 who were held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-08">8 February 2007</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="a.87.5/5">Those detained are assessed and released or interred. All cases of internees are reviewed monthly by MND(SE). In addition, these cases go to a joint Iraqi and MNF-I review board every three months. There are additional review procedures for those held for a period in excess of 18 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.5/1">Carrickfergus Castle is the most popular of the historic monuments cared for by Environment and Heritage Service (EHS), with almost 60,000 visitors in 2006. The staff complement includes a castle manager, assistant manager, custodian, tour guides and receptionists.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/2">EHS's actions have included installing reduced-scale siege weaponry, refurbishing the model figures, upgrading the reception building (making it more suitable for disabled people) and improving the castle vaults for use by schools. During 2006 EHS carried out major conservation work on the walls on the seaward side. During 2007, work will continue on the entrance towers.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/3">Other actions underway for 2007 include commissioning a new audio-visual presentation, producing a new guidebook, and further improving facilities for disabled people. EHS is considering opening sections of the wall walk to supervised groups and assembing military memorabilia.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/4">The castle will host a number of events throughout 2007. These include a fencing competition in June,the Lughnasa Fair in July, the Halloween Fair in October, and a series of living history events and demonstrations throughout the year. The castle may also be used when Carrickfergus hosts the Walled Towns of Ireland Association in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/5">I am satisfied that EHS's programme of work is greatly enhancing the appeal of Carrickfergus Castle as a tourist attraction. The agency will continue to work with the council and tourism industry to achieve that.</p>
