	<p pid="c.21.2/1">As part of its ongoing bilateral dialogue with the Government of Pakistan, and in the context of the forthcoming deployment of UK troops to Afghanistan, the Government regularly discuss with the Government of Pakistan the security situation in the federally administered tribal areas. This issue will remain high on the UK/Pakistan bilateral agenda, including on military channels. Travel to the federally administered tribal areas in north Pakistan is difficult for UK officials and therefore infrequent. However, members of staff from the British Deputy High Commission in Karachi visit Balochistan regularly, most recently in January 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.23.8/1">Domestic aviation currently represents around 0.4 per cent of the UK's total domestic carbon dioxide emissions, and we expect it to remain a modest proportion of the total in future.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.8/2">Further assessment of future aviation emissions and a comparison of aviation's contribution, both domestic and international, to global and UK emissions targets were provided in <i>Aviation and Global Warming</i>, published by the Department for Transport in 2004.

	<p pid="c.29.5/1">The Directive on Asylum Procedures was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>. It establishes common minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status, which are consistent with international obligations and in some respects go beyond them. Although it will be for other member states to decide how best to implement the directive, we would expect this implementation to increase standards across the EU as a whole. We intend to consult on domestic implementation of the directive in due course.</p>

Measures adopted according to this procedure are binding upon the United Kingdom where it participates in the measure to be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.6/2">During the debate on the Identity Cards Bill, a question arose over whether a measure requiring EU identity cards could be adopted under Title IV of the treaty establishing the European Community. Title IV, &quot;Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons&quot;, is primarily concerned with the entry of third-country nationals into the Community and their rights of residence and movement once there. It does not refer to measures establishing identity cards for EU citizens. In addition, the UK is bound by Title IV measures only if it chooses to opt in to them, so even if a measure providing for EU ID cards could be adopted under Title IV, the UK would have a choice whether to participate in the measure and thus whether to be bound by it.</p>

	<p pid="c.35.0/1">Like all publicly funded bodies in Northern Ireland, the Office of the Police Ombudsman is subject to rigorous public accountability scrutiny, inspection and review. These include common mechanisms such as reporting to Parliament through the publication of annual reports and accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. In addition, the Police Ombudsman is subject to specific scrutiny by bodies charged with overseeing policing and criminal justice functions. These include the Criminal Justice Inspectorate for Northern Ireland, the Justice Commissioner, the Oversight Commissioner and the Surveillance Commissioner. Scrutiny arrangements for other statutory bodies in Northern Ireland reflect their diverse roles, duties and responsibilities; therefore a direct comparison is not possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.39.5/1">The United Kingdom Government do not inform the government of an individual's home country whether there is evidence that the person being repatriated has previously been trafficked. Victims of trafficking have the right to inform their home authorities at any time. However, the UK authorities, in line with our obligations under the Data Protection Act, acknowledge a victim's right to confidentiality, and general legislation does not inform the government of the returning applicant's home country of the reasons for their removal from the United Kingdom unless the applicant has given us their explicit consent to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.5/2">Moreover, there is an additional factor in cases where an individual who may be a victim of trafficking also claims asylum. In such cases where the claim is refused and all appeal rights are exhausted, and where we seek to return the individual to their country of origin, the United Kingdom is under an international obligation not to inform the authorities/government of the receiving state that the person is a failed asylum seeker. This must be borne in mind when returning the individual.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.5/3">Where we remove individuals, steps are taken to ensure that people are safely returned. Some of these steps include the partnership between the UK Government and a number of charities to offer reintegration assistance to those returning to their countries of origin. This is provided through the International Organization for Migration (IOM), or through links with other organisations or NGOs in the return country. The type of assistance organised by IOM can include help in arranging initial housing, facilitating access to employment, help in setting up a small business, training opportunities and health services. Through this work our aim is to minimise the risks that the returnee may experience on their return.</p>

If an offence has been committed and the person is suspected of involvement and subject to arrest, they will be cautioned on arrest that they do not have to say anything but that it may harm their defence if they do not mention something when questioned which they later rely on in court.</p>

	<p pid="c.43.5/1">The decision to build the Red Dragon superhangar in south Wales was taken on the basis of the best available information, and was a welcome development for the area. A subsequent fundamental review of defence logistics looked across the whole logistics process. It concluded that there were clear benefits from consolidating fast jet support at RAF bases and rotary wing support at DARA Fleetlands in order to best serve the needs of defence. These new arrangements are fully in line with the principles of the defence industrial strategy, which emphasise the importance of improving the effectiveness of through-life capability management and support for our fast jet fleets. This move will help sustain this critical capability in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
	<p pid="c.43.5/2">The Ministry of Defence expects to recover its investment in the Red Dragon project by the proposed drawdown date of April 2007. The MoD expects to achieve this through the major rationalisation of the St Athan site and the DARA manpower, overheads and efficiency savings which follow the move into the Red Dragon superhangar.</p>

It proposed further work on saver regulation with a view to replacing it in due course with a more appropriate regime. Work continues but no decision on the future of saver regulation has yet been made.</p>

	<p pid="c.48.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/2" qnum="HL3621">Whether the African Union (AU) summit in Khartoum has proposed the involvement of the United Nations in strengthening the AU mission in Darfur; and whether they have any proposals to make in the United Nations Security Council for disarming the militias and improving the protection of civilians.</p>

	<p pid="c.48.2/1">We welcome the AU's decision at the <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-12">12 January</phrase> Peace and Security Council (PSC) expressing support in principle for handing over its monitoring mission in Darfur (AMIS) to the UN. However, the PSC recommended that this decision be approved by AU Ministers before the end of the current AMIS mandate in March 2006. There was no formal decision on this at the AU summit held in Khartoum earlier this week. We are pressing the AU to convene this meeting as soon as possible. We will continue to strongly encourage the UN and AMIS to co-ordinate their work.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.2/2">We regularly urge the Government of Sudan to rein in the Arab militia, and we have made clear to all parties in Darfur that they must abide by the ceasefire, control their forces and work towards a political solution.</p>

	<p pid="c.49.0/1">In Northern Ireland, Waterways Ireland has a limited property portfolio associated with the Lough Erne and Lower Bann navigations. These properties were transferred to the body in its establishing legislation and the transfer of title process is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.0/2">The body also inherited an extensive property portfolio in the Republic of Ireland but apart from a relatively small amount of lands acquired for the Shannon-Erne waterway, practically all the other property in Waterways Ireland's care is unregistered.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.0/3">The registration process will involve extensive research and significant legal input. Waterways Ireland estimates that this project will take a minimum of five years to complete.</p>
