	<p pid="a.92.0/1">Our current veterinary risk assessment concludes that infected deer could transmit foot and mouth disease to susceptible livestock during the clinical stages of the disease. However, they are unlikely to represent a longer term risk. In the event of an outbreak of the disease in a feral herd, susceptible livestock likely to come into contact with the herd could be housed if they were normally confined in fields. However, attempts to round up and confine livestock normally grazed on moorland or other open spaces, or attempts to cull deer could lead to increased spread of the disease.</p>

Local planning authorities have wide ranging enforcement powers which they can use at their discretion if they consider any unauthorised development is unacceptable on planning grounds. These include the power to issue an enforcement notice, serve a breach of condition notice or serve a stop notice to terminate any unauthorised development.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/2">It is an offence to ignore the provisions of notices once they have come into effect. On conviction a person may find himself subject to a summary penalty. The maximum penalty in the magistrates' court is &pound;20,000 and there is no upper limit on the penalty which the Crown Court may impose on conviction. It is a matter for the court to determine the level of fines imposed.

	British Nationals Imprisoned Overseas: Clemency

	<p pid="a.98.2/1">Our objective is to support pleas for clemency in deserving cases, while respecting the sovereign right of foreign governments to sentence prisoners according to their own laws. Following an internal review, we have decided to widen our existing criteria for supporting clemency pleas. We will now consider supporting clemency pleas from British nationals imprisoned overseas in the following cases:</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/2" class="indent">in compelling compassionate circumstances, such as where a prisoner is chronically ill or dying (particularly when prison conditions overseas are poor) or where a close family member is chronically ill or dying; where continued incarceration is likely to endanger life or is likely to reduce life expectancy significantly;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/3" class="indent">in cases of minors imprisoned overseas;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/4" class="indent">as a last resort, in cases where we have prima facie evidence of a denial or miscarriage of justice, where we have made representations, but where those representations have failed to secure a remedy. In these cases, our reasons for supporting a plea would not normally be mentioned explicitly in the plea itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/5">We will also take the prisoner's family circumstances into account when considering whether to support a plea for clemency. We will examine all pleas on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/6">Our previous policy was to support clemency pleas in compelling compassionate circumstances, such as where a prisoner was terminally ill, or where the death of a spouse would leave young children with no one to care for them. The new policy demonstrates our commitment to protecting the human rights of British nationals.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-05-02a.99.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="99"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010502/text/10502w03.htm#10502w03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.99.2/1">We firmly believe that we have shared responsibility to respond when confronted with massive violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity. The UK has played a leading role in this continuously evolving debate. We have spent the past year trying to build the broadest possible consensus around a set of ideas on the conditions and circumstances that make international action appropriate. We believe such a consensus could strengthen the Security Council's ability to respond effectively and promptly to humanitarian crises. Our ideas have been framed as policy guidelines to help the international community decide when it is right to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">The key elements of our ideas are:</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/3" class="indent">that any intervention is by definition a failure of prevention. Force should always be the last resort;</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/4" class="indent">that the immediate responsibility for halting violence rests with the state in which it occurs;</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/5" class="indent">but when faced with an immediate humanitarian catastrophe and a government that has demonstrated itself unwilling or unable to halt or prevent it, the international community should take action;</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/6" class="indent">any use of force in this context must be collective, proportionate, likely to achieve its objective, and carried out in accordance with international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/7">Our consultations will continue. But progress has proved difficult. Many countries have reservations about the concepts involved, fearing that their endorsement would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/8">Copies of our set of ideas have been placed in the Libraries of the House of Commons and House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">The Government have reported on the problems of rising ill health in the public services. The Review of Ill Health Retirement in the Public Sector was published in July 2000 and is available in the Library. But the incidence and management of particular health issues in the workplace is a matter for each employer and detailed analyses are not collated centrally. The information requested is not available and it could only be collected across all public service employers for the year 2000 at disproportionate cost. It is not likely to be possible to collect data for the year 1970.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-05-02a.100.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="100"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010502/text/10502w03.htm#10502w03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.100.5/1">We are grateful for all the responses to our proposals. We have concluded that they confirm the case for comprehensive modernisation of the alcohol and entertainment licensing laws in England and Wales. They show that the White Paper proposals represent a sound basis for legislation, and strike the right overall balance between the needs of business, the enlargement of consumer choice, and the interests of local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/2">Two issues raised by the White Paper attracted most comment: which body should be responsible for the new integrated licensing arrangements; and whether licensing hours should be extended.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/3">As to the former, the responses to the White Paper showed a great divergence of opinion. We have considered with care the views of those who argued that the new licensing authorities should be based on magistrates' courts. However, there remains a clear need to bring greater democratic accountability into licensing; and we remain persuaded that local authorities are the right bodies for this purpose. It will of course be important for all licensing decisions to be taken, as the White Paper stressed, in accordance with fair and consistent procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/4">The balance of opinion amongst those who commented specifically on licensing hours in responding to the White Paper clearly supported our proposals for more flexible arrangements. They will make an important contribution to dealing with the problems of alcohol-related crime and disorder, alongside the provisions in the Criminal Justice and Police Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/5">The responses to the White Paper include a number of reservations or suggestions which are helpful, and which we shall want to pursue as we work up the detail of legislative proposals to bring before Parliament in due course. There is, however, one major point on which we have been persuaded by the consultations that a substantive change to the White Paper proposals is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/6">The appeal arrangements described in the White Paper gave rise to considerable anxiety for many interested parties. We now intend to provide in legislation that appeals against licensing decisions should go to local magistrates' courts on both law and merits, rather than to the Crown Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/7">We will continue to consult closely with all the interested parties as work on preparing the necessary legislation proceeds.</p>
