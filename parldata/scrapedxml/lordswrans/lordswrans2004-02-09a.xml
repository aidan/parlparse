	<p pid="a.124.5/1">The table below shows the total number of applications lodged, applications refused, and appeals received, by our visa sections in Pakistan, Canada and Australia during 2003. A direct comparison of appeal statistics across different countries would be misleading. Citizens of Canada and Australia are not visa nationals and therefore do not require a visa to visit the United Kingdom. However, they must obtain entry clearance to come to the UK in another immigration category, such as working holidaymakers. Citizens of Pakistan on the other hand are visa nationals and would therefore require a visa to visit the UK. A substantial proportion of the appeals lodged in Pakistan relate to refusal for family visits.</p>

UNSCR 1510 expanded the mandate of the Internal Security Assistance Force (ISAF); work is now in hand to plan and resource ISAF activities outside Kabul. The network of provincial reconstruction teams is being substantially extended across Afghanistan. UK-led work to tackle drugs production continues; a joint UK/Afghan/UN international conference in Kabul on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-09">9 February</phrase> will seek additional international support for counter-narcotics activities.

	<p pid="a.128.5/1">The burdens of liability and regulation that fall upon individuals undertaking voluntary work have been the subject of close interest by this Government for some time. Formal representations on these issues have rightly been directed to the Home Office, which is responsible for the voluntary and community sector, to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which is leading a government review of the employers' liability insurance system, and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA), which is leading a government review of regulatory issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/2">The Active Community Unit in the Home Office set up the Insurance Cover Working Group (ICWG) in July 2002, to look into insurance difficulties for the voluntary and community sector and advise on practical solutions. The ICWG engaged consultants Alison Millward Associates to undertake a study into the current position regarding the provision of insurance for the voluntary and community sector, including employers' liability, public liability and professional liability, and to make practical recommendations that will bring relief to the problems. The consultants' report was delivered to the ICWG in June 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/3">The DWP-led review of employers' liability aimed to assess the case for reforming employers' liability compulsory insurance (ELCI) and to identify the objectives and options for such reform. The second stage of its report was published at the end of 2003. The Better Regulation Task Force, acting for the DCA, aims to publish its findings later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/4">Action is already being taken following the publication of the DWP review and following careful consideration and wide consultation, a cross-departmental response to the consultants' proposed action plan is being drafted by the ICWG. This will be published at the beginning of March. All the accepted practical recommendations of these reports will be implemented in partnership with the voluntary and community sector, the insurance industry, local authorities and government departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.2/1">The work is funded by the European Union and will be carried out by Professor Atkins at Trinity College Dublin. The research involves using a novel genetic engineering technology to develop vaccine viruses which cannot replicate in human cells and therefore may in theory cause fewer adverse reactions than the current vaccines containing whole live attenuated viruses. However, this technology is very new and there is no guarantee that these novel vaccines will be as efficacious or as safe as the current products. The Department of Health will be asking Professor Atkins to provide regular updates on his work.</p>

We expect that there will be an increasing demand for faster and more symmetrical services over the next few years and that increased investment in fibre-optic networks is likely to be one of the outcomes of this progress in the market. Decisions on where and when networks will be deployed will be predominantly for the market. However, the Government will continue to encourage investment where they can; for example, aggregating the demand for public sector connectivity through the Broadband Aggregation Programme will create fresh opportunities for further investment by industry in infrastructure for high speed broadband.</p>

The size of bolus in use has been kept under review and changes to the bolus used have been made as the scheme has progressed based on experience gained. The most recent update to guidance was issued to all staff on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-22">22 October 2003</phrase>. In addition to the national scrapie plan use of bolus, the Government are anticipating the widespread use of this technology in the future and have just launched a pilot project on a minimum of 50 commercial sheep farms to assess how industry can make best use of electronic identification and to identify any issues that may arise. Feedback from both the national scrapie plan and the government trial will inform future guidance to the industry on the use of electronic identification including boluses.</p>
