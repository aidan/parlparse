	<p pid="a.115.2/1">Some years ago a journalist located two children convicted of murdering another child using statistics provided through the Department of Heath secure units bulletin. Since then the Department for Children, Schools and Families has adopted protocols that prevent individual children from being identified through published statistical information.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/2">The department has closely examined and reviewed its statistical disclosure controls when considering the release of data that could lead to individuals being self-identified or identified by others. Where there is a risk that individual children could be identified, the data are released by aggregation with other data, or released in a form where small numbers are rounded or suppressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/3">We have applied this policy to the information collected recently on home education. We released much of the raw data in the form of graphs, which allowed users to see the distribution of data but which did not identify individual local authorities. This is because where numbers are low it would be possible for journalists or other researchers to combine press reports or other information collected formally or informally with published statistical information to identify individual children subject to child protection plans, or young people not in education, employment and training, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/4">This could lead to home-educating families being pursued for further information about their children-for example, the sort of information set out in the Answers given on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-11">11 December</phrase> (<I>Official </I><I>R</I><I>eport</I> cols. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>167</I><I></I>and <I>WA</I><I></I><I>169</I>) and <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-15">15 December</phrase> (<I>Official </I><I>R</I><I>eport</I> cols. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>206</I> and <I>WA</I><I></I><I>207-WA</I><I></I><I>209</I>).</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/5">We are considering how we can release more of the statistical data collected in a format that protects individuals from being identified but which is more informative than the data already released.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.5/1">The type of items and the frequency with which they may be received by prisoners while in custody are decided by individual prison governors in line with prison Rule 43(2) of the Prison Rules 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.5/2">The rule enables governors to exercise discretion as to the types of items that they consider to be appropriate for their local circumstances, the profile of their prison population (for example, whether a certain publication will have an adverse effect on a prisoner's physical or mental condition) and to fit in with their locally devised incentives and earned privileges scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.2/1">In June 2008, The Experience Corps produced a draft framework of standards and recruitment process to be used voluntarily by institutions when engaging Muslim chaplains in public service. The Experience Corps was awarded &#163;88,708 (excluding VAT) to complete this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/2">Following a tendering process in August 2008, Faith Matters was contracted to pilot the draft recruitment process and standards. Following the pilot, Faith Matters will produce a final standards framework and recruitment process, which will be promoted for voluntary use in public institutions from spring 2010. The project is projected to cost a total of &#163;90,000, with final payment on completion. A copy of the final documents will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
