	<p pid="b.105.5/3">Standards in London schools have improved rapidly since 1997 with GCSE results in London overtaking the national average for the first time in history in 2004. In 1997, 36 of the 402 mainstream maintained schools with results published in the performance tables had 70 per cent or more pupils achieving five A* to C, with 94 having less than 25 per cent achieving this standard. In 2004 of the 403 published schools 92 had 70 per cent or more pupils achieving five A* to C, with 17 having less than 25 per cent achieving this standard.</p>

	<p pid="b.107.5/1">This Government give great priority to the physical and recreational needs of our children as a fundamental part of their education and development. Building and renewing secondary school sports facilities are included in the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.5/2">Central government capital funding for school buildings in 2005&ndash;06 is over &pound;5.1 billion, including over &pound;2 billion allocated to the first wave of BSF. BSF aims to transform secondary schools so that they are fit for the teaching and learning needs of the 21st century, including for sports and physical education. Decisions on investment will be made locally by the authorities which have been allocated funding as they develop their projects, in line with their priorities, which will reflect local need and government policies. In time, all secondary schools in England will benefit from BSF.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.5/3">The balance of capital funding, about &pound;3 billion in 2005&ndash;06, is mainly allocated to schools and authorities by formula, so that they can make investment decisions locally, in line with the priorities of their asset management plan. Again, these can include the improvement of school sports facilities, and we give guidance on good sports facilities for schools. We provide additional capital grant for schools which wish to develop sport as a specialism, where there is local matched funding. From 2008&ndash;09, we are providing additional funding for primary schools, to support their improvement, which will include sports facilities.</p>

From September 2005 there will be 17 in place, 45 by September 2006 and 90 by September 2007. Subject to the next Spending Review in 2006 the eventual ambition is to have one manager per school sport partnership by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.5/2">The overall role of the competition managers will be to manage and co-ordinate the planning and implementation of the national schools competition framework through a programme of inter-school competition within and across school sport partnerships. They will also reach out to local, regional and national governing body competitions. Each competition manager will be an integral part of their school sport partnership and be managed by their partnership development manager. In contrast, the role of the school sport co-ordinator is, principally, to help their school and their primary school partners to ensure that their pupils spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport. As part of this process, they provide enhanced out of school hours sporting opportunities, increase participation in community sport and develop and strengthen links&mdash;particularly between key stages 2 and 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.5/3">For the first wave of competition managers partnerships will receive a grant of &pound;37,500 which will cover the salary of their competition manager and also provide a modest budget. The posts are designed to be three-year appointments.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.2/1">To be awarded qualified teacher status, all trainee teachers must: demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the special educational needs (SEN) code of practice; know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN; and be able to differentiate their teaching to meet the individual needs of pupils, including those with SEN. These requirements are further reinforced during induction.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.2/2">Once qualified, teachers can extend their knowledge and understanding as part of their on going in-service continuing professional development. This can range from awareness raising to securing specific qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.2/3">The department has produced a training CD-ROM <i>Success for All: an Inclusive Approach to PE and Sport</i>. This resource includes a series of filmed case studies and supporting material designed to help teachers in primary, secondary and special schools to include disabled pupils in all areas of the PE curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.2/4">Teachers also operate within a national curriculum framework that includes a statutory statement on providing effective learning opportunities for all pupils.</p>

Investigations and discussions continue on the most appropriate form of such a link.</p>

	<p pid="b.114.8/1">Yes. A key Cabinet Office objective is to achieve co-ordination of policy and operations across government. The work of the Cabinet Committee secretariats is crucial to achieving this objective. The secretariats support Ministers collectively and provide efficient arrangements for collective decision making.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.8/2">Further information about the work of the secretariats was published in the Cabinet Office Departmental Report 2004 (cm 6226) available at <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/about-the-cabinet-office/reports.asp">www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/about&ndash;the&ndash;cabinet&ndash;office/reports.asp</a> and in the Library.</p>
