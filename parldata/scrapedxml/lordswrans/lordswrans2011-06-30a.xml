	<p pid="a.455.1/1" qnum="HL10337">To ask Her Majesty's Government what is the cost structure of the fees proposed to be charged out to abattoirs by the Food Standards Agency should proposals for full cost recovery be accepted.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-06-30a.455.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="455"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110630w0001.htm#11063050000003">
	<p pid="a.455.2/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) consulted across the United Kingdom on proposals for full cost recovery for meat official controls by removal of current discounts, with options for a phased introduction and a reduction in charges for low throughput businesses, and is committed to further reducing its costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.2/2">In response to comments received during the consultation, the FSA revised its proposals, deciding that full cost recovery should be introduced over a three-year period, beginning in April 2012, and that increased support should be provided for a greater number of low throughput meat establishments on a sliding scale. This will provide increased support for approximately 570 establishments, as opposed to about 420 establishments as originally proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.2/3">In addition following discussions between the FSA and HM Treasury, it has been agreed that industry in Great Britain will not bear the cost relating to the deficit in the Local Government Pension Scheme from 2011-12, which would have totalled &#163;4.7 million. Therefore the pension element within FSA costs will be reduced by this amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.2/4">In February the cost structure of the proposed full cost recovery fees for 2011-12 was presented to stakeholders including the pensions element above. The following table shows the costs presented with the LGPS pension deficit element removed. This represents the actual costs of meat official controls and the hourly fees that would be required to recover these costs, no more, no less. Discounts are applied to these rates to calculate charges to be made. It is estimated that for 2011-12 industry will be charged &#163;26.9 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.462.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is responsible for ensuring that the UK's contributions to the UN regular budget are appropriate and bring the Government value for money. With the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, the FCO also oversees the Government's contributions to the UN peacekeeping budget. To do this, the UK uses its position on the UN Security Council to ensure that mandates for the UN's peacekeeping missions and special political missions are realistic and focused. At the same time, the UK participates fully on the UN's administrative and budgetary committees to ensure that value for money is being improved or maintained across both UN budgets. Finally, a UK member has recently been elected to the UN's Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), which makes recommendations to UN member states on effective use of UN funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.5/2">On human contributions to the UN, the FCO posts staff to UN capitals sufficient in number to represent the UK at all negotiations where there is a British interest. The level of personnel is monitored throughout the year by FCO management in London, New York and Geneva. The Government's contributions to wider parts of the UN system, such as the funds and programmes and specialised agencies, are led by a wide range of Whitehall departments. Providing details of each of these would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.5/3">Financial contributions to the European Commission are set within annual EU budget negotiations, as well as within negotiation on the multi-annual financial framework. The UK takes a strong line within these negotiations: the EU budget needs to reflect the very tough budget decisions being taken across Europe, and we want to see very substantial savings in EU administration spending during the next seven year budget cycle. In terms of staff contributions, the UK manages secondments to the European Commission and other EU institutions carefully to ensure that these are beneficial for all concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.5/4">In the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), FCO officials are heavily involved in negotiations to ensure that UK contributions are set and remain at an appropriate level. We also strive to ensure that UK contributions are used in as efficient and effective a way as possible to deliver added value on the ground. British officials engage closely in the annual budget negotiations and have been instrumental in ensuring the OSCE participating states agreed a budget at zero nominal growth or less over the past few years. Again, FCO management in London and Vienna ensure that the level of representation to the OSCE and secondees to its field missions is sufficient.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.0/1">The research on dental fluorosis, which is the only proven side effect of fluoridation, is being conducted on a sample population of Newcastle where there is an existing fluoridation scheme. The benefits of fluoridation are illustrated by epidemiological surveys which show that levels of dental decay in fluoridated areas like the West Midlands are lower than those in areas like Greater Manchester where no adjustment is made to the level of fluoridation in the water supply. A new scheme would provide baseline information on oral health and cost of implementation which are not available from existing schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.5/1">National Health Service productivity growth is measured as the ratio of the growth in the volume of outputs to growth in the volume of inputs. No spend data are used in the calculation of volume of outputs in the NHS productivity measure. Spend data are used in the calculation of the volume of inputs where there is no data available to count inputs directly, (bandages and dressings for example).</p>
	<p pid="a.476.5/2">Spend data are adjusted for inflation (deflated) to enable a comparison of input volumes between two time periods, as required to calculate NHS productivity growth. The measure of the volume of inputs must only reflect quantity but spend data reflect both the quantity and price of inputs. So, deflating spend removes the effect of price increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.5/3">Different deflators are used for different inputs. There are three broad categories of healthcare inputs: labour, goods and services and capital consumption. Goods and services are measured in three parts: GP prescribed drugs, healthcare purchased from outside the NHS and other goods and services. Expenditure data are used to measure healthcare purchased from outside the NHS and other goods and services. All other inputs are directly measured.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.5/4">Spend on other goods and services in Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) is deflated using the Health Service Cost Index (HSCI). The HSCI is calculated monthly to measure the price change for 41 sub-indices of goods and services purchased by the HCHS. The sub-indices are weighted together according to the proportion of total expenditure which they represent. Spend on other goods and services in primary care is deflated using the retail Prices index as no specific deflator is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.5/5">Spend on healthcare purchased from outside the NHS is deflated using the HCHS pay and price index; no specific price deflators are available for healthcare purchased outside the NHS. The HCHS pay and price index is a weighted average of the HSCI (described above) and the pay cost index. The PCI is a weighted average of increases in staff unit costs for each staff group within the HCHS sector. The HSCI and PCI are weighted together to calculate the HSCI by their expenditure shares.</p>

	<p pid="a.481.2/1">The Government are committed to maintaining high levels of tobacco duty to contribute to wider efforts to tackle the deficit and support the Government's health objectives. The UK has some of the highest priced cigarettes and tobacco products in the EU and the current level of taxation helps to reduce the affordability of smoking, and discourages smoking.</p>

	<p pid="a.482.2/1">The Government review of waste policy in England, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-14">14 June 2011</phrase>, set out a number of measures we consider will act as a real deterrent to those responsible for waste crime. These measures include working closely with landowner organisations, to increase reporting of fly-tipping incidents on private land and sharing best practice on how to reduce the risk of fly-tipping, for example through improved security and intelligence sharing.</p>
