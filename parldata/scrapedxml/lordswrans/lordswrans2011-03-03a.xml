	<p pid="a.359.5/1">The M4 bus lane was suspended from December 2010 for a trial period of 18 months. It will be reinstated as part of the transport arrangements for the 2012 Olympics, as part of the Olympic Delivery Authority's planned traffic management measures on this section of the Olympic Route Network. Sufficient data should be collected during the trial to inform the final decision about the future of the bus lane. If this supports the permanent removal of the M4 bus lane, then a revocation order will be made for commencement after the Olympics and Paralympics in autumn 2012. The speed limit will be reviewed as part of this process.</p>

	<p pid="a.360.5/1">The dedicated schools grant (DSG) is distributed by the department through a single guaranteed unit of funding per pupil for each local authority. It is for the local authority to decide how much funding it delegates to the maintained schools in its area. Each local authority in consultation with its schools forum has a funding formula that it has designed to cater for the needs of its own area.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.5/2">Overall, the city of Manchester received &#163;350.8 million of revenue funding for schools in 2010-11, including DSG and other specific grants for schools. For 2010-11, the authority's DSG funding per pupil was &#163;4,919.11. For 2011-12, the DSG funding per pupil will be &#163;5,875.61, including &#163;956.50 for specific grants that have been mainstreamed into the DSG. The final DSG allocations for local authorities will be based on the January 2011 pupil count and will be published in summer 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.5/3">The pupil premium is additional to the DSG. The level of the premium will be &#163;430 per pupil and will be the same for every deprived pupil, no matter where they live. Using data from January 2010 this would be worth an additional &#163;9.9 million for the city of Manchester. The actual amount allocated may, however, be higher or lower than that since we will use data from January 2011 when they are available.</p>
