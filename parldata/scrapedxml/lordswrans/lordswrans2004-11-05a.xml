	<p pid="a.49.2/1">We have received over 450 consultation responses from private, public and voluntary and community organisations, including many detailed responses from black and other multi-ethnic organisations and from faith organisations. We received a full and thoughtful response from the Commission for Racial Equality. We are giving careful attention to the many issues raised, including those raised by CRE, and will address them in the Government's response to the consultation this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/2">The Government have said that they will bring forward legislation to create the CEHR as soon as parliamentary time allows. As we have made clear, the CEHR will not be established with its full powers and remit before the end of 2006 at the earliest.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">There are no specific regulations that ban the use of mobile phones on petrol station forecourts.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/2">The Health and Safety Executive issued advice in August 2003, updated in March 2004, to petroleum enforcement officers on safety control measures where the dispensing of petroleum takes place. This notes that in general mobile phones are not designed or certified for use in explosive atmospheres, although the risk of incendive sparking from mobile equipment is low. It also notes that they can create a serious distraction for people getting petrol.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/3">It recommends that customers or staff actually dispensing petrol should not use them; that they should not be used in designated hazardous areas when petrol deliveries are taking place; and they should not be used during other petrol handling activities or the maintenance of petrol equipment. It specifically does not recommend a total prohibition on use on petrol station forecourts.</p>
