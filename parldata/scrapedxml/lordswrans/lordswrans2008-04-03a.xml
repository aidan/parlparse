	<p pid="a.189.2/1">It is government policy that regulatory and approval regimes should be cost-neutral and that regulatory bodies charge appropriate fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/2">Prior to the revision of fees in 2005, no fees relating to the approval mechanism had been revised since 1991. It was proposed that the fees Order would be revised to start to recover the fees for testing. Since 2005, the price for each of the tests charged by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency has been revised and is based on the actual hours needed to perform the test by graded staff, together with the materials used: that is, the full economic cost. The prices reflect the complexity of the tests and difficulty of the methodologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/3">The Institute for Animal Health (IAH) is the only laboratory in the UK equipped to undertake efficacy testing of disinfectants against foot and mouth disease and swine vesicular disease testing. The IAH is also now required to recover the full economic cost of the testing service they provide. This has resulted in them needing to revise their fees, something they have not needed to do since 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.5/1">It is government policy that regulatory and approval regimes are cost-neutral and that regulatory bodies charge appropriate fees. It is not considered appropriate for Defra and the taxpayer to subsidise the mechanism when manufacturers in industry benefit from the sale of their products.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.5/2">Prior to the revision of fees in 2005, no fees relating to the approval mechanism had been revised since 1991. This had resulted in a growing disparity between what Defra was allowed to charge under the Order and the actual costs incurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.5/3">In 2004, industry were informed of the proposal that the fees would be revised to start to recover the costs for testing and that fees would be revised to recover the administrative cost later. Defra did not increase the administrative fee for the approval mechanism when testing fees were reviewed. This was because a fundamental overhaul of the approval process was planned and is now complete.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-04-03a.193.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="193"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80403w0001.htm#80403w0001.htm_spmin12">
	<p pid="a.193.2/1">Not all badger populations in Great Britain have been tested for bovine tuberculosis (bTB). However, evidence of Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection was found in all randomised badger culling trial (RBCT) areas (where culling meant there were carcases that could be tested), namely: Gloucestershire/Herefordshire, Cornwall/Devon, East Cornwall, Herefordshire, North Wiltshire, West Cornwall, Derbyshire/Staffordshire, Devon/Somerset, Gloucestershire and Devon. The prevalence of infection on initial culls was higher in the inner regions of proactive treatment areas (2km or more inside the boundary) than in the outer areas, which is not surprising as trial areas were centred on areas of high bTB risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/2">The results of Defra's Road Traffic Accident survey, carried out in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire between 2002 and 2005, showed badger populations in all of the counties sampled were affected by bTB to some degree. On average, M. bovis was detected in 15 per cent of badger carcasses ie around one in seven. This is similar to that recorded in proactively culled badgers in the RBCT during the same time period (16.6 per cent). An extended post-mortem examination carried out on a sample of 205 RBCT badgers revealed substantially more infected animals, approximately double, than did standard post-mortem examination. Therefore, these prevalence values are likely to be under-estimates.</p>

The identifiers must be replicated by elector when they subsequently cast their postal vote, and will be cross-checked with the original samples to ensure the postal vote is valid;new offence of falsely applying for a postal or proxy vote;after every election a list of all those who voted by post is published which will enable individuals to check that their vote was counted. In an investigation the police will be able to check up with any individual whether they did actually vote by post or whether their vote was stolen;new criminal offence of supplying false information (or failing to supply information) to the electoral registration officer at any time;strengthened offence of undue influence, which will make it easier to prosecute, even if the undue influence does not affect the way someone votes; and clear new powers for electoral administrators to cross check applications to register to vote against other information the council holds.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.5/1">A range of sanctions including criminal prosecution are available depending on the circumstances of the case. All prisoners who breach temporary release conditions, on returning to prison, are charged with the offence under Prison Rules, if there is prime facie evidence to support a charge. The prisoner is then adjudicated on by a governor during a disciplinary hearing. If found guilty, the prisoner will be the subject of an adjudication award. Adjudication awards have a maximum of 14 days' cellular confinement, with loss of association with other prisoners and loss of prison earnings. There are a range of losses of privileges for varying time periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.5/2">Since summer 2002, following a European Court ruling, an adjudicating governor cannot increase a prisoner's sentence by awarding loss of remission. However, the prisoner's release date is recalculated and extended by the length of time the prisoner has been unlawfully at large.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.5/3">Where prisoners have failed to return to prison by the designated date and time the adjudicating governor may decide to deal with the matter internally or can adjourn the hearing and refer the matter to the PSNI for investigation and consideration for prosecution. Section 25 of the Prison Act carries a maximum penalty of 2 years' imprisonment for being unlawfully at large.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.5/4">The Prison Service updated its memorandum of understanding with the PSNI and PPSNI last autumn so that any prisoner who has absconded for a significant period of time, normally over 7 days, is referred to the authorities to be considered for prosecution. For shorter time periods governors may refer any case for prosecution if they consider the individual circumstances make it appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.5/5">Each individual prisoner's leave quotas under the pre-release home and resettlement scheme are based upon the length of sentence and continuous custody. If a prisoner breaks continuous custody by remaining out of the prison unlawfully for a full calendar day or more, the prisoner is deemed to have broken continuous custody. As a result the prisoner's entitlement to such leave is recalculated from the day on which he returns to prison, and consequently his home leave quotas will significantly reduce.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.5/6">In any subsequent application for home or resettlement leave account is taken of any previous leave failures by the Home Leave Board as part of its consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">The Unlawful Drilling Act 1819 has become obsolete in Great Britain because it has been superseded by modern public order law and practice. This includes the Public Order Act 1936, Section 2 of which is directed against quasi-military activities. Powers to manage crowds and demonstrations in the Public Order Act 1986 also have a potential application to address unlawful gatherings.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">The repeal does not extend to Northern Ireland because the Public Order Acts of 1936 and 1986 do not extend there.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.5/1">The Academy for Sustainable Communities (ASC) was established by Government in 2005. It receives core funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government of &pound;5.5 million a year, and has also attracted additional funding from the Northern Way and from some sponsorship of particular activities. The intention is that the ASC will transfer to the Homes and Communities Agency once this has been established, based on its existing business plan and allocated budget from Communities and Local Government. Over time it will be for the new agency to work with the academy and CLG to develop and determine a new business plan and the appropriate funding levels for its activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.8/2">Although HEIs are independent autonomous organisations, their governing bodies are aware of their relevant legal responsibilities in this area which are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.210.8/3">Section 43 of the Education (No 2) Act 1986 provides that those involved in the government of an institution in the higher education sector or the further education sector must take reasonably practicable steps to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for members, students, employees and visiting speakers. This includes the duty to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable that use of the establishment's premises is not denied to anyone on the grounds of their beliefs, views, policy or objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.8/4">The duty under Section 43 includes the duty to ensure (so far as is reasonably practicable) that the use of the premises is not denied to any individual or body on grounds connected with the beliefs or views of the individual or body or the policy or objectives of the individual or body.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.8/5">HEIs have to have a code of practice on the organisation of meetings and other activities to take place on their premises. They then have to take such steps etc to ensure that the code is complied with.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.8/6">In addition to this the Education Act 1994 requires university governing bodies to take such steps as reasonably practicable to ensure the student union operates in a fair and democratic manner&mdash;we would expect them to do so in these cases or any others.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.8/7">Governing bodies should ensure that they are fulfilling their duty to uphold these legal requirements.</p>
