	<p pid="a.39.8/1">Compliance with all new information legislation crucially depends on public authorities' ability to manage their record effectively. The National Archives (TNA) has provided a wide range of guidance to local authorities on records management to help them to meet their obligations under new legislation. In 2003 it formed a new Records Management Advisory Service with the specific remit of promoting better records management throughout the public sector, especially in local government. Since this work is essentially advisory and qualitative, it is not possible to express TNA's increased activity in terms of a single percentage figure.</p>
