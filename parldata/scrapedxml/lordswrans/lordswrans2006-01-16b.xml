	<p pid="b.92.8/1">Neither the phrase &quot;sensitive personal information&quot; nor the phrase &quot;particularly sensitive information&quot; has a technical or defined meaning in relation to the national identity register. The Identity Cards Bill establishes a national identity register as a record of &quot;registrable facts&quot; about individuals as set out in Clause 1(5) of the Bill. The only information that may be recorded in the register is as provided for in Clause 3 and listed at Schedule 1 of the Bill. This does not include what, in the ordinary meaning of the words, could be described as particularly sensitive information such as medical or criminal records. Clause 1(6) of the Bill prevents the inclusion of any personal reference number under Clause 1(5)(g)&mdash;such as a police national computer reference number&mdash;that would tend to reveal any &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 (c.29).</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="">27 December</phrase> the Eastern Front announced that it was unhappy with Libyan mediators and was withdrawing from the talks.
