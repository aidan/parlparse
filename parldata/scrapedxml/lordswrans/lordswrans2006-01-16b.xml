	<p pid="b.89.4/2" qnum="HL3104">Whether the nature of the six-year commitment undertaken by 16 year-olds on joining the Armed Forces is compatible with obligations of the United Kingdom under the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-16b.89.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="89"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60116w01.htm#60116w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.89.5/1">The six-year commitment is a term of service that applies to the Army. It provides that all recruits over 18 years old who enlist into the Army sign up to a minimum of four years with the right to give 12 months' notice at the three-year point. Those aged under 18, however, only have their reckonable service taken from their 18th birthday. Therefore, if a young man or woman enlisted on their 16th birthday, for instance, he/she could serve a minimum of six years, comprising two years under-18 service and four years of adult service, before leaving the Army by giving 12 months' notice at what for them would be the five-year point.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.5/2">The UK ratified the optional protocol (OP) on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-24">24 June 2003</phrase>. In so doing the UK agreed that it would take all feasible measures to ensure that members of the Armed Forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities. The UK made another declaration upon ratification concerning the minimum age of recruitment (age 16, in line with minimum school-leaving age) and on the safeguards to ensure that all recruitment of under-18s is genuinely voluntary and with informed consent of the volunteer and his/her parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.5/3">Although the six-year commitment predates the ratification of the OP, it is consistent with it. There are adequate safeguards in place to ensure that young servicemen or women under the age of 18 years may, if they wish, leave the services before committing to adult service, and that any commitment to adult service is both considered and voluntary.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.5/4">This is done through the Armed Forces operating a policy whereby all new recruits, regardless of age, have a right of discharge within the first six months of service by giving not less than 14 days notice in writing to the commanding officer if they decide that the Armed Forces is not a career for them. In addition, service personnel under 18 years three months who have passed their statutory six-month period for &quot;discharge as of right&quot;, and have registered, before reaching their 18th birthday, clear &quot;unhappiness&quot; at their choice of career, can request permission to leave the Armed Forces. This provision does not provide &quot;discharge as of right&quot; and the commanding officer has discretion to delay a decision on discharge if he has doubts about the permanence of the individual's unhappiness. However, it is exceedingly rare for such an &quot;unhappy&quot; individual to be refused permission to leave.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.5/5">The most relevant provision of the Convention on the Rights of the Child concerned the recruitment of children aged 15 into the Armed Forces. This convention predates, and was largely superseded by, the provisions of the OP. The Government consider that the safeguards provide sufficient protection to under-18s serving in the UK's Armed Forces and sufficiently comply with the UK's obligations under the convention. Similarly, the Government consider that the safeguards in terms of service of under-18s in the Armed Forces sufficiently comply with the United Kingdom's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.5/1">Not all organisations will be equipped to check biometric information against the national identity register and it is envisaged that simple visual verification may be used in low-risk transactions or where the individual has an established history with the organisation checking identity. However, where that happens there will be other methods in place to verify the authenticity of an identity card. Accredited user organisations which do not have biometric readers may use card readers which can verify the card's validity and authenticity electronically against the register. This will guard against the misuse of lost or stolen cards. In addition, in the absence of a biometric check, it will be possible to request the individual to submit a password or personal identification number (PIN) with their identity card.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.8/1">Neither the phrase &quot;sensitive personal information&quot; nor the phrase &quot;particularly sensitive information&quot; has a technical or defined meaning in relation to the national identity register. The Identity Cards Bill establishes a national identity register as a record of &quot;registrable facts&quot; about individuals as set out in Clause 1(5) of the Bill. The only information that may be recorded in the register is as provided for in Clause 3 and listed at Schedule 1 of the Bill. This does not include what, in the ordinary meaning of the words, could be described as particularly sensitive information such as medical or criminal records. Clause 1(6) of the Bill prevents the inclusion of any personal reference number under Clause 1(5)(g)&mdash;such as a police national computer reference number&mdash;that would tend to reveal any &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 (c.29).</p>

	<p pid="b.93.7/2" qnum="HL3154">What arrangements exist for users of the National Health Service in north Cumbria to challenge decisions taken by the strategic health authority and assumptions made by the advisory committee in resource allocation on health needs in north Cumbria.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-16b.94.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="94"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60116w02.htm#60116w02_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.94.0/1">The Cumbria and Lancashire Strategic Health Authority has not made any decisions with regard to health services in north Cumbria. However, users of National Health Service services in north Cumbria will have a full opportunity to challenge any options for service redesign in north Cumbria as part of a full public consultation process which will be the responsibility of the primary care trusts in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/2">The role of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) is to oversee the development of the national weighted capitation formula to ensure equity in the allocation of resources to the NHS. The details of the formula developed under the auspices of ACRA, in relation to the 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 revenue allocations, is set out in a booklet entitled <i>Resource Allocation: Weighted Capitation Formula, Fifth Edition</i>. This booklet has been placed in the Library and is available on the Department of Health Publications website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en">www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en</a>?CONTENT&ndash;ID=4112065&amp;chk=MqnOJW.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/3">The department has also published the detailed data that underpin the allocations at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/OrganisationPolicy/FinanceAndPlanning/Allocations/fs/en">www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/OrganisationPolicy/FinanceAndPlanning/Allocations/fs/en</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/4">These sources of information are accessed by a wide range of people and groups, and as a result the department receives papers and correspondence on a variety of topics related to the formula. On occasion, issues are also raised directly with ACRA members. Where appropriate, ACRA places these issues on the agenda for future meetings.</p>

	<p pid="b.95.5/1">A total of 90 minutes were spent by police in relation to the investigation and recording of remarks made during a BBC Radio Five Live programme. This was as a result of a member of the public contacting the police to complain. The time spent by police involved the recording of the incident on the police Crime Reporting Information System (CRIS) and speaking to both parties (the complainant and the journalist) by telephone. During the course of these telephone conversations it was explained that no crime had actually been committed but that a record of the complaint had been made. It is a standard operating procedure in the Metropolitan Police Service that if any person reports an incident which they perceive to be homophobic it will be recorded.</p>

	<p pid="b.96.2/1">The Government have supported Concordis, a UK-based non-governmental organisation, in providing technical assistance to the Eastern Front, the main rebel group in eastern Sudan, to prepare them for peace talks with the Government of Sudan. Talks were to begin under Libyan mediation in mid-January 2006. On <phrase class="date" code="">27 December</phrase> the Eastern Front announced that it was unhappy with Libyan mediators and was withdrawing from the talks. However, we understand that following negotiation with the United Nations in early January, both parties are now willing to begin negotiations under Libyan mediation in Sirte, Libya, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-17">17 January</phrase>. We have always made clear that any agreement must be fully compatible with the terms of the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA).</p>
	<p pid="b.96.2/2">Under the terms of the CPA between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement, the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) will maintain a presence in eastern Sudan to verify implementation of the CPA between the parties there. UNMIS has also encouraged the Eastern Front and Government of Sudan to start talks at the earliest opportunity. Any further decision on the role of the UN in the east will have to be taken by the Security Council.</p>
