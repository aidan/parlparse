	<p pid="a.25.5/1">The Government have no plans at present to sign and ratify the covention. We consider we have already struck the right balance between the need for immigration control and the protection of the interests and rights of migrant workers and their families in the United Kingdom. The rights of migrant workers and their families are protected in United Kingdom legislation, including the Human Rights Act 1998, and the United Kingdom's existing commitments under international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/2">The convention in its totality applies to migrant workers and members of their families during the entire migration process, including their entry into the United Kingdom. We consider that the pre-entry and on-entry scope of the convention could undermine the United Kingdom's system of frontier controls were the UK to ratify the convention.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.0/1">Provision of extended visits for children and families is at the discretion of individual governors, who take into account a number of factors, including the availability of staffing and other resources. However, over the last 10 years an increasing number of establishments offer such visits, which take place over a longer period than routine social visits and in more relaxed surroundings, using existing recreational facilities. Greater emphasis is placed on the needs of the child and I am pleased that there is a growing appreciation of the benefits which may be gained from visits of this kind. Information on which establishments offer such facilities is not collated centrally by the Prison Service. Rebo</p>

	<p pid="a.26.3/1">To date, the European Union (EU) governments have been working to reach agreement on instruments designed to meet the Treaty of Amsterdam commitment for member states to adopt measures designed to establish minimum standards for asylum procedures and policies across the EU. The deadline for this is May 2004. At the Tampere European Council in October 1999, member states agreed to look beyond the minimum standards established by 2004 towards the creation of a common European asylum system. After a slow start there is now increasing momentum on the first stage of the process to establish minimum standards. The United Kingdom has participated actively in this process and has opted in to all the measures to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/2">The following measures have been adopted to date: Council regulation establishing the EURODAC electronic fingerprinting database (adopted <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-11">11 December 2001</phrase>); and Council directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in event of mass influx (adopted <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-20">20 July 2001</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="a.27.5/1">The Government are committed to improving the position of older people in our society. This is an issue that is relevant not only to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) but also to others across government, including the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/2">The Government's strategy is co-ordinated by a Cabinet sub-committee of Ministers from several departments, chaired by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Department of Work and Pensions. The strategy consists of five main strands: encouraging and enabling active ageing, promoting age diversity, tackling pensioner poverty for today's and future pensioners, maintaining and supporting independence in later life and working in partnership with older people to provide better services focused on the needs of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/3">DWP is also aware that increasingly older people want to remain active longer through work. The Government are committed to helping people of all ages back to work. The range of back to work programmes includes New Deal 50 plus, New Deal 25 plus and New Deal for Disabled People. These programmes have helped to ensure that the employment rate for people aged 50 to state pension age has increased each year for the last four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/4">New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme and was launched in April 2000. The programme provides active help and advice for individuals who have been out of work and dependent on benefits for six months or more. Through a personal adviser it offers an income top-up of &pound;60 per week for people returning to full-time work (&pound;40 a week for part-time work) and an in work training grant. In its first two years of national operation, New Deal 50 plus has already helped nearly 67,000 people off benefits and back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/5">Through our Age Positive campaign we are also promoting to employers the business benefits of recruiting, training and retaining older workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/6">The Department for Education and Skills is exploring physical activity as part of its development programme, which explores innovative ways of engaging older people in learning. Two projects are currently running, the first to develop a programme for senior peer mentors, costing &pound;22,700, which will enable older people to encourage increased levels of physical activity among their peers; the second, costing &pound;15,300, to develop a programme to engage older people in sports based volunteering in their communities. Rebo</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/7">The Home Office, through funding of the Experience Corps Company of &pound;19.9 million over three years, is encouraging older people to be active in their community, mainly through voluntary work. This may involve volunteering activity that encourages people to be physically active, but this is not specifically targeted.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-05-14a.34.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="34"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020514/text/20514w03.htm#20514w03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.34.5/1">My right honourable friend has today laid before Parliament a statutory instrument: The Town and Country Planning (Major Infrastructure Project Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002. A departmental circular (DTLR Circular 02/2002) is also being issued today to accompany the new statutory instrument. This circular explains the new procedures for handling inquiries into those major infrastructure projects in England, as defined in the schedule to the rules. Copies of the statutory instrument and the circular have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/2">The new arrangements for major infrastructure project inquiries, which are due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">7 June</phrase>, are part of the package of measures announced by my right honourable friend on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-20">20 July 2001</phrase> to streamline the planning procedures for major infrastructure projects. The department has also consulted on a key part of that package which is the proposed introduction of new procedures to enable Parliament to make a decision in principle on applications for major projects before the detail of the application is considered at a public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/3">The new rules build on the improvements already made to inquiry procedure rules more generally in August 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/4">The key changes are:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/5" class="indent">The introduction of round table sessions will allow parties to discuss areas of concern with each other. Experience at other inquiries has shown that these can be a very effective means of agreeing facts and narrowing areas of disagreement both before and during the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/6" class="indent">The introduction of a technical adviser who will be tasked with assessing the technical evidence of all parties and will produce his own independent report on the technical issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/7" class="indent">The introduction of mediation into inquiry proceedings which will help to narrow the issues before and during the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/8" class="indent">A date for the delivery of the inspector's report will be announced at the end of the inquiry. This will give certainty to the parties about the length of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/9" class="indent">The provision to limit cross-examination where the inquiry timetable is put at risk has been introduced so that a situation should not arise where people at the beginning of an inquiry are not allowed to encroach into cross-examination time allocated to those at the end of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/10">All these measures included in the rules will help to improve the inquiry system for major infrastructure projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.5/1">The Government have not adopted a formal national strategy for integrated product policy (IPP) at this stage. However, we are contributing to the development of a policy framework for IPP at EU level, in line with conclusions adopted by the Council of Ministers in June last year. We have also set up the Advisory Committee on Consumer Products and the Environment (ACCPE) to advise on the development of IPP approaches in the UK and how they can most effectively be put into practice to reduce the impacts of consumer goods. Further consideration will be needed in the light of ACCPE's second report, Action for Greener Products, published earlier this month, and a White Paper on IPP which the European Commission has undertaken to produce this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/2">An example of where elements of IPP thinking are already being applied successfully in the UK is in some of the main electrical and electronic product sectors, for which Defra runs a strategy and practical implementation programme called the Market Transformation Programme. This has been working with manufacturers and other stakeholders to achieve savings in the energy used by major domestic goods and by commercial equipment. The lessons learned in this programme are now being tried out to address other environmental issues such as water consumption related to domestic goods and equipment.</p>
