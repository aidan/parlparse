	<p pid="a.191.2/1">The objective of the Pesticide Incident Appraisal Panel and the principle of case assessment were set out in my Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January 2005</phrase> (<i>WA 141</i>).</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/2">For the panel to accept a case as an ill health incident there needs to be a clearly defined incident, investigated by HSE (or a local authority), together with associated ill health. Each individual case is discussed by the panel, within the framework published in the annual <i>Pesticide Incident Report</i>, until there is consensus. Details of these discussions are not directly relevant to the panel objectives and not recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/3">The five investigations listed included the assessment of 10 individual cases. For eight of the individual cases the panel concluded that there was no discrete event linked to a specific pesticide exposure. For two of the individual cases the panel concluded that the alleged ill health was unrelated to any exposure and the two incidents involving these individuals were assessed as &quot;unrelated&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.5/2">Individual cases will be categorised as &quot;insufficient information&quot; where there are no data properly to assess either the exposure or the ill health. This includes where there is no clear route of exposure, known documents or medical reports are unavailable and where symptoms are inadequately defined. Each individual case is discussed by the panel, within the framework published in the annual <i>Pesticide Incident Report</i>, until there is consensus. Details of these discussions are not directly relevant to the panel objectives and not recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/3">Where, as in the case highlighted, incidents involve more than one person alleged to have been made ill, each individual case is assessed independently. Where the individuals receive a different assessment by the panel, the overall incident is classified according to the most serious individual assessment. It is categorisation of the incident that is of specific importance in enabling the panel to meet its primary objective and in this case the panel assessed the incident as &quot;confirmed&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.5/40">3. The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years. FES figures are single calendar years from 1979&ndash;87, two combined calendar years from 1998&ndash;89 to 1992&ndash;93 and two financial years combined from 1993&ndash;94 to 1995&ndash;96.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/41">4. Income definitions differ slightly between the two series.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/42">For all FRS years 1994&ndash;95 to 2002&ndash;03, the level of absolute low income was estimated as &pound;166 per week for the before housing costs (BHC) measure, and &pound;142 for the after housing costs (AHC) in average 2002-03 prices after adjustment for inflation, and was estimated using reported values from respondents to the 1996&ndash;97 FRS.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/43">The estimated equivalent level for all FES years was &pound;168 per week BHC, and &pound;143 per week AHC, in 2002&ndash;03 prices, and was estimated using results reported from the 1995&ndash;96 and 1996&ndash;97 FES.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/44">Over the period 1979 to 2002-03, the proportion of working-age adults experiencing low income using this measure was at its lowest in 2002&ndash;03 both BHC and AHC. The statement is true for other thresholds of median and mean income, with the exception of the 40 per cent mean threshold BHC, for which there was a slight, although not statistically significant, increase between 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03. However low-income levels on this threshold remained lower in 2002&ndash;03 than in the mid to late nineties.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.5/4">The UK was particularly instrumental in the negotiations at the Tenth Conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires in December; we helped to establish consensus on an adaptation package for developing countries, and agreement was also reached on holding a seminar in May to begin to look at what the international community would like to see happen after the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period ends in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">The Environment Agency (the agency) responds to specific incidents of fly-tipping. The agency and the local government association have agreed the &quot;fly-tipping protocol&quot; that sets out the respective roles and responsibilities of the agency and local authorities. The agency will respond to incidents: of a large scale, that involve organised crime of containers of hazardous waste. They may also intervene if the illegally dumped waste is causing water pollution or a flood-risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/2">The agency response may consist of one or more of a number of elements, depending on the incident. These elements include: investigation, clear-up and the serving of notices for the removal of waste and enforcement action, including prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.8/1">The figures quoted by the commission described the ceiling on annual support for modal shift schemes in England, Scotland and Wales. Support within this ceiling received state aid clearance; the figures did not represent a commitment by government to provide a particular level of support. The indicative allocation for the sustainable distribution fund in 2007&ndash;08 reflects in part the fact that the Government's current commitments on rail freight spending will be complete by the end of the preceding financial year. We start again with a new pot of money in April 2007, and new state aid clearances will be needed to continue some of the schemes funded through the pot. Spending levels beyond this will be set in SR2006.</p>
