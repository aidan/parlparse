	<p pid="a.45.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2" qnum="HL1597">Whether they will describe the essence of the defence of necessity in cases involving the Official Secrets Act indicating the origins of this defence and the main cases in recent years in which it has been used.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-03-17a.45.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="45"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040317/text/40317w01.htm#40317w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.45.2/1">Necessity is a common law defence which applies to all crimes. The origin of the defence of necessity in Official Secrets Act cases arises from the case of David Shayler, who was prosecuted for an offence under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989. In that case the Court of Appeal decided that in addition to the defences specifically provided by the Act the defence of duress or necessity of circumstance was available to defendants charged with an offence contrary to Section 1 of the 1989 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">The essence of the defence is that it is available when a defendant commits an otherwise criminal act to avoid an imminent peril of danger to life or serious injury to himself or towards somebody for whom he regards himself as responsible. That person need not be named and may not be identifiable. If it is not possible to name the person it must be possible to identify them by reason of the threat to them which may be avoided by the defendant taking action. The defendant has a responsibility for them because he is placed in a position where he has a choice whether to take or not to take the action which will avoid them being injured. The act done should be no more than is reasonably necessary to avoid the harm feared and the harm resulting from the act should not be disproportionate to the harm avoided.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/3">The defence of necessity has been used in the case of David Shayler and was raised by the defence in the case of Katharine Gun.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.5/1">During the 2002 and 2003 meetings of the Bangladesh Development Forum, donors expressed concerns over the Government of Bangladesh's handling of the Chittagong Hill tracts. They expressed particular concern at the slow pace of implementation of the Chittagong Hill tracts peace accord. Given this, we are disappointed with the continued lack of progress on implementation of the peace accord, and are concerned at the increasing unrest in the region including violent clashes between rival tribal groups, settlers and the military. In advance of the 2004 Bangladesh Development Forum in May we will be discussing with donor colleagues the most appropriate way to raise these concerns during that meeting. Rebo</p>

Naval Service All RN recruits are required to undertake a pre-joining fitness test which must be passed before entering the Service. Pass rates in the potential Royal Marines course average out at 50 to 55 per cent. Army All Army recruits must pass the initial fitness test in order to complete recruit training. Failure to complete a fitness test results in the recruit being retrained and retested. RAF All RAF recruits undertake the fitness test in week one of phase 1 training and again at the end of phase 1. During the period April to December 2003, the pass rates were 80 per cent and 88 per cent respectively. All recruits are expected to attain the standards of the RAF fitness test before the end of phase 2 training.</p>

RN recruits have to pass this element of their training before moving into the fleet. It is mandatory for a Marine to have completed the battle swimming test before he can be operationally deployed. Army Army recruits are not required to pass the military swimming test (MST). The MST may be completed at any time during a soldier's service and is recorded on each soldier's record of service. RAF The RAF has tested the swimming ability of new entrants only since June 2003. Between June 2003 and March 2004, some 1,775 recruits undertook their initial RAF swimming test, and 357 (20 per cent) could not achieve the required swimming standard. Rebo</p>
