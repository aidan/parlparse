	<p pid="a.47.5/1">With effect from today there will be a new approach to decision-making to assist the most senior and experienced lawyers in the CPS to make decisions in the most complex and serious cases. In future, where the case papers are particularly voluminous, the decision-maker may be assisted by another experienced lawyer, who will provide the decision-maker with a detailed analysis of the case, drawing attention to the key issues on which the decision must depend. The decision-maker may rely on this analysis, together with the essential evidence in the case papers and supplemented by such other evidence as the decision-maker chooses to consider, in applying the tests set out in the code for crown prosecutors and making his decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.5/2">This approach marks a change from the procedures put in place following the publication in August 1999 of the report of His Honour Gerald Butler QC into CPS decision-making in relation to deaths in custody and related matters. The recommendations in that report referred to the need for the decision-maker to read &quot;the whole of the relevant documentation&quot;. The effect has been that the most senior lawyers in the CPS have been precluded by their other commitments from taking decisions in some of the service's most serious and important casework. The new approach will allow a more effective use of their time and will thus enable greater input by senior lawyers into the most critical casework decisions that the service faces.</p>

We have decided that all applicants for a Certificate of Identity, including those who have indefinite leave to enter or remain, must prove that they cannot obtain a passport from the authorities of their own country. People who have exceptional leave to enter or remain (i.e. leave for a limited period) will also have to show that they need to travel for an essential reason, such as business, education, religion or compassionate circumstances.

	<p pid="a.49.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-06">6 September 2002</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced the appointment of an independent review team, led by Patrick Carter, to take a fundamental look at the operations of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). In particular, the review team was tasked to support the CRB management in the short term and to identify necessary longer-term changes in the way the CRB operates to ensure that it can deliver its twin objectives of providing greater protection for children and vulnerable adults whilst ensuring that the disclosure process does not act as a bar to speedy recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/2">We have today placed in the Library the main findings and recommendations of the independent review team.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/3">We are extremely grateful to Patrick Carter and his two colleagues&mdash;John Holden and Ron Skelly&mdash;for their rapid and thorough examination of the situation at the CRB and their recommendations on the way forward. The team has come up with a wide ranging set of recommendations for improvements to the CRB intended to enable it to to meet future challenges as demand for its services continues to grow. The CRB is a vital element of the Government's programme to improve the protection of children and vulnerable adults from those who might wish to harm them. It needs to be put on a sounder footing to meet these objectives more effectively and provide the levels of service rightly expected by its customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/4">The independent review team's recommendations build on the steady improvement in the CRB's performance over the past six months which has seen the average number of disclosures issued rise from 24,500 per week in August 2002 to the current 40,000 per week. Some 80 per cent of standard disclosures and 50 per cent of enhanced disclosures are now issued within three weeks. These improvements have been achieved by both the agency and Capita working in partnership to deliver the service that the CRB's customers are entitled to receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/5">The Government propose to take forward the 10 recommendations in the report as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/6" class="indent">1 Ways should be sought of optimising the end-to-end CRB process efficiency, by reviewing and rationalising the management responsibilities and respective roles in the complete chain undertaken by Registered Bodies, the CRB Agency, Capita and local police forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/7">The Government agree that the roles of the different parties involved in the CRB process should be strengthened and clarified. In particular, we intend to enhance the intelligent customer function within the agency so that there is a stronger focus on setting standards across the whole operation and ensuring that these are met. There also needs to be better management co-ordination of the CRB end-to-end business processes. This may involve the more flexible deployment of agency and private sector staff and to this end we will take powers in the Criminal Justice Bill to enable the Secretary of State's functions under Part V of the Police Act 1997 to be exercised by the private sector as well as agency staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/8" class="indent">2 The critical role of Registered Bodies in the CRB process needs to be recognised and upgraded. Registered bodies should be unambiguously responsible for validating the identity of those for whom they seek Disclosures and for ensuring the quality and completeness of applications submitted to the CRB. The number of Registered Bodies should be optimised to establish sensible economies of scale and improve proficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/9">The Government accept this recommendation and will legislate this Session to make it clear that registered bodies are responsible for verifying the identity of an applicant. It would, as now, be open to a registered body to delegate the function of validating identity to the prospective employer or other agent while retaining overall responsiblity, as long as we are satisfied in a particular case that delegation provides a reasonable safeguard. To ensure that registered bodies discharge their responsibilities effectively, we will take powers to attach conditions to a registration and to revoke a registration where such conditions are breached. We share the review team's view that optimum levels of efficiency within a registered body can best be achieved by handling a sufficient number of disclosure applications. With the new responsibilities for registered bodies, a number of those currently countersigning relatively small numbers of applications may seek to de-register of their own volition. We will monitor the situation carefully. The Government will take reserve powers to set a threshold for the minimum number of applications to be processed by a registered body each year and to de-register those registered bodies which fall below the threshold. Registered bodies and others across the sectors which use the CRB's disclosure service will be fully consulted before those changes are implemented. We will take particular account of concerns that have been expressed about access to registered bodies and the level of fees charged by some umbrella bodies. As part of the consultation exercise, we will seek views on placing a cap on the fees that may be levied by registered bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/10" class="indent">3 There shoud be a progressive move to mandate electronic submission of applications by Registered Bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/11">The CRB will introduce an electronic appplication channel as soon as practicable; a pilot will be undertaken later this year. We believe that many registered bodies will want to adopt this channel as their preferred means of submitting disclosure applications. In time, as more and more registered bodies migrate to the electronic channel there will be a diminishing case, on efficiency grounds, for maintaining the existing paper and telephone channels. At that point, consideration would need to be given whether to mandate&mdash;by means of a condition attached to registration&mdash;the electronic channel for registered bodies to submit applications to the CRB. This will not preclude individuals submitting their applications to registered bodies by paper or telephone channels where mutually agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/12" class="indent">4 Given that the production of Enhanced Disclosures is significantly more costly and ties up local police force resources, new arrangements should be established for the Agency to set priorities, in accordance with Government Guidelines, on which applications should get Enhanced and which should get Standard Disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/13">The Government agree with the spirit of this recommendation, but it is important that the criteria are set by Ministers, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, on the basis of a risk assessment. Having established the criteria for standard and enhanced disclosures it is important that there is some mechanism to ensure that they are properly observed. It is proposed, therefore, to amend the Police Act 1997 first to enable the type of disclosure for any given occupational group to be determined by regulations and then to enable the CRB to give effect to such regulations. Where necessary, the CRB would be expected to seek additional information from the registered body in order that it could make its assessment in any given case. We will take account of the views of registered bodies and others before implementing these changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/14" class="indent">5 It is recommended that the Police National Computer (PNC) files are &quot;flagged&quot; to denote the existence of intelligence information on any individual held at local force level and not included in convictions recorded on the PNC.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/15">The cost and feasibility of introducing a system of flags on the PNC to denote the existence of local intelligence will be tested in a pilot due to commence in three forces (Metropolitan Police, Staffordshire and West Midlands) in the spring. Decisions about the rollout of such a system will be taken in the light of the outcome of the pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/16" class="indent">6 It is recommended that the launch of Basic Disclosures be postponed until the CRB systems have been developed to provide a substantially greater capacity. It would be inappropriate the launch Basic Disclosures until higher priority categories of applicant for higher level Disclosures are seeing their needs fully accommodated. It is also recommended that Basic Disclosure applications should be routed through Registered Bodies, with identity validation undertaken by these Bodies, rather than allow direct submission from applicants as currently envisaged by the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/17">The Government concur that the priority for the CRB is to ensure that demand for higher level disclosures is fully met and that applicants for such disclosures receive a satisfactory service. Basic disclosures will not be introduced until these objectives have been achieved. The Government note the case for routing applications for a basic disclosure through a registered body as in the case of standard and enhanced disclosures, but will want to consult fully with employer organisations and others on the implications before coming to a final view. In the event that the Government decide to proceed, legislation would be needed to implement this recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/18" class="indent">7 The Information Technology system built and operated by Capita has been subject to a range of improvements and enhancements since original delivery, as a result of which performance has improved. A further programme of significant enhancement will be required. Additionally, almost all the recommendations set out here would lead to requirements for system change and therefore would have contractual consequences. It is therefore recommended to attempt to renegotiate the contract with Capita to implement necessary technology renewal and align the contract to the changed and evolving circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/19">The Government accept this recommendation and will seek to renegotiate the contract with Capita so that it reflects the changed environment in which the CRB will be operating.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/20" class="indent">8 An investigation should be undertaken into the possibility of requiring fingerprints to be submitted by applicants for Disclosures where the sensitivity of the employment role to be undertaken makes this appropriate. This would enable a more rigorous linking of police records (which in turn are mostly linked to fingerprints) and the individuals submitting applications for Disclosures. This investigation will need to look at the balance to be struck between such increasing rigour of CRB identity processes and the cost and convenience of the service to the customer.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/21">The Government will undertake a further study in consultation with registered bodies and others on the case for, and practicalities of, requiring applicants for disclosures in particularly sensitive employment roles to submit their fingerprints with their application. Among the issues the study will need to address is how to avoid any unnecessary intrusion into the privacy of applicants. A decision whether to proceed will be taken in the light of the results of the consultation exercise. Legislation would be needed to implement this change.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/22" class="indent">9 While recognising the benefits derived from establishing the CRB under the wing of an existing Agency, it is now recommended that an independent Executive Agency is created within the Home Office to carry forward the CRB's changing and increasingly demanding functions. There will need to be a transitional period which will be overseen by a transitional Management Board operating within an appropriate governance framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/23">The Government agree that the CRB, currently part of the Passport and Records Agency, should be reconstituted as a free-standing agency. The new agency will be established as soon as practicable. A transitional board has been established to ensure a smooth transition. John Holden has agreed to serve as the non-executive chairman of the board and Patrick Carter and Ron Skelley as non-executive members. A stakeholder group will be established under John Holden's chairmanship to represent the interests of government departments and the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/24" class="indent">10 In order to implement a number of the recommendations, changes to the legislative framework under which the CRB operates (Part V of the Police Act 1997) will be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/25">As indicated above, the Government will take forward in the Criminal Justice Bill the necessary legislative changes needed to implement Recommendations 1, 2 and 4.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-02-27a.53.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100395" speakername="Lord Macdonald of Tradeston" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030227/text/30227w02.htm#30227w02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.53.5/1">Last summer the Government published a set of seven consultation papers on the future development of air transport in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">26 November</phrase> the High Court upheld a challenge against the exclusion of options for additional runways at Gatwick Airport. On <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> the Secretary of State for Transport told the House in another place (Official Report, cols. 474&ndash;87) that he would not appeal against the judgment, because an appeal would result in an extensive period of uncertainty for people up and down the country. The Government therefore announced that they were keeping open the consultation, which had been due to end on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>, and that they would publish a further consultation paper including runway options at Gatwick.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/3">We are today publishing the further consultation material. We have decided that it would be easier for consultees to publish it in the form of second editions of the full south-east consultation paper, the summary south-east paper and the questionnaires for both the south-east and other areas of the UK. Consultees can easily see the text added as a result of including the Gatwick options.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/4">The new documents include the original consultation material on options at Heathrow, Stansted, Luton and other south-east airports, and the option for a new airport at Cliffe. In addition, in accordance with the High Court decision, the papers now include options for additional runways at Gatwick.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/5">As for options on the other south-east airports published last July, the papers now set out for Gatwick all the options which were appraised in detail in the later stages of the South East and East of England Regional Air Services (SERAS) study. Accordingly, there are two options for a single new runway at Gatwick and one option for two new runways there. The papers also set out alternative assumptions on the timing of these Gatwick options.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/6">The consultation, for all parts of the UK, will now close on <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. We will consider carefully all responses received by that date, including proposals for options other than those which have been included in the Government's consultation documents. This is an opportunity for anyone to express their views on all the options in the consultation, as well as to put forward any reasonable alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/7">Copies of all the new documents are available in the Printed Paper Office and in the Library. Officials are writing to everyone on the original consultation list, and to all those who have responded to the consultations so far, to alert them to the new documents and to the <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> deadline, and explaining that people who have already submitted responses can choose either to let their response stand, or to add to, or amend, or withdraw their response in the light of the new material.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.0/1">We fund Ufi to carry out two functions key to our agenda; to deliver innovative learning through the network of learndirect centres, and to provide the national learndirect information and advice service.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/2">Ufi receives public funding through two channels. My department makes available an annual grant which funds Ufi's infrastructure and operating costs such as product development. Additional departmental funding provides for the learndirect information and advice service.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/3">Secondly the Learning and Skills Council funds learning delivered through the network of learndirect centres. In line with government policy Ufi also generates commercial income, for example through the sale and supply of services and products outside of public policy areas. Details of the public funding that Ufi receives area set out in table 1.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.56.0/13">The department covers the difference between Ufi's commercial income and expenditure by making available a grant up to the levels shown above. To date Ufi has not drawn down the maximum grant because of higher than expected levels of income and savings across expenditure headings.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/14">For 2003&ndash;04, the department has secured &pound;44 million for general funding and &pound;12.25 million for the information and advice service. The LSC is making available &pound;159.5 million in 2003&ndash;04 for funding learning delivered through learndirect centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/15">We are currently undertaking a review of the DfES/Ufi/LSC relationship to establish a long-term sustainable relationship. This may suggest different organisational and funding implications from those at present. Because of this it will be difficult to forecast expenditure with any certainty beyond 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/16">Ufi also provides the learndirect information and advice service. This is an impartial, comprehensive, national telephone and web-based service available to adults across the country. By using the UK-wide learning opportunities database, advisers are able to direct inquirers to a range of appropriate local learning opportunities. The service does not book potential learners on to learndirect courses. Departmental funding for this is detailed at table 1. To date the learndirect information and advice service has responded to nearly 5,000,000 enquiries via the telephone service. The learndirect website has to date received 9,579,388 hits.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/17">The Learning and Skills Council, as the national post-16 funding body, funds learning delivered through the learndirect network. The estimated LSC funding used to date is shown in table 2. Ufi has exceeded expectations in terms of course delivery. For example between <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>, 707,279 individuals registered for 1,566,370 learndirect courses.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.14/1">The number of vehicles being abandoned has grown in recent years, largely due to a fall in the price of scrap metal and deficiencies in the accuracy of the vehicle register Implementation of the End of Life Vehicles Directive might lead to a further increase because of a consequential rise in the costs of disposal, but the Government are already addressing the problem with a number of initiatives announced last year. Statutory notice periods after which local authorities can remove abandoned vehicles from the highway have been reduced and can now be as short as 24 hours. We will be consulting in the spring on reducing the statutory notice periods of vehicles abandoned on private land. Local authorities can seek information about the keeper of a vehicle from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) more quickly than before via a new electronic link funded under the Invest to Save programme. In addition, the Finance Act 2002 contained outline powers to establish a system of continuous registration in order to ensure that keepers of vehicles remain responsible for licensing their vehicle until such time that the DVLA has been properly notified of its sale or disposal. The Department for Transport is currently considering how this will be implemented, and will make a announcement in due course. All these measures will make it more difficult for vehicles to be abandoned with impunity.</p>

This includes 21,710 in 866 flocks tested as part of a survey of rare breed genotypes (for which there are no culling requirements). Under the terms of the plan's ram genotyping schemes, NSP members with rams carrying one or two copies of the scrapie susceptible VRQ allele, have agreed that under normal circumstances these rams will be slaughtered or otherwise prevented breeding by castration or vasectomy. Instructions to slaughter or castrate 8,112 rams have so far been dispatched, of which confirmation of slaughter or castration has been received for 5,956. The remainder are either ram lambs that are being fattened for slaughter, or rams (with 1 VRQ allele) that are being used by agreement with the flock owner in controlled breeding programmes because there is a particularly low level of resistance conferring genotypes in the flock, or rams that are subject to a reminder instruction to slaughter. The number of rams by breed for which confirmation of slaughter/castration has been received is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.59.35/1">The Rural Payments Agency does not have data relating solely to the Beef Special Premium Scheme. However, it is estimated that producers made 20,000 representations in 2002 in relation to all bovine subsidy claims because the British Cattle Movement Service records differed from those held by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. This represents 7 per cent of the total bovine subsidy claims received.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.41/1">Keepers who send movement information to the British Cattle Movement Service through its website can see that a transaction has been recorded by revisiting the site the next day. Those who send movement data through the bulk e-mail system will receive a file receipt notification from BCMS for every file they send.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.41/2">The barrier to the issue of a receipt for each movement card received by the BCMS is cost. With up to 48,000 movement cards received in a single day last year the logistics of producing and despatching receipts for them all are daunting. With the waiver to industry bearing the full cost of the BCMS services due to expire on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>, the cost of the production of receipts (manpower, materials and postage) would be passed directly to industry. The cost could be over &pound;10,000 per day, just for receipts.</p>
