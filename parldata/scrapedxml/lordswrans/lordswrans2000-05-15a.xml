	<p pid="a.2.2/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State at the Home Department (Mr Boateng) is pleased to announce today that 24 areas have been selected to participate in the On Track programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">The On Track programme is a long-term crime reduction programme aimed at children between four and twelve years who are at risk of offending. It is a central element of the Government's Crime Reduction Programme's agenda on tackling the causes of crime. Eighty local authorities were invited last December to participate in the programme. The 24 areas have been selected from 76.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/3">The objective will be to establish in each pilot area an enhanced range of evidenced-based preventive services. These will include family support training, home visiting, pre-school education, parent-school partnerships, family therapy and specialist interventions. There will be intensive inter-agency co-operation so that children at risk of offending are identified early and they and their families provided with consistent services through the child's development.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.2/30">The On Track programme will establish an effective and cohesive programme of early prevention in these communities. It will have a real impact on youth crime in the areas concerned and provide valuable information on what works best in terms of early prevention.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">Following discussions between the departments concerned, the reply given by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Home Department (Mr Boateng) in another place (House of Commons Official Report, col. 443 on <phrase class="date" code="1999-05-20">20 May 1999</phrase>), requires expansion. The Home Secretary has general ministerial responsibility for enforcement action under the Landmines Act 1998 taken by the police in England and Wales, with parallel responsibilities being exercised in Northern Ireland by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and in Scotland by the Scottish Ministers. Her Majesty's Customs and Excise also have enforcement responsibilities under the Act. In addition, the Foreign Secretary has responsibility for policy on the Ottawa Convention and for co-ordinating any amendments to the Landmines Act which may arise from amendments to the Ottawa Convention. Action may be taken under other provisions of the Act by the Secretaries of State for the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Attorney General and the Attorney General for Northern Ireland.</p>
