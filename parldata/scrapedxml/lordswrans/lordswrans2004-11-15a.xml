	<p pid="a.107.2/1">We declared Bowman to be in service on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-26">26 March 2004</phrase>. At the in-service date, as planned, Bowman was capable of supporting two mechanised battalions in non-warfighting operations. It delivered high quality, secure voice communications down to half-section level including the vehicles that would be deployed in such operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">We have always planned for Bowman, like other complex programmes, to be developed and delivered incrementally from in-service date. Therefore, work is continuing on conversion of, for example, armoured fighting vehicles, ships and helicopters, and on a comprehensive and progressive test and trials programme, ranging from laboratory integration and analysis to operational field trials. A further brigade-level field trial is due to be held before the end of the year. The aim of all this work is to achieve the full functionality of Bowman including data messaging, situational awareness capability and assurance of the system's robustness and usability. Together with parallel work to develop the non-equipment elements of military capability, we plan to achieve full warfighting capability in stages across different operational environments&mdash;land based, amphibious and air assault&mdash;over the next two years or so.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">We intend that the first deployment of Bowman for non-warfighting operations will take place at brigade level next year. We will continue to use experience from this deployment to inform the continuing programme to deliver the full Bowman capability.</p>

The MoU is supplemented by an exchange of letters between the UK and US Defence Secretaries, which, inter alia, identify the principle of data sharing.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/2">In line with this approach, access to such avionics software required at this stage to enable both the MoD and UK companies to participate as key partners in the design and development of the aircraft has been achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">The integrated children's system (ICS) will be quite different from the information database(s). The ICS is a framework for councils with social services responsibilities' (CSSRs') work with children in need and their families that provides a single approach for assessment, planning, intervention and reviewing based on an understanding of children's development needs in the context of their families and communities. It is designed to improve outcomes for children in need. The information gathered in the course of working with children and their families must be recorded by social services. These records have traditionally been paper-based but increasingly councils have electronic record-keeping systems in place. As part of implementing the integrated children's system, social service records kept on their work with children in need will all be kept electronically, replacing paper-based systems. The ICS is simply a better way to maintain and meet existing record-keeping requirements and, therefore, requires no legislative provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">The ICS will provide a more effective way of keeping and accessing records relating to social services work with chidren and families than exists at present. This will help to improve standards of service to children and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">The information database(s) provided for by the Children Bill will not contain detailed case information such as this. The information sharing databases will be broader in their coverage than the ICS (they will cover all children in England, whereas the ICS will record information about the 4 per cent of children in need known to social services at any one time), but narrower in terms of the information they will hold about the child. They will contain basic information about all children and the contact details of practitioners working with them across the board. This will be a new and valuable tool in aiding a wide range of practitioners in working together to meet children's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/4">There is no explicit relationship between the IT system which supports the use of the ICS and the information databases. The IT system which CSSRs purchase for the ICS are designed to hold information about children in need and their families, who are in receipt of services from social services. It is, therefore, a specialist system for holding case-based data.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.2/1">RSPB, English Nature, Environment Agency and local authorities in the north-west are promoting a Ribble estuary regional park to examine the long-term viability of environmental enhancement throughout the estuary. This includes improving defences, creating habitat areas, establishing visitor centres and improving recreation.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/2">The Environment Agency has also undertaken a managed realignment study of the estuary to examine the suitability of a number of sites for potential managed realignment.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/3">The Ribble estuary falls within the Ribble pilot river basin, the UK's pilot for implementation of the Water Framework Directive. This directive requires a strategic, river basin-based approach to managing water bodies and improving their ecological and chemical status. As part of the pilot the Environment Agency will be working closely with stakeholders, to develop a prototype river basin management plan for the Ribble basin, including the Ribble estuary.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.2/1">The Government support a wide range of approaches to help consumers to identify products which deliver better environmental performance. Taking the example of white goods, the development of the mandatory EU energy label has advanced considerably since the first cold products were labelled in the mid-1990s, and that labelling regime is now an important driver for product improvement and consumer choice. Other good labelling regimes that apply to these products, on a voluntary basis, are the EU ecolabel and the Energy Saving Trust's &quot;Energy Efficiency Recommended&quot;. The Government promote awareness of reliable information schemes through the Defra website, an electronic newsletter &quot;Pitching Green&quot;, and a pocket-sized &quot;Shopper's Guide to Green Labels&quot;. They also offer a &quot;Directory of Green Labels&quot; as a reference guide to existing and forthcoming labelling initiatives. At a more detailed level, information about green product standards and benchmarks is available on the market transformation programme website (<a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>), along with searchable databases showing the relative performance of different products for some categories of goods.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.5/1">Over the last three years the department has been actively supporting the EU ecolabel scheme (the flower mark) in a number of related ways, which involve administration and promotion of the scheme in the UK and the development of strategy and technical content for the scheme at EU level. In terms of staff support, Defra acts as the UK's competent body for the scheme and its officials are therefore responsible for administering the scheme in the UK and for representing the UK in EU meetings about the scheme. Officials are supported by specialist contractors who advise on technical and scientific aspects of the scheme. Other financial commitments include work on the development of new product criteria and the promotion of the scheme through a range of media. At the EU level the UK plays an active part in supporting and advancing the scheme, for example in leading the development process for several product groups and in chairing the policy committee which is looking at options for the future of the scheme and its contribution to other product-related policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">The Government believe that land to which the public has a right of access under Section 2(1) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 will generally fall within the meaning of a public place contained in other primary legislation, including the Firearms Act 1968. Section 42 of the CRoW Act gives the Government power to make regulations to disregard the right of access to access land in considering whether such land is a public place for the purposes of existing legislation. Following public consultation, the Government have decided not to make such regulations but to keep the matter under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/2">The public place provisions in the Firearms Act 1986 are designed to ensure that firearms are used responsibly and safely in public places. The Act makes it an offence for a person to have a firearm in a public place unless he has lawful authority or a reasonable excuse for doing so. This should not affect a landowner's or occupier's ability to use a firearm for a legitimate purpose on his own land. As the Firearms Act already allows firearms to be used for legitimate activities, like organised shoots and pest control, the Government do not anticipate that it will lead to increased burdens for landowners or occupiers engaged in such activities on access land. Defra has issued guidance on legislation that affects public places, including guidance to police authorities on the Firearms Act 1968. This can be found on the Defra website at: defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/accessopen/accessopen08.htm.</p>

The randomised badger culling trial (RBCT), which was designed to provide information about whether badger culling is effective in reducing TB in cattle, is ongoing. It is not possible, therefore, to estimate what effect badger culling would have had on compensation expenditure between April 2001 and March 2004.</p>

It is for departments to determine the selection of posts which could be reduced, having regard to the need to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and expertise to meet their ongoing requirements. Cabinet Office guidance to departments made clear that they need to ensure that their procedures do not result in unlawful discrimination directly or indirectly and to consider the impact of their plans on the diversity of the workforce, so that specific groups of staff are not disproportionately disadvantaged. In particular, departments must consider the need to conduct a race equality impact assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">The 2008 target in fact requires that we increase the number of minority ethnic staff in the Senior Civil Service by almost two-thirds in the next four years. The PSA target also includes the commitment that, in the longer term, the Civil Service reflects the diversity of the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/2">The 2008 disability and ethnicity targets will be measured on a slightly different basis from the current targets for 2006; the 2008 targets focus more narrowly on around 3,900 mainstream posts in the Senior Civil Service itself, while the targets for 2005 include all posts at SCS level, encompassing around 500 additional posts, including a number of Diplomatic Service posts and some specialist/professional roles. This change will focus our efforts on maintstream SCS roles and will mean that the ethnicity and disability targets will be measured on a consistent basis with the gender targets (which are currently based on data on the SCS alone). The baseline figure for minority ethnic staff in the SCS against which the target was set is 2.4 per cent (October 2003), compared to the October 2003 SCS level figure of 3.2 per cent.</p>
