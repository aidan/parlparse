	<p pid="b.133.1/2" qnum="HL917">With reference to the Charges for Residues Surveillance (Amendment) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/2439), why charges for eggs have been raised by 30 per cent and for milk and bovine and soliped carcasses by 9 per cent; and whether this reflects a situation that has been wrong for a number of years.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.2/1">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) consults annually on the proposed adjustments to the charges for surveillance of animal foodstuffs for residues of veterinary medicines and unauthorised substances. The charges seek to recover income from the individual sectors to cover the costs of collecting and analysing the samples and operating the programme in accordance with EU requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/2">The charges to the egg industry for the financial year 2007-08 were raised by 6 per cent&mdash;not 30 per cent. This reflects an agreement between the VMD and the British Egg Industry Council (BEIC), whereby the BEIC pays the whole charge for the egg industry and collects the money from its members as it judges appropriate. The resulting savings in administrative overheads from charging one body rather than several hundred individual egg packers means that the increases are kept much lower. However, the option of charging the higher amount is retained in the Statutory Instrument in case the agreement with the BEIC ends and the VMD has to resume charging individual businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/3">In respect of charges in general, the VMD noted in its consultation exercise for the 2004-05 financial year that a number of imbalances between sectors had arisen in previous years, be addressed in the following years. This is being done. The VMD is aware of the difficulties faced by the agriculture industry and makes every effort to continually improve the efficiency of the programme. In the forthcoming review of the legislation which needed to governing the surveillance programme the VMD will take every opportunity to press for the programme to move to a more risk-based approach in taking samples.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.3/1">Under the Zoonoses (Monitoring) Regulations 2007, an inspector means any person appointed to be an inspector for the purposes of these regulations by the Secretary of State or a local authority. This person would not necessarily have to be a veterinary surgeon. Defra ensures that inspectors required to mark any animal, whether for research or as part of a monitoring programme, are properly trained. Most animal marking techniques used in monitoring (such as paint spraying) are non-invasive. A frequently used invasive method, ear tagging, is straightforward and can be performed by farm operators or trained animal health staff. Any use of such methods would need to comply with animal welfare legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.3/2">To ensure full protection for wild animals, Regulation 6 of the Zoonoses (Monitoring) Regulations 2007 makes Natural England a statutory consultee. Natural England is a non-departmental public body which can advise on the impact of monitoring and survey work on the wild animal populations. This includes the practicalities in relation to wild animal control and protection, sampling of animals and application of any marks. Animal welfare would be an important consideration.</p>

	<p pid="b.137.6/1">Working closely with the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, the military managed ward within the S4 trauma/orthopaedic ward at Selly Oak had achieved the desired operational capability by last July. A total of 39 military nurses had been appointed, in addition to NHS civilian staff serving on the ward. To strengthen the military presence at Birmingham, a Standing Joint Commander (Medical) and a military ward master for S4 had been appointed. The layout of the ward had been changed to produce a separate 12 bed partitioned area for military patients. Over the previous year military welfare and psychiatric support to all military patients in the Birmingham area had been boosted.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.6/2">We intend to continue our partnership with the NHS in the development of a military ward in the new Birmingham hospital that will replace Selly Oak from 2010. We are discussing detailed arrangements with the University Hospital Birmingham Trust. The new ward will allow military patients to be nursed together in four-bed units and we intend that the military ethos within the ward will be enhanced. The nurses will be predominantly military, as now, working with civilian NHS counterparts, and they will continue to nurse civilian patients when required. We also intend to have dedicated reception arrangements for visitors to the military ward, and to include rehabilitation facilities within it.</p>

Military patients requiring trauma or orthopaedic treatment are generally accommodated together in the partitioned-off section of the military-managed ward when clinically appropriate. On occasions where numbers of injured service personnel have exceeded the number of beds available in the partitioned area, they are accommodated elsewhere on the ward, where they are cared for by the same military and civilian nursing team. Military patients who have different clinical requirements are accommodated on other wards, where they will still receive frequent visits from military nursing staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.139.6/1">The MoD provides a good death in service benefits from the Armed Forces Pension Scheme and compensation for injury in service through the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. Commercial insurance is for those requiring additional cover. MoD cannot advise individuals whether to take out insurance or on the effectiveness of particular schemes as such matters are regulated by the Financial Services Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.6/2">In the run up to Operation TELIC, insurance companies did react to what they saw as the increased risk to Service personnel. Usually this was by closing their schemes to new applicants, or by increasing premiums. Some did, however, change benefits for existing policyholders deployed on operations by, for example, excluding cover for death caused by the use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. These were commercial decisions made by companies. Consequently, members of such schemes who were already on operations, or about to deploy on operations, were disadvantaged. In response to this, the MoD developed, and launched, a new life insurance scheme called Service Life Insurance (SLI). The SLI scheme, under a unique partnering arrangement with the scheme providers, guarantees worldwide war and terrorism cover, regardless of an individual's likelihood of operational deployment. There are no exclusions for death caused by the use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons.</p>

	<p pid="b.152.6/1">BERR is not aware of such a report produced in 2005. However, the 2003 Imperial College Centre for Energy, Policy and Technology report noted that countries with a mix of investment subsidies, fiscal incentive and feed-in laws were generally doing well in terms of encouraging renewable generation. However, the report also noted that quota systems such as the renewables obligation (RO) were in their infancy and might in time prove to be a successful driver for deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.6/2">Since its introduction in 2002 we have seen renewable generation under the RO more than double from 1.8 per cent in 2002 to 4.4 per cent in 2006. It is a 25-year mechanism and bringing in an alternative so soon after its introduction would undermine investor confidence, potentially result in delays to the commissioning of existing and planned projects due to uncertainty over the regulatory regime.</p>

	<p pid="b.157.5/1">The Government are working to implement the Act as speedily as possible. As the Government stated during the passage of the Bill, implementation of any legislation requires a significant programme of work. In overview, this programme of work will include the development of the necessary court rules and forms, the setting up of the appropriate court processing systems, guidance developed for staff and judicial training undertaken. The views of the public will also be taken into account and the Government have already published a public consultation on the issue of who should be a relevant third party to forced marriage proceedings. The implementation plan therefore includes the time needed to prepare staff and the judiciary and to ensure that support systems are in position once the Act comes into force.</p>

	<p pid="b.162.2/1">The NHS Cord Blood Bank has been set up to complement bone marrow registries. In most cases, if a patient requires a stem cell transplant, cord blood is used only if an appropriate matched bone marrow donor cannot be found. Only 25 to 35 per cent of patients have a matched sibling. The chances of obtaining matched stem cells from an unrelated donor vary, depending on the ethnic origin of the patient. Therefore, matching is greatly improved when the donor and recipient have the same ethnic and racial background.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/2">Since the majority of the 10 million unrelated donors available in registries worldwide at present are of white caucasoid ethnic background, most patients from this racial group have more than a 90 per cent chance of finding a matched, unrelated donor. However, this figure falls substantially for patients from ethnic minorities, who have only a 30 to 40 per cent chance of finding a good match.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/3">The aim of the NHS Cord Blood Bank is to redress the imbalance of minority groups that are represented on bone marrow registries by focusing collection at hospitals with high ethnic diversity and high delivery rates. As a consequence, approximately 40 per cent of donations in the NHS Cord Blood Bank derive from ethnic minority mothers, contrasting with approximately 3 to 4 per cent ethnic minority bone marrow donors presently in the British Bone Marrow Registry, hence increasing the potential matches for patients from diverse ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/4">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) currently licenses, on a case-by-case basis, the screening of embryos where the intention is that the resulting baby's umbilical cord blood stem cells, or bone marrow stem cells, will be used to treat an existing sibling who has a life-threatening or serious illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/5">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill clarifies the scope of the HFEA to make such decisions by introducing five purposes for which embryos can be tested under a treatment licence. One of the purposes is for tissue typing (the creation of a &quot;saviour sibling&quot;). In practice tissue typing is only ever considered when all other options are exhausted; in other words, when there are no matched donors on the registry or within the family.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/6">This may be the case when someone has a particularly rare tissue type. Even if there were a greater supply of cord blood available for treatment, it would still be possible that no match would be found. Therefore, it may still be necessary to use embryo testing to find an embryo that would result in a child with matched tissue whose cord blood cells could be used to treat a sick older sibling.</p>

	<p pid="b.166.5/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill re-enacts the existing provisions set out in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 in relation to a child conceived as a result of assisted conception treatment and who is treated as the father of that child, where donor sperm is used. The woman's husband is the child's father, unless it can be shown that he did not consent to her treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.5/2">Clauses 36 and 37 of the Bill replace similar provisions in the 1990 Act which enable an unmarried man to be the father of a donor-conceived child if he is &quot;treated together&quot; with the mother in a licensed clinic. New provisions in the Bill require the couple each to have given consent by the time the embryo or gametes are placed in the woman, for the man to be treated as the father of any resulting child.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.5/3">The Bill maintains the principle set out in the 1990 Act that if an unmarried couple carry out self-insemination with donor sperm outside a licensed treatment centre or non-medical fertility service, the male partner would not be the legal parent. In this situation, the man would have to acquire formal parental responsibility; for example, by adopting the child.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.5/4">Clause 41 ensures that any man who acts as a sperm donor will not be treated as the legal father of any child born. Clause 38 reaffirms the position that where a person is treated as a child's father under the 1990 Act, no other person is to be treated as the father; for example, a sperm donor.</p>

	<p pid="b.176.2/1">The current provisions in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill for the establishment of HM Commissioner for Offender Management and Prisons provide arrangements for easy access to the commissioner's service. For example, complaints can be made orally and commissioner reports can be issued orally; the commissioner has discretion to waive the conditions that determine the eligibility of a complaint; and the commissioner has discretion over the detailed arrangements for dealing with a complaint. In addition, we expect that the commissioner will produce and publish detailed guidance about his procedures for dealing with complaints, for use by his staff, complainants and the bodies against whom complaints can be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.2/2">There are currently no proposals in the provision for the establishment of HM Commissioner for Offender Management and Prisons in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill to extend the commissioner's remit to complaints from family members and third parties. The purpose of the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has always been to deal with grievances about the custodial or offender management experience by those subject to it, not complaints against the Prison and Probation Services generally. The current provisions preserve that focus.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.2/3">However, we are considering carefully whether to extend the commissioner's remit to complaints from family members and third parties, and we will base our decision on the outcome of any consultation on the proposal. There is provision in the Bill to extend the remit by order. We may conclude that we want to preserve the Prison and Probation Ombudsman's existing remit and that complaints by members of the public are best dealt with under current arrangements; that is to say, either by the service concerned or by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. Should we decide to extend the commissioner's remit to such complaints we will certainly ensure that the arrangements for accessing the commissioner's service will be equally clear, accessible and user-friendly to those complainants.</p>

	<p pid="b.179.2/1">The existing Code of Practice for Conditional Cautioning provides that restorative justice (RJ) processes may be used to help determine the conditions to be attached to a conditional caution. It also provides that participation in an RJ process may be a condition of the caution itself; where the requirement is positive participation in the process, any actions arising out of the RJ process will form a voluntary agreement between the offender and the victim or victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.179.2/2">Earlier this year we consulted on a revised draft Code of Practice for Conditional Cautions. That draft made the same provisions in respect of RJ.

	<p pid="b.180.2/1">The average strength of wine is based on the data from excise duty returns on hectolitres of wine cleared within categories based on duty rates. The strength related duty bandings are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.180.2/2">for still wine of fresh grape&mdash;above 1.2 per cent but not exceeding 4 per cent, above 4 per cent but not exceeding 5.5 per cent, above 5.5 per cent but not exceeding 15 per cent, above 15 per cent but not exceeding 22 per cent;for sparkling wine and made wine&mdash;above 1.2 per cent but not exceeding 4 per cent, above 4 per cent but not exceeding 5.5 per cent, above 5.5 per cent but not exceeding 8.5 per cent and above 8.5 per cent but not exceeding 15 per cent; and for still made wine&mdash;above 1.2 per cent but not exceeding 4 per cent, above 4 per cent but not exceeding 5.5 per cent, above 5.5 per cent but not exceeding 15 per cent and above 15 per cent but not exceeding 22 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.2/3">The overall estimated wine strength is based on an estimated strength for each of these categories weighted by the number of hectolitres cleared for each category. The bulk of wine cleared for consumption falls into the first category.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.2/4">The wine and made wine duty category does not solely include &quot;table wines&quot; but also the lower duty rated fermented alcohol-based ready to drinks (&quot;coolers&quot;). The weighted average strength for wine thus provides a more accurate reflection of alcohol released for consumption across a range of alcoholic products. This category also includes fortified wines up to and including those with ABV 22 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.2/5">The average strength for total beer is also a weighted average strength taking into account the origin of the beer. Unlike the wine category beer duty is calculated on alcoholic strength from 1.2 per cent in 0.1 increments. The bulk of the beer released for consumption in the UK is produced in UK registered premises. Precise data are available from traders' returns to produce an average strength for this beer. The strength of the residual beer released from bonded warehouses and imports is an estimated average strength of alcohol based on the national statistics retail prices index basket of goods.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.2/6">The average strength of cider is based on the data from excise duty returns on hectolitres of cider cleared within categories based on duty rates. The categories are: still cider 1.2 per cent to 7.5 per cent; still cider over 7.5 per cent but less than 8.5 per cent; and sparkling cider 1.2 per cent to 5.5 per cent over 5.5 per cent but less than 8.5 per cent. The overall estimated cider strength is based on an estimated strength for each of these categories weighted by the number of hectolitres cleared for each category. The bulk of cider cleared for consumption falls into the first category.</p>

	<p pid="b.183.3/1">The proposals in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill will amend the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 so as to exclude from the Parliamentary Ombudsman's remit any matter that falls within the complaints or deaths remit of the proposed HM Commissioner for Offender Management and Prisons. That will ensure that there is no question of both statutory ombudsmen investigating the same complaint or death.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.3/2">In practice, we consider that the amendment to the 1967 Act will make little difference to the handling of prisoners' complaints; the large majority of which are currently made to, and resolved by, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. Prisoners, those supervised by the Probation Service and immigration detainees will continue, as now, to be able to complain to an ombudsman who specialises in their concerns. The important difference created by the Bill is that that the Commissioner for Offender Management and Prisons will be legally independent of the department and equipped with statutory powers of investigation equivalent to those of the Parliamentary Ombudsman.</p>
