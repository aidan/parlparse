	<p pid="a.71.2/1">The development of the midland new site airport is one of many options being considered by the Department for Transport in its examination of the United Kingdom's future requirement for air transport, The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom. No decision has yet been taken on whether to build a new airport at a site between Coventry and Rugby, and the study is currently in the consultation phase. It is too early to predict what the impact of such a development on RAF operations might be. The Ministry of Defence will continue to work closely with the DfT throughout the development of the strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-10">10 December 2001</phrase> the US Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced the preliminary findings of a US Government-sponsored study of the prevalence among US Gulf veterans of motor neurone disease (MND), known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the US. The VA and US Department of Defense both released some information about the study and its implications via news releases available on the Internet at <a href="http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/docs/dsals.doc">www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/docs/dsals.doc</a> and <a href="http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/latest-news.html">www.gulflink.osd.mil/latest-news.html</a>. The Ministry of Defence has received no further information and awaits publication of the detailed research. The MoD cannot take a view on whether there is a link between MND and service in the Gulf until the research has been published.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/2">It has always been the case in the United Kingdom that because the cause of MND is not known, if it is diagnosed and claimed within seven years of leaving the Armed Forces a war disablement pension, and associated benefits, may be paid. In addition, UK Gulf veterans may qualify for benefits under the Armed Forces Pensions Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">We have been looking at how to optimise the Royal Artillery to meet the demands of the new security environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/2">The Army currently has two combined regular multiple launch rocket system (MLRS)/unmanned air vehicle (UAV) (Phoenix) regiments: 32 Regiment Royal Artillery based at Larkhill, Wiltshire and 39 Regiment Royal Artillery at Harlow Hill near Newcastle. Each of these regiments has two batteries of nine MLRS launchers and one battery of three troops of UAVs (Phoenix).</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/3">As a result of past successful deployments, the capability of Phoenix has become more widely recognised and valued within the military command structure. It has, therefore, been decided that a revised structure would provide a better focus for UAVs. In line with the direction set in the new chapter to the Strategic Defence Review this new structure will establish UAVs as a valuable asset for surveillance and intelligence gathering in addition to being Royal Artillery target acquisition assets to support the indirect fire system. The impact on the Royal Artillery will be the separation of these capabilities and the creation of discrete regiments: UAV (Phoenix) at Larkhill and MLRS at Harlow Hill. The reorganisation will require inter-regimental moves of complete sub-units but will not have any significant impact on the overall numbers of personnel at each site.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/4">The field standard B2 variant of the Rapier missile system has reached the end of its useful life and will be withdrawn from service by <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>. The system is currently operated by 22 Regiment Royal Artillery, based at Kirton-in-Lindsey, Lincolnshire. Following the withdrawal of the Rapier FSB2 equipment, 22 Regiment will undertake a tour in Cyprus in the infantry role during the second half of 2003 before it is disbanded in March 2004. Personnel from the regiment will be redeployed to other Royal Artillery units to support the introduction of planned new &quot;network-centric&quot; capabilities as described in the new chapter, including the Watchkeeper UAV.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/5">Our future Rapier air defence capability will be based on the more advanced field standard C model operated by 16 Regiment Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force Regiment. The capability of 16 Regiment will be enhanced by the creation of a fourth battery. In addition, we plan to move 16 Regiment from Woolwich to Kirton-in-Lindsey in late 2004. It will then be close to both the Air Warfare Centre at RAF Waddington and the Joint Rapier Training Unit at Honington, bringing a number of practical benefits.</p>

The extension comes in recognition of the valuable work undertaken by the ISAF in helping to provide a secure environment in Kabul, allowing the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan, headed by President Karzai, to pursue the difficult task of rebuilding the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/2">The new resolution reaffirms the remit of the ISAF as covering Kabul and its immediate environs. The resolution recognises that security within Afghanistan is primarily a matter for the Afghans themselves and commends their efforts to establish representative, professional and multi-ethnic security forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/3">Germany and the Netherlands have offered to assume jointly the role of ISAF lead nation upon the completion of Turkey's tenure in command. The United Kingdom anticipates remaining a significant contributor to the ISAF.

	<p pid="a.73.5/1">Smallpox is a deadly and highly contagious disease that could be used as a biological weapon. Currently we do not assess that there is any immediate threat to our Armed Forces from smallpox. But the consequences of any release of smallpox could be very serious, so we continue to monitor the threat closely, and take precautions.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/2">We continually review the package of defensive measures against chemical and biological attack available to our Armed Forces, which includes vaccination. We have decided to offer vaccination against smallpox to a small number of specialist military personnel who face a greater risk of exposure to smallpox by virtue of their specialisation. This will include those NBC specialists and specialist medical personnel who would form the spearhead of our defensive reponse, including vaccination teams, in the event of a confirmed, suspected or threatened release of smallpox. The Department of Health, with which we are working closely, is planning to vaccinate a similar cohort of healthcare professionals.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.2/1">The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys research published in 1989 estimated that overall there were 360,000 children under the age of 16 in Great Britain who had one or more disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/2">Of these, the survey estimated that 91.2 per cent of these children lived with their parents, 0.6 per cent with other relatives, 2.4 per cent in foster homes and 4.4 per cent attending boarding schools either as termly or weekly boarders, while 1.5 per cent lived in communal establishments. (NB. Does not add to 100 per cent owing to rounding.)</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/1">A wide range of family support services is provided by the local authorities and the health service. Services include advice, guidance and counselling; short-term breaks; day care; home help; domiciliary care; nursing and medical support; social events and outings for parents and children; child care and family centres. The Government, through various programmes, including implementation of the NHS Plan and Quality Protects, are working to tackle inequalities and reduce unacceptable variations in NHS and social services provision. We are also increasing funding specifically for families of disabled children. Through the Quality Protects programme we have earmarked funding of &pound;60 million over three years for services to disabled children. Next year this funding doubles from &pound;15 million to &pound;30 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/2">There is also a range of welfare benefits available to families to help with the additional costs of caring for disabled children, depending on their individual circumstances. These include disability living allowance and invalid care allowance. In addition, the Government fund the Family Fund Trust (FFT) which supports families of severely disabled children under 16 with grants for items such as holidays and leisure breaks, washing machines and tumble dryers, bedding and clothing. The FFT operates throughout the United Kingdom. The Government are funding the charity Contact a Family to run a free national telephone help and advice line for disabled children, parents and carers.</p>

The Royal National Institute of Deaf People is co-ordinating the project on our behalf and expects the majority of the sites to be prescribing digital aids by the end of January 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.2/1">Since the tragic events of September 11, the Department of Health has strengthened its plans against any deliberate release of biological agents, including smallpox.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/2">We have no evidence of a specific threat of a smallpox attack on the United Kingdom. However, it is sensible and prudent to ensure that the National Health Service can deal with any potential threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/3">There are three components to the department's preparation for response to a possible smallpox emergency: improved vaccine stocks, a plan of action and a cohort of immunised staff who could deal safely with any potential smallpox cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/4">We have already taken action substantially to increase our stocks of smallpox vaccine and we have recently begun a second procurement to add to these stocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/5">The Department of Health is today publishing an interim plan of action for discussion and comment over the coming month. Under this plan, it is intended to establish 12 regional smallpox response groups around the UK. They will consist of infectious disease physicians and paediatricians, public health physicians, microbiologists/virologists, acute care and communicable disease control nurses and occupational health staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/6">This core group of NHS staff will need to be immune to smallpox and therefore able to react quickly and work safely with patients with actual or suspected smallpox. Preparations for the vaccination of these key workers is now under way. I expect these vaccinations to be completed by the end of next month. It is intended to vaccinate around 350 healthcare staff across the UK. This will be on an entirely voluntary basis with informed consent. The Ministry of Defence, with which we are working closely, is planning to vaccinate a similar cohort of specialist military personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/7">The plan also explains how smallpox cases would be handled in various scenarios. The Department of Health's primary strategy would be to contain and ring vaccinate around any outbreak. The teams of vaccinated healthcare staff are central to delivering this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/8">These plans are a practical precaution designed to ensure the UK is prepared for any possible smallpox emergency. They are in line with World Health Organisation advice and will be kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/9">Similar interim plans are being prepared for publication by the devolved administrations.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-12-02a.85.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="85"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo021202/text/21202w04.htm#21202w04_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.85.2/1">We are pleased to be able to announce that on <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> negotiators representing the United Kingdom health departments, National Health Service employers and NHS trades unions successfully concluded negotiations on a new pay system for NHS staff (with the exception of those within the remit of the Doctors and Dentists Review Body and the most senior managers). It represents the most radical transformation of the NHS pay system since the foundation of the service in 1948. The proposed new system will now go out for consultation with organisations representing NHS staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">Over the three year period from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 the overall package will mean an average increase of 12.5 per cent. in basic pay for NHS staff. It will give a 10 per cent. pay increase over three years for all staff, plus an average 5.9 per cent. in the longer run linked to modernisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">The proposed new pay system will be based on a new system of job evaluation. This means that the basic pay that NHS staff receive will reflect the knowledge, responsibility, skills and effort required in their job, rather than their historic job title or occupational group. To progress fully in the new pay system, staff will need to demonstrate a level of applied skills and knowledge appropriate to their level of responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">The new system will also introduce clearer rewards for staff who work flexibly outside traditional working hours. It will give extra flexibilities for local NHS employers to create new types of jobs and to make extra payments to reflect recruitment and retention pressures. Instead of almost 650 different staff grades and thousands of different allowances, there will be a simple set of core terms and conditions based on eight pay bands, including simple, harmonised arrangements for working hours and annual leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5">The new system is designed to ensure fair pay for staff, based on the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, and a clearer system of career progression. It will also directly support modernisation of patient care. It will provide new opportunities for staff to take on new responsibilities, breaking down old-fashioned demarcations and enabling jobs to be redesigned around the needs of the patient. It will produce a more sensible division of labour, with nurses, therapists and healthcare assistants taking on new roles that improve NHS productivity and free up more of doctors' and other senior clinicians' time for direct patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/6">Clearer rewards for flexible working will help make NHS services more widely available to patients in the evenings and weekends. Improvements in pay, career and training prospects will help recruit an estimated 10,000 more nurses and other health professionals and an estimated 27,000 healthcare assistants by 2006&ndash;07 in England, particularly in high cost areas such as London. A clearer link between pay and development of knowledge and skills will help deliver higher and more consistent standards of NHS patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/7">If the new system is approved following consultation, implementation will start in 12 NHS sites in spring 2003, with full implementation starting in October 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.3/1">It is a matter for tourism trade organisations to decide on which issues they should advise their members. For instance, the British Hospitality Association (BHA) decided to advise its members in March 2001, following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, that business interruption policies do not usually cover losses incurred following an outbreak, unless the business's access is closed. If the tourism industry does not consider that suitable insurance cover exists for risks such as those arising from an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, then it can make representations to the insurance industry. As sponsors of the tourism and hospitality industry, my department will consider how it can work with the industry on this matter, if we are approached about it.</p>
