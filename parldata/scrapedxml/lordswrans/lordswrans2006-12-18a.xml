	<p pid="a.237.2/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) systematically collects information on rape, although due to the sensitivity of such questions in a face-to-face crime survey it is recognised that the subsequent results may be an unreliable indicator. For this reason, they are not routinely published.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/2">However, a number of BCS questionnaires have included a self-completion part on sexual victimisation designed to improve reliability and confidentiality. The BCS questionnaires on sexual victimisation also collect information about the relationship between offenders and victims. The latest published results are reported in Home Office Online Report 12/06 (Finney, 2006). According to the 2004-05 BCS most women and men who had been victims of serious sexual assaults had been assaulted by people who they know rather than strangers. Altogether 11 per cent of females and 17 per cent of male victims of serious sexual assaults had been assaulted by a stranger.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.2/3">A research study, commissioned by the Home Office (Home Office Research Study 293, Kelly, et al (2005)), also provides information on the victim's relationship to the offender. Analysis of incidents of rape which had been reported to a sexual assault referral centre (SARC) from 1987 to 2002 revealed that over half of the assaults were committed by a perpetrator who was known to the victim compared with about a quarter of assaults which were committed by strangers.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.6/2">The average award is lower within the statistics provided for the period November 2004 to March 2005 for two reasons. For staff at grade 6 and below, the data for this period only include in-year performance bonuses. Annual performance bonuses&mdash;which have a higher individual value&mdash;would have been paid prior to this date within the financial year. For the period April 2006 to November 2006, for staff at grade 6 and below, the number of staff receiving the annual performance bonus reduced from 25 per cent of staff to the top 10 per cent of performers. The amount of funds allocated for the annual bonus remained constant and individual bonus amounts therefore increased.</p>

This was not possible with the previous versions of the system. Secondly, the Commission has this year delivered an enhancement to TRACES called the Data Warehouse. This allows us to extract more detailed trade activity data from TRACES.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/3">The system of codes for recording the import of wild birds is now fully operational. The information provided in the Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase> highlighted there were discrepancies between the TRACES and CITES data and that officials were investigating the discrepancies. A ministerial colleague in the other place is writing to the Member in that place who asked the original Question, to provide him with recently published data on the bird trade. A copy of the letter will be placed in the Library of the other place. The recently published European Food Safety Authority report has the most reliable figures for 2005: 521,906 captive birds were imported to the EU, of which 61,450 were to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/4">The EFSA report does not have figures for 2004, but CITES figures are available and indicate that around 695,000 birds were imported into all member states with 18,897 birds imported into the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.5/1">The National Health Service data dictionary does not give a definition for a bay. Its smallest unit is a ward. However, there have been several statements that move towards a working description. The firstof these was in 1997, when the Department ofHealth issued guidance on eliminating mixed-sex accommodation. This stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.246.5/2" class="indent">&quot;at a point where a ward has been divided into separate areas to segregate the sexes, there should be screening which is adequate to ensure privacy is maintained, eg which will prevent patients being overheard and overseen by others where this is not desirable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.5/3">In 2002, NHS Estates issued <I>Enhancing Privacy and Dignity&mdash;Achieving Single Sex Accommodation</I>. This offered a number of design solutions using various arrangements of bays, single rooms and open areas, and demonstrated the wide range of acceptable solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.5/4">Also in 2002, in response to a Parliamentary Question, the following advice was given on how wards could be separated into bays:</p>
	<p pid="a.246.5/5" class="indent">&quot;Partitioning can be used to divide wards into bays as a means of achieving an acceptable method of protecting patients' privacy and dignity. To ensure that they provide adequate physical separation, sound reduction and visual privacy the partition must be permanent, rigid and fixed to the building structure. A mobile privacy screen alone is not an acceptable solution to enhancing privacy and dignity for the patient&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.3/1">We do not envisage any new functions for the delivery of mental health services by a local health board under Clause 36 of the Mental Health Bill, as this clause is intended to make it clear, for the purposes of the Mental Health Act 1983, who the managers are in respect of a local health board.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/2">The current definition of managers of hospitals, which is contained in Section 145 of the 1983 Act, does not include a reference to local health boards. Hospital managers have a variety of functions under the Act and the definition of managers identifies the body or people who are managers of each hospital, depending on who owns or runs it.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.6/1">Under the terms of the Channel Tunnel rail usage contract (RUC) and in line with the access charge provisions of the first European rail package, we have agreed that the British Railways Board (BRB) should continue to bear the UK freight allocation of Eurotunnel's operational expenses charges payable under the terms of the rail usage contract, as these represent overhead infrastructure costs not directly incurred as a result of operating the railway service.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.6/2">To enable BRB to do this, we have made changes to the UK arrangements whereby those rights and obligations of BRB previously delegated exclusively to English, Welsh and Scottish Railway (EWSI) are now delegated on a non-exclusive basis and apply to any international freight train operator.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.6/3">For the first year these charges will equate to approximately &pound;6.5 million.</p>

This is being achieved through a balance of normal outflow, intake reductions and targeted redundancy. As a planned consequence of the strategy and the pace of the redundancy programme, the trained strength is falling faster than the reduction in requirement, which is resulting in a period of increased manning deficit. One significant contributing factor is that most of the 1,200 applicants selected for redundancy under tranche 2 left the service on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April 2006</phrase>. Work is ongoing to reduce the requirement for manpower to minimise the deficit.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.2/2">The national governing bodies (NGBs) of English non-Olympic sports receive funding from Sport England through their whole sport plans and will use a proportion of this to identify and support talented athletes. In addition, the Government's school sport strategy provides access to a range of non-Olympic sports, and talent in particular is supported through the gifted and talented scheme. Since 2003, over&pound;6.5 million has been invested in this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/3">The talented athlete scholarship scheme (TASS) enables talented athletes to continue in their sport beyond the age of 16 while pursuing further or higher education. TASS 2012, a strand of the TASS programme, supports our most talented 12 to 18 year-olds in a variety of Olympic, Paralympic, non-Olympic and non-Paralympic sports. Between 2004 and 2008, the Government will have committed &pound; 17 million to TASS and TASS 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/4">Lastly, government funding extends to the advanced apprenticeship in sporting excellence programme, which is a structured national training and development route across all sports for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve excellence in their sport and perform at the highest level. Up to &pound;15 million is being invested into this two-year programme.</p>
