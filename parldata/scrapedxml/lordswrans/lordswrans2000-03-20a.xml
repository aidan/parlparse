	<p pid="a.2.8/1">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is audited annually by a team of independent auditors whose reports are made public and discussed by UNHCR's Executive Committee of which the UK is a member. UNHCR is required to take action on any areas of financial mismanagement identified by the auditors. The UK National Audit Office has been elected by the UN to audit UNHCR in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.8/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) places additional financial controls on its own funding for UNHCR, monitoring expenditure through regular financial and narrative reports and field visits by our experts. Any concerns we have about financial management are discussed at bilateral meetings with UNHCR and, if necessary, at the Executive and Standing Committees of UNHCR. DfID has made it clear that UK funding for UNHCR is conditional on increased transparency and accountability in the organisation. We therefore welcome UNHCR's adoption of a unified budget and its closer dialogue with donors on financial and policy issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/1">Humanitarian emergencies, whether caused by conflict or natural and man-made disasters, cause great suffering and loss of life and can destroy development advances and set back the prospects of progress for years to come. Providing assistance during times of instability and then assisting people to re-establish their lives is an essential humanitarian need and is a precondition for achieving the International Development Targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/2">Inter-departmental arrangements are already in place for rapid and effective responses to overseas disasters. These are co-ordinated by the Department for International Development, which has established call-down arrangements with other government departments. These include the Home Office, with which we have an arrangement for the deployment of UK Fire Service Search and Rescue Teams and the Ministry of Defence, from which we are able to request, where appropriate, the deployment and utilisation of military assets. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and our diplomatic posts overseas provide useful early information in case of sudden disasters.</p>

They were asked to leave because they were not prepared to sign an agreement put forward by the SPLA which they see as compromising the principles of neutrality and impartiality that underpin the accepted international rules governing humanitarian operations. The expulsion of the humanitarian staff concerned will cause a significant reduction in the provision of assistance to the people living in areas controlled by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). We have made our concerns very clear to the SPLA. We have urged the United Nations to play a leadership role in finding a solution.

Medicines licensed for the treatment of depression have been shown to be safe and effective and have met standards to ensure reproducible quality. It is not advisable for patients to stop their prescribed medication without seeing their doctor. There have been no successful licence applications for St John's Wort in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/2">Along with a number of other European Union member states, the United Kingdom licensing authority has issued advice in the light of new evidence on interactions between prescribed medicines and St John's Wort.

Further steps are being taken to address problems of access. Personal dental services pilots allow for flexible and innovative approaches to the provision of dental services. There are currently 38 pilots in operation. The Investing in Dentistry initiative is still bearing fruit.
