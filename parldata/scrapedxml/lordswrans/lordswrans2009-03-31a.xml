	<p pid="a.221.3/1">The principle of free trade is at the heart of the single market and the European Union. An open and competitive single market will be key to economic recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/2">The Prime Minister, in a letter to European leaders ahead of the informal European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-01">1 March</phrase>, called on all countries to renounce protectionism, both within and outside the European Union. At that meeting, leaders stressed that protectionism is no answer to the current crisis and expressed confidence in the Commission's role to make sure that the treaty is respected. The Government will continue to press for a strong commitment to resisting protectionism at both the upcoming spring European Council and London summit. It is hoped that leaders will renew their commitment to a successful and speedy conclusion of the Doha round. This could generate over $100 billion of additional economic growth and would provide an effective means of preventing a retreat into protectionism.</p>

These figures are based on the Department for Work and Pensions' Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series which is produced using the Family Resources Survey. It is not possible to present results from the HBAI series below the level of Government Office Regions. While HBAI more commonly presents median incomes, mean incomes are also shown here in order to be more comparable with the mean incomes shown for the 10 districts of Greater Manchester.</p>

These are based on experimental small area statistics published by the ONS. Figures for other years are unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/6">It should be borne in mind that the Government Office Region statistics and the small area statistics are based on different methodologies. It is not possible to separate out methodological differences from real differences. Small differences or changes over time should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.2/1">To meet all current defence language skill requirements Armed Forces personnel receive training in about 40 different languages each year. At present, Arabic, Farsi/Dari and Pashto are regarded as operationally critical languages.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/2">To meet general military operational requirements, provision is made for about 400 personnel to receive lower skill level operational language training each year and there is provision for 72 personnel to start training each year on longer courses for higher skill level requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/3">All language skill requirements must be balanced with other security and operational requirements. A coherent mix of military and contracted civilian personnel is used proactively to satisfy dynamic requirements, thereby minimising the impact of emerging skill shortages.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/4">The intelligence services' language requirements are many and diverse: generally these parallel military requirements. It would not be appropriate, however, to list languages of particular interest to the intelligence services. Their capacity in languages is built through both internal training and recruitment.</p>
