	<p pid="a.14.0/1">It is estimated that some 30 kilograms of mercury are used each year in the manufacture of new barometers in the UK. As a typical barometer contains 100 to 600 grams of mercury, this equates to the production of 50 to 300 new instruments annually. No further breakdown of these figures is available.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.2/1">I am pleased to confirm that the EC regulation on roaming came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-30">30 June</phrase>, triggering a process that will see the offering of roaming packages complying with the regulation by the start of August. The regulation, while introducing average wholesale price caps that must be met by operators when they procure roaming capacity from one another, does not fix prices as such; instead, it introduces a tariff that has to be offered to all roaming customers (the Euro tariff) with maximum rates for incoming and outgoing calls made.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/2">Throughout the discussions and negotiation pertaining to this regulation, the Government have sought legal advice on all matters to the extent thought necessary and appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/3">As regards subsidiarity, the national authorities responsible for regulating the telecommunications markets have found themselves unable to effect a reduction in roaming charges. This has resulted from the cross-border nature of the telecoms market in general and, in particular, the necessarily international interconnections between networks, which enable the making of roaming calls. It was also necessary to ensure that a common, Community-wide approach was adopted, so that operators could operate in a single coherent regulatory framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/4">In these circumstances, it was considered appropriate for the EU to intervene and to act in order to procure the desired benefits. The Government are therefore satisfied that the principle of subsidiarity has been adhered to.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/5">Finally, the Government take the view that the EC regulation on mobile roaming is compatible with its WTO obligations, having sought clarification on this matter when it was raised during discussions in the European Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.8/1">Encouraging travellers to choose rail instead of other modes will, in general terms, help to reduce carbon emissions. This underlies Department for Transport objectives in specifying franchised rail services. The department seeks to ensure that the specification issued to bidders will deliver an efficient service that meets passengers' needs while being affordable for the taxpayer. In order to win the contract, bidders must demonstrate their ability to deliver the service reliably, at a price that is value for money. A successful bidder will need to take every advantage of opportunities to increase passenger usage and promote rail. We also ask bidders to put forward their plans for improving the environmental performance of the business, which are taken into account when the bid is awarded.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">Though special schools are not legally required to follow the national curriculum (NC), those pupils who are able to do so are entered for tests and public examinations. In the interests of recognising that many pupils with special needs are capable of high achievement, the results of special schools are included in the tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">Independent schools also are not legally obliged to follow the NC and are not included in the key stage 2 and key stage 3 tables. However, the vast majority of pupils in the independent sector are entered for public examinations and are included in the key stage 4 (GCSE) tables and post-16 (A-level) tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/3">Pupil referral units (PRUs) are different because their purpose is not to provide a permanent place of education. The purpose of PRUs is to provide a placement for pupils temporarily displaced from mainstream schools. The majority of pupils spend less than two terms in a PRU and many never sit an exam. Any test and exam results that were published would not give a reliable picture of educational standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/4">We believe that good PRUs should be recognised and encouraged, but we do not believe that publishing their results in the achievement and attainment tables would achieve that. They are inspected by Ofsted and, where a PRU is achieving well, this will be detailed in the school's inspection report. PRUs that are judged by Ofsted to be &quot;outstanding&quot; appear alongside other high-performing schools on Ofsted's annual outstanding provider list.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/5">With the plans to include PRUs in pupil level data collection, we anticipate including their results in the LA averages once we know that the data are reliable.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/2">The report of an inspection by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the Commission of the Heathrow inspection centre in June 2004 stated that the British Airways (BA) inspection centre had a number of deficiencies.
