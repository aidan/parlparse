However, only 5 million receive it. Ensuring that abortion services are safe, and that post-abortion care is provided, saves maternal lives. Both DfID and Marie Stopes International are working to increase access to family planning, which will avert many thousands of unintended pregnancies and abortions every year.</p>

	<p pid="a.257.8/2">An example of DfID support for maternal health is in India, where over 60,000 women die every year due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth. DfID provides support to the health programmes of three poor states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa) to improve the quality of services for maternal and newborn healthcare to reduce this unnecessary and tragic burden. Part of this support may be used to upgrade centres for emergency obstetric care, including provision of ultrasonography, which is an essential medical technology to diagnose problems in pregnancy and protect the life of both mother and baby.</p>

For example, our partner state of Madhya Pradesh is implementing enhanced monitoring of all use of ultrasound to ensure that it is not used for this purpose.</p>

Similarly, as the A400M design and production phase contract is a fixed price contract, these engine problems should not have any effect on the cost of the UK's A400M order.</p>

A programme of raising public awareness and reformulation of food products by the food industry has reduced average adult intakes from 9.5 grams (2001) to 8.6 grams (2008). A further survey to assess more recent progress is planned for the end of this year.</p>

The results demonstrated that the models could provide valuable input to the Defra Phytophthora Disease Management Programme for optimal use of resources on the ground. Therefore additional funds of up to approximately &#163;220,000 per year and an extension of three years were made to the original project through an agreed variation.

The positive experience of those countries has inspired manufacturers, independent of the Intercity Express Programme, to develop bi-mode locomotives and to look to convert existing diesel trains to bi-modes for the UK market.</p>

Throughout the year, including since the beginning of the Arab Spring, the UK has maintained an open, frank and sustained dialogue with Saudi Arabia on human rights. The UK has encouraged progress in four priority areas: women's rights, the death penalty, rights of foreign workers and judicial reform. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary recently raised our concerns during his visit to Saudi Arabia. Our ambassador discussed these concerns at length with the president of the Saudi Human Rights Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-03">3 July</phrase>. We will continue to raise them at every appropriate opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.5/3">We work to achieve our objectives on the death penalty through three main channels: bilateral initiatives, the EU and the UN. Bilaterally, we continue to work hard to lobby Governments to establish moratoriums or abolish the death penalty, we raise individual cases of British Nationals and we use political dialogue and fund projects to further our objectives. We also continue to raise cases of third-country nationals through the EU, and work with the EU to lobby states and pursue common action in international forums such as the UN.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.2/1">The warrant is already of a similar standard and contains similar information to the writ of fieri facias and has recently been revised on the basis of stakeholder feedback. Any divergence is intentional to reflect the differences in the process when executing road traffic debts. The Ministry of Justice is committed to continuous improvement and welcomes any feedback or representation for change from stakeholders and other interested parties on this or other related issues.</p>
