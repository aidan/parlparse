	<p pid="a.245.3/22">Britain's food aid is provided through non-governmental organisations (international NGOs) and the WFP. The length of time between purchase and delivery of food aid depends considerably on where the food is sourced (much is purchased locally and some comes from the in-country food security reserve) and the accessibility of those in need.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.3/23">We do not maintain records of all the UK-based NGOs active in Ethiopia. Details of the emergency interventions we have funded in Ethiopia between June 1999 and April 2000 are outlined in the DFID background briefing on Ethiopia, April 2000, a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House. In addition, we are also providing &pound;1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to cover food and transport costs and some &pound;1.3 million to Farm Africa for work in Konso.</p>
