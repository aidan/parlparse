	<p pid="a.127.2/2">Both NEPAD and the G8 Africa Action Plan emphasise the wish of Africa's leaders to address the long-term development needs of the continent. Peace and security are key elements of this. We are supporting the ECOWAS peace-monitoring force, which has already begun to deploy in Cote d'Ivoire. The UK is providing &pound;2 million to assist the Ghanaian contingent. We welcome the political support which the UN Security Council has provided for the peace process. Its continued engagement will be important if this is to succeed.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.6/1">The recommended vaccine for routine immunisation of children against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis remains diphtheria, tetanus and wholecell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine. A course of primary immunisation with DTwP vaccine consists of three doses starting at two months, with an interval of one month between each dose. Each dose of the standard DTwP vaccine contains 50 micrograms of thimerosal (containing 25 micrograms of ethylmercury). Therefore, by 16 weeks the total thimerosal exposure would be no more than 150 micrograms (75 micrograms ethylmercury).</p>

	<p pid="a.135.2/1">Ofsted's 2001 report on specialist schools said that the overall profile of teaching was broadly in line with the national picture. This was based on visits to 46 specialist schools. However, the latest Ofsted evidence submitted to the Education and Skills Select Committee looked at the evidence of all secondary schools inspected during school year 2001&ndash;02. For the 74 specialist schools inspected, the proportion of teaching judged to be very good or better was 26 per cent compared with 8 per cent for non-specialist schools. The proportion of teaching judged to be good or better was 81 per cent in specialist schools compared with 74 per cent of non-specialist schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/2">The latest Ofsted figures suggest that significant progress is being made in specialist schools. This gives confidence that the key disciplines of the specialist schools programme (audit, objectives, target-setting and monitoring) will continue to help drive up standards, and the department will continue to monitor their progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.8/1">The Government have proposed that teachers should have guaranteed time for planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) equivalent to at least 10 per cent of their timetabled teaching time. Schools will manage this contractual change, which takes effect from September 2005, in a variety of ways. These are likely to include the transfer of managerial and administrative and non-teaching contact tasks to support staff, releasing teachers for PPA; protecting existing non-contact time from cover through the use of ICT learn centres and cover supervisors; and adjusting timetables and redeploying existing staff. Guidance will be made available to schools on ways of releasing time for guaranteed PPA. The cost of creating guaranteed PPA time will depend on how each school provides it. But it will be well within the estimated total cost of workforce reform in 2005&ndash;06 of &pound;1 billion.</p>

They will consider tourism in the context of their corporate plans, regional economic strategies and the targets by which they are monitored. We see the regional tourist boards (RTBs) as their natural delivery partners. RDAs will distribute DCMS tourism funds to the RTBs for activities in line with regional sustainable tourism strategies and the national policy framework. For a transitional period of three years, they will thus fund tourism strategy delivery with at least the sums currently received via the English Tourism Council. In line with regional priorities, some RDAs have already confirmed additional funding for tourism.</p>

This will include consideration of the need to designate particular posts as sensitive and the criteria that should be applied. At present all administrative posts in the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) are subject to a counter-terrorist check which is carried out on recruitment to the NICS. Under current national security vetting policy only individuals whose duties require long-term, frequent and uncontrolled access to Secret or Top Secret information or assets are regarded as requiring a security check or developed vetting. Very few posts within the NICS would involve such access.
