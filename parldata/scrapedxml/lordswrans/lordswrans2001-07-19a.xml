<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-07-19a.136.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="136"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo010719/text/10719w01.htm#10719w01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.136.2/1">We have looked urgently at revoking remaining blanket closures of rights of way imposed by local authorities in England. Letters were sent to local authorities explaining the Government's proposals in more detail and inviting them to make representations if they considered they could justify retaining blanket closures beyond <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-20">20 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/2">We have now considered carefully the representations received. We have agreed that blanket closures may remain in place for the time being in Cumbria and in parts of Devon, Lancashire, Durham, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. We have also allowed Somerset to retain partial blanket closure until <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-27">27 July</phrase>, and agreed with North Yorkshire their proposals for temporarily retaining closures in parts of the county. In granting these exemptions we have recognised the logistical difficulties which revocation would pose for a few authorities, particularly those hardest hit by foot and mouth disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/3">With the exception of the authorities mentioned above, all remaining closures under Article 35B will be lifted from midnight on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-20">Friday, 20 July</phrase>. At midnight the following <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-27">Friday, 27 July</phrase>, any remaining closures under Article 35A (which allowed authorities to close individual paths outside Infected Areas without ministerial consent) will be revoked.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/4">These actions will ensure that public rights of way are closed only where this is justified. The department's guidance and veterinary risk assessment issued on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-23">23 May</phrase> makes clear that, except within 3 km Protection Zones around infected premises, paths may safely be reopened. We expect authorities to continue to reopen paths where this can be done safely, in line with the guidance. We shall review the position no later than early September.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/5">Lifting blanket closures does not mean that all paths will be open. Local authorities retain power to close individual paths, though outside Infected Areas this requires the department's consent. All such closures must be signed at entrances to the path. Authorities should use their power to close paths selectively, in the areas affected by revocation and elsewhere, only where justified on disease control grounds, in line with the department's guidance. Where paths within Protection Zones are affected by the lifting of a blanket closure, authorities should arrange for their selective re-closure where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/6">People using paths should take sensible precautions to reduce even further any risk of spreading the disease. These are set out in the codes for path users accompanying the guidance to local authorities of <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-23">23 May</phrase>. Authorities should publicise these precautions, particularly the need to stay off farmland if people have recently handled farm animals and to avoid going near, touching or feeding livestock.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/7">The Government's decision to open footpaths to walkers is entirely consistent with our strong advice to farmers to observe tight bio-security and reflects very different risks. The risks of footpath users transmitting the disease are tiny, particularly when compared with those posed by farmers and others who handle livestock.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/8">Foot and mouth disease remains a serious problem in a few areas and we continue to do all that is necessary to contain and eradicate it. But in most of England there is no case for wholesale closures. Keeping footpaths closed hurts the rural economy and prevents people enjoying the countryside. We have received strong representations in favour of our approach from those engaged in tourism and other rural businesses--including farmers who have diversified their activities--because of the extent to which their income has been devastated by the consequences of the outbreak. Revoking unnecessary closures now means the vast majority of our countryside will be open for the summer holidays and people will know where they can walk, cycle or ride.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.6/1">I am today able to announce the outcome of the first stage of the quinquennial review of the six grant-awarding Research Councils. I shall be placing a copy of the stage 1 report in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/2">Quinquennial reviews of Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) are a key part of our programme to modernise government. The Government are committed to achieving better public services that are of higher quality and are more responsive to the needs of the people who use them. Regular NDPB reviews are an important element in ensuring that we have in place the right structures to deliver the Government's agenda effectively and to provide a strong focus on improving future performance. Under Cabinet Office guidance (<phrase class="date" code="2000-01-31">31 January 2000</phrase>), such reviews should be conducted in two stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/3">The terms of reference for this review set the following objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/4" class="indent">the first stage would examine the role and organisation of the Research Councils, by reference to their charters and missions, and evidence of past practice. It would set the detailed terms of reference for the second stage;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/5" class="indent">the second stage would examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the councils' operations and look for further opportunities for improving performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/6">The principal recommendation of stage 1 is that the Research Councils should continue to be executive NDPBs. The review concluded that:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/7" class="indent">the councils are a necessary mechanism for the delivery of government policy for scientific research and postgraduate training;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/8" class="indent">the councils, individually and collectively, are an important source of independent scientific advice to government;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/9" class="indent">the councils' existing individual missions provide an effective focus for their communities;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/10" class="indent">none of the alternative organisational models would offer equivalent benefits to the UK science and engineering base at the present time;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/11" class="indent">the councils have made considerable progress in adopting new ways of working to generate efficiency savings, demonstrate value for money and maximise spending on science;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/12" class="indent">NDPB status remains the most appropriate organisational model for maintaining the Haldane principle, ensuring effective accountability for public funds and engaging the scientific communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/13">Stage 2 of the Review will now examine four broad themes which were identified following the extensive stage 1 consultation. These are: mission, structure and governance; relations between the Research Councils and their clients; priority-setting and decision-making; the councils' management and internal processes. Working groups, whose members will include a wide range of stakeholders, will be considering these areas, and there has also been a second written consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.6/14">I welcome these recommendations, and I am grateful to the members of the steering group for their work on this review.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.3/1">The International Organisation for Migration, with Refugee Action as an implementing partner, successfully bid for funding of three separate projects under this measure. All three projects are co-funded by the Home Office. They are: Voluntary Assisted Return Programme 2000: The project is open to any persons, subject to the European Refugee Fund criteria, who wish to return to their country of origin but do not have the means to do so. The programme aims, within a 12-month period, to organise a dignified and orderly return service to facilitate the return of 1,200 persons to their home destination. Information and assistance is made available, in the home country, to all returning persons. This project commenced in September 2000 and is therefore funded retrospectively. Somalia Project: This project aims to facilitate the sustainable return and reintegration of 100 Somali nationals currently living in the United Kingdom who have applied for asylum and now wish to go back to Somalia. The project will be concentrating on the regions of Somalia--predominantly Somaliland and Punt Land--where there is peace and conditions are conducive for the safe and orderly return and reintegration of Somali nationals. Voluntary Assisted Return Programme (VARP) 2001: This project, which will begin in September 2001, aims to continue the work already established by the earlier project (VARP 2000). The target is a further 1,200 voluntary returns. The same criteria will apply and it is intended that any identified improvements following evaluation of the VARP 2000 project will be incorporated into the programme.</p>

He confirmed that people appealing against immigration decisions made before <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-02">2 October 2000</phrase> cannot benefit from this appeal right which is not restrospective. But they could make a separate human rights claim and would have the opportunity to appeal except in those instances where the human rights issue had already been considered by the appellate authority or the courts, or there had been findings of fact at an earlier appeal which mean the human rights claim is bound to fail.</p>

The system will also implement a tactical internet and provide automatic position location, navigation and reporting.</p>

It is based on the development of a proven system, and includes best of class radios and a very efficient approach to fielding and support. Its bid is the clear winner of the competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4">The Ministry of Defence and CDC will now work together on the programme to bring Bowman into service. We aim to be in a position to let the contract in late summer this year, in support of an In Service Date in early 2004. The contract is valued at around &pound;1.8 billion. It will cover both the supply of the Bowman system and the first five years of support up to the year 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/5">CDC's solution will provide employment opportunities in the UK in a broad range of system areas, including design, development, manufacture and project management. Ninety per cent of the work content of the CDC bid will be UK based--the highest proportion of any of the three bids. Around 1,600 jobs will be secured across the UK, including 400 new high technology and support posts at the company's headquarters, which CDC plan to establish in South Wales. The company has also earmarked South Wales for a new Army Communications Technology research and development centre, which will be staffed by around 65 leading scientists. Other regions will benefit too. We expect sub-contract work to secure over 100 jobs in Scotland, over 300 jobs in South West England, and around 75 jobs in the South East centred on Hastings. Major UK sub-contractors include Alvis and GKN-Westlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/6">This month will also see the first deliveries, ahead of schedule, of the Personal Role Radios, a new capability which was separated from the main Bowman requirement in 1999 in order to ensure early delivery to the front line. These radios will provide short range communications for dismounted infantry, and will transform their operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/1">Peer reviewed scientific data comparing the mortality of UK Gulf veterans with an era group of service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf were published for the first time in the Lancet on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-01">1 July 2000</phrase>. Updates to these figures were provided by the Ministry of Defence to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-20">20 July 2000</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-22">22 January 2001</phrase>. The MoD had undertaken to continue to monitor the mortality of both Gulf veterans and the era group and will publish updated figures on a regular basis. The figures as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase> are shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/2">Overall, in the period <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-01">1 April 1991</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase> the mortality of UK Gulf veterans was no different than that of the control group. The number of Gulf veterans dying from disease related causes is rather fewer than for the control group, whereas the number of Gulf veterans dying of external causes is rather higher than for the control group. The MoD will conduct a more detailed analysis of accidental deaths, to establish where there are any underlying trends that might help to explain this.</p>
