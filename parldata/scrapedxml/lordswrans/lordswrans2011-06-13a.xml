Benefits to consumers include real-time information on their energy consumption to help them control energy use, save money and reduce emissions.

The costs and benefits of a range of different features have been considered and analysed, supported by extensive consultation with industry, consumer groups and other stakeholders. The functional requirements have been developed to ensure the benefits of the programme are delivered. These benefits include removing the need for on-site meter readings by the supplier or consumer, and more accurate billing.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.5/1">The Health and Social Care Bill, as currently drafted, sets out that all providers will be required to apply for a licence from Monitor, the health regulator, who will undertake due diligence and will require that the provider maintains sufficient resources to deliver against its contractual commitments on an ongoing basis. Our policy proposals are subject to outcome of the listening exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.5/2">In addition, it would be for commissioners to determine the appropriate due diligence that they must undertake to be assured that any provider responding to a contract will be able to deliver the quality and outcomes required, for the full duration of the contract term.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.0/1">The Government are committed to reducing carbon and other emissions from all sectors including road transport. As part of our overall strategy, we are supporting a number of measures to promote the increased use of low-carbon vehicles including electric cars. Details can be found on the website of the Office for Low Emission Vehicles at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/olev/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/olev/</a>. The main measures are:</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/2">since <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase> motorists purchasing a qualifying ultra-low emission car are eligible to receive a grant of 25 per cent towards the cost of the vehicle, up to a maximum of &#163;5,000 under the plug-in car grant (PICG) scheme. As of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>, 465 cars had been ordered through the PICG;we are also committed to mandating a national recharging network for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, and will be publishing an electric vehicle infrastructure strategy this summer. The plugged-in places (PIP) programme provides match-funding to local consortia of businesses and public sector partners to encourage installation of the recharging infrastructure needed to support use of electric vehicles. This will give investors and consumers confidence in the provision of charging facilities in the UK and remove an important barrier to the wider uptake of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Learning from the programme will feed into the infrastructure strategy; the Government are also funding a programme of research and development work to support the ongoing progression of this new generation of vehicles; and the department has paid &#163;46.8 million to local authorities and bus operators to assist them in purchasing 526 hybrid-electric and 16 all-electric buses.
