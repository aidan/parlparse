	<p pid="a.105.0/1">The study referred to is based on research carried out in three care homes in Scotland, which has its own system of social care regulation. The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 set up the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care, which registers and inspects the services listed in the Act, taking account of the national care standards published by Scottish Ministers, to whom the commission is responsible. Action in response to the study is a matter for the Scottish Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/2">In England, the regulation of social care services is the responsibility of the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI), which was established under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 as a single inspectorate to bring together all strands of inspection, monitoring and the regulation of social care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/3">CSCI inspects and regulates social care providers, including care and nursing homes, according to regulations and policy guidance set by government, and taking account of national minimum standards (NMS). CSCI is entitled to inspect any care home at any time. It has a wide range of enforcement powers and will take action to protect the welfare of residents, with the aim of raising the quality of care and level of protection for vulnerable people and ensuring that service users and their families can be confident that their welfare and interests are safeguarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/4">The regulations and NMS, copies of which are available in the Library, include requirements that care homes should be staffed at all times of the day or night by adequate numbers of suitably trained staff. In the case of care homes providing nursing, this must include qualified nurses.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/5">A comprehensive assessment of care needs should be carried out and an individual care plan drawn up for every resident, together with a plan of care for daily living. All specialised services offered, including services for people with dementia or other cognitive impairments, sensory impairment, physical disabilities, learning disabilities, intermediate or respite care, should be demonstrably based on current good practice, and reflect relevant specialist and clinical guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/6">The environment in homes must be safe, comfortable, clean and hygienic. Residents' accommodation must meet their needs and they must be provided with the specialist equipment they require to maximise their independence.</p>

The Secretary of State's policy on the use of Section 106 is set out in Circular 5/2005 <I>Planning Obligations</I>.

	<p pid="a.107.3/1">The Criminal Justice (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 created the offences of &quot;aggravated vehicle taking&quot; and &quot;aggravated vehicle taking causing death or grievous bodily injury&quot; to deal specifically with the problem of what is often erroneously referred to as &quot;joy-riding&quot;. The maximum penalty for the latter offence is 14 years imprisonment. Section 285 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, also increased the penalties available to the courts in Northern Ireland for offences of causing death or grievous bodily injury by dangerous driving&mdash;again to a maximum of 14 years' imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.6/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that all parts of the country, rural as well as urban, benefit from economic development and increased prosperity. While there has been no specific assessment of the impact of inner city and urban regeneration programmes on rural economic development, the State of the English Cities Report 2006 included comparisons with groups of small towns and rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/2">This showed that overall growth in employment and number of households in small towns and rural areas rose faster than in groups of larger towns and cities from 1991-03. The research also showed that, outside of London, small towns and rural areas overall had a higher percentage of the working age population qualified to degree level than in larger towns and cities, and a higher percentage of 15 year-olds with five-plus GCSEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/3">The report's findings on the importance of linking opportunities, needs and places in order to further economic competitiveness and tackle social exclusion (for example, by improving the accessibility of unemployed people to jobs) offer potential benefits for both rural and urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/4">The Government's review of sub-national economic development and regeneration (SNR) recognises the contribution small towns and rural areas can make to the wider regional economy, and as contributors to the economic life of cities rather than merely being beneficiaries of economic activity in cities. The SNR proposal for a new statutory duty on local authorities to assess local economic conditions, and take account of their wider economic area, will assist rural and urban economic development.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.5/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has procedures in place to ensure that centres comply with Sections 3(3)(a) and 3(4) of the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The HFEA checks compliance on a case by case basis upon inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/2">The culture of mouse embryos, as described by Hsu et al (1974), involved culture on a collagen surface with the intention of nurturing a 3D structure. As far as the HFEA is aware, this study is the only one in which contractions resembling a heart beat have been observed in mammalian embryos cultured in vitro. The gestation period of a mouse is 19 days, meaning at 10 to 14 days a mouse embryo would be over halfway through the normal gestation period.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/3">When culturing inner cell masses which have outgrown from the structure of an embryo, centres must ensure that the method used does not allow embryos to develop past 14 days or the appearance of the primitive streak. The method used must result in a flat culture of cells and not a 3D structure. Embryos that have attached and outgrown on the surface of the dish no longer have the organisation structure of a viable embryo.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">The effects of diazinon poisoning in humans have been reported in a number of clinical studies following accidental or suicidal ingestion of diazinon. The major effects observed are related to excessive stimulation of acetylcholine receptors, which results in changes in the function of the brain, heart, respiratory tract and other organs. Changes in liver enzymes have also been reported. Patients who survive a severe acute poisoning crisis sometimes develop muscle weakness beginning one to four days later and this has occasionally resulted in fatal respiratory failure. There is some evidence that severe poisoning with organophosphates, such as diazinon, can lead to persistent impairment of brain function but effects on other organs have not been reported.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/2">Fines, such as those levied by the OFT, are paid into the Consolidated Fund and are then allocated according to government spending priorities as part of the spending review process. The fines are therefore spent on providing services to the public. The Treasury's Comprehensive Spending Review and Pre-Budget Report (published in October 2007), available in the Library of the House and at <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pbr">www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pbr</a> _csr/pbr_csr07_index.cfm, provides details of how departments' budgets have been set for the next three years. The fines levied by the OFT are intended to be a punitive measure to deter anti-competitive behaviour and are not designed as a means of compensation. However, in general where consumers or businesses have suffered as a result of anti-competitive behaviour, they can seek redress for their losses through private action. The Government recognise that, in some instances, there may be barriers to redress and will be consulting shortly on measures to address this.</p>
