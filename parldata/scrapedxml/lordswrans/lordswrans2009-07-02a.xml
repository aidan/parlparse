	<p pid="a.65.2/1">The UK works closely with the Afghan authorities to support a strengthening of the criminal justice system across Afghanistan. The UK is clear that all detainees should be treated humanely. It is right that the International Committee of the Red Cross have access to those detained at the Bagram detention facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/2">The question of prisoners detained at Bagram is a matter for the US and Afghan Governments as Bagram is a US detention facility. President Obama has set in motion a comprehensive review of detention policy and practice, including in Afghanistan. We welcome this and await its outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/3">The formal justice system in Afghanistan faces many challenges, including a shortage of trained judges and legal representation. The UK and international community are supporting the strengthening of the justice sector to address these; for example, at the national level the UK is building the capacity of the Criminal Justice Task Force and, through the Department for International Development, has supported the World Bank's Justice Sector Reform Project.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/4">The UK also supports human rights in Afghanistan. Since 2001 the UK has given nearly &pound;2 million to support the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC). The AIHRC has over 500 staff across Afghanistan, actively tackling human rights issues, including false imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/5">In its 2007 annual report, the AIHRC stated that its Monitoring and Investigation Unit, in close co-operation with the Afghan Ministry of Justice, prepared a list of 2,392 people who were in prison after the completion of their sentences or who were otherwise illegally detained. The AIHRC later released an update stating that 819 of those who were illegally detained had been released and the sentences of an estimated 1,500 more had been determined.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.8/1">We closely follow the impact of policy announcements by the United States and other major countries on plans to mitigate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with their legal obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/2">Under the convention, parties are required periodically to report their climate policies and emissions inventories to the UNFCCC secretariat. We take a strong interest in these reports, and use the data presented to inform our understanding of countries' progress in reducing emissions through existing policies, and the further actions that will be required from countries in order to avoid dangerous climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/3">The Government are also monitoring unilateral announcements by major countries on the mitigation actions that they expect to undertake in future. Current negotiations on the overall shape of a future international climate change agreement foresee the adoption at Copenhagen later this year of new, improved international rules for measuring, reporting and verifying the impact of countries' emissions reduction policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/4">We also actively monitor the longer term impact of mitigation actions on global concentrations of carbon dioxide and other GHGs in the atmosphere, including through research conducted by the Meteorological Office Hadley Centre. However, we would expect a lag of several years between any significant changes in greenhouse gas emissions and the measurable atmospheric effects that would result from this, due to inertia in the global climate system.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">The Government recognise that if we do not take action now to stop climate change getting worse, the ice sheets will continue to melt, the impacts on future generations will be irreversible and the costs of taking action unaffordable. That is why the UK is pushing for an ambitious global climate change deal in Copenhagen later this year that will meet our objective of keeping global temperature rises below 2 degrees Celsius. This will mean nothing less than a 50 per cent reduction in global emissions by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels).</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">In the EU, we have already committed to a 20 per cent reduction in EU emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2020, and if other countries make ambitious commitments in December, the EU is prepared to increase this commitment to 30 per cent. This is by far the most ambitious mitigation offer on the negotiation table so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/3">At a national level, future sea level rise around the UK coast due to the effects of climate change is a major concern. In November 2008, the Environment Agency, working with the Met Office Hadley Centre, published some climate change research findings as part of the Thames Estuary 2100 project (TE100). The research outlined that relative sea levels could rise between 0.2m and 0.88m by 2100. This figure allows for small land movements over that time, but does not fully account for the remote possibility of future rapid changes in ice flows in the Atlantic or in Greenland, which could lead to the upper figures being much higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/4">In response, the Environment Agency commissioned the Met Office to consider this gap in ice flow science. The work investigated a most extreme scenario, known as High + +. This suggested a higher range of sea level rise of up to 1.9m. This is regarded as a remote possibility, highly uncertain and highly unlikely in this century. As we go forward, we will refine our projections in the light of what is happening in practice and as science deepens our understanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/5">Defra manages the impacts of sea level rise through a range of policy approaches including supporting flood adaptation and resilience. Long-term strategies and plans, such as Thames Estuary 2100, have been prepared on the basis of current understanding and are designed to be adaptable to ensure that future challenges can be met.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">The determining factors that contribute to defining security at a licensed civil nuclear site are: the threat, the consequences of the loss or dispersal of nuclear material, and the UK's international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">Security in the civil nuclear industry is subject to regulation which reflects the international obligations and best practice. The Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) regulates the civil nuclear industry by means of the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (NISR), which makes provision for the protection of nuclear material, both on sites and in transit, against the risks of theft and sabotage, and for the protection of sensitive nuclear information.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/3">Security measures in the civil nuclear industry are applied in a graduated manner in accordance with the severity of the threat and the level of consequence of a successful attack in a manner that provides defence in depth. OCNS may give directions to the nuclear operators at any time, for instance in the light of a change in the threat level for the industry. This is aided by OCNS being an active member of the UK intelligence community.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/4">Any new licensed nuclear sites would need to satisfy the demanding requirements of the NISR. OCNS will ensure that security measures are included in plans for the construction of any new nuclear power station from the outset. Doing so will avoid the need to retrofit security measures once construction is under way. This will also enable regulators to make an early judgment on the most appropriate measures for any construction site. This will help ensure that security is ingrained into practices at any site from day one. The Government are confident that this approach will ensure that security measures will continue to be robust and effective.</p>

There are now no international military monitors operating in Abkhazia. The EU Monitoring Mission is mandated to operate in the whole of Georgia, but in practice has never had proper access to the separatist regions. We continue to press for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/2">The UK and partners are exploring options to strengthen the international presence in Abkhazia. The closure of UNOMIG has had no effect on the status of other UN agencies, such as the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), who continue to operate in Abkhazia. Our embassy officials in Georgia have visited Abkhazia since the war, most recently in May 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/3">We have supported the role of international monitors in investigating&mdash;where they can&mdash;allegations of human rights violations. This is especially relevant in the case of the increasingly exposed ethnic Georgian population in Abkhazia.</p>

The monitors currently operate in Georgian-controlled territory adjacent to South Ossetia. Prior to August 2008 they had access to South Ossetia, but they have never had access to Abkhazia. We continue to press Russia to re-engage on the Greek chairman's proposals regarding the OSCE Monitoring Mission in Georgia, which would allow OSCE monitors to work in South Ossetia. We are concurrently looking at options for an alternative OSCE presence working in Georgia on specific issues, not necessarily related to conflict.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.5/2">The Government intend to bring these changes into effect through an enabling power in the flood and water management Bill. This would allow the Secretary of State to extend the uses of water that may be restricted under existing water company hosepipe ban powers. The existing hosepipe ban powers apply only to the watering of private gardens and the washing of private motor vehicles. The proposed legislative change is currently being consulted on as part of the draft flood and water management Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.5/3">The department has committed to undertake further work to identify evidence of the costs and benefits of these changes. Any additional non-essential uses of water that may be prohibited, which could include the filling of private swimming pools, would be added to the legislation through an order, and would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
