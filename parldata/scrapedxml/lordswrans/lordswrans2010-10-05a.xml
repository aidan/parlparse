However, they must not use this criterion to give a child a lower priority in obtaining a place at a school.

Inspections that are carried out from the authorities' own vessels are, as far as possible, programmed to coincide with other operations in the vicinity and to take place after dark when other work is not possible, in order to keep sailing time to a minimum.</p>
