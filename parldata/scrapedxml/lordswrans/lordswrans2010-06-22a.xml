	<p pid="a.169.5/1">The pilot in Ashford, Kent was run for 12 months from November 2007 to October 2008 and was aimed at refused asylum seekers with children. The pilot explored alternative ways to return families to their country of origin without the need for detention or enforced removal. Using the lessons learned from this a new pilot was started in Glasgow in June 2009. It encourages refused asylum seeker families to return voluntarily by providing intensive support focused on helping families to make sense of their stay in Scotland, confronting issues delaying a return and building up skills to prepare for a voluntary return.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/2">To date 32 families have been referred to the Glasgow pilot leading to 11 being accommodated. No families have elected to return voluntarily to their home countries and enforced departure has taken place for three families initially accepted into the project, but not engaging with it. During the period when the Ashford pilot was operating and reviewed, a total of 12 families were accommodated with one being removed.</p>

It is currently being independently evaluated by Organisational Development Consulting and Support (ODS) and Barnardo's, which are specifically evaluating the impact of the project on children. The pilot in Ashford was formally evaluated and the lessons learned were used to inform the pilot in Glasgow.</p>
