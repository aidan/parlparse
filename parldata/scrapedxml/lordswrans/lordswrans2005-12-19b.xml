	<p pid="b.197.2/1">The Government understand that it is rare for a baby to be born alive following a termination of pregnancy. The Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists issued guidance to its Fellows and Members in 1996, and again in 2001, on terminations at gestational age of more than 21 weeks and six days, and ensuring that the foetus is born dead.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/2">The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) initially intends to carry out a validation exercise to look at data on babies born alive but who die in the first 28 days following legal abortion. Upon completion of the validation exercise CEMACH will make its work available, although the time scales for this are uncertain at present.</p>

	<p pid="b.197.5/1">When developing the partial regulatory impact assessment (PRIA) on the Prohibition of Abortion (England and Wales) Bill officials contacted a range of government departments and stakeholders to get the best possible understanding of the Bill. The number of possible illegal abortions estimated in the PRIA was based on information provided by those stakeholders responding to the consultation and from examining what happened in other countries where access to abortion is restricted or illegal. The PRIA highlights that any outcomes would evolve over time, requiring around five years to become established.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.5/1">Unlike other Jobcentre Plus programmes, the success of which are measured by how many unemployed people find work or training through those programmes, Access to Work is designed to help disabled people who are already in employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.5/2">Since the programme began in 1994, the number helped and the spend has increased dramatically, with 32,077 people helped in the 2004-05 financial year with a spend of &pound;59.5 million. The national centre carries out regular customer satisfaction surveys and monitors the number of people helped by Access to Work. The National Audit Office also carries out regular checks on the administration of the programme to ensure correct use of access to work guidance and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.5/3">More detailed evidence is available from a recent survey. In July 2005, 4,000 customer satisfaction questionnaires were sent out by the Access to Work business centres. Some 1,523 questionnaires were returned by the end of September: 1,387 respondents were either very satisfied or satisfied with the programme and said that they could not work without its support. There is also strong support for Access to Work from voluntary organisations and groups promoting employment for disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="b.199.2/1">The UK is working hard to ensure that the UNFCCC creates the enabling framework for developing countries to manage climate change, principally through its policy function and supported by enabling funds. For example, under the UNFCCC, least developed countries are developing national adaptation programmes of action. The impacts of climate change on water resource management are likely to be an important focus. Enabling funds have been established under the UNFCCC to help developing countries to assess the relevance of climate change impacts to their development and to integrate responses to climate change into their planning and policies. The UK has committed &pound;10 million over three years to the UNFCCC Special Climate Change Fund for this purpose. A similar fund was adopted at the recent conference of parties for least developed countries, which covers 30 countries in Africa. The UK will be considering a contribution to it once we are satisfied with the programming strategy developed for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.2/2">The G8 Gleneagles plan of action contained important agreements on progressing adaptation to climate change. The G8 agreed to put climate risk management procedures in place for donor-funded development investments, to increase their resilience to climate change impacts. The UK will be working collaboratively with the World Bank and other donors to implement a pilot phase of climate risk screening of its investments in 2006. On Africa specifically, the G8 agreed to support improvements to climate observation networks to address climate data gaps, as well as developing in-country and regional capacity for analysing and interpreting climate observational data, to support local planning needs in sectors such as water and agriculture. The UK will be supporting the relevant multilateral organisations to take this forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.5/1">The Government provide VAT reliefs for charities worth over &pound;200 million each year&mdash;this includes some reliefs designed specifically for things sold by charities&mdash;such as donated goods, and goods and services sold in connection with a one-off fundraising event. Charities also benefit from zero rates of VAT for certain things they buy such as advertising services and some construction services. In addition, the Government provide over &pound;2 billion in direct tax and business rate relief and repayments to charities each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.5/2">Charities do incur VAT on some of their purchases, and the Government have considered the issue of charities' irrecoverable VAT in two major reviews since 1997. Through these reviews we came to two conclusions: first, that it would not be an affordable or efficient use of public resources to reimburse all 250,000 charitable bodies in the UK for the VAT they incur regardless of the activities they are involved in or their financial health, which the sector estimates would cost some &pound;500 million per year; and secondly, that there was no fair and principled basis on which we could decide that some charities would be reimbursed their VAT and some would not.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.5/3">The available resources are better and more effectively deployed through targeted initiatives such as the new Futurebuilders investment fund, rather than through a general VAT refund scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.204.3/1">The UK Government's policy on the population and sexual and reproductive health in the developing world is about providing choice, not coercion. We believe that women should be able to decide freely and responsibly, the number and spacing of their children, and have information and services to be able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.3/2">DfID does not provide direct funding to population activities in China. We do provide support to the work of United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the International Planned Parenthood Foundation (IPPF), as well as other organisations in sexual and reproductive health fields that seek to promote informed choice and better services in developing countries. Both the UNFPA and the IPPF work to promote reproductive health and family planning, including HIV prevention services; DfID currently provides &pound;80 million over four years to the UNFPA and &pound;19.5 million to the IPPF for 2004-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.3/3">The UNFPA and the IPPF are working to promote reform and change in China. Neither supports the one child policy or its implementation. Both the UNFPA and the IPPF are working to promote and uphold the principles of free and informed choice as set out at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.3/4">As a condition of the UNFPA support the Chinese authorities have removed birth quotas and targets within the counties in which the UNFPA provides support. The UNFPA programme in China is making a full range of reproductive health services available in 32 countries on a voluntary basis. In the areas where the UNFPA is working, abortion rates are falling.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.3/5">The IPPF, through the China family planning association, is promoting work to report misconduct by officials within government programme, and innovative approaches to enable people to report behaviour that infringes people's rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.3/6">For these reasons, and for the work that both the UNFPA and the IPPF pursue elsewhere, DfID will continue to provide support to both organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.209.2/1">There are several types of cycles on the market designed for use by disabled people. However, we have made no assessment of the extent to which they, or other forms of cycles, are used as mobility aids and information to inform such an assessment is not held centrally. The extent to which cycles benefit the mobility of disabled people when compared with other forms of mobility aids has therefore not been determined.</p>

Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase>, the duties in Part 3 have started to be extended in stages to more areas, including private clubs, public bodies in their carrying out of public functions, and letting of premises. An adjustment for a disabled person who required a cycle as a mobility aid would need to be considered by those with duties under the Act when deciding what may be a reasonable adjustment to make. Factors such as the cost and practicability of making an adjustment, and the resources available to the service provider, private club or landlord may be taken into account in deciding what is reasonable in any individual situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.5/1">Green material, or non-hazardous waste, is not subject to the prior notification and consent procedures which apply to exports of hazardous waste. The UK competent authorities that control exports of waste are therefore not able to provide figures for exports of green material. Data from other sources, such as HM Revenue and Customs, would not be able to distinguish between exports that originated in households and other sources such as industry since a consignment could come from either source.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.5/2">General household waste, not including separately collected or sorted recyclable waste, is usually regarded by the UK as only suitable for disposal. Exports of waste for disposal from the UK are prohibited under national legislation. It is possible that general household waste could be exported to a facility specifically designed to recover energy from waste provided that UK competent authorities were minded to accept that the export was primarily for the purpose of energy recovery. However, no exports to these types of facilities have been reported during the period 2000&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid="b.225.2/1">The Department for Education and Skills contributed to the benefits overview document which was published by the Identity Cards Programme in June 2005. The department has, in consultation with the Identity Cards Programme, developed a current best estimate of the cost of using the ID cards scheme to support the services which it oversees and these costs have been incorporated into the business case. The department is represented on the Ministerial Committee on Identity Cards, which oversees the work on benefits planning and realisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/2">We cannot release detailed estimated costs for using the ID card scheme as some elements may be acquired from the market. The estimates are therefore commercially sensitive and to release them may prejudice the procurement process and the department's ability to obtain value for money from potential suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.234.6/1">Government purchasing seeks to demonstrate value for money while promoting fair and open competition. As well as value for money, a number of other factors are used to determine the most appropriate products to buy, including: technical, health and safety and environmental considerations, as well as delivery and after sales service. Because of the aggregated value of the items purchased by the Prison Service, the European Union (EU) public procurement directives apply to both stationery and furniture and have been the subject of EU competition procedures, the latter of which was undertaken by the Inland Revenue as part of a collaborative venture. The Prison Service uses furniture manufactured by prisoners. As well as ensuring value for money, this policy has the added benefit of providing prisoners with purposeful activity, training and potentially qualifications that will help lead to employment on release. Where specific items of furniture cannot be manufactured in house, two contractors have been selected to provide such items from framework agreements awarded by Inland Revenue following an open competition. Contract prices are subject to rigorous reviews to ensure that products remain competitively priced throughout the life of the contract.</p>

	<p pid="b.240.3/1">Information on the number of violent attacks involving bladed weapons is not collected centrally in the police recorded crime statistics. The British Crime Survey (BCS) collects information on the use of weapons in violent incidents, whether or not the incident was reported to the police. The available information from the BCS is given in the table. Statistics on victims of homicide killed with a sharp instrument are published in Table 1.03 of <i>Crime in England and Wales 2003/04: Supplementary Volume 1: Homicide and Gun Crime</i> (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 02/05). A copy of this publication is available in the Library.</p>
