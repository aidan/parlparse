	<p pid="a.42.5/1">The Government recognise that local authorities may wish to consider adopting local purchasing policies but it is for them to judge how far this can be done within existing UK and EU legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/2">Local authorities are limited in their scope to use procurement to pursue local purchasing policies by Section 17 of the Local Government Act 1988, which sets out a number of &quot;non-commercial matters&quot; which must be excluded from the contract process. The 1988 Act does not apply to National Health Service trusts. However, a more significant dimension is the EC Treaty and the European Directives for Public Procurement. These apply to all public contracting bodies, including National Health Service trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/3">EC procurement directives, which are implemented in the UK by various public procurement regulations, prohibit discrimination on the grounds of nationality. To bring local purchasing considerations into the contracting process may well conflict with these wider requirements. In addition to requiring contracts to be awarded on the basis of non-discrimination, transparency and competitive procurement principles, the EC Directives/UK Regulations set out detailed procedures and criteria for the selection of tenderers and the award of contracts. The selection criteria relate to the financial standing, technical capacity and personal standing of the companies involved and the award criteria cover what is necessary to deliver value for money in performing the contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/4">However it is open to local authorities to build non-discriminatory quality factors into contract specifications for the procurement of goods and services under Best Value and to take account of this in the evaluation of bids. They could also assist local suppliers to tender for work by, for example, holding briefing sessions which explained the way that the authority tendered, how and where it advertised forthcoming work and how firms should respond to those requests.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.2/1">Each application for the release of genetically modified (GM) plants for research purposes is supported by a risk assessment, which is evaluated by government experts and independent scientists on the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). Bee foraging behaviour is well understood and expertise on bees and their behaviour is available to ACRE. When foraging a crop with high flower density, a bee may fly for some metres, possibly hundreds of metres, to a particular area of the crop. ACRE always takes account of pollen dispersal by bees and its likely consequences. ACRE also considers the possible effects of GM crops on other insects when advising whether or not to approve consents for GM crop plantings. If there was any reason to believe the crop would be harmful, its release would not be approved.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/2">My department is aware of recent reports from Germany about the possible effects on bees of ingesting GM pollen. Once this research has been finalised, published and peer reviewed, ACRE will advise if any further research is needed.</p>
