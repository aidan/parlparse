The change in title and grade was made following the restructuring of the SVS and the MAFF regional organisation in 1995 and reflected an increase in the resources being managed by the DVM when compared with a DVO.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.5/1">The Government's objectives in setting up a UK emissions trading scheme are cost-effective emissions reductions and to give UK business early experience of emissions trading. These objectives will be met providing there are sufficient participants to ensure competitive pressure in February's incentive auction. As 46 organisations are currently in the process of registering for the auction, the Government are confident that this will be case. Moreover, total participation in the scheme is not limited to those organisations entering through the February auction. There are 3,500 companies in climate change agreements, which can trade on the basis of their energy efficiency targets. There will also be opportunities to enter through approved emission reduction projects, or by simply buying and selling allowances.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.8/1">During the first two weeks of consultation on draft maps in the South East and lower North West mapping regions, the Countryside Agency's website received nearly 2 million hits. This high level of interest initially led to some visitors to the website experiencing delays in navigating the site.

Such an exceedence would not result in a chronic risk to consumers. It is known, however, that the compounds are effective against apple and pear storage diseases at 50 per cent of the maximum approved rates, and it is already horticultural practice to use a 50 per cent rate. Action has therefore been taken to reduce the maximum approved rate by 50 per cent which still provides effective disease control, but which will not result in a breach of the MRL.</p>

It would be convenient to have a single definition, but it might well fail to reflect reality and prove inflexible. We are working towards a better definition of urban and rural areas as explained in my Answer (WA 83; <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-05">5 February</phrase>). For statistical purposes we generally use the definition developed by the Countryside Agency and where any other definition is being used we will endeavour to make that clear.</p>

The police may at any time before, during or at the conclusion of an investigation make a request for advice or submit a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS will consider any file submitted by the police with a view to determining whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.

	<p pid="a.248.3/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today laid before Parliament a Special Grant Report which sets out the arrangements for reimbursing local authorities in England for the costs of supporting unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) as a result of their duties under the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.3/2">The Special Grant Report explains the areas of expenditure which will be eligible for the grant and the time-scales for local authorities to make their claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.3/3">As my right honourable friend the Home Secretary outlined in the White Paper, we will continue to offer appropriate levels of care to UASC and the Home Office leads the Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children's Stakeholder Group. One key element of this is to ensure that we can sift out adults posing as children and deter those seeking to abuse the system. Home Office staff are already taking steps to challenge older applicants and divert them to the adult asylum process.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.3/4">We are exploring opportunities for better sharing of costs across the country and in particular the joint commissioning of the accommodation for unaccompanied minors who are 16 or 17 on arrival. We are already doing more to support local authorities by improving information exchange and UASC will be included as part of the asylum audit. It is important that financial support to local authorities provides fairly for essential needs and encourages good value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.2/1">The Performance and Innovation Unit is reviewing the legal and regulatory framework for charities and the voluntary sector. The aims of the review are to enable not-for-profit organisations to thrive; to encourage the development of new types of organisation; and to ensure public confidence in the sector. The review was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-03">3 July 2001</phrase> and is expected to report in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/2">The Active Community Unit provides funding to voluntary and community organisations that support the development of strong and active communities. For example, over the past year, under the capital modernisation grant programme, some &pound;8 million was invested in 46 local voluntary and community partnership projects to enhance and improve access to services by encouraging co-location, integration and refurbishment of community buildings; &pound;1 million a year is also invested in support of 18 networks to ensure that the voluntary and community sector has a voice at regional level.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/3">The unit provides some &pound;12 million a year in three-year grants to key national bodies in the voluntary and community sector that support the development of communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/4">The unit is developing proposals for simplifying access to small grants for small voluntary and community groups. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary hopes to publish an action plan in the next few weeks that will provide for the establishment, at local level, of a simplified mechanism for handling all government small grants programmes. The aim is to encourage more people to become involved in their communities and making it easier for them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/5">The Regional Co-ordination Unit is undertaking a study to explore how the system of regeneration and community funding could be made more comprehensible to both voluntary and community sector groups as well as small businesses. The study covers regeneration and community funding: that is, resources provided by government and other agencies to support activity which will change the economic, environmental or social state of an area.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/6">There has been regular dialogue between the units and they work closely together. They aim to recommend a package of reforms that will support the sector as a whole.</p>
