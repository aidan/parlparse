Trusts are allowed to charge because the provision of car-parking facilities incurs a range of maintenance, security and staffing costs. If no charges were made, trusts would have to find these costs from elsewhere. Each trust is responsible for setting its own charges, but any profits must be used to improve health services.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.0/1">My department has funded the Energy Saving Trust since 1992, to promote the sustainable and efficient use of energy in the household sector. Our grant for the current financial year is &pound;27 million. The trust is an independent, private company that plays an important role in helping the Government to meet their climate change targets. The trust runs a number of programmes to promote energy saving in the home, including television advertisements, a network of 52 local advice centres and the endorsement of energy-saving products. The trust also provides information about grants and offers that are available to help implement energy-saving measures in homes. More information is available from the Energy Saving Trust website at <a href="http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/">www.est.org.uk/myhome/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/2">We need to raise levels of public understanding and change attitudes to climate change as a central part of the wider climate change programme. This is the focus for our climate change communication initiative, which was launched in December last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/3">Defra has made funding of &pound;12 million available for the whole initiative and, so far, &pound;4.8 million has been allocated to 53 Climate Challenge Fund projects. These projects, from across England, will form part of an innovative new approach aimed at raising awareness at regional and local level of the urgent need to tackle climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/4">Under the climate change communications initiative the Government are providing additional support, including guidance for communicators, a website (<a href="http://www.climatechallenge.gov.uk">www.climatechallenge.gov.uk</a>), and free-to-use resources such as short film and radio advertisements.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/5">As a further element of the initiative, earlier this year we ran a competition to choose nine young climate change champions, each from a different region of England. The winners, who were chosen in May, will spend a year spreading the word to their region about climate change and the role that young people can have in tackling it.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.3/1">We agree that stepped improvements in access to evidence-based psychological therapies should be available. Our programme, Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), which we announced in May, is a key part of the Government's mental health programme to address this. The IAPT programme will define the best way to achieve these improvements over the next five to 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/2">We have recently set up psychological therapy demonstration sites in Doncaster and Newham, to help test the extent to which increasing access to these therapies improves well-being, reduces worklessness and the number of people claiming incapacity benefit, and provides greater choices in treatment and core options for people with these conditions. The demonstration sites will help to clarify the number of staff, the skills set and the training requirements needed to improve access to psychological therapies.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/3">Evidence from the demonstration sites will be supplemented by a national network of smaller, local IAPT projects and 20 national primary care mental health collaborative sites.</p>
