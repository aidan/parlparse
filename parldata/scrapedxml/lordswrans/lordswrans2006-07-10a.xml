Trusts are allowed to charge because the provision of car-parking facilities incurs a range of maintenance, security and staffing costs. If no charges were made, trusts would have to find these costs from elsewhere. Each trust is responsible for setting its own charges, but any profits must be used to improve health services.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.0/1">The UK provided &pound;200,000 in 2003-04 to the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) to co-fund an independent internal survey aimed at assessingthe environmental and human health effects of using glyphosate to eradicate coca crops in Colombia. The survey's findings were published in April 2005 and can be found at <a href="http://www.cicad.oas.org/Desarrollo_Alternativo/ENG/Projects%20By%20Country/Colombia/OAS%20Panel%20Report%20Final.pdf">www.cicad.oas.org/Desarrollo_ Alternativo/ENG/Projects%20By%20Country/Colombia/OAS% 20Panel%20Report%20Final.pdf</a>.</p>

As such, we have regular discussions with all Governments in the region, including Colombia and Ecuador, and with other international partners about strategies for countering the activities of those involved in the illicit drugs trade. As part of that assistance, we have contributed &pound;100,000 to the development of an alternative livelihood programme in Bolivia. The UK does not assist with aerial spraying and it has not therefore been necessary to discuss the environmental and health effects of aerial spraying with any Government in the region. We none the less recognise the right of the Colombian authorities to take whatever steps they deem necessary, as part of a wide range of activities, to counter the production of illicit drugs.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.5/1">Neither strategic health authorities (SHAs) nor primary care trusts (PCTs) have any direct responsibility for the follow-up treatment and care of victims of rape.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/2">The role of PCTs is to commission services based on local assessments of need. It is their role to commission a comprehensive and equitable range of high-quality, responsive and efficient services, within allocated resources. PCTs operate within the framework of Department of Health policy; they are held to account for this by SHAs, not directly by the department.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/3">The role of SHAs is to ensure that local systems operate effectively and deliver improved performance, by working in partnership with PCTs and holding them to account for their performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/4">However, a number of initiatives are taking place across Government to develop policy and improve practice for victims of rape and sexual assault. One of these is the national sexual violence and abuse stakeholder advisory group, chaired by Home Office Minister Mr Vernon Coaker and Department of Health Minister Ms Caroline Flint. In addition, a national sexual violence and abuse action plan is being developed by the Home Office with the Department of Health and other government departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/5">The Department of Health has also been working closely with the Home Office to develop sexual assault referral centres (SARCs), and national service guidelines for developing sexual assault referral centres were published in October 2005. In addition, since 2003, &pound;1.27 million from the Home Office Victims Fund has been spent on new and existing SARCs. SARCs operate in 14 locations in England and Wales, and six more are due to open in the forthcoming year.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/6">The Victims of Violence and Abuse Prevention Programme, run jointly by the Department of Health and the National Institute for Mental Health in England, is working in partnership with the Home Office to develop national service guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/7">There are no national standards for training of doctors providing medical examinations and aftercare following sexual assault. There is currently no United Kingdom qualification in sexual assault examination and aftercare.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/8">The content and standard of postgraduate medical training is the responsibility of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board, and the General Medical Council's education committee has the general function of promoting high standards of medical education. Both bodies have a vested interest in ensuring that doctors are equipped to deal with the problems they will encounter in practice, including forensic examination of victims of rape. It is not, however, practicable or desirable for the Government to prescribe the exact training that any individual doctor will receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/9">However, courses are available for training doctors and nurses to carry out examinations following sexual assault; for example, those run by the London Havens and by St Mary's Hospital, Manchester. To become competent in this area of work, new doctors working in the London Havens:</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/10">attend a two-day adult rape course;attend a two-day child sexual assault course;attend a one-day court training course;attend subsequent updates;shadow examinations conducted by experienced doctors; conduct their first few examinations under supervision, and have their statements checked by an experienced colleague.</p>

Our grant for the current financial year is &pound;27 million. The trust is an independent, private company that plays an important role in helping the Government to meet their climate change targets. The trust runs a number of programmes to promote energy saving in the home, including television advertisements, a network of 52 local advice centres and the endorsement of energy-saving products. The trust also provides information about grants and offers that are available to help implement energy-saving measures in homes. More information is available from the Energy Saving Trust website at <a href="http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/">www.est.org.uk/myhome/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/2">We need to raise levels of public understanding and change attitudes to climate change as a central part of the wider climate change programme. This is the focus for our climate change communication initiative, which was launched in December last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/3">Defra has made funding of &pound;12 million available for the whole initiative and, so far, &pound;4.8 million has been allocated to 53 Climate Challenge Fund projects. These projects, from across England, will form part of an innovative new approach aimed at raising awareness at regional and local level of the urgent need to tackle climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/4">Under the climate change communications initiative the Government are providing additional support, including guidance for communicators, a website (<a href="http://www.climatechallenge.gov.uk">www.climatechallenge.gov.uk</a>), and free-to-use resources such as short film and radio advertisements.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/5">As a further element of the initiative, earlier this year we ran a competition to choose nine young climate change champions, each from a different region of England.

The British Academy of Audiology wrote to express concern about directly accessed audiology services. The department has made clear that reducing waiting times for directly accessed audiology services is important and that an action plan is being developed to improve access.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.5/1">More than 13 million people have registered on the organ donor register (ODR), 23 per cent of the United Kingdom population. The Department of Health gives around &pound;1 million yearly to National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) to run the ODR and to promote transplantation. It also provides Section 64 grants to a number of charities to promote donation in particular parts of the community. Specific initiatives include funding through NHSBT to support hospital-based schemes, high profile media initiatives and partnership working with a range of organisations to increase the number of people registered on the ODR and to encourage donation.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/2">In April 2006, NHS Blood and Transplant published the results of its potential donor audit. It suggested that there may be greater opportunities to identify potential donors in intensive care units; and highlighted the high number of relatives&mdash;some 40 per cent&mdash;who refuse donation. We have asked officials to bring together a small group of key people to take stock of progress against <I>Saving Lives Valuing Donors&mdash;A Transplant Framework for England</I>, published in 2003; to identify current barriers to organ donation; to look at national and international experience; and to identify opportunities to increase donation rates within the current legal and regulatory framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/3">The Human Tissue Act 2004, which is due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2006</phrase>, sets out the requirement for consent to be obtained to use human organs and tissue whether from the living or after death. It will make clear that relatives have no right of veto over the deceased's wish to donate, which should assist in reducing the current relatives refusal rate. We are not convinced that a policy of &quot;presumed consent&quot; would be effective in increasing the number of organs available for transplantation or that there is overwhelming public support for a &quot;presumed consent&quot; or opt-out scheme. A system of presumed consent would be entirely contrary to principles in the Human Tissue Act.</p>
