Examples include the new obstacle breaching line explosives system, enhanced medical diagnostic and monitoring equipment, a vehicle decontamination system and the blue force tracking situational awareness system that comprised one part of UK ground forces' combat identification capability.

These are essential for SECI effectively to fulfil its principal function, namely the exchange of intelligence information between participants. Individual countries decide whether to mount operations based on this information. In the meantime, the UK retains an observer in Bucharest to assess SECI's capacity and the UK will review its position if and when significant progress can be demonstrated.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.8/1">The format of the biennial meeting (New York, 7&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">11 July</phrase>) does not allow for states to make substantive proposals. But it will be a useful opportunity to take work forward with partners within the framework of the UN. The UK is therefore planning, in partnership with other interested states, to hold a side meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">8 July</phrase> to discuss options for strengthening consensus on the need for regulation of small arms transfers. This is a sensitive issue for many states. Continuing this work within the framework of the UN is particularly important, and the UK is committed to the process. The aim of the side meeting is to gather support for launching a regionally based process to share more widely understanding on national implementation of export controls of small arms, with the aim of reporting back findings at the 2005 biennial meeting. We also hope the July 2003 biennial meeting will focus on the linkages between small arms proliferation and poverty and issues around disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.8/2">Weapons collection and destruction is a central part of the UK strategy on small arms and light weapons. We have allocated &pound;7.5 million over three years to the United Nations Development Programme for a global programme on weapons collection, management and destruction. The UK is aware of the wide availability of weapons in Iraq and regards this as a serious and urgent issue. We are in discussion bilaterally and with UN agencies on how best to address this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.5/1">The United Kingdom was represented at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in Luxembourg on 5 and <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase> by my noble friend Lord Filkin and me.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/2">The A points were approved as in document PTS A 32 and ADD 1 (9941/03) (a copy has been placed in the Library) with the exception of item 21.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/3">The Council concluded a political agreement on the Council directive concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/4">One member state retained scrutiny reservations on the directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection. The presidency remitted the directive to COREPER with a view to securing agreement at the Thessaloniki European Council in order to meet the deadline set at the Seville Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/5">Member states lifted the majority of their reservations on the first two chapters of the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status. Five member states, including the United Kingdom, also presented a joint declaration calling for a minimum common EU list of safe countries of origin to be included in the text.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/6">The Commission presented its communications on illegal immigration, asylum systems and integration and employment. Lord Filkin welcomed the communications noting that there was a need to address the crisis in Europe and across the world in the international protection system. Lord Filkin also said that the Council should consider the priorities for the Thessaloniki European Council. In particular, there was a need to integrate asylum and migration issues into the EU's relations with third countries; set targets for the conclusion of readmission agreements; and give a commitment to burden sharing. He also called for a European returns fund; extra Community funding for JHA activity post-2006; and agreement to take forward pilot projects to test out new approaches to international protection with interested member states and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/7">The Council subsequently agreed conclusions on the effective management of the EU's external borders. A discussion on conclusions on a common policy on illegal immigration, external borders, the return of illegal immigrants and co-operation with third countries focused on the need for a financial mechanism to assist Community return policy, which the United Kingdom supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/8">The Council agreed conclusions on the functions of SIS and the SIS II architecture and the Council decision concerning the signature of agreements between EU-US on extradition and mutual legal assistance. On the latter, the majority of member states, including the United Kingdom, entered declarations under Article 24(5) TEU to the effect that they would not be bound by the agreements until they had met constitutional, or in the case of the United Kingdom, legislative requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/9">The Council resolved the outstanding issues of principle on the regulation concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility on the basis of a presidency compromise package. The regulation was remitted to experts to address the final technical questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/10">The Council held an orientation debate on the regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested civil claims during which Ministers discussed the scope of the regulation, minimum standards for the service of claims, appeal provisions and the omission of a public policy-based right to refuse enforcement. Baroness Scotland welcomed the proposed regulation, emphasising the benefits that better debt recovery would bring to businesses trading cross-Europe. She supported the presidency's proposals, in particular the inclusion within the minimum standards of postal service where that method was permitted in the state in which both parties resided and where the possibility of setting aside the judgment continued until enforcement commenced. The issue of whether to exclude consumer debts from the scope of the regulation and the matter of claims which attracted state immunity protection were remitted to the working group.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/11">Member states indicated that they could accept the proposal that confiscation orders be enforced in the absence of dual criminality for a list of offences specified in Article 5 of the framework decision on the execution in the EU of confiscation orders. However, member states linked the enforcement of extended confiscation orders as defined in Article 2 to grounds for refusal set out in Article 7.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/12">The presidency presented a progress report on the framework decision on the application of the principle of ne bis in idem and on negotiations with Switzerland to participate in the Schengen aquis and asylum matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/13">The Commission gave a detailed summary of the latest version of the JHA scoreboard noting in particular that some of the deadlines set at the Seville European Council were not going to be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/14">Under Any Other Business, the presidency presented its ideas for the creation of common data protection rules for the third pillar.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/15">The mixed committee with Norway and Iceland met at ministerial level in the margins of the Council. It approved conclusions endorsing the creation of the Visa Information System; conclusions on the functions of SIS and SIS II architecture; the directive on assistance in transit for the purposes of removal by air; conclusions on the Schengen evaluation of Spain; a report following up the Schengen evaluation of France; conclusions on increasing the efficiency of the Schengen evaluation mechanism; and the regulation on the issuing of visas for members of the Olympic family for the 2004 Games. The mixed committee also took note of the presidency's report on the implementation of programmes, ad hoc centres, pilot projects and joint operations for the effective management of the external border.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-19a.139.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="139"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030619/text/30619w03.htm#30619w03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.139.2/1">The report of the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the act of self-harm by Ian Huntley was received by the Prison Service on <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 13 June</phrase>. Paul Goggins received that report together with the Prison Service's response to it in his office on <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 17 June</phrase>. While the investigation report itself is, for a variety of reasons, confidential, we provided a statement because we wanted Parliament and the public to have confidence that this matter has been properly dealt with. We have been mindful of the Attorney General's guidance concerning the publication of matters relating to Mr Huntley prior to his trial, to matters of security and medical confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/2">The report highlights a number of serious systems failures. We can confirm that these have already been addressed and corrected. In essence the systems for managing Ian Huntley concentrated more on protecting him from other prisoners than on the risk of self-harm. The Prison Service should have given equal importance to both risks. The report also highlighted the risks in managing a single prisoner in special conditions for a protracted period. The arrangements for briefing staff supervising Mr Huntley and the arrangements for overall management oversight were not robust enough to combat complacency and conditioning. Finally, the procedures for dispensing medication to Mr Huntley fell well short of acceptable standards and failed to take into account the risk of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/3">The report acknowledges the complex multi-functional role of Woodhill Prison and the challenge this poses to managers and staff but we have made it clear that the safe custody of Mr Huntley is an absolute priority for the Prison Service and that revised arrangements for his supervision must reflect this. The report concludes that lines of accountability for the management of Mr Huntley were unclear. We have made it clear to the Director General that there must be clear lines of accountability in the future so that all staff are fully aware of their responsibilities and that management oversight is to a consistently high standard. The report did not recommend that any disciplinary action be taken against individual officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/4">The investigating officer concluded that:</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/5" class="indent">Any failures were corporate failures and not the failure of any one individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/6" class="indent">The management arrangements for Mr Huntley lacked clarity, were not communicated well and failed to respond effectively to the developing needs of the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/7" class="indent">The day-to-day management of this situation had effectively become the responsibility of one manager who had a wide range of other responsibilities. This was not appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/8" class="indent">There were failings in communication and input from senior managers.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/9" class="indent">There were deficiencies in searching practices, which were predictable and did not include the items stored outside of his cell.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/10" class="indent">The management of staff deployed to carry out the task of supervision of Mr Huntley did not fully recognise the full risks inherent in working long shifts without relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/11" class="indent">Information was not systematically reviewed. There was a time lapse in some cases between information being submitted and consideration being given to that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/12" class="indent">Staff must have the appropriate resources, instructions and support to enable them to remain vigilant at all times they are carrying out this duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/13">The recommendations of the investigating officer include:</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/14" class="indent">One operational manager should have responsibility for the care of Mr Huntley.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/15" class="indent">A clear and effective structure for the management of Mr Huntley must be established and published to staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/16" class="indent">A multi-disciplinary team should review the current operational instruction. An amended instruction must be authorised by the Governor.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/17" class="indent">The amended operational instruction must be communicated to all staff who have contact with Mr Huntley. The implications of the new instruction should be communicated to Mr Huntley.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/18" class="indent">A multi-disciplinary team should meet weekly to review the management of Mr Huntley.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/19" class="indent">Staff still in their probationary period should not supervise Mr Huntley.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/20" class="indent">All recommendations made by Prison Service Safer Custody Group should be actioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/21" class="indent">The searching strategy should be reviewed. There should be management oversight of the reviewed strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/22" class="indent">A review of security intelligence systems, including use of CCTV, at Woodhill should be carried out by an independent person.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/23" class="indent">All recommendations made in relation to medical issues should be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/24" class="indent">There should be an audit of prescribing practice after three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/25" class="indent">Staff should be reminded of their personal responsibilities in relation to the supervision of prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/26" class="indent">The findings of the significant event audit should be circulated to health-care staff who should be engaged in resolving issues raised and implementing change.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/27" class="indent">There should be an audit of compliance with the administration of medication policy after three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/28" class="indent">There must be a specific integrated care plan for Mr Huntley, which should record all issues relating to him. This document should be reviewed daily and submitted to the governor weekly.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/29">The Prison Service has advised us that all the recommendations in the report have been accepted and have been implemented with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 16 June</phrase>. Revised and comprehensive operational instructions have been put in place that will be overseen by a clearly identified manager at all times who will report direct to the Governor. The instructions are underpinned by an integrated care plan in which comprehensive written details of all events concerning Mr Huntley will be recorded. This plan will be reviewed daily. Medical procedures have also been reviewed in consultation with the appropriate primary care trust and a multi-disciplinary team will supervise Mr Huntley's healthcare. The effectiveness of these revised procedures will be formally reviewed each week by the accountable manager together with those other managers who have designated responsibilities laid down in the operational instructions. The governer will supervise their work. The Prison Service will also make arrangements for regular audits of the operational instructions to be carried out independently of the establishment to provide assurance that full compliance with the instructions is being maintained. Audit reports will be sent to the Deputy Director General for his personal attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/30">We have made it clear to the Director General that the conclusions of the report describe a completely unacceptable situation, that the lessons to be learned must be applied immediately and that the highest standards of supervision must be sustained from now on.</p>

The appointed person is an independent person who scrutinises the use of the new search power introduced to support the scheme to seize and forfeit criminal cash.</p>

The power is a welcome addition in the fight against crime and the report shows that its operation has been, and will continue to be, closely monitored.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.3/1">The proposed development is the construction of a fishing lake near the River Rother, north of Rye in Sussex. The landowner acquired the site last autumn with the intention of creating a commercial fishing lake. He approached the Environment Agency's local emergency work force office as he wished to benefit from an arrangement whereby the agency and its predecessors obtain clay wherever possible for repairing the river flood defences.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/2">Local agency staff stripped topsoil as a preliminary to excavating clay from the site, but withdrew immediately when it became apparent there was no planning permission for the excavation and prior to any material leaving the site. No other works were carried out by the agency. The agency is liaising with Rother District Council and is actively reviewing its procedures for the local acquisition of flood defence material.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/3">In answer to the specific points raised:</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/4" class="indent">(a) There is no financial arrangement between the Environment Agency and any of its staff and the proposer of the proposed fishing lake nor has there ever been. Where the Environment Agency intends to take adjacent earth material for the repair or improvement of a river embankment, it does not consider checks on the probity or criminal record of the developer to be necessary or appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/5" class="indent">(b) The agency understood that planning permission had been obtained by the owner and ceased work on the topsoil scrape as soon as it was ascertained that this was not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/6" class="indent">(c) The agency believed that there would be a small increase in flood storage capacity. Planning application RR/2003/1208 was for the siting of a caravan only. The agency objected to this on flood risk grounds, but withdrew the objection if (as the owner stated) the caravan would only be occupied during June, July and August which is outside the months of high flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/7" class="indent">(d) The proposed fishing lake was not to be bunded and there would be a small increase in flood storage.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/8" class="indent">(e) The agency will not be further involved in the proposed development from the point of view of flood defence works to the River Rother. The agency will liaise closely with the local planning authority regarding any future proposals for this site.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.0/1">In May 2002 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued a consultation letter concerning the law on prize competitions and lotteries. This followed the report of the independent gambling review, chaired by Sir Alan Budd, which the department published in July 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/2">The consultation document asked for replies by the end of August 2002. We received 70 responses, and have been considering them carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/3">The Government are clear that lotteries will continue to be the preserve of good causes only. There should be no commercial, for-profit lotteries. The law should provide for a clear and enforceable distinction between lotteries and prize competitions, and the Government intend that the overall Bill on gambling which they propose should achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/4">The Bill will remove the restrictions on prize competitions in Section 14 of the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976. Under the Bill, prize competitions will be distinguishable from lotteries in that either they require a degree of skill, or they have a clear and open free entry route. Competitions based on forecasting will be regulated as betting. Subject to any requirements arising from the European regulation on sales promotions, which is currently under discussion, the Bill will also provide for promotional prize draws.</p>

However, in terms of costs, if the amendments in relation to driving with uncorrected defective eyesight which were debated were to be accepted, drivers would be faced with bills for regular vision tests (the cost of these varies across the UK between &pound;10 and &pound;20) and with having to purchase two new pairs of spectacles or lenses whenever their prescription changed. The requirement for regular eyesight testing would generate a significant number of additional transactions at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and, given that the driver licensing system is required to be self-financing, the considerable cost involved in processing these would have to be met by all licence holders in higher licence application fees. The &quot;intrusion&quot; which my noble friend Lord McIntosh spoke of referred to the inconvenience that would be caused to the majority of drivers, who do not have defective eyesight and who would presumably be compelled to carry documentation confirming this.</p>
