	<p pid="a.103.8/1">Asylum and human rights claims by Zimbabwean nationals are considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). As with any other nationality, Zimbabweans who meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 convention are granted asylum. If they do not qualify for asylum, but there are other circumstances that make them particularly vulnerable and engage our obligations under the ECHR, they are granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave. If their application is refused, they have a right of appeal to the independent appellate authorities. In this way we ensure that we provide protection to those Zimbabweans who need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.8/2">Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information from a wide range of reliable sources, including international organisations, non-governmental organisations, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the media. Decisions are based on the specific circumstances of the individual concerned and, while we are aware of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' advice based on a general assessment of conditions in Zimbabwe, that does not mean that it would be unsafe for failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers to return to Zimbabwe. It is clear that there are Zimbabweans in need of international protection, and the asylum system will continue to provide that, but if an asylum and human rights claim is refused, and any appeal to the independent appellate authorities is unsuccessful, that means that it would be safe for that particular individual to return to Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.8/3">Voluntary returns have continued throughout the period when enforced returns were temporarily suspended. There is no evidence to suggest that voluntary returnees or those whose return has been enforced since the suspension was ended have suffered any mistreatment on return.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.2/1">The result of the audit that took place at Manchester in September 2004 was 95 per cent compliance with the Prison Service security standard. The result of the audit that took place at Wakefield in June 2004 was 92 per cent compliance with the same standard. The audits measure compliance with a standard range of key mandatory security practices and processes. The target level for compliance in high security prisons is 90 per cent and any non-compliances found are addressed immediately through a mandatory action planning process. There are no grounds for reducing high security standards in either prison and the complement of staff will reflect this.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">An interim review of the Criminal Cases Review Commission took place in January 2000. This review found no evidence to suggest that the CCRC was not managing its systems of control effectively, efficiently and economically. An assurance was provided to the departmental accounting officer that there were adequate and effective mechanisms in place for achieving good governance. The commission's accounting officer has also provided annual statements of systems assurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">For small NDPBs like the Criminal Cases Review Commission, there is no longer a requirement to undertake reviews every five years, nor is a minimum period stipulated. The Cabinet Office has issued new guidance for departments on how to conduct reviews. These vary according to the size and remit of the NDPB concerned but generally will aim to ensure that the NDPB is delivering high quality services efficiently and effectively and fits appropriately into the department's overall delivery structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/3">We are satisfied that the retention of the CCRC is justified and that the internal systems are satisfactory. The Home Office Select Committee is also satisfied that the CCRC is an effective organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/4">The management statement and financial memorandum are currently being reviewed and re-drafted and new versions will be published soon.

	<p pid="a.109.9/1">School improvement partners (SIPs) will be selected for their ability to analyse school performance and to help schools to improve. Within the framework of <i>Every Child Matters</i> they will help schools map out their future priorities for improvement, looking particularly at the attainment and progress of groups of pupils, including vulnerable pupils, such as children in local authority care. We expect SIPs to be serving and recent head teachers or other professionals with relevant experience who have met accreditation standards. Quality assurance of SIPs will be rigorous and they will be accredited only after they have successfully completed their training.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.5/1">Given that reprocessed fuel oil is produced from waste oil and remains waste until burnt as fuel, installations burning it have to be capable of complying with the stringent emission limits and other operating requirements specified in the Waste Incineration Directive (2000/76/EC) which are intended to prevent or limit as far as practicable negative effects on the environment from the incineration of waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/2">If operators of installations currently burning reprocessed fuel oil conclude that their installations do not meet those requirements, they have the option either of making improvements or of switching to a non-waste alternative fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/3">If they opt to switch, their installations generally will be subject to regulation under the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (or corresponding instruments in Scotland and Northern Ireland). Those regulations cover combustion installations with a rated thermal input of 20 megawatts or more and roadstone coating plants which are currently the main users of reprocessed fuel oil. The regulations require emission limits and other operating requirements to be set by the regulator for each installation based upon the application of best available techniques for pollution control and taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation, its location and the local environmental conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.3/1">This issue is dealt with in European Community legislation. Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 provides that land which is used to grow grass, and that is not included in the crop rotation of an agricultural holding for a period of five years or longer, is permanent pasture rather than arable land. However, if the land has been set aside under the old arable area payments scheme or the new single payment scheme during that period, it will be counted as arable land until it has been in grass for five years following the last year it was in set-aside.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.0/1">Decisions concerning maintenance works on local roads are the responsibility of the local highway authority. It must decide in each case the most appropriate way of carrying out any works, taking into account both the safety of the workforce and the safety of the public, for example, by providing safety clearances between working areas and traffic. Advice on a range of typical situations is provided in the Department's <i>Traffic Signs Manual</i>, chapter eight. Local authorities should carry out risk assessments for each situation. Other factors, including the disruption to traffic and bus services that may be caused by road closures or traffic restrictions, can be taken into account as part of that assessment when considering options for carrying out works.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.3/1">If it is necessary for a road to be closed or traffic restricted in order to carry out road works safely, the traffic authority should make a traffic order under Section 14 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to restrict or prohibit temporarily the use of the road. Under that section the authority must have regard to the existence of alternative routes suitable for the traffic which will be affected by the order. The enforcement of such orders is for the police.</p>
