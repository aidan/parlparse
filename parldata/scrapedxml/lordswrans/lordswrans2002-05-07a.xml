	<p pid="a.158.5/1">There have been two recent important developments. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-15">15 April 2002</phrase>, the UK publication Air Cargo News published an article which alleges that Victor Bout had been involved in the supply of an aircraft for Osama bin Laden in 1995. Prior to <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>, this aircraft had reportedly been frequently overflying Iran from Saudi Arabia to Kabul and Kandahar in Afghanistan. It is now reportedly parked at Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. We shall be asking that the United Nations investigate this very serious allegation as a matter of great importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/2">Following our past approaches to the UAE on the subject of Victor Bout, and the issuing of an international arrest warrant by the Belgian authorities, we are pleased to welcome a recent announcement by the Government of the United Arab Emirates. They have informed the United Nations Angola Monitoring Mechanism that Bout's companies, i.e. Air Cess and Trans Avia, have been prohibited from operating in the United Arab Emirates. He has also been banned from entering the United Arab Emirates personally.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/3">We hope that this increased international pressure on Bout will finally result in the end of his sanctions-busting activities and that he will be brought to justice. The UK has played a leading role in drawing international attention to Bout's illegal activities, initially in Angola and Liberia and more recently relating to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.5/1">Following successful discussions between officials from the Ministry of Defence, MoD trade unions and the prospective partnering companies, the MoD and the partnering companies have signed a joint statement of intent on the transfer of staff to the private sector under the warship support modernisation initiative. The joint statement of intent gives assurances that current terms and conditions, including redundancy provisions, will transfer in full in compliance with the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations and the MoD TUPE code of practice. New pension arrangements, broadly comparable to those currently enjoyed under the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme, will be offered to those who transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/2">The partnering companies have stated their intention to achieve any changes to pay and conditions of employment through consultation and negotiation. It is also their intention to achieve any job reductions that may arise through natural wastage and voluntary means to avoid compulsory redundancies. The companies confirm their commitment to work fully with the recognised trade unions after the transfer. These assurances are set out in full in the joint statement of intent, a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.2/1">Our overseas posts have standing instructions to report on allegations of misuse of any UK-origin defence equipment to take into account in the licensing process. Detailed guidance notes are provided to posts and FCO officials involved in licensing in London to help decide when to carry out end-use checks and to outline the kinds of questions that these checks should address. This advice applies to defence attach&eacute;s as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/2">We focus our efforts on assessment of potential end-use at the export licensing stage. Carrying out effective risk assessment on end-users before making the export licensing decision is the surest way to prevent UK arms falling into the wrong hands. We assess all export licence applications on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria in accordance with Criterion 7. In accordance with that criterion we will not issue an export licence where there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to an undesirable end-user.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/3">The Government nevertheless remain committed to carrying out end-use monitoring in those circumstances where this will genuinely add value to our efforts to minimise the risk of misuse and diversion and where such monitoring is practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/4">The Government have introduced a number of safeguards in order to minimise the risk of diversion and those measures are under constant review. We can not disclose details of our safeguards or possible diversion to undesirable end users as much of the information is obtained from sensitive sources. Janice</p>

	<p pid="a.162.5/1">The Government are committed to addressing the problems caused by explosive remnants of war. In international discussions, we are ready to explore steps to facilitate and make more effective the clearance of unexploded ordnance. We support the development of a new protocol to the Convention on Conventional Weapons. But we are not convinced that a legal responsibility on the user is the best approach for a protocol. Legal responsibility is unlikely to be acceptable to countries unable to carry out or pay for post-conflict clearance. Moreover, it is not clear how such an obligation would apply when there are multiple parties to a conflict, or how the user would be identified in all cases. The practical and legal implications of this recommendation are thus wide-ranging and need to be considered fully.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.0/1">Business must be responsible for taking appropriate measures to minimise the risk of disruption or damage arising from information security breaches. Government can and do help in specific ways. The Cabinet Office is taking the lead on ensuring that the Government's own services and systems are suitably protected and work in partnership with the private sector to develop solutions that work with the grain of the market. The Home Office has established NISCC (National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre) to work with the owners of the critical systems in government and the private sector to ensure their resilience. The DTI has for many years sought to increase awareness of information security as an important business enabler. In the past two weeks we have released the latest in our series of surveys on information security. These surveys help government, businesses and suppliers assess the response to the challenge of information security. The DTI has also been involved in the development of best practice and works in partnership with business on several projects to promote best practice. To this end, it is embarking on a new project to better take the message to SMEs through the UK Online for Business programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.6/1">Essentially, the TSE (England) Regulations 2002 seek to implement Community measures against TSEs set out in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. This relates to all animal and public health risks resulting from animal TSEs, covering the whole chain of production and the placing on the market and export of live animals and products of animal origin.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.6/2">Of course the Government wish to ensure that the Community rules are fully reflected in national law. The TSE (England) Regulations 2002 therefore revoke and replace much of the previous national legislation and provide powers and penalties in order effectively to administer and enforce the Community measures in England. However, the regulations do not cover export trade aspects of the Community rules. These are covered by appropriate transitional measures, mirroring existing domestic legislation, until decisions can be taken on the BSE status of individual member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.6/1">The Government are advised on matters of food safety by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The FSA has alerted the Spanish veterinary authorities to the discovery of spinal cord in meat which originated in Spain and has asked those authorities to investigate the incident and to notify the FSA of the action being taken to prevent a recurrence. The FSA has also notified the European Commission, which is responsible for ensuring that member states fulfil their obligations under European Union rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.6/2">On instructions from the FSA, the Meat Hygiene Service is continuing to check every consignment of imported carcass beef arriving at licensed meat plants in Great Britian for the presence of specified risk material. Similar instructions have been issued to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland in respect of imported consignments arriving at licensed meat plants there. jenny</p>

	<p pid="a.168.2/1">The Independent Television Commission and the BBC notified the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry in February 2002 of their decision to adopt a change in the assumptions used in planning the digital television transmission networks which will permit a significant increase in the strength of transmissions, with adequate safeguards, of course, to protect the quality of the existing analogue signals and the television signals broadcast by neighbouring countries for their domestic consumption. The Radiocommunications Agency will seek to reach agreements with neighbouring administrations for the use of these higher power transmissions where there is a risk of interference with services in other countries. The implementation of plans to increase the strength of digital terrestrial television transmissions is therefore a matter for the broadcasters.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.5/1">Since November 2001 the Government Secure Intranet (GSI) provides a single virus checking service for e-mail coming into government. This scans all e-mails, identifying suspect items as potential viruses and preventing them being received (where traditional virus checkers would rely on regular updates to identify new viruses). This means that new viruses such as BadTrans are identified when they first appear, where other virus checkers would let them through. In the first two months, more than 22,700 viruses were prevented from reaching government departments and several instances of the BadTrans virus were stopped before it was even realised there was a threat. It is currently stopping one e-mail in every 250 received as containing a virus.</p>
