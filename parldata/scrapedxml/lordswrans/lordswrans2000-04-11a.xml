At the Istanbul OSCE Summit in November 1999, all OSCE states, including Russia, recognised that the OSCE had a role in assisting with a political settlement. The UK has been active in urging international involvement. Mr Putin has assured the Prime Minister that Russia will permit access to Chechnya by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNCHR) and by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe. The visit by the UNCHR, Mary Robinson, is expected to take place on 1-<phrase class="date" code="2000-04-04">4 April</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">Under a formula agreed in 1992, our contributions to the European Community's external assistance programmes absorb approximately 30 per cent. of the Department for International Development's budget. In December 1998, we published a strategy for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of European Community development programmes in order to increase their impact on our poverty reduction objectives. Since then, and in line with UK aims, the number of Commissioners responsible for external spending has been reduced from five to two. The successor to the Lome Convention has been agreed with a much sharper poverty focus and the Commission has tabled a draft development policy statement. Both the Development Commissioner, Poul Nielson, and the External Relations Commissioner, Chris Patten, have stated their commitment to poverty elimination. They and Vice-President Neil Kinnock are reviewing procedures with a view to thorough reforms. We support and encourage them to carry this through urgently.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">I have today published 'Making Changes--The Future of the Public Trust Office', setting out my plans for reform of the Public Trust Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/2">The Public Trust Office, an executive agency of my department, was established in 1994. It incorporates three separate functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/3">Its Mental Health Sector deals with matters under Part VII of the Mental Health Act 1983. The Sector's Protection Division oversees the activities of private receivers appointed by the Court of Protection to manage financial affairs for mentally incapacitated individuals. Its Receivership Division manages the financial affairs of mentally incapacitated people who have no one else to manage their finances. The sector also deals with matters under the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/4">The Court Funds Office is a banking and investment service for funds deposited in court. These are held under the jurisdiction of the Chief Executive of the Public Trust Office, acting as Accountant General of the Supreme Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/5">The Public Trustee acts as an executor or trustee in respect of estates and settlements.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/6">In November 1999, I published the quinquennial review of the Public Trust Office. I welcomed the review's clear diagnosis of the challenges faced by the Public Trust Office, agreed that radical change was required and undertook to explore the review's recommendations in a programme of change.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/7">The change programme for the Public Trust Office, announced today, will improve services received by clients and, in particular, the vulnerable. The Government's overriding objective will be to ensure that the interests of the Public Trust Office's clients are fully protected. The changes I propose will deliver a step-change in the quality of services. This will be achieved through centralised planning and monitoring, balanced by service delivery through those agencies which are best placed to meet the needs of clients. Where this means estabishing new partnerships with the private and voluntary sectors, we will do this. Throughout the reforms, we will target resources on those clients who are most in need.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/8">I will separate the disparate functions of the existing Public Trust Office, transferring the trust function and the Court Funds Office to the bodies best placed to provide them: the office of the Official Solicitor to the Supreme Court and the Court Service respectively. The office's remaining core functions of oversight of receivers and functions in relation to enduring powers of attorney will be reviewed to provide a cohesive and greatly improved service.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/9">I will ensure that I retain responsibility for the most vulnerable of Public Trust Office clients. There will be clear lines of ministerial accountability for those functions remaining within my department and I will establish and monitor clear standards of service provision both for those functions remaining within my department and for those services provided in future by other parts of the public sector and in the voluntary and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/10">I will want to be satisfied that reform does not entail placing a greater financial burden on some of the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. The new regime will deliver much improved value for money. Services received will be tailored to the individual's requirements; there will be much greater advice and assistance available; and it will genuinely protect the vulnerable. A new clearer and simpler fee system will be introduced and will be backed by the introduction of fee remissions for those who cannot afford to pay for the services they receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/11">I envisage that plans for the more significant changes proposed will be taken forward during 2000-01 with the intention that the Public Trust Office would cease to exist as a separate and distinct office from April 2001 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/12">The change programme reforms to the Public Trust Office will also play an important part in paving the way for the Government. Making Decisions policy proposals to modernise and clarify the law governing decision-making by and on behalf of the mentally incapacitated. The Governmetn are committed to legislating on Making Decisions when parliamentary time allows, and the change programme will provide a firm basis for these reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/13">I welcome the views of all those who wish to comment on the reforms that I propose to take forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/14">Copies of the booklet: Making Changes--The Future of The Public Trust Office have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

A recall policy was not considered justified for plasma derived products from plasma pools incorporating a donation implicated for classical CJD. It reaffirmed that advice in March 1997. CPMP concluded on the basis of currently available information from epidemiological and experimental studies that there is no scientific justification for changing from the current CPMP position on classical CJD. CPMP further stated there to be no evidence that classical CJD is transmitted via blood or plasma derived products. This issue was also subsequently considered by the US Food and Drugs Administration, which came to the same conclusion.</p>

The report considers the significance of gender differences and looks at ways of involving young people more as policies are developed.

	<p pid="a.40.0/1">We understand from the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company that the overall capital cost for construction of the E-way scheme would be &pound;15.6 million. Vehicle costs for the intitial fleet were estimated at &pound;8.4 million. Cost data were derived from a variety of sources by W S Atkins Consultants Ltd. The Government have made no decision on this scheme. However, given the current financial resources available for public transport in Northern Ireland, there are currently no plans to proceed.</p>
