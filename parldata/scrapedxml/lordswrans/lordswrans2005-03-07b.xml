The procurement practices of DfID and the government of Montserrat are regularly reviewed to ensure effectiveness and value for money.

	<p pid="b.57.2/1">Working through its mission to the UN in New York, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) co-operates closely with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) on the role civilian policing plays in UN peace support operations (PSOs). Already a key element of PSOs, we are working proactively to ensure civilian policing needs are considered at all stages of the establishment of a mission, including pre-mission needs assessment, definition and development of mandates, intelligence gathering, rapid deployment&mdash;on which we await further information on the DPKO's proposal to establish a standing civilian policing capability and pre-deployment training. In particular, we strongly support the DPKO's efforts to develop integrated mission planning, combining three closely interconnected pillars of the criminal justice system&mdash;police, judiciary and penal institutions. To that end, a UK secondee to the DPKO helped in the development of a handbook on integrated planning last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.2/2">At an operational level, the UK contributes police officers to two UN missions, with 93 officers currently deployed to UNMIK (Kosovo) and six to UNAMSIL (Sierra Leone). Building on our commitment to the 2000 Brahimi Report on Peacekeeping Operations, we support the development of other member states' international civilian policing capability, and have to date delivered 11 &quot;Train the Trainer&quot; courses around the world. We are also in the process of developing a G8 initiative to help build African civilian policing capability. In addition, we continue to play an active role in the development and delivery of civilian police standardised training module workshops to assist in the training of military and police officers who are likely to serve in specialised functions in PSOs.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.2/3">As far as the UK's own civilian policing contribution is concerned, the FCO is leading cross-Whitehall and Police Service consultation aimed at improving the UK's approach to international policing, and better prioritising and strengthening our response to calls for contributions from the UN and other international organisations. A strategic task force is expected to submit recommendations to Ministers in July 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.0/1">We support the work of the high level panel, and welcome the emphasis given to human rights issues. In particular, we welcome the proposals to improve links between the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Security Council/Peacebuilding Commission, and to increase the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights' funding from the regular budget. On the other recommendations, our position is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/2">Universalising membership of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR): this could potentially remove accusations of lack of representation, and the need for divisive elections. But we are not convinced it would address issues of legitimacy. And we would need to consider how this would work in practice, to ensure it would not have a counter-productive effect on the overall handling of human rights in the UN system.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/3">Human rights figures to head CHR delegations: we agree with the principle that there should be human rights expertise throughout CHR delegations. However, it is for governments to send who they wish&mdash;many governments will wish to keep their head of delegation as a government representative.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/4">Advisory council or panel to advise the CHR on country-specific issues and thematic mandates: the UK would like to see more detail on this. It would be important that this does not duplicate the current CHR sub-commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/5">The Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights' annual report on the situation of human rights worldwide: we welcome the aim of providing a neutral and objective basis for discussion at the CHR. However, this should not be seen as a substitute for country action, but an objective basis on which the UN can choose to take action.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.6/1">The recent report of the United Nations Secretary-General's high level panel has recommended the deletion of the provision for a military staff committee in Article 47 of the United Nations Charter. The Government would support this change as part of a package of amendments to the United Nations charter, as the staff committee has never functioned as envisaged.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.6/2">The United Nations charter gives the Secretary-General the power to bring matters to the attention of the Security Council where he believes that there is a threat to international peace and security. He also provides analysis to the council of situations which are already on its agenda. It is clearly vital that the secretariat should have the capability to provide accurate analysis to the Secretary-General to underpin these responsibilities. The High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change recommended that the secretariat's capacity should be strengthened in this area, and that responsibility for such analysis and information should rest with a second Deputy Secretary-General. We support the panel's view that the secretariat's performance in this area could be strengthened, and we look forward to the Secretary-General's response in his report on implementing the high level panel's recommendations in March.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.0/1">These criteria are similar to those set out by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in his speech in Chicago in 1999. We support the development of such principles as a tool to assist the Security Council in deciding when to authorise the use of force. We also note that the high level panel identifies that the Security Council needs to be more proactive in dealing with threats and that in certain circumstances force may be justified not just reactively, but preventively.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.6/1">The Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is still under negotiation. Like most other members of the working group, the UK has a number of concerns with the original text. Only two out of 64 articles of the original text have been agreed, and there are alternative proposals on the table for much of the remaining text. The issue has therefore been one of discussion and negotiation, not signature. However, we were encouraged by the progress made in negotiations in the September and November/December 2004 working group sessions. We will continue to work with UN partners and indigenous representatives to reach agreement on a strong and meaningful declaration.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.0/1">Football disorder will not be tolerated. Tough legislation is in place and targeted and public order policing operations will continue to identify troublemakers for banning order purposes. The Home Office works closely with the police, football authorities and fans in taking forward a comprehensive multi-agency strategy designed to minimise the threat of English football disorder at home and overseas. That strategy is working and football stadia in England and Wales are now among the safest and most secure in the world. There was a 10 per cent. decrease in the number of football related arrests last season with, on average, fewer than two arrests inside and outside of grounds at each match. Statistics for the current season show a continuing decline in the number of football-related arrests and incidents. However, there is no complacency. Football disorder may have been marginalised but it has not been eradicated. Clearly some matches pose a higher than average degree of risk due to local and other rivalries. These matches are easy to predict and there is nothing to suggest that the level of risk is significantly increased by media coverage.</p>

Information on member states on which we have information is detailed in the following table.

	<p pid="b.71.3/2">The EU has already made clear its determination to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. We support this and believe that it will make a Cyprus settlement more likely, less costly and easier to consolidate&mdash;something that is undoubtedly in the interests of all Cypriots.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/3">The Government's objective remains the reunification of Cyprus, and we continue to support all efforts to achieve this aim in a manner that is fair, viable and lasting for the benefit of all Cypriots.

During our EU presidency, we will co-chair any sub-committees that fall under our presidency with the Commission.
