	<p pid="a.283.5/1">The published peer reviewed evidence is of sufficient quality and quantity to recognise a statistical association between exposure to Agent Orange and chronic lymphatic leukaemia, soft tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chloracne. There is limited evidence of an association with respiratory cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma and porphyria cutanea tarda. Limited evidence means that the studies are not consistent in outcome and that the possibility that the findings might be due to chance or bias cannot be ruled out. These associations have only been recognised in heavily exposed populations. Currently, the scientific evidence does not support the conclusion that associations between exposures and adverse health effects are causal.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.5/2">Since 2005, MoD officials have been in regular contact with the Canadian authorities on the facts surrounding the spraying of Agent Orange at Gagetown in 1966 and 1967. We have followed closely the Canadian Government's initiative announced in August 2005. This had three main tasks: first, to establish those present, including foreign military units, at Gagetown since 1952 and including in 1966 and 1967; secondly, to review the history and science of herbicide spraying; and thirdly, to assess the health risks from the herbicides based on the products used and likely exposure dose. Much of this work has been reported or final reports are awaited.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.5/3">Scrutiny of the published peer reviewed evidence on Agent Orange and its adverse health effects has been carried out by MoD officials. The Canadian authorities have provided information on UK units present at Gagetown in 1966 and 1967 and details of locations and areas sprayed and of weather conditions. Findings of the Canadian study so far are that the exposure to Agent Orange resulting from normal activities during 1966 and 1967 was very low and unlikely to increase risk of adverse health. We will continue to monitor results emerging from the Canadian project.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.6/1">We welcome Ofcom's announcement on tightening the rules on broadcast advertising of food and drink to protect children from encouragement to eat foods high in fat, salt and sugar. This is a complex area and Ofcom has sought to strike a balance, which protects the health of our children but also considers the impact on our broadcasting industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.6/2">Parliament has placed clear duties on Ofcom to ensure that any regulatory interventions they propose must be proportionate, appropriately targeted and soundly based on evidence of impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.6/3">Under this package of measures, in households where children's viewing includes a large number of programmes targeted at adults as well as programmes for children and young people, children under 16 would see 41 per cent fewer high fat, salt and sugar foods and drinks advertisements. For under-9s, the reduction would be 51 per cent. This represents a significant reduction, which Ofcom has deemed proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.6/4">Ofcom's new rules will be fully implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase> at the same time as new Committee on Advertising Practice restrictions for non-broadcast media.</p>

The department will conduct an interim review in 2007, we will undertake a more detailed review in 2008. On that basis, the Government will decide whether future action, through new (for non-broadcast) or existing legislation, is required.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.5/1">Published national statistics include all offences of rape that are recorded as crimes by police, including cases where the victim has reported to the police and been examined at a sexual assault referral centre. They exclude cases that are &quot;no crimed&quot; because they meet one of the following criteria:(i) there is additional verifiable information that a crime did not take place;(ii) the crime was committed outside the jurisdication of the recording force; (iii) the crime constitutes part of a crime already recorded; or (iv) the reported incident was recorded as a crime in error. Each sexual assault referral centre (SARC) operates according to local protocols with respect to how anonymous third-party referrals are reported to the police. We are currently working with the national SARC steering group to develop a consistent approach to crime recording in these circumstances.</p>

However, following the no votes in France and the Netherlands, there is at present no consensus among member states on the future of the Constitutional Treaty. The way forward will be discussed at the European Council in June. The Government make no presumption as to the outcome of those discussions. My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe made a Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December 2006</phrase> regarding the UK's approach to these discussions. This remains the Government's position (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-12-05.10"><I>Official Report</I>, cols. WS10-11</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="a.296.8/1">We welcome the decision to appoint Cape Verde as vice president of the World Food Programme. At a time when the devastating agricultural policies of the Mugabe regime have led to a great many of its own population requiring food aid, it would have been particularly inappropriate for Zimbabwe to be elected to this position.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.8/2">We will continue, as we have done up to now, to give food aid through the World Food Programme to those most in need, including in Zimbabwe.</p>
