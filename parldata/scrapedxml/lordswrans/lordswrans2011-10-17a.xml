	<p pid="a.1.2/1">The Government want to see more children in care adopted, where this is in their best interests, particularly those who in the past may have been overlooked-children who are older or have disabilities or very complex needs. We want local authorities to look very critically at their practice in respect of children who wait longest, such as black children, disabled children, older children and larger sibling groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">To help drive change and steer a programme of reform, the Government set up last year a ministerial advisory group on adoption. We have already published revised statutory adoption guidance, which makes clear that the primary consideration for local authorities must be whether the prospective adopters can meet all or most of the child's needs. It is plainly unacceptable for a child to be denied loving adoptive parents solely on the grounds that the child and prospective adopters do not share the same background.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">We also published, in March, an adoption data pack to help local authorities challenge and review their practices and outcomes, and to highlight the variations in outcomes between local authorities. In July the Government appointed Martin Narey, former chief executive of Barnardo's, as ministerial adviser on adoption. He is now visiting individual local authorities to identify and share good practice, and to challenge poorer practices. His remit specifically includes offering advice on how to reduce waiting times for black children in need of adoption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">Special guardianship orders were introduced in 2005 to provide another form of permanence for children who cannot live with their birth parents but for whom adoption may not be appropriate. This is particularly relevant for older children and children from some ethnic and minority communities who may have cultural and religious difficulties with adoption. The number of special guardianship orders has increased from 1,290 in 2010 to 1,740 this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.0/1">The Independent Commission on Banking (ICB) proposed that UK banks, defined as globally systemically important (G-SIBs) and large ring-fenced banks, should be required to have primary loss absorbing capacity (PLAC)-made up of capital and long-term unsecured debt that is subject to a bail-in power recommended by the ICB-to be applied on a sliding scale and in the following way.<sup>1</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/2">UK G-SIBs with a 2.5 per cent G-SIB surcharge, and ring-fenced banks with a ratio of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to UK GDP of 3 per cent or more, should be required to have a PLAC equal to at least 17 per cent of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/3">UK G-SIBS with a G-SIB surcharge below 2.5 per cent, and ring-fenced banks with a ratio of RWAs to UK GDP of 1 to 3 per cent, should be required to have a primary loss absorbing capacity set by a sliding scale from 10.5 to 17 per cent of RWAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/4">Under the ICB's recommendations, the PLAC requirements would be applied at group level, meaning that subordinated and senior unsecured debt issued by overseas subsidiaries would count towards this requirement if it is capital or can be bailed in under the power recommended by the ICB. However, the ICB also recommended that PLAC requirements be applied to UK-domiciled banks that are part of UK G-SIBs at a solo level, meaning that a ring-fenced bank that is part of a UK G-SIB would need to meet its own PLAC requirements on a standalone basis (though these could count towards the bank's group PLAC requirement).</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/5">The Government have welcomed, in principle, the recommendations brought forward by the ICB and will provide a full response by the end of this year. As part of this, the Government will consider the appropriate division of responsibilities within the proposed new regulatory architecture.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/6">The European Commission consulted in January on proposals for an EU crisis management framework, covering a range of preventive powers, early intervention and resolution tools (including an EU-wide bail-in regime). The Government expect the Commission to publish a draft directive proposal on crisis management later this year. The Government will consider the relevant interactions between the ICB's recommendations and any contained within the EU crisis management framework once it is adopted by the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/7">A list of G-SIBs, and recommendations for additional regulatory capital above the Basel III baseline that they should be required to hold (the G-SIB surcharge referred to above), is currently being developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. These recommendations are due to be presented to the G20 for agreement later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.8/1">The Government committed in the coalition agreement to introduce stronger consumer protections, including measures to end unfair bank and financial transaction charges. The Government are putting this into action through the joint Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and HM Treasury consumer credit and personal insolvency review. In July 2011, the Government published a summary of responses to the call for evidence to the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.8/2">The call for evidence found that there have been significant developments in the market in recent years. As part of the Office of Fair Trading's work, banks have committed to introduce measures to improve the transparency of unarranged overdraft charges and many have also revised their charging structures in the last two years. This has already led to some reductions-the average unpaid item charge has fallen by more than half from &#163;35 in 2007 to &#163;14 in 2010. However, responses to the call for evidence showed that there are still serious concerns about how charges, including the new charging structure, affect consumers, particularly where charges may be not be clear or transparent enough.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.2/1">The extradition of Mr Bat Khurts to Germany under a European arrest warrant was the subject of the usual judicial process that is conducted by the courts entirely independent of Government. During these proceedings the conduct of UK officials including the then ambassador to Mongolia was considered by the court, which concluded that no UK officials had acted unlawfully or improperly in any way. The findings of the court are published at: <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2029.html">http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2029.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">It was the German judicial authorities, rather than the German Government, that initiated the extradition process and would take forward proceedings in Germany. Accordingly it was the German judicial authorities that instructed the Crown Prosecution Service to act on their behalf in the proceedings in this country. Whilst it is not for the UK Government to speak for the German judicial authorities, it is a reasonable assumption that if they had not intended to pursue the proceedings they would not have pursued the extradition proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/3">Khurts's detention in no way amounted to a diplomatic or political statement by the UK Government. The judicial authorities, which are wholly independent of Government, carried out their independent legal functions in accordance with the law. This case has had no impact on the Government's desire to strengthen bilateral relations with Mongolia.</p>

Indicators of progress include: the establishment of a study panel in the Japanese Ministry of Justice to consider the death penalty; the media being given access to the execution chamber; and no executions in Japan for over a year. Furthermore, the recent statement by the new Justice Minister Hideo Hiraoka that he does not intend to approve any executions for the time being while discussions on the issue are ongoing is particularly welcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.6/1">The information will be placed in the Library of the House, with the exception of the information on students' first degree, which is not available. At present there are no course subject categorisations available to report by within the Student Loans Company (SLC) data.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.6/2">Student loans taken out since <phrase class="date" code="1998-09-01">1 September 1998</phrase> have income-contingent repayment where borrowers repay at a rate of 9 per cent of earnings above &#163;15,000. This is usually collected either by employers alongside income tax and national insurance contributions, or through the tax self-assessment system for those who are self-employed. It is not normally possible to default on these repayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.6/3">Where a borrower moves abroad, repayments are made direct to the SLC. From 2009 the SLC began to take action against those borrowers who moved overseas and did not provide the SLC with adequate information to allow the processing of repayments. Those borrowers who have moved abroad and fail to respond to the SLC will have default repayments automatically scheduled. This enables borrowers to be placed in arrears so that legal action may be brought against them to enforce the debt. This necessary change in the process has led to an increase in the number of borrowers residing overseas who are in arrears. It should be noted that the figures include UK borrowers who have moved overseas after completing their studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.6/4">Borrowers with older mortgage-style loans repay instalments to the SLC, usually through direct debit, when their annual income exceeds the repayment threshold (currently &#163;27,734, equivalent to &#163;2,311 per month). Borrowers can apply to defer for 12-month periods if their income is below this threshold. Unless a borrower is either repaying or deferring, they are in arrears and therefore in default of their credit agreement. The SLC takes a number of steps to trace borrowers who are not repaying and to bring their accounts into order, and-as a last resort-will take cases to court. Exceptions are made for some vulnerable borrowers.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.5/1">The Kimberley process certification scheme (KPCS) was established to tackle the problem of rebel groups financing conflict through the sale of rough diamonds. Thanks to the KP, conflict diamonds now represent less than 1 per cent of the global trade in rough diamonds, compared with 15 per cent in the 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.5/2">The Government Diamond Office (GDO), based in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, is responsible for overseeing UK implementation of the KPCS in the UK. The UK is represented in the Kimberley process by the European Commission (EC). UK officials work closely with EC officials and other EU member states, participate in quarterly EU meetings in Brussels, and regularly attend Kimberley process meetings in support of the EU delegation. UK officials frequently discuss the Kimberley process and areas of specific concern such as Zimbabwe with other KPCS participating states. The GDO regularly meets representatives from the UK diamond industry, trade associations and civil society groups to discuss the KPCS. The next Kimberley process meeting is scheduled to take place in Kinshasa from <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-31">31 October</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-03">3 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.5/3">Since 2008 when serious violence erupted around the newly discovered diamond mines in the Marange region, Zimbabwe has repeatedly failed to implement measures to bring it into compliance with KPCS minimum standards. Following the KP intersessional meeting in June 2011 the UK has been working with the EU to broker a robust agreement on the export of Marange diamonds in order to maintain the credibility and effectiveness of the KP. The UK, working with the EU, is looking at ways to reform the KP to ensure it remains a credible and effective mechanism. The UK supports reform of the KP that would enable it to take human rights abuses by states more explicitly into consideration.</p>

The GDO also has its own page on the FCO website, containing information on the KPCS and conflict diamonds.

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.31.3/14">The revision of &#163;1,233 million to central government net borrowing was driven by a &#163;1.640 million revision to income tax data. This revision was due to the inclusion of an accrual adjustment between 2010-11 and earlier years, which related to repayments and recoveries identified through the introduction of HMRC's National Insurance and PAYE service (NPS). There was an offsetting downward revision of &#163;450 million to central government net investment. About half of this revision related to revised data on capital grants to the private sector and half to revised data on the acquisition and disposal of fixed capital assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/15">The revision of &#163;4.156 million to local government net borrowing was driven by the replacement of budget forecast data by provisional outturn data. The largest revisions within these data were a downward revision of &#163;1,963 million to current expenditure on goods and services and a &#163;1,417 million downward revision to the net acquisition of fixed capital assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/16">The Department for Communities and Local Government has recently introduced the Quarterly Revenue Outturn (QRO) data collection for English local authorities. The first quarterly dataset from this collection was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-28">28 September 2011</phrase>, and these and future QRO data will be used by ONS to inform the calculation of local government net borrowing. It is anticipated that the availability of this new data source will reduce the size of revisions to local government net borrowing at the point that provisional outturn data for the full financial year become available.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/17">However, the monthly frequency of the public sector finances bulletin means that initial estimates of net borrowing will always be liable to revision as new and more comprehensive information sources become available.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/6">In National Accounts the Bank of England is classified as a public financial corporation, and is in the public sector but it is not part of general government.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/7">The gilts purchased are treated as assets of the Bank of England and the central bank reserves that are created to pay for them as its liabilities. The gilts purchased remain as government liabilities For technical reasons, there is a small (in the context of the overall total) effect on public sector net debt, even though the value of assets purchased are matched by the liabilities created to pay for them. First, the gilts are purchased by the Bank of England at the prevailing market price, but by convention are recorded in the public sector finances at their nominal price. Secondly, interest payments flow from Government to the Bank and are therefore transfers within the public sector (whereas previously they left the public sector altogether). These interest flows also serve to reduce public sector net borrowing</p>
