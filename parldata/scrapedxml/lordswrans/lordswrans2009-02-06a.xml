Part 2 states that taking &quot;default&quot; enforcement action, under Section 178 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, can be extremely traumatic for vulnerable residents in a site such as the elderly and that careful thought needs to be given to ensuring that action taken to restore a site to its original state is proportionate and considered. <I>Guidance on Managing Unauthorised Camping </I>states that, where bailiffs or other agencies and contractors are employed to take such enforcement action, a code of expected behaviour should be drawn up.

	<p pid="a.155.3/1">This is a devolved matter. The Government are aware of the development of the modernised right to buy in Scotland. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 introduced a new Scottish secure tenancy (SST). Existing tenants with the right to buy (RTB) whose tenancies were converted to SSTs retained the RTB on the same terms and conditions (commonly referred to as preserved RTB entitlements). People taking up new tenancies created after introduction of the SST are entitled to a modernised RTB.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/2">Under the 2001 Act, local authorities in Scotland can apply to Scottish Ministers to have pressured areas designated. To justify designation, local need for social rented housing must be substantially in excess of the local stock, and it must be demonstrable that matters are likely to be worsened by tenants exercising the RTB. Twelve pressured area designations have so far been made in 11 local authority areas since October 2005. In all these cases, the pressured area is a part of the local authority area only. Within these pressured areas, the RTB is suspended for tenants with modernised RTB entitlements for up to 5 years, which can be extended. Tenants with preserved RTB entitlements are unaffected.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.3/1">The Number 10 e-petitions system was established as a means for facilitating greater engagement with the public, giving them an opportunity to make their views known to the Government. They are not referenda and are in no way a legislative substitute for Parliament. An e-petition has no legal status, however to protect the service from abuse petitions must satisfy some basic terms and conditions. The terms and conditions are set out on the website at: <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/terms">http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/terms</a>. 50,000 petitions have been received since creation.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.6/1">Lavatories provided for public use in private developments are covered by disability discrimination legislation, which requires that reasonable adjustments be made to enable disabled people to access those services. In addition, the British Standard BS8300 (Design of buildings and their approaches to meet the needs of disabled people &mdash; Code of Practice) states that &quot;where turnstiles or other similar forms of access control, e.g. those with rotating arms, are used, a complementary side-hung gate should be installed to provide access for wheelchair users and people with limited mobility&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.6/2">These provisions aim to ensure that, where turnstiles are used, alternative access, or access to alternative facilities, is available to people with limited mobility.</p>
