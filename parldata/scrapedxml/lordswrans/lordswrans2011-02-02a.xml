We understand that the carrier concerned intends to appeal this ruling through the Spanish legal system and we do not propose to comment on it. Pending determination of any such appeal, the carrier can continue with its policy of charging passengers for printing boarding passes.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/2">Passengers should always ensure, prior to booking, that they are aware of airline check in policies, along with any fees or charges that may apply. They can then decide whether to proceed with a booking or choose an alternative carrier.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.8/1">It is not possible to monitor the impact of changes in bus subsidy, concessionary travel reimbursement or local authority funding in isolation. Any changes to the level of services, the cost of bus fares, or the number of deregistrations will reflect wider influences, including commercial decisions by operators and, where appropriate, local authority priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.8/2">The Department for Transport already publishes national statistics on annual bus service mileage, passenger journey numbers and a local bus fares index. We plan to continue to publish these statistics in future years. The number of applications for new registrations and variations processed and accepted, and the number of registrations cancelled is published annually in the Traffic Commissioners' annual report. However, bus deregistration figures alone would not be an accurate way of monitoring impacts in service provision, as it does not give any indication of why services have been deregistered. Indeed, a service may be deregistered only to be re-registered under a different operator.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.8/3">We have regular discussions with the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents the bus industry, as well as the Local Government Association and the Passenger Transport Executive Group. They all provide a strategic overview of the impacts of any change.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.3/1">The load factors for operationally metered wind farms were lower in December than annual average load factors recorded since 2006, probably due to unusually low wind speeds in December relative to the previous decade. However, this is not outside our expectations. Whilst UK onshore and offshore wind averaged load factors of 27.6 per cent and 31.1 per cent respectively from 2006 to 2009, wind is an inherently variable resource of energy, with variations in output, both up and down, experienced from month to month as well as over shorter periods. DECC's analysis of supply capacity and projections of the growth of wind energy take into account the need for, and cost of, back-up capacity.</p>

The Department for International Development (DfID) funds non-governmental organisations (NGOs) through a range of channels, including some in Kenya from the bilateral aid budget, some from centrally managed funds and some from multilateral aid, in particular through the EU. Furthermore, a criterion for the centrally managed Civil Society Challenge Fund is that DfID can only fund UK-based organisations, which can then spend money through an implementing partner in-country-there is thus no direct funding to Kenyan NGOs through this channel, but some indirect funding. We do not hold disaggregated data on how much each NGO in receipt of UK funds spends in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.8/2">DfID is now starting to publish its projects database (<a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>) which will have increasing levels of detail of all our expenditure, including through NGOs.

	<p pid="a.277.6/1">The Government are aware that the announcements on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-11">11 March 2010</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-20">20 December 2010</phrase>, confirming the preferred route for consultation on a new high-speed rail line, have had an effect on the value of properties in close proximity to the proposed line of route. This effect is the result of the market's perception of the potential impacts of the railway should it be taken forward as proposed. The Government are actively seeking to mitigate the potential impacts on people's homes and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.6/2">The Secretary of State for Transport is committed to providing fair compensation for people who suffer a significant diminution in the value of their property as a result of the proximity of any line. It is right and proper that individuals who suffer serious financial loss in the national interest should be compensated, and the Government believe it to be appropriate that, for an infrastructure scheme of the potential scale and longevity of HS2, compensation beyond the requirements of statute should be considered. This is in line with the approach taken on other recent infrastructure projects such as High Speed 1 and Crossrail.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.6/3">In determining the scope of any compensation package, the Government will need to consider how best to strike a fair balance between the public interest and the rights of the individual, consistent with its legal obligations and developing case law. The Government will provide more information about its proposed compensation package as part of the public consultation on high-speed rail which is due to begin in February 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.278.2/1">One of the intentions of the English Baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history. Classical civilisation was not included in the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate for the 2010 performance tables because the historical element of the course was not judged sufficient. Ancient history focuses on history and so counts towards the history element of the English Baccalaureate. We will however be taking on board comments about the English Baccalaureate measure and reviewing the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 performance tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.2/2">For the 2010 performance tables only GCSEs or accredited iGCSEs counted towards the English Baccalaureate measure. The WJEC certificates in Latin are not currently accredited as either a GCSE or an iGCSE and so were not included in the 2010 performance tables English Baccalaureate measure. In the longer term we will draw up criteria that qualifications will have to meet to be included in the EBacc, which may allow qualifications other than GCSEs or iGCSEs to count towards the EBacc.</p>
