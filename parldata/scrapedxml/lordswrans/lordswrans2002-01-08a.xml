The Abuja text sets out clear benchmarks on the rule of law, ending political violence and intimidation and promoting basic human rights. The Government of Zimbabwe's scant regard for their commitments have damaged Abuja's credibility. But the continued engagement of the UN development programme on land reform&mdash;a key element of Abuja&mdash;is important.

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">Quotations taken out of context rarely give the whole picture. In his speech in Liverpool on <phrase class="date" code="">21 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State drew attention to the fact that despite the very many gains achieved for all sides through the implementation of the Belfast Agreement, there is still a perception among many unionists that their traditions, needs and aspirations are somehow respected less than those of the nationalist side of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">As explained by the Secretary of State, the Government do not believe this to be the case. The Belfast Agreement addresses many of the deep-seated concerns of both sides of the community in a balanced way, taking parity of esteem as one of its guiding principles. However, as a consequence of its implementation many fundamental changes have been instigated in a relatively short space of time; and change can be a very unsettling experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/3">The Secretary of State's intention in making this speech was to acknowledge that both communities in Northern Ireland are in need of persuasion. He expressed the Government's desire to work towards reversing negative perceptions of the political process and encouraging unionism and nationalism to embrace the changes which are being brought about; to encourage all sections of the community to feel that they belong to the new Northern Ireland. He also called on political and community leaders in Northern Ireland to take an active role in achieving this goal. Taken in its entirety, the speech is a reflection of government policy.</p>
