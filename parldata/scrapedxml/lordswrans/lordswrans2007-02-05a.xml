This makes it more successful than the previous mechanism, the non-fossil-fuels obligation, under which the proportion of renewables rose from 0.2 per cent of electricity sales in 1992 to 1.8 per cent in 2002. We wish to build on this success with an approach that increases the deployment of renewable generation, maintains investor confidence and increases value for money for the customer.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">Defra is regularly involved in meetings and negotiations at EU level, as well as globally, that have sought to address threats to shark conservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">The illegal fishing of sharks for fins is a major threat to shark species. As a response to international concerns over the sustainability of shark fisheries, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) produced a voluntary action plan for the conservation and management of sharks. As the European Commission has competence on fisheries measures it has signed up to the plan on behalf of the UK and all other EU member states. As part of the commitment to implement the plan, the EU has already adopted a regulation outlawing the practice of removing sharks' fins on EU vessels and in EU waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">The UK is active in its support for international agreements that seek to control international fishing activities. My honourable friend the Minister of State for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare (Ben Bradshaw) was the Chair of the High Seas Task Force on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, which produced its final report this year. The UK is actively implementing the proposals of the high seas task force in order to help identify and eliminate illegal fishing activity including the lucrative trade in shark products.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">Furthermore, the UK has been instrumental in listing certain species (such as the basking shark) on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Convention for Migratory Species (CMS) to afford them better protection. The UK has supported the European Union's proposal that the listing of porbeagle and spiny dogfish sharks be considered at the forthcoming CITES Conferences of the Parties in June 2007. Following the CMS listing, the UK has been working with CMS and the Governments of Australia and the Seychelles to develop an international instrument to conserve migratory species of sharks. A meeting of government officials from range states and other interested parties, to consider this further, is likely to take place towards the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/5">The Far East is the main destination market for shark fins and the demand is ever-increasing due to the increased wealth of the population, particularly in China. Through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and during bilateral meetings between government officials and Ministers, we regularly raise the subject of shark conservation and the detrimental impact on shark species directly as a result of the demand for products such as shark fin.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.3/1">The European Commission has competence in this area under the Common Fisheries Policy.

The report concluded that the regulation is achieving its general objectives and that further amendments were not necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/2">Since sharks are taken as a bycatch in many fisheries, it would be impossible to prevent all catches. The most effective way of conserving sharks is likely to be to limit to sustainable levels, within the EU and elsewhere, the overall level of fishing for the main target species.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/2">Limited provision will, however, be made to allow visitors to the UK to be accompanied by their &quot;domestic assistants&quot; under revised business visitor arrangements.

	<p pid="a.92.5/1">The gender guidelines produced in 2000 are out of date in respect of reference to the law and have been replaced by a growing body of jurisprudence. The guidelines were originally designed to provide guidance for the Immigration Appellate Authority (the predecessor to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal), in considering asylum seekers' claims under the refugee convention. They have not at any time had binding authority on the AIT.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.5/2">Immigration judges are independent judicial officers and determine cases on the evidence placed before them. In all appeals, including those involving rape allegations, judges consider case law from the tribunal and the higher courts.

If the complainant remains unhappy with the chief executive's response, he can write to the Secretary of State specifying where he believes maladministration has occurred.

	<p pid="a.102.2/1">Prisoners with severe mental health problems should be transferred and treated in hospital whenever possible. To help facilitate quicker transfers, a protocol has been issued setting out what must be done when a prisoner has been waiting for a hospital place for more than three months following acceptance by the NHS. Tighter monitoring has also been introduced to identify prisoners waiting an unacceptably long period for transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.2/2">In 2005, 24 per cent more prisoners with mental illness too severe for prison were transferred to hospital than in 2002&mdash;up to 896 from 722. In the quarter ending September 2006, 43 prisoners had been waiting over 12 weeks for a transfer, down from 58 in the same quarter in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.2/3">We are looking to further reduce the national waiting time standard for transfers between custodial settings and hospitals and pilots of a 14-day maximum wait will take place in 14 mental health trusts this year. A protocol specific to the transfer to hospital of young people in the secure estate with severe mental illness is also being developed.</p>

The costs excluded sunk costs of &pound;16.7 million to the end of June 2005 (used to produce a prototype, technical designs and contracts). The estimated full life cost (over 14 years) is &pound;234 million (including support and technical refreshes), which equates to about &pound;240 per member of staff per annum.

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">The Chief Executive of Water Service (Mrs Katharine Bryan) has written to the Noble Lord in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/2"><I>Letter from Mrs Katharine Bryan to Lord Laird</I></p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question, further to the Written Answer by Lord Rooker on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-17">17 January</phrase> (<I>WA 167</I>) concerning the sewerage system at Springfield, County Fermanagh, what are the criteria for economic feasibility [HL1484]. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/4">Under current legislation, Water Service has a duty to provide water and sewerage services but is not required to do anything which is not practicable at a reasonable cost. For this reason, Water Service has always operated a policy of reasonable cost allowances for the purpose of determining what is practicable at reasonable cost. The reasonable cost allowances for sewerage schemes are &pound;4,000 for each house occupied before May 2000 and &pound;2,300 for all other houses. The policy provides Water Service with an objective mechanism to consider applications for new water and sewerage services in a consistent and equitable manner. The policy seeks to strike a balance between the interests of householders and taxpayers, within the context of resources made available for water and sewerage services. If the cost of the scheme is more than the total reasonable cost allowance, the scheme cannot be provided at public expense alone and can proceed only if the property owners agree to meet the additional cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/5">When an application was received in 2002 for a sewer extension covering eight properties at Springfield, it was estimated that it would cost &pound;45,000 and the total reasonable cost allowance was assessed at &pound;32,000. The applicant was advised that the scheme could proceed if the additional cost of &pound;13,000 was met by the householders who would benefit, but the offer was not taken up.</p>

As the channel's audience share is below the threshold at which broadcasters are obliged by Ofcom to offer subtitles, the subtitling service on BBC Parliament is a voluntary commitment of the BBC.

	<p pid="a.112.0/2">The BBC announced in October of last year an increase in its subtitling of BBC Parliament from450 hours per year to 810 hours, enabling more of the most important events to be offered in subtitling. The Government welcome this.</p>
