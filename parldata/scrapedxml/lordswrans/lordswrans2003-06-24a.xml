	<p pid="a.9.2/1">Brixton has the capacity to provide access to learning within the education department to nearly one in five prisoners at any one time. This will be further enhanced with the opening of a new learning and skills centre in autumn 2003. I will look to senior management in the prison to do all they can to ensure that this capacity is fully utilised.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/2">In addition, Brixton has increased access to learning by offering education and learner support across a range of other activities outside the traditional classroom setting including on the prison wings. This is helping to engage those prisoners whose experiences of schooling have made them resistant to more formal teaching methods.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/3">We want to see enhanced provision of learning and skills in all prisons, with increased prisoner participation supported by greater flexibility in delivery. We are pursuing a programme of quality improvement and investing an additional &pound;110 million over the next three years to bring this about.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.5/1">The concept of racial discrimination in the Race Directive (Council Directive 2000/43/EC) appears to be expressed more narrowly than the concept of racial discrimination in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (referred to in Recital (3) of the directive). Whereas the latter refers to &quot;racial discrimination&quot; as meaning &quot;any distinction, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origins&quot;, the former refers to &quot;the principle of equal treatment&quot; as meaning &quot;that there shall be no direct or individual discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin&quot;.

	<p pid="a.13.2/1">The cost of &pound;340 million to &pound;375 million is the difference between the assets and the liabilities of the schemes taken over by the PPF in a year, using the following assumptions:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/2" class="indent">(i) Data on the MFR funding levels of just over 1,000 schemes that had an MFR valuation with an effective date between April 1997 and April 2000 were used. Adjustments were made for each scheme in the sample in order to estimate the up-to-date funding position. The results were scaled up to the total for all private sector occupational pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/3" class="indent">(ii) The value of the liabilities if such schemes were to fall within the responsibility of the Pensions Protection Fund were estimated on a basis equivalent to midway between the current MFR basis and the full insurance buyout costs for the liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/4" class="indent">(iii) The cost will obviously depend on the number of firms going insolvent. Allowance was made for the possibility of normal, poor and extreme years as far as bankruptcies are concerned, but on average over a 20-year period, the probabilities of a scheme becoming a liability of the PPF were assumed to be between about 0.3 per cent a year for large schemes and 1 per cent a year for small schemes. This assumed level of bankruptcy is cautious, especially given that it is very rare for large companies to go bankrupt.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/5" class="indent">(iv) Allowance was made for the impact of the suggested salary cap using data on the earnings of occupational schemes members from the Family Resources Survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/6">The cost of &pound;340 million to &pound;375 million is an estimated annual cost that represents the estimated overall annual levy needed to meet the benefit funding shortfall of schemes eligible for compensation from the PPF (see above). The flat-rate levy will be in respect of all members of defined benefit schemes (active, deferred members and pensioners), approximately 15 million members in total. The cost per individual member will be the flat-rate levy, with an additional cost depending on the level of underfunding in the scheme. All costs are gross of corporation tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/7">Note:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/8">As set out on page 41 of Working and saving for retirement: Action on occupational pensions, the estimated cost of &pound;340 million to &pound;375 million is based on a cap of &pound;40,000&ndash;&pound;60,000, not &pound;40,000&ndash;&pound;66,000, as cited in the Question.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.11/1">The Government have evaluated the evidence mentioned. A number of concerns about the safety of Chardon LL, a variety of the GM maize type T25, were raised at the &quot;public hearing&quot; into the proposed addition of Chardon LL onto the UK National List of Seeds. The Government sought advice from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) on all the safety issues raised including the results of the study where T25 genetically modified maize was fed to chickens. ACRE consulted the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF) on matters related to the use of Chardon LL in animal feed, including the chicken feeding study, and issued their advice to government on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-13">13 December 2002</phrase>. The full text is available on the Defra web-site at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/acre/advice/advice20.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/acre/advice/advice20.htm</a>. Point 12 of the advice deals specifically with the chicken feeding study. In summary there is nothing in this study to indicate that T25 maize grain poses any more risk to humans or animals than non-GM varieties. In particular no statistically significant difference in mortality rate was observed between chickens fed T25 grain compared to those fed non-GM maize.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The Government have in place two main agri-environment schemes, Countryside Stewardship and environmentally sensitive areas, whose objectives include the conservation of biodiversity and the maintenance and enhancement of landscape quality and character. Expenditure under these two schemes in 1996&ndash;97 was &pound;40 million. We have expanded them every year since then and the total budget for the two schemes in the current year (2003&ndash;04) is &pound;129 million. However we want to go further. We are reviewing the current agri-environment schemes, with the aim of streamlining and simplifying them while also improving their effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/2">We also intend to increase the opportunities for all farmers to take part in agri-environment schemes by introducing a broadly based, entry level agri-environment scheme. This will reward a range of simple management practices designed to benefit a range of objectives, including biodiversity and landscape, on a much wider scale than has been possible hitherto. This scheme is currently being piloted in four areas of England. If the pilots for the scheme are successful, the Government will make national funding available to roll the scheme out across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/3">This new entry level scheme will be designed to complement a revised higher tier scheme, incorporating both Countryside Stewardship and environmentally sensitive areas, which will continue to deliver the more demanding, complex and expensive aspects of environmental management. These two new schemes will form a single integrated structure.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.2/1">One of the main objectives of the Horse Passports (England) Order 2003 is to protect human health. It will achieve this by providing the necessary controls to ensure that horses treated with certain veterinary medicines which may not be used on food-producing animals do not enter the human food chain. Enforcement of these controls at the slaughterhouse will rest with the Food Standards Agency.</p>
