	<p pid="a.145.1/2" qnum="HL2192">Whether they consider that the United Nations military force in Sierra Leone is as effective as it should be; and whether they will inquire into its acclimatisation, mobility and training.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-01-15a.145.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="145"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020115/text/20115w01.htm#20115w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.145.2/1">The military element of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) forms the largest UN peacekeeping operation in the world. Troops from over 30 nations are participating, including a small number of UK forces, working to support the headquarters' operational planning and as military observers.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">The peacekeeping force was significantly strengthened by the addition of over 3,000 Pakistani troops during the latter half of 2001, and with the recent arrival of troops from Nepal has reached its authorised ceiling of 17,500. Other elements of the force have benefited from training assistance from the United States Government. We welcome the multinational nature of the peacekeeping force and recognise the difficult circumstances in which it must act. We are also conscious of the complexities in welding together a force composed of so many different nationalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/3">UN forces are working well in Sierra Leone as a result of a series of measures taken to enhance general effectiveness. These include pre-deployment training and assessment visits to troop contributors, an integrated training and acclimatisation package in the mission area prior to operational deployment, better logistic sustainability and enhancement to medical and welfare support.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/4">During 2001, UNAMSIL deployed troops throughout the country and provided crucial assistance in the area of human rights and with the disarmament and demobilisation process. They have helped to provide a level of security in Sierra Leone not seen for many years. Confidence in the peace process, stemming from their presence, is encouraging refugees and displaced persons to return home in advance of the elections, scheduled for May 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/5">UNAMSIL is now turning its attention to providing technical and logistical assistance to the Government of Sierra Leone in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the elections. As a demonstration of its conflict prevention capacity in Africa it is vital that UNAMSIL's mission in Sierra Leone succeeds. We will continue to offer it our full support.</p>

Reservists have been supporting the operation on other forms of service. We are immensely grateful to all of them. As a further measure to support the current level of operations, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence has authorised the compulsory call-out of up to 140 specialist Territorial Army personnel to provide intelligence support to headquarters organisations in the UK and to the UK forces deployed in Afghanistan. This action is fully in accordance with our stated intention as part of the Strategic Defence Review to make our reserve forces more useable integrated and relevant. We believe that the compulsory call-out will be welcomed by the personnel involved and their employers.</p>

Agriculture Ministers of the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland were also present.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/2">The Council reached agreement on reform of the sheepmeat regime, including a number of measures for which the United Kingdom had pressed strongly. The changes will make substantial savings in the budget for the EU's current financial year. The main ones will fix permanent rates of premium and create national envelopes which can be directed towards national or regional priorities. Different approaches will be permitted in England and the devolved administrations. We are delighted with this outcome which will give us some valuable flexibility in the operation of this important regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/3">The Council also agreed to introduce a stabiliser which will cap spending in the seeds sector. The new arrangements fully safeguard UK interests.

	<p pid="a.150.0/1">Detailed implementation plans for the proposals set out in the discussion document Extending Choice for Patients will be worked up in discussion with patient representatives, National Health Service clinicians and managers and partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/2">Under the funding arrangements set out in the section of the document on heart surgery, it is proposed that funding should flow from NHS commissioners to their local cardiac centres, which will either undertake operations themselves or arrange for patients who have waited longer than six months to be treated elsewhere, if the patients so choose. Funding will transfer to those hospitals which do the extra activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/3">Arrangements for travel and support for patients and their families will be considered in more depth with patient representatives and others; this will include reviewing travel cost arrangements to ensure that patients who exercise choice do not lose out.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/4">The detail of the arrangements for cardiac patient care advisers and patient choice trustees will be explored further early in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.3/1">Since the 1999 coronary heart disease survey was carried out, the Government have published the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (NSF for CHD). The NSF for CHD was produced with the need to address inequalities in healthcare firmly in mind, and sets out to ensure that top quality treatment and care are available in all parts of the country and to all communities. The NSF for CHD requires National Health Service organisations to take into account the impact of ethnicity on the heart disease risks to which patients are exposed and to ensure that they meet people's needs in ways that are culturally, religiously and linguistically appropriate. Expansion in heart disease services combined with a greater sensitivity to patients' backgrounds will improve both access to services and the experiences of ethnic minority patients.</p>
