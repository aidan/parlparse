	<p pid="a.1.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-09">9 May 2002</phrase>, the number of life peers in each category was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2" class="indent">Conservative: 171</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3" class="indent">Labour: 188</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4" class="indent">Liberal Democrat: 60</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5" class="indent">Cross Bench and other: 157.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6">This excludes those peers who have taken leave of absence (source: House of Lords Information Office). On the same basis, the total strengths of the parties, which include the elected hereditary peers, were:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/7" class="indent">Conservative: 220</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/8" class="indent">Labour: 192</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/9" class="indent">Liberal Democrat: 65</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/10" class="indent">Cross Bench and other: 189.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/11">The changes to the strength of life peers, as requested in parts (b) and (c) of the noble Lord's Question, are set out in the attached table. These are based on calculations done by the Government Actuary's Department. The figures shown are for the mid-point of each year and have been rounded to the nearest whole number. They are only approximate figures; given the small size of the numbers involved, the statistical fluctuations will be large, especially when the figures are disaggregated among parties. Applying the same calculation to the figures including the elected hereditary peers would be meaningless since under present legislation the hereditary peers are automatically replaced when they die.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/1">While it would not in any case be appropriate to comment on resourcing decisions taken in part under the previous government, there is no uniform explanation for the change in the overall number of Customs staff employed in different roles in Northern Ireland between 1993 and 2002. In individual areas there has recently been, for example, a significant increase in the resources allocated to tackle oils fraud in Northern Ireland and a reduction in the number of staff engaged in handing inquiries following the welcome creation of the Customs National Advice Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">Designating an item as a &quot;heritage asset&quot; determines only the way in which it is treated in a department's accounts. Responsibility for interpreting it therefore lies with the department. The National Audit Office has been tasked by Parliament with reviewing all government departments' accounts. It is for the auditor to judge whether it needs external advice on any particular issue: that is not a matter for the body being audited, or hence for me as a Minister. However I have passed the noble Baroness's question to the NAO, which intends to reply.</p>

In effect this prohibits the land spreading of composted kitchen waste. We have commissioned a risk assessment on the risks to public, animal and plant health from the land spreading of composted catering waste and will review the order in the light of that assessment. The risk assessment will be made public.</p>
