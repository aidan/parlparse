	<p pid="a.187.2/1">All dairy cattle, in whatever system they are kept, are protected by comprehensive animal welfare legislation. In England, the welfare of cattle is protected by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal. The Act also contains a duty of care to animals. This means that anyone responsible for an animal must take reasonable steps to make sure the animal's needs are met. These general requirements are supplemented by more detailed ones in the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 for calves and cattle, covering areas such as accommodation, tethering, inspection, feed and water.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/2">It is important to recognise that poor welfare may occur in both intensive and extensive systems. The most significant influence on the welfare of livestock is the stock-keeper, not the system in which it is reared.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/3">Defra is currently funding a three year project by the Scottish Agricultural College which is investigating the management and welfare of continuously housed cows. It will compare the health of cows in continuously housed systems with those in summer grazing systems, by using culling and fertility data. Work on this research is at an early stage, and is due to be completed at the end of June 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.2/1">Over the next decade the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organisation (OECD-FAO) project modest growth of agricultural output in OECD countries of 8 per cent and less than 4 per cent in Europe. In contrast, it projects much stronger production increases in non-OECD countries, particularly for meat and dairy. For instance, Brazil's agricultural output is projected to grow by over 40 per cent to 2019, whilst Russia, the Ukraine, China and India are expected to grow by 20-30 per cent. This growth will be important to meet the increased demand projected in these countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/2">While higher incomes and increased demand in emerging economies present opportunities to EU producers, the greatest contribution Europe can make to global food security is through good policy and technology transfer, encouraging sustainable agriculture, productivity and resource efficiency, and a more stable and equitable global trade system. Europe can do this through pressing for a more ambitious and balanced Doha deal and through genuine reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to remove unhelpful subsidies and demonstrate leadership in delivering sustainable production systems. These reforms will also improve the underlying competitiveness of our farmers and fishermen, enabling them to better compete in world markets and take advantage of increased global demand for high quality produce. Continued investment in the development and application of science and technology and policies that encourage healthy, sustainable diets and reduce waste along the food chain will also be important in meeting future demand sustainably.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/3">As the world's largest donor of development aid, Europe also has an important role to play in assisting developing countries address food security challenges, including availability, access and nutritional uptake. In March 2010, the EU published a comprehensive policy framework to this end which acknowledges the importance of smallholder farmers, their vulnerability to the effects of climate change, the significant contribution sustainable agricultural productivity increases can make to meeting local and regional demand and increasing smallholder incomes. Implementation of this framework is now starting. It is supporting those countries that prioritise agriculture and food security in their own development efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/4">In January 2011, Sir John Beddington, Government Chief Scientific adviser, will publish a major two-year study from the Foresight Programme: Global Food and Farming Futures. The study, co-sponsored by Defra and DfID, has brought together an impressive range of international experts, from the UN, EU, World Bank and industry and will set out what policy makers at national, regional and international levels, including Europe, will need to do in the coming decades to ensure supply can match demand in a way that is affordable to all and environmentally sustainable.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.2/1">There is a substantial body of economic analysis that explores returns, both private and social, to R&amp;D expenditure. This literature, which looks at different sectors, countries and time periods, invariably suggests strong returns to science funding, with social returns usually outstripping private. Recent work by Professor Jonathan Haskell (Imperial College) and Dr Graeme Wallis (HMT) reports strong growth returns to Research Council investment in the UK. Specific estimates of this type must be treated with considerable caution because of the complex methodological issues involved, but it is likely that the economic returns to UK science are strong. The BIS reporting system for the Research Councils explores the economic and research outcomes achieved by each of the councils, producing evidence supporting the link between science and growth. For that reason, the Government will continue to focus expenditure efforts on the UK's world-leading institutions that underpin interactions between science and business in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.2/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-15">15 October 2010</phrase>, of the 56 establishments that hold young offenders and/or juveniles, 40 have a legal services officer (or officers), as defined by the terms of Prison Service Order 2605 &quot;The Role of the Legal Services (Previously Legal Aid) Officer&quot; and 16 do not. However, of the 16 who do not, six establishments have other staff members who are able to assist with legal issues when required and in two others appointments are pending.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/2">The mandatory policy requirement for young offender institutions to have a legal services officer is set out in Prison Service Order 2605, a copy of which is available in the Libraries of both Houses. The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is committed to ensuring that all prisoners, including young offenders, who require legal services understand what is available and how services are accessed. Regional custodial managers will work with governors to ensure that every young offender institution has appropriate staff available to provide assistance in obtaining these services.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/3">It is not the Government's responsibility to provide prisoners with legal advice, but prisons do aim to help them to access such advice. Legal services officers are not the only source of advice available to prisoners. In particular, they may not always be the best people to advise prisoners on the parole issues mentioned in the Howard League report. NOMS is currently developing a specification for advice services for prisoners in general, and the Howard League's report will be taken into account as part of that process.</p>
