However, this Government believe that even in these difficult economic times, the UK has a moral responsibility to help the poorest people in the world. It is also very much in our national self-interest to ensure that our development budget does something about the difficult conflict-ridden and unstable areas in the developing world. The UK will therefore honour the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GNI on official development assistance (ODA).</p>

	<p pid="a.262.2/1">In 2008, communities were invited to express an interest in entering discussions with Government about a siting process for a geological disposal facility for higher activity radioactive waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/2">To date, three expressions of interest have been received (Copeland Borough Council, Cumbria County Council and Allerdale Borough Council) for the areas of Copeland and Allerdale. The authorities and local stakeholders are working together in partnership and recently requested the commencement of the British Geological Survey high-level, subsurface unsuitability test. This process will be desk-based, using existing data, and will not identify sites that could definitely host a facility but will screen out areas that can easily be identified now as unsuitable for geological reasons, using a small set of basic geological criteria that were subject to public consultation in 2007. At further stages of the process increasingly detailed assessments will be made of potential sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/3">The British Geological Survey's report is expected to be made available to the West Cumbria Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) Partnership in the autumn. Further information about the West Cumbria MRWS Partnership can be found at (<a href="http://www">www</a>. westcumbriamrws.org.uk).</p>

	<p pid="a.262.5/1">Government are undertaking a stepwise process for implementing geological disposal of higher activity radioactive waste based on the recommendations of the independent Committee on Radioactive Waste Management. This process is based on voluntarism and partnership with local communities with the first stage being local communities expressing an interest in entering discussions with Government about the siting process.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.5/2">Following an expression of interest the second stage in the process is the completion of a high-level, subsurface unsuitability test by the British Geological Survey to exclude those areas that can easily be identified now as unsuitable to host a facility for geological reasons. This unsuitability test is currently being undertaken for the Allerdale and Copeland Boroughs of West Cumbria using a small set of basic geological criteria that were subject to public consultation in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.5/3">In its input to the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management's original deliberations between 2003-06, the British Geological Survey set out that it was confident that geological conditions suitable for the disposal of radioactive waste could be found in a significant proportion of the UK.</p>
