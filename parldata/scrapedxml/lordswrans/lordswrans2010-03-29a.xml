	<p pid="a.331.1/1" qnum="HL3051">To ask Her Majesty's Government why it took 15 months to publish the data for 2007 in Indicator 6.1.2 (greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture) in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' autumn performance report 2009; and why the data for 2008 will not be available before April 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.2/1">Indicator 6.1.2 on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is compiled using statistics from the set of environmental accounts published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which in turn use statistics from the greenhouse gas inventory now published by DECC. The 2007 environmental accounts were published by the ONS in July 2009 and these were then used to update indicator 6.1.2 published in the 2009 autumn performance report in line with previous years. The 2008 data are expected to be available in the summer of 2010 and will be used to update the indicator within the 2010 autumn performance report.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.2/2">The complex nature of the calculations for both the inventory and the environmental accounts and the timing by which the variety of data sources used in their compilation become available leads to an inevitable delay before indicator 6.1.2 can be published. But we will continue to look for ways to improve the timeliness of the publication of this indicator without compromising its accuracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.5/1">Current genetically modified (GM) products approved for food and feed use in the European Union (EU) are not intended to provide benefits directly for consumers. They are mainly products made from GM crops which are designed to make weed and pest control easier for farmers, being herbicide-tolerant, insect-resistant, or a mix of both these traits. In addition, the EU has just approved the cultivation and marketing of a GM potato which has altered starch composition for various industrial uses.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/2">Defra is aware of various published reports on the impact of GM crop cultivation in other countries. The reported impacts can vary according to the specific type of crop involved and the country or region of use. In addition, outcomes may fluctuate over time, and the range of evidence available on a given impact may not cover a consistent period.</p>

Any issues about the scientific evidence relating to a specific product are usually raised at an earlier stage in the EU assessment process, before a decision is referred to the council. Scientific questions concerning GM food and feed applications under Regulation (EC) No.1829/2003 can be raised at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and for applications made under the GMO Deliberate Release Directive 2001/18/EC at the associated Regulatory Committee. The position taken by the UK on GM applications is informed by the expert scientific advice provided by the European Food Safety Authority and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.336.5/1">No specific assessment has been made of the impact of the Biocidal Products Directive on the use of formaldehyde in the embalming process or more generally on funeral practices in the United Kingdom. At the time the Biocidal Products Regulations 2001 were drafted to implement the Biocidal Products Directive in Great Britain, a regulatory impact assessment was prepared by the Health and Safety Executive using the best available information. Compliance costs of the Biocidal Products Regulations for industry as a whole were estimated over and above those for existing national legislation, and industry was consulted.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.5/2">Embalming and taxidermist fluids is one of 23 biocidal product types identified in the Biocidal Products Directive. Formaldehyde (often as formalin, a solution of formaldehyde gas in water) is widely used as a disinfectant, preservative and for antifouling and vertebrate control. The embalming industry is, therefore, not alone in having to support active substances used in its products through the review process required by the directive, and may wish to work with other sectors to share costs as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.341.2/1">Section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1985 provided for the first time that British citizens living overseas should be able to register to vote in parliamentary elections in the UK. That Act established the principle that a British citizen living abroad can only be registered within a fixed period of time. That period currently expires 15 years from the date on which the citizen in question was last resident in a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom and was included in the register for that constituency as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.341.2/2">Parliament decided to impose a time limit on the eligibility of overseas electors to vote in parliamentary elections, as it was thought that, during a lengthy period of absence from the UK, their connection with the UK is likely to diminish. Accordingly, it was considered that the ability of those electors to have a direct influence on our democratic processes by voting should also diminish.</p>
	<p pid="a.341.2/3">The length of the period after which the right to vote lapses was initially set at five years but has subsequently been increased by statute to 20 years then, from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, reduced to 15 years. Each time a change has been has been made, Parliament has approved that change and confirmed its view that the basic principle of time-limiting overseas voting rights remains appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.341.2/4">However, despite the general time limit described above, there are certain categories of person living abroad for a period longer than 15 years who are still entitled to vote. The categories of person are members of the Armed Forces; persons in Crown service posts; and persons working for the British Council. This exception also covers the spouses and civil partners of members of each of those categories. In the case of the Armed Forces, the right recognises the need for special arrangements that reflect the important nature of their service to the United Kingdom. Crown Servants are given this right because their service and loyalty to the Crown and State are considered to be directly comparable to that of a civil servant who lives and works in the United Kingdom.</p>

This guidance applies the higher level HM Treasury guidance on appraisal and evaluation in Central Government (The Greenbook) (2003) and Defra's policy statement on Appraisal of Flood and Erosion Risk Management (2009). Guidance on Catchment Flood Management Plans and Shoreline Management Plans also follows those high level guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.345.0/5">A category four asset will have no economic or other reason to justify continued maintenance of the flood protection scheme. Where plans may include stopping maintenance, the Environment Agency provides support by offering practical advice on future options that may be a viable alternative. This could include the landowner. If maintenance is to cease, the period of notice to the landowner or occupier must be reasonable. This would normally be within six to 24 months. Longer periods may be appropriate in some instances as the definition of what is reasonable can depend on many factors.</p>

	<p pid="a.347.2/1">Our initial estimate of &#163;3 billion to 3.5 billion was based on an understanding that individual payments made in Ireland to infected patients ranged between &#163;500,000 and &#163;1 million, and was derived by multiplying the average of those figures by the estimated number of infected claimants in the United Kingdom. It did not take account of payments to dependents of those infected.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.2/2">It is not possible to calculate an accurate figure for the cost of implementing the recommendations for compensation contained in Lord Archer's report because the Irish scheme uses a series of eligibility criteria, which means that different claimants have received different amounts of compensation, depending on their circumstances. Therefore, unless each UK claimant is assessed individually against the same criteria, it would be impossible to give an accurate figure. It is also not possible to estimate with any certainty how many people in the UK might be eligible to apply.</p>

The health check found that PICT had developed into a professional ICT organisation delivering effective ICT services at a reasonable cost. It went on to recommend improvements that could be made in the way in which ICT projects and programmes were organised and financed. A review of the actions taken in response to the health check was undertaken in June 2009 and the consultants found that good progress had been made. Both reports were presented to the Management Board and the Information Committee in the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="a.356.2/1">NEST will be self-financing in the long-term, meaning that any loan finance provided by Government to fund the costs of establishment, including those costs incurred by the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority (PADA), will be repaid from members' charge revenues. This will ensure the scheme is delivered at nil overall cost to taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/2">Up to the end of February 2010, PADA has received &#163;37 million of loan funding and is expected to receive a further &#163;24 million up to its wind-up on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July 2010</phrase>. All loan funding advanced to PADA is based on evidence of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/3">The loan liability owed by the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority (PADA) will, on its wind-up, be transferred to the NEST Corporation, which will then be responsible for repaying the loan along with any further money it borrows from Government in connection with its activities to establish the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/4">The period in which the loan to NEST Corporation will be repaid will ultimately depend on a variety of factors, including the final costs of NEST and the size and nature of its membership. We anticipate that the total loan period, including the years in which NEST borrows from Government and the subsequent repayments, will last in the region of 20 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.357.0/1">The responses to the consultation on the draft Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 15 supported the unified approach to the historic environment but raised concerns about some aspects of the draft. They gave a clear steer as to how these should be addressed. With the help of informal discussions and stakeholder feedback both during and after the consultation exercise we were able to propose changes to the draft which were tested with key practitioner and conservation interests. Once we were satisfied that the draft had been revised in a way that fully met the concerns raised during consultation, a final version was published as PPS 5 on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-23">23 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/2">The Government's formal response to the consultation, identifying the main issues raised and how they were addressed, was included in the summary of consultation responses published alongside the new PPS, which can be found on my Department's website at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/pps">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/pps</a> 15summaryresponses.</p>

	<p pid="a.357.6/1">No estimate of the cost to local authorities, the Valuation Office Agency and the Exchequer has been made for administering and enforcing arrangements for business rates on firms in ports, as the addition of new properties to the ratings list is part and parcel of the ongoing rating system.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.6/2">The cost of the schedule of payments scheme to the Exchequer is set out in the impact assessment accompanying the Non-Domestic Rating (Collection and Enforcement) (Local Lists) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 (SI 204). It estimates the cost of the scheme as being revenue neutral for local authorities and &#163;33 million over the life of the scheme to the Exchequer. There is no cost associated for the Valuation Office Agency with this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.6/3">The schedule of payments scheme was implemented as a result of the Government having listened to the concerns of businesses with significant and unexpected backdated bills, including some businesses within ports. The scheme enables such bills to be repaid over an unprecedented eight years rather than in a single instalment, helping affected businesses to manage the impact on their cash flows during the downturn by reducing the amount they are required to pay now by 87.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.5/1">The Government continue to engage in the international debate on the subject of financial transaction taxes, following the Prime Minister's speech to G20 Finance Ministers at St Andrews in November, where he raised the issue of a new social contract between banks and society, and called for a global plan to make the financial sector contribute in recognition of the cost to taxpayers of government interventions in the sector. The International Monetary Fund has been commissioned by the G20 to produce a report on these issues. The Government look forward to seeing the results of this work later on this year.</p>
