	<p pid="a.123.2/1">We have not made representations to the Irish Government on this issue. We do accept as do the Irish that certain cases from the past remain a source of grave public concern, particularly those giving rise to serious allegations of collusion by the security forces in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This was one of the issues dealt with in the package of proposals the UK and Irish Governments put to the parties on <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-01">1 August</phrase>. These proposals flowed from the intensive discussions the Irish and we have been engaged in with the parties in recent weeks. The aim of those discussions was to help deliver the full and early implementation of the Good Friday agreement. The package addresses the four outstanding issues: policing, the stability of the institutions, security normalisation and decommissioning. We have invited the parties to give their views on these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/2">On the issue of alleged collusion, the package includes a proposal that the UK and Irish Governments will appoint a judge of international standing from outside both jurisdictions to undertake a thorough examination of such allegations in the cases of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, along with those of Mr Finucane and Mrs Nelson, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Robert Hamill and Billy Wright.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/3">Subject to the parties' agreement on the overall package, it is intended that the investigation of each individual case would begin no later than the end of April 2002, unless this is clearly prejudicial to forthcoming prosecution at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/4">We will publish detailed terms of reference. However, the appointed judge will be asked to review all the papers, interview anyone who can help, establish the facts and will report with recommendations for any further action. If the independent judge recommends a public inquiry in any case, the relevant government will implement that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/5">We believe that this approach represents a genuine attempt to respond to the legitimate needs and concerns of those bereaved as a result of these appalling outrages. In dealing with the allegations of collusion once and for all, it will allow us to draw a final line under the past.</p>

Any information that may exist about the paramilitary membership of victims would often be as a result of intelligence and therefore inappropriate to be placed in the public domain.</p>

It is not the practice of the Garda to comment publicly on such matters. The Garda seize any illegally held arms whenever they can and will continue to do so. The decommissioning Act 1997, and regulations made under it, provide for the decommissioning of such arms.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.6/1">Changes in Burma in the past nine months give grounds for cautious optimism. But the rapprochement between the regime and the domestic opposition remains fragile and reversible. Until Burma is firmly embarked on a return to constitutional, democratic rule, it would not be appropriate to suspend or remove the core elements of the EU common position. The General Affairs Council of <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-08">8 October</phrase> therefore decided to renew the common position for a further six months. The core elements of the common position are to remain unchanged, with the addition of required legal clarification that enables EU member states to fulfil their UN obligations by allowing Burmese Ministers to attend UN conferences in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.6/2">However, in recognition of the progress achieved to date and in expectation of further positive developments, the EU Council conclusions on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-08">8 October</phrase> set out a modest first package of positive measures. We stand ready to consider what further measures might be appropriate if change in Burma accelerates significantly. Conversely, if progress were to stall or fail, UK/EU policy would need to be tightened again.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.0/1">The retention of experienced medical officers is a key element in our plans for restoring the operational capability of the Defence Medical Services (DMS). We recognise that both financial and non-financial measures have a part to play in improving retention. So far as financial measures are concerned, the Ministry of Defence submits evidence on the pay of DMS medical and dental officers each year to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. This year, on the review body's recommendation, we have introduced commission transfer grants of &pound;16,000 (gross before tax) to encourage medical officers who are general medical practitioners to transfer from short career commissions to longer commissions. We also keep under review the use of other financial incentives to encourage retention. We have addressed complaints by medical officers about differing terms of service between the three services and plans for implementing common terms of service are well advanced. Non-financial measures we have taken to help reduce overstretch and, thus, encourage retention include targeting recruitment at fully vocationally trained doctors and reducing the length and frequency of operational deployments for hospital specialists. We believe that the creation of the new Centre for Defence Medicine at Birmingham, which we intend will become a recognised centre of excellence in military medicine, is a further important factor in encourging both the recruitment and retention of medical officers.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.3/1">The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has an obligation to ensure that personnel of the Armed Forces have access to appropriate medical care in all circumstances, whether in the UK, at bases abroad, or when deployed on exercises or operations. Primary care is provided by military GPs and civilian medical practitioners employed by the MoD who, in the UK, may refer personnel needing hospital treatment to Minsitry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs), or in some cases, to NHS hospitals which do not host MDHUs. During 2000-01, the MoD supplemented these arrangements with a special waiting list initiative in order to return service personnel in shortage categories to deployability more quickly. For the future, arrangements for medical care are being addressed by a medical quinquennial review, which will be considering, among other things, the most appropriate pattern for hospital care to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">No. Local overseas allowance is a payment to compensate individuals for the necessary day-to-day costs of serving overseas. It is not part of the military salary nor is it a reward for serving overseas. It offers at best an inefficient method of providing for welfare and is not considered appropriate for service personnel already in receipt of the operational welfare package (OWP).</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">We undertook a &quot;from first principles&quot; review of operational welfare in 1999 to seek a solution to a legacy of ad hoc and inequitable welfare provision in different theatres. The review determined that the most appropriate method of providing welfare support to service personnel deployed on operations was through the delivery of a comprehensive OWP. This was introduced in April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/3">For Exercise Saif Sareea II the OWP includes: the installation of 676 telephones and a personal allowance of 20 minutes of publicly funded telephone calls per week; free forces aerogrammes and concessionary parcel rates; access to the Internet and e-mail; newspapers and book packs; BFBS TV and radio; televisions, video recorders and video tapes; Expeditionary Forces Institute shops; publicly funded laundry and a combined services entertainment show.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/4">Although there have been occasional difficulties in delivering all elements of the OWP on time in some of the remote locations and in the harsh environment of Oman, service personnel on Exercise Saif Sareea II have generally received the OWP in full and work will continue to refine provision of the OWP.</p>

The order which, if made, would give the promoters the powers they need to carry out the work, has been the subject of a public inquiry.

	<p pid="a.131.2/2">Letter to Lord Corbett of Castle Vale from the chief executive of the Highways Agency, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-24">24 October 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/3">The Minister for Housing and Planning, Lord Falconer, has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the provision of lighting on the unlit sections of the M6 between junction 19 of the M1 and junction 5 of the M6.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/4">The Highways Agency is responsible for the management of the motorway network, including the provision of lighting. When considering whether or not to light a particular section of motorway, the Agency is required to strike a balance between the potential benefits anticipated from reduced accidents and the capital maintenance and energy costs which would be incurred. Increasingly, account must also be taken of the results of environmental pollution from any additional lighting, particularly in rural areas where there is little or no existing light pollution. In effect, this means that lighting is only installed where there is a poor night-time accident record.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/5">The M6 is currently lit at its junction with the M1 (Junction 19), at Junction 2 and north of Junction 4. We estimate that the cost of lighting the remaining sections would be in the region of &pound;7 million. However, there are no plans at present to provide any additional lighting on this length as the accident rate is lower than on other comparable sections of unlit motorway. In the circumstances, such expenditure would be difficult to justify given that there are greater priorities elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/6">If you would like further information, please contact Peter Adams at our Birmingham office. He can be contacted at Broadway, Broad Street, Birmingham B15 1BL, or by telephone on 0121 678 8215.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.5/1">This information is not held centrally. All products of animal origin imported from third countries into the UK must enter, and are subject to veterinary inspections, at designated UK border inspection posts (BIPs). The inspection services at the BIP are the responsibility of the local authority. Central government has no powers to instruct the local authority over the number of inspectors. However, the BIP has to be approved by the European Commission, which conducts periodic inspection missions, and which has to be satisfied that the inspection services are adequate. If they are not, the approval of the BIP may be suspended. Central government may also suspend the approval if inspection services are inadequate, reporting its action to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.5/2">Products of animal origin produced within the EU may circulate freely in the single market and are not subject to border checks. They are subject to checks at the point of destination within the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.5/3">In respect of food not of animal origin, the Food Standards Agency monitors general food enforcement activity by all local authorities, including port health authorities, and has recently begun a programme of audits to provide more detailed information on enforcement standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.5/4">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is co-ordinating action across government to improve our ability to detect and prevent illegal imports. Improved publicity for travellers has been introduced. Posters have been placed at main airports and information is being provided by the travel industry and FCO posts abroad. National legislation has been amended to make it easier for local authorities to act when illegally imported products of animal origin are found and the Food Standards Agency is encouraging local authorities to ensure that checks for illegal imports are part of their routine inspections of food premises. An improved system of sharing and analysis of information has been introduced to enable enforcement bodies to better target action. We are also looking at other ways in which enforcement of import controls may be improved.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.2/2" class="indent">(a) at key stage 2, about the different types of relationships, including marriage and those between friends and families, and to develop the skills to be effective in relationships; (b) at key stage 3, about the role and feelings of parents and carers and the value of family life; and (c) at key stage 4, about the nature and importance of marriage for family life and bringing up children as well as the role and responsibilities of a parent, and the qualities of good parenting and its value to family life.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/3">Our framework refers to &quot;parents&quot; and therefore applies equally to both fathers and mothers. We believe our framework provides teachers with the flexibility to discuss the issues the noble Lord raises. We rely on teachers' professionalism to choose appropriate materials to support their teaching.</p>
