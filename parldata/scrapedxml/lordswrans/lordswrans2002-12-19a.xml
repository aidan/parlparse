<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-12-19a.135.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100067" speakername="Lord Brabazon of Tara" colon=":" colnum="135"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo021219/text/21219w01.htm#21219w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.135.0/1">The initial feasibility study for improved visitor facilities was commissioned by the House of Commons Board of Management, acting through the Group on Information for the Public (GIP). The study was conducted by the consultants Haley Sharpe, in conjunction with Purcell Miller Tritton and Partners (conservation architects).</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/2">GIP is a Commons body, but the House of Lords is represented on it by Mary Morgan, the Director of Public Information. The group is charged with increasing and improving the public understanding of Parliament, so fulfilling one of the strategic objectives adopted by the House of Commons Commission in October 2001 (see the commission's 24th annual report, 2001&ndash;02, p.10). It has been particularly concerned about the way in which visitors of all types (whether on business or simply to see the building) are received when they come to Parliament. Related concerns have been expressed by Members of this House in recent debates, including those initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbots, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-04">4 July 2001</phrase> (HL Deb., cols. 821-34) and the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-13">13 March 2002</phrase> (HL Deb., cols. 827-65).</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/3">The decision to commission an initial feasibility study was therefore taken by the House of Commons administration. The object of the study was to assess what options were available for improving visitor facilities, not to agree a single way forward. No formal representations were made on behalf of the House of Lords, although the consultants did meet senior officials, including Black Rod, the agent of the Administration and Works Sub-Committee. The House has been kept informed throughout, and the Administration and Works Sub-Committee took note of developments on <phrase class="date" code="">2 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/4">A general notice was issued to Members of both Houses in the all-party whip on <phrase class="date" code="">16 May</phrase>, inviting them to make their views known to the consultants, who subsequently conducted a number of interviews. No instructions were given by individual Members or groups of Members to those from the House of Lords who spoke to the consultants.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/5">The feasibility study covered a range of options and different levels of visitor facilities, from an improved welcome and access to more fully developed information provision. At this stage no decisions have been taken, and no options either ruled in or ruled out. Proposals to build underground car-parking facilities in Victoria Tower Gardens have been considered by the Administration and Works Sub-Committee in the past (notably in 1991), but have been rejected on the grounds of costs. However, with regard to option five of the present feasibility study, no detailed appraisals have been undertaken, and further examination of the Victoria Tower Gardens option could well include consideration of other facilities, which would have to be costed. No agreement will be given to any scheme until all relevant issues have been thoroughly explored, including that of access to the parliamentary estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/6">The House of Commons Commission discussed the report on <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase> and has asked for further studies to be undertaken, while asking several Commons committees their views. The House Committee of this House discussed the report at its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase> and has remitted it to the Information Committee and the Administration and Works Committee for detailed consideration. The House Committee will consider the matter again in the light of recommendations from these committees. I urge the noble Lord, should he wish to make formal representations on this matter, to write either to me, as Chairman of the Administration and Works Committee, or to the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking, as Chairman of the Information Committee.</p>

This power is to be exercised in the public interest, which I exercise in my independent judgment in my role as Attorney-General rather than as a member of government. Such an application is always exceptional and is instituted only where there is the prospect of genuine, serious and irreparable harm and I judge that it is in the public interest to make the application.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/2">It is my duty to keep under constant review the question whether to exercise this power. In order to determine where the public interest lies I may consult, as I have been doing, with my ministerial colleagues to ensure that I am properly informed as to the public interest consultations arising. I have been informed also of the views of fire authority representatives in relation to the potential threat to public safety. But the power to apply for an injunction is one for me as the Attorney-General to exercise in the public interest and the decision is for me alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.5/2">In considering what options might be available to us, we have taken the view that, to be of value, any scrutiny should be able to deliver new and useful conclusions despite the passage of time and the investigations that have already taken place.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.5/4">We have concluded that, given the absence of any significant new information, the fact that the key issues have already been extensively explored, and action taken, including substantial changes to airport procedures, it is most unlikely that any further form of inquiry would unearth further lessons to be learned, 14 years after the event, which had not already been identified by earlier investigations.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.3/1">Angola (UNITA)</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/2">With the suport of Her Majesty's Government, the UN Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-18">18 October 2002</phrase> unanimously adopted UN Security Council resolution 1439(2002). The resolution lifted the travel ban on members of UNITA and their immediate families listed in paragraphs 4a and 4b of UN Security Council resolution 1127(1997) from <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-14">14 November 2002</phrase>. The travel ban has been suspended since May pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions 1412(2002) and 1432(2002).</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/3">Resolution 1439(2002) also committed the Security Council to review all remaining measures imposed on UNITA by <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-19">19 November 2002</phrase>. Following the review with the support of Her Majesty's Government, the Security Council voted unanimously to adopt United Nations Resolution 1448(2002) on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-09">9 December 2002</phrase>. This resolution lifted all remaining sanctions measures on Angola (UNITA). This is in recognition of the considerable progress made in Angola since the formal cessation of hostilities on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-04">4 April 2002</phrase>, and the broad fulfilment of the tenets of the Lusaka Peace Protocol by UNITA. Sierre Leone</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/4">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the Security Council voted unanimously to adopt Resolution 1446(2002) on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-04">4 December 2002</phrase>. The resolution extended the embargo on the export of rough diamonds without a certificate of origin, controlled by the Government of Sierra Leone. This extension will allow the Government of Sierra Leone to extend and consolidate their authority over the diamond-mining fields in the country. Democratic Republic of Congo</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/5">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the General Affairs and External Relations Council of <phrase class="date" code="">22 October</phrase> agreed Council Common Position 2002/829. The European Union introduced an embargo on the export of arms to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1993 pursuant to an EU declaration of <phrase class="date" code="1993-04-07">7 April 1993</phrase>. The Common Position (2002/829) amends the scope of that arms embargo by providing that the arms embargo does not apply to temporary exports for personal use of United Nations personnel; and does not prohibit the export of non-lethal military equipment with a legitimate humanitarian use to representatives of the media and humanitarian and associated personnel, or equipment to be used for the clearance and destruction of anti-personnel landmines. Burma</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/6">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the General Affairs and External Relations Council of <phrase class="date" code="">22 October</phrase> agreed Council Common Position 2002/831. The Common Position extends EU sanctions against Burma for a further six months. The Common Position and the accompanying Council Regulation also update the list of individuals subject to EU sanctions to take account of recent changes to the Burmese military regime. hp</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">The transport segment of the Transport, Energy and Telecommunications Council was held in Brussels on 5-<phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (John Spellar) and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (David Jamieson) represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/2">The Council came to an agreement on the Single European Sky package. The aim of the four regulations making up the package is to improve the efficiency of air traffic management across the EU, thereby reducing air traffic delays. The United Kingdom has been a strong supporter of this package from the outset and we are very pleased to be able to report the successful outcome. Civil/military co-operation is an important aspect of air traffic management, and the member states made a declaration agreeing to cooperate on military aspects.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/3">The Commission presented its recent communication on the consequences for European avaiation policy of the recent ECJ rulings on aviation agreements. The Commission called for rapid progress on concluding an EU-US aviation agreement, the Commissioner having written to Ministers asking them to denounce their existing agreements with the US, which, following the ECU rulings, the Commission believed were no longer valid. There was general agreement that member states and the Commission needed to discuss the consequences of the ruling urgently, including the question of a Commission mandate for negotiations with the US. COREPER was asked to work on proposals to be put to the Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/4">The Council agreed on a regulation providing for new levels of compensation to air passengers in the event of denied boarding, cancellation and delay. A majority of Ministers accepted three levels of compensation: 250 euros for all flights of 1,500km or less, 400 euros for intra-EU flights of more than 1,500km and other flights between 1,500-3,500km, and 600 euros for all other flights. These compensation levels will be reviewed four years after the regulation comes into effect. The UK voted against the regulation because in the absence of a link to the ticket price it could damage the interests of consumers of no-frills air services. During the debate, the Minister of State for Transport had voiced concern at the impact on the services of no-frills carriers, pointing out that the minimum compensation level was almost four times the average cost of a no-frills ticket. Following a suggestion from some member states that the scope of the regulation be extended to certain passengers returning to the EU from non-Community airports, it was agreed that the Commission would publish a report on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/5">Conclusions were agreed setting out the basis for the continuation of the Galileo satellite navigation project, including the tendering procedure, and addressing the importance of relations with third countries. A final decision on whether to include a public regulated service (PRS) in the project is to be taken before the end of 2003. The UK and the Netherlands entered a minutes statement stressing that they could not accept any PRS that would overlay the US GPS M-Code.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/6">The Council debated the second package of rail measures. The Presidency noted the progress that had been made on this package of five proposals, designed to progress the development of more harmonised technical standards for interoperability, harmonise safety regulation processes, to open up access to the market for all rail freight services and to establish a european rail agency. In discussion of the main outstanding issues on the safety and interoperability proposals there was a consensus for member states to be able to maintain safety levels above any harmonised minimum standard, and general support for extending the scope of the interoperability requirements. The Presidency concluded that work should continue on the package. Greece made clear that it hoped to reach agreeement during its Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/7">There was a debate on action to be taken following the &quot;Prestige&quot; accident. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Mr Jamieson), in common with other Ministers and the Commission, generally welcomed the Presidency's approach in the conclusions put to the Council. He joined others in arguing for better quality port state control inspections and expressed the UK view that in general there should be co-ordinated EU actions leading to improvements in the international regulatory framework. The conclusions reaffirmed the support of member states for the establishment of a supplementary compensation fund, developed in the IMO, to the benefit of the victims of oil pollution. This would enhance the existing international fund. The UK's concern was that the EU should not commit itself at this stage to its own fund in the event of failure of negotiations in the IMO for fear of prejudicing those negotiations, and we secured an amendment to this effect. The conclusions also include commitments to a faster phasing out of single-hulled tankers and restrictions on those carrying very heavy oil. There is to be an analysis of available double-hull tanker capacity. Also included are better implementation of port state control obligations and possible measures by member states to prohibit within 200 miles of their coasts traffic carrying dangerous and polluting goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/8">The Council agreed on a regulation establishing the Marco Polo programme to grant Community financial aid to projects designed to achieve the shift of freight transport from road to other modes. The programme will have a total budget of 75 million euros.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/9">Political agreement was reached on a regulation to prohibit the use of environmentally damaging anti-fouling paints on ships, in accordance with the latest IMO agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/10">Conclusions were agreed on the integration of environment and sustainable development into transport policy, a continuation of the process begun at the Cardiff European Council in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/11">The Council debated the issue of alpine transit and the ecopoint system for transit through Austria. Agreement could not be reached, and the Presidency submitted the dossier to the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/12">During the Council, Ministers signed the Agreement on Maritime Transport between the European Community and its member states and the People's Republic of China. hp</p>

	<p pid="a.148.3/1">The first stage of the quinquennial review (QQR) of the Met Office has been completed. This has focused primarily on the future status of the Met Office and on the arrangements for strategic oversight by its parent department, the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/2">The stage 1 report examined a number of alternative status options for the Met Office but concluded that the Met Office should remain a trading fund agency of the Ministry of Defence for the foreseeable future. It concluded also that there was a need for a substantial reform of the arrangements for oversight of the agency by its owner, the Secretary of State for Defence. The recommended reforms comprise the reshaping of the Defence Met Board into a UK Met Board, including in its membership representatives of the three principal civil stakeholder interests in the Met Office's product (environment, transport and civil contingencies) alongside the existing defence stakeholder interest; the adoption of a more proactive stance by the new board, with the focus on identifying in advance and resolving key strategic issues so as to provide a clear policy framework for Met Office management; and the provision of adequate administrative support to the new board.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/3">We have today given our endorsement of these recommendations, and action is now in hand to give effect to them as soon as possible. It is planned that the UK Met Board should come into existence early in 2003. A copy of the QQR Stage 1 report has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.6/1">The transfer of some of the laboratories of the Public Health Laboratory Service to National Health Service trusts is one part of the preparation for creating the proposed health protection agency, which is itself one element of implementing the Chief Medical Officer's strategy for combating infectious diseases, Getting Ahead of the Curve. Our assessment of the impact of each element is therefore in the context of the entire strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.6/2">The transfers of these laboratories to NHS trusts will bring public health activities within the mainstream of the NHS and thereby strengthen and enhance its arrangements for protection of public health. In particular, the transfer will strengthen the four public health functions of all NHS laboratories (reporting the occurrence of infectious diseases, submitting relevant samples to reference laboratories for detailed testing, assisting with the investigation of outbreaks and with the development and implementation of local policies in infectious disease control) by providing the opportunity and incentive for all NHS microbiology laboratories to build on the examples of good practice in current PHLS laboratories. These transfers are essential to create a comprehensive, coherent surveillance and outbreak response system, as described in Getting Ahead of the Curve, and to ensure robust microbiology services to help implement the action plans for turberculosis, healthcare acquired infections, antibiotic resistance and blood-borne viruses.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.2/1">The Strategic Review of Pathology Services, published by the then NHS Executive in 1995, focused on key issues relating to the provision and commissioning of NHS pathology services. The review emphasised local decision-making and provided a number of possible models. In addition, it flagged up some of the ways in which anticipated advances in technology were likely to impact on the pathology services, for example, through improved communication with service users and better collaboration between services. The report was widely disseminated to NHS pathology services to consider, in the light of the recommendations made, how to maintain and develop high quality, cost-effective clinical services responsive to the needs of patients and users.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2">The NHS Plan, subsequently published in 1997, set out the vision for the NHS to offer people fast and convenient care delivered to a consistently high standard. This overtook the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Pathology Services. Where relevant, for example, on collaboration on service reconfiguration, appropriate access to 24-hour services, and developing guidance on specialised pathology, the recommendations have been implemented. The Department of Health recognised the critical role of pathology services in the effective treatment and care of patients, in protecting the public health and in national screening programmes. We also recognised the pressure on them to maintain quality in the face of increasing workloads and the challenges facing them of technological and scientific change. As part of our modernisation programme for the NHS, in 1999 we therefore established the pathology modernisation programme (PMP), a 10-year programme to modernise NHS pathology services.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/3">The first three years of the PMP (from 1999&ndash;2000 to 2001&ndash;02) concentrated on capital investment to support service modernisation: &pound;28 million capital funding was awarded to 39 demonstration projects for smaller-scale service reconfigurations; technology and IT upgrades; rationalisation of specialist services; and larger-scale reconfiguration projects to support the development of managed pathology networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4">In 2002 the PMP has developed and published for consultation draft guidance Pathology&mdash;the Essential Service for the NHS. We are currently considering the responses to the consultation and will publish final guidance, revised in the light of the views received, in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/1">It is difficult to arrive at an estimate of the cost to society attributable to alcohol-related harm, as there are a number of widely different factors which need to be taken into account. The majority of the funding for prevention and treatment is spent via the general budgets of primary care trusts and local social service departments, which is consistent with provision being determined following a local consideration of need. This method of funding means that it is not possible to give details of the amount spent on the prevention and treatment of alcohol misuse. However, latest estimates indicate that &pound;95 million per year is spent on alcohol treatment in England, and that most of this funding is provided by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.5/1">Information collected centrally about the cause of deaths does not systematically record whether a death is attributable to alcohol misuse. A number of health and lifestyle factors can contribute to diseases such as cancer, stroke and coronary heart disease, and it can be difficult to isolate alcohol consumption as the most important of these factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/2">Estimates of the number of deaths range between 5,000 and 40,000 deaths per annum in England and Wales, reflecting the wide range of methods of calculation used in studies covering the number of alcohol related deaths. Consequently the trend data requested are not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.5/1">National Health Service franchising is a new approach being taken by the Department of Health to find the best available managers to take over the functions of the chief executive and, where necessary, other senior management positions in, and to identify organisations which might be called upon to exercise the functions of, some of the most poorly performing NHS trusts in England. The prime goal under new franchised management arrangements will be to address the particular areas where a trust has performed poorly and to demonstrate its capacity to sustain improved performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/2">Franchising will bring in new management skills to trusts that have been under-performing, as part of the Government's wider drive to raise standards in all parts of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/3">Until now, NHS franchises have only been awarded to suitably qualified people within the NHS. The department has now widened these opportunities to other areas of the public sector, the voluntary sector and the private sector, as well as to suitably qualified individuals, by inviting formal applications from both within and outside the NHS for inclusion on the NHS franchising register of expertise.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/4">The names of the organisations on the National Health Service franchising register of expertise have been published today and a copy has been placed in the Library. It is also available on the Department of Health's website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/nhsfranchising">www.doh.gov.uk/nhsfranchising</a>. The register includes 62 NHS trusts whose three star status gives them automatic inclusion on the register, Trent Strategic Health Authority and eight private sector organisations&mdash;five of which are based in Britain, one in Germany, one in Canada and one has its parent company based in Sweden.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/5">The NHS Appointments Commission set up an independent panel, under the chairmanship of Sir William Wells, to assess the applications received from organisations and individuals who expressed an interest following national advertisements in May 2002. The criteria for entry to the register were designed to assess interested parties' expertise and commitment to the public service ethos necessary to turn round failing NHS organisations and services in the future. The criteria included a commitment to the ethos of public services, expertise in managing and improving performance in large and complex service delivery organisations and an excellent track record in both financial and human resource management.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/6">Following the July 2002 performance star ratings, the management of two zero star trusts will be franchised. These are United Bristol Hospitals NHS Trust and Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/7">The Good Hope Hospital NHS Trust, Birmingham, will also be franchised following an investigation around the mismanagement of waiting list figures. As a result the trust has been reclassified to zero star. The trust held a disciplinary hearing at which the chief executive was found guilty of gross misconduct and summarily dismissed. The data underlying the trust's star rating has been reviewed and the performance rating recalculated.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/8">The department will shortly be inviting those on the NHS franchising register of expertise to tender for the franchises in these trusts early in the new year, along with the interim management team at Bath.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.0/1">There are no plans to introduce the international phonetic alphabet into schools. Primary pupils, through the National Literacy Strategy (NLS), are already taught to read using a range of strategies including both synthetic and analytic phonics, as well as other strategies such as grammar and context. The NLS advocates the Searchlights model of teaching children to read which emphasises the central importance of early phonics but also accepts that children will attempt to make sense of a wide range of print and texts during the course of mastering the phonic code.</p>
