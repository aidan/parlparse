	<p pid="c.9.1/2" qnum="HL1637">What measures are in place for the reporting and investigating of incidents of exposure to contaminated air in United Kingdom aircraft; how many reports have been received for each year since 1995; how many of these reports were investigated; and what conclusions were drawn.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-11-01c.9.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="9"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo051101/text/51101w01.htm#51101w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.9.2/1">The Civil Aviation Authority's mandatory occurrence reporting scheme requires reports of contaminated air events where they are considered by the reporter to represent potential airworthiness concerns. To identify the serious events from these, CAA review all smoke and fume events that may be related to engine oil and categorise them by the severity of the reported symptoms, as experienced by the pilots. The severity ranges from a brief smell of smoke or oil, to some form of impairment.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.2/2">The numbers of reports made to CAA since 1995 are as follows and in parentheses are the number of those events that involved pilot impairment.</p>
	<table>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.9.2/12">As a result of these reports, all of which were investigated, specific continued airworthiness actions have been taken in respect of BAe146 and Boeing 757 aircraft to mitigate any effects and to reduce the frequency of occurrence.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.2/13">The CAA believes that the increase in reports received in recent years is due to better reporting. However, the number of events where impairment has been reported has remained low.</p>

	<p pid="c.12.0/1">The Government are taking forward a number of reforms intended to minimise miscarriages of justice, both for defendants and victims. These include provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to ensure that the correct charges are brought, with the Crown Prosecution Service assuming the responsibility for determining the charge in cases other than routine offences. The 2003 Act also amended the provisions governing the disclosure to the defence of unused prosecution material to introduce a new single objective test for disclosure. This should assist in ensuring that relevant material is disclosed to the defence earlier. The independent Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) recently announced that two academics have been given permission to review cases that the CCRC has considered dating back to 1997, when the commission was established. The research includes an examination of expert evidence, with specific reference as to whether changes might assist in avoiding future miscarriages of justice.</p>

	<p pid="c.13.5/1">Planning for housing policies, currently set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 3 (PPG3), aim to secure sustainable, well-designed development that makes the best use of land, and which is sensitive to the impact it has on the environment and the surrounding area. Where planning applications are made for permission to be given to add a second or third storey to a house, it will be for local planning authorities to consider such applications on their individual merits, having regard to local circumstances set out in their development plans and to the guidance set out in PPG3. The Government do not therefore consider it necessary to introduce into national planning policy guidance the presumption suggested by the noble Lord.</p>

	<p pid="c.13.8/1">The Government do not have precise estimates of the cost of providing public services specifically to migrants. In 2002 the Home Office published research into the net fiscal contribution of migrants. This was based on figures for 1999&ndash;2000 and estimated that migrants (defined as foreign born) made a net fiscal contribution of &pound;2.5 billion. This research was recently updated by IPPR based on figures for 2003&ndash;04 (Sriskandarajah, Cooley and Reed: <i>Paying their way: the fiscal contribution of immigrants in the UK</i>, IPPR, London, 2005). This found that migrants (defined as the foreign born) accounted for 9.6 per cent of the population, yet 1 per cent of government revenue and only 9.1 per cent of government expenditure. The Government do not calculate the capital cost of providing infrastructure as a means of determining the number of immigrants who should be admitted to the UK.</p>

If any disciplinary matters regarding an officer above the rank of chief superintendent arises from the IPCC investigation into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Metropolitan Police Authority must deal with them under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2004. In regard to the complaint against the commissioner of the metropolis, the Metropolitan Police Authority must deal with it, subject to the requirements of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Police Reform Act 2002. If the IPCC determines that the complaint must be investigated by the Metropolitan Police Authority, then the authority must refer the matter to the Secretary of State for the Home Department who will nominate a person to conduct the investigation.</p>

The company that was responsible for monitoring the offender has altered its own procedures to bring them into line with our requirements.
