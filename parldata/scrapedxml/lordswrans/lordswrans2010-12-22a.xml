	<p pid="a.322.2/9">Following the Spending Review, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Norman Baker) spoke to the Confederation of Passenger Transport which was hopeful that, in general, the small reduction in BSOG could be absorbed without fares having to rise. Indicative estimates produced by the department suggest that the changes in concessionary travel reimbursement guidance may lead to a reduction in passenger journeys in England outside London between 1 per cent and 1.8 per cent, and an increase in fares between 1 per cent and 1.8 per cent. It has not been possible to directly model the likely impact on rural areas as we do not know the extent to which local authorities will apply the non-statutory guidance and in which instances local authorities will decide to tender services that might be withdrawn by operators on commercial grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.2/10">No information is available on the number of services that local authorities classify as socially necessary. However, subsidised bus services funded by local authorities accounted for 22 per cent of the total mileage operated by bus services in 2009-10 in England outside London. It is for local authorities to decide what services to provide in the light of resource available and local priorities. The simplification of local transport funding undertaken through the Spending Review will give local authorities greater flexibility, enabling solutions to be tailored for the specific needs and circumstances of individual communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.326.11/1">The UK aid programme in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) does not specifically focus on agriculture. Support to DRC's agricultural sector is led by Belgium, the United States and the World Bank. DRC still benefits indirectly from a range of regional and continental initiatives tackling climate change adaptation. However, DfID recording systems do not routinely disaggregate country level expenditure under such programmes. Compiling the requested information would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.11/2">The UK supports adaptation to climate change in DRC, through its &#163;50 million contribution to the Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF), which seeks to alleviate poverty and tackle climate change and sustainable forest management. DRC is one of 10 Congo Basin countries eligible for funding. One of the fourteen projects approved and in receipt of funds directly seeks to support poor farmers in DRC. Action for the Development of Agriculture and Fisheries to promote the Environment (ADAPEL), a local Congolese environment and development NGO, is implementing a pilot project in 10 villages in DRC's Equator Province to replace slash-and-burn farming. The practice is being replaced with a system that uses bio-char, a carbon-rich product derived from biomass found on previously cleared forest land to enrich soil fertility and improve agricultural yields on a more sustainable basis, therefore lessening pressure to encroach on forested land. Using crop residues to produce bio-char also generates renewable energy in a low-cost manner, so reducing local dependency on firewood.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.11/3">DfID recognises that smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The UK Government have committed to providing &#163;1.5 billion in Fast Start finance over the period 2010-12, to help the developing world carry out the urgent work needed to adapt to climate change, adopt clean technology and reduce emissions from deforestation. This year, the UK is allocating approximately 41 per cent of its Fast Start allocation for adaptation, a significant share of which has been designed to benefit smallholder farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.11/4">In December 2010, the Secretary of State for International Development announced extra support to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which will include &#163;7.2 million for a programme to help adapt farming systems in the developing world to climate change. The UK Government also support the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa-of which DRC is a member-to support research into agricultural issues, including climate change adaptation.</p>

	<p pid="a.327.2/1">As set out in the Statement on the Independent Living Fund on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-26">26 July 2010</phrase>, the decision to close the fund to new applicants for 2010-11 was taken to ensure that the fund remained within its &#163;348 million budget set by the previous Government, not to free up funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.2/2">The Independent Living Fund was originally designed to provide financial assistance for around 500 people and last for five years. However, it is now topping up local authority support of 21,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.2/3">The Independent Living Fund is a discretionary fund which makes direct cash payments to severely disabled people to purchase personal care or help with domestic duties from a care agency or privately employed personal assistant. Local authorities already have primary responsibility to provide social care support to their residents and the Independent Living Fund supplements this. As part of this responsibility they will need to consider the requirements of clients who may otherwise have received an additional Independent Living Fund package.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.2/4">Although core funding for DWP falls by 26 per cent in real terms over SR10, we have decided that throughout this Parliament the Independent Living Fund will continue to support existing awards and we will fully protect the programme budget for existing recipients. We are therefore protecting 21,000 disabled people currently in receipt of Independent Living Fund awards.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.2/5">In addition in 2011, following the publication of the report by the Commission on the Funding of Care and Support, we will carry out a formal consultation on the future of the ILF. This will inform decisions on determining how best to continue to support existing users of the ILF in a social care system based on the principles of personalised budgets, the findings of the Commission and recognising the importance of the support that ILF users have built their lives around. We will consult fully with disabled people, particularly current users of the Independent Living Fund and their families, local authorities and other interested parties, including the devolved administrations.</p>

	<p pid="a.335.2/1">Agriculture in Ghana is mainly fed by rain, with very little irrigation. Latest projections of climate change point to increasingly erratic rains and rising temperatures. This year, seasonal rains have continued late and been far above normal, particularly in the poorer north, which has caused extensive flooding. The National Disaster Management Organization estimated that up to 140,000 people were affected in October, losing household goods, food stocks and field crops. Overall, the likely food security scenario for the next four months is moderate, with food available in both rural and urban areas. However, areas heavily affected by floods are likely to experience food insecurity and loss of income until the next harvest.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.2/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) is currently providing support to poor and marginal farmers through several channels, including; work through the Government's social protection programme, which is being scaled up, funding CARE to undertake a community-based adaptation programme in two northern districts and supporting the Government in developing their national climate change policy framework. This highlights the needs of poor and excluded groups and the vulnerability of agriculture. DfID Ghana is currently considering a dedicated contribution towards the flood response as the situation develops.</p>

Overall, the Government estimate that around 25 per cent of the lowest-paid graduates, regardless of their family background, will pay less than under the current system, and that 25 per cent of the highest earners will repay more than 100 per cent of their original loan.

	<p pid="a.340.8/1">I refer the noble Lord to the Answer given on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-15">15 December 2010</phrase>, 197WA which provided data on those detained in immigration removal centres beyond 12 months. Management information shows that the vast majority of those detained for such periods are former foreign national prisoners who we are seeking to deport from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.8/2">Detention plays a key role in maintaining an effective immigration control. It is used only where necessary and is kept to the shortest time possible. Each case is considered on its individual merits, and there remains a general presumption in favour of release. Many factors will be taken into account, including the risk of absconding and the risk of further harm to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.8/3">Deportation of these individuals can be delayed in a number of ways. Judicial challenges can be used to delay or frustrate removal. This is being tackled through improved legal case working within the UK Border Agency and closer co-operation with the judiciary. Where there are difficulties in obtaining travel documents these issues are taken up directly with the relevant Embassy or High Commission. There may also be delays in the deportation process if individuals do not comply fully with the UK Border Agency's efforts to re-document them.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.8/4">Every effort is made to ensure that a foreign prisoner's deportation coincides, as far as possible, with his or her release from prison. Where sentence length allows, deportation will be considered up to 18 months prior to the earliest point of removal. It is expected that in 2010 around a third of all foreign prisoner removals will have occurred before the end of sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.8/5">As Lin Homer, Chief Executive of the UK Border Agency, advised the Home Affairs Committee in July, the new government is committed to exploring ways of removing foreign criminals even earlier. This will include working with the prisons, courts and the police to build upon our capacity to gather intelligence information on nationality at an earlier stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.341.2/2">As part of the review, the UK Border Agency looked at the approaches taken in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden. No one jurisdiction provides all the answers, and comparisons are difficult to draw not only for reasons of culture and geography but also because of differences in the overall systems for dealing with migrants in other countries. But some common themes emerge from a number of countries around the emphasis on positive engagement with families and maximising the opportunities for them to co-operate with their return; these have been built into the approach we have now set out for the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.342.2/1">Sir Michael Marmot's review, <I>Fair Society, Healthy Lives</I>, is the latest assessment of the impact of the wider social determinants on health, including socioeconomic factors, on life expectancy. This review, commissioned by the Government, reported earlier this year. Its findings have informed policy across government.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.2/2">The review concluded that socioeconomic factors, along with the other determinants of health, significantly contribute to inequalities in life expectancy and other health outcomes. The Government recognise that reducing health inequalities is a matter of fairness and social justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.2/3">Policies to address these inequalities are being developed actively across government. In particular, <I>Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS</I> (Cm 7881) proposes a National Health Service health inequalities duty and a health premium to reward progress in improving health and reducing health inequalities. Deprivation in communities is associated with need for health care services, and is recognised in the formula for primary care trust revenue allocations. <I>Healthy Lives, Healthy People</I> (Cm 7985) responds to the Marmot review and adopts its life-course framework for tackling the wider social determinants of health as part of a commitment to help people live longer, healthier lives and improve the health of the poorest fastest. The health inequalities in life expectancy outcomes are a key measure of this approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.346.5/1">The coalition Government made a commitment to increase health spending in real terms. In October the Spending Review delivered this. Nevertheless, the Government made clear the need for the National Health Service to make efficiency improvements of up to &#163;20 billion over the next four years to re-invest in meeting rising demands and to improve outcomes. This includes a one-third reduction in the costs of administration that will save &#163;1.9 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.5/2">The NHS Chief Executive first outlined the likely scale of the efficiency challenge in May 2009, and NHS organisations have therefore been planning towards meeting this challenge for some time, through the Quality Innovation Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) programme. The NHS Operating Framework for 2011-12, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-15">15 December 2010</phrase>, set out the requirement for NHS organisations to formulate single integrated plans setting out how they intend to deliver on quality, efficiency and reform over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.5/3">While delivery of efficiency and quality improvements must be locally led, the Government have also taken action centrally to support delivery. For example, the Operating Framework announced that the tariff prices received by providers of NHS services will be subject to a 4 per cent efficiency requirement in 2011-12. The two-year pay freeze across the public services, excepting lower-paid workers, will also help the NHS in delivering efficiency improvements.</p>

	<p pid="a.353.8/1">The Government have not quantified the volume of all of the public benefits on the public forest estate (PFE) in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.8/2">The PFE is the largest single landholding owned by the state and is managed by the Forestry Commission. It covers 258,000 hectares of land, 2 per cent of the total land area of England, and 18 per cent of England's woodland in 1,500 sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.8/3">It provides a significant proportion of all the goods and services from England's woods and forests. The remaining non forested areas are composed of open habitats, such as heath land, upland mires and open space, including as part of wooded green space around urban areas, as well as other non-wooded land use types such as car parks.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.8/4">The wooded habitat comprises over 151,000 hectares of conifers and more than 66,000 hectares of broadleaved woodland, with 53,213 hectares of ancient woodland. The PFE:</p>
	<p pid="a.353.8/5">produces 60 per cent of England's home grown timber;</p>
	<p pid="a.353.8/6">26 per cent of the estate is designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interests (SSSIs) with 98 per cent of which are in &quot;favourable&quot; or &quot;recovering&quot; condition; and</p>
	<p pid="a.353.8/7">45 per cent of the estate sits within our nationally most important landscapes (national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty).</p>
	<p pid="a.353.8/8">The PFE is a significant place to in our country's carbon sequestration. It currently stores about 129 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e): in the trees (48MtCO2e); and in the soil (81MtCO2e). The harvested timber and wood-fuel also have the potential to substitute for 1-2 MtCO2 per year through reduced fossil fuel emissions as a consequence of its use.
