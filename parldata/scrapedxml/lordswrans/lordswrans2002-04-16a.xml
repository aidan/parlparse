	<p pid="a.143.5/1">It is the responsibility of any person using a rifle or shotgun to ensure that any shots are made safely. Before starting to shoot they should be aware of all footpaths, bridleways and rights of way and ensure that the angles of fire are safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/2">It is not a specific offence to shoot across a public right of way. But doing so could amount to a common law nuisance; wilful obstruction of the highway under the Highways Act 1980, Section 137; or intimidation under the Highways Act, Section 130, if any person is threatened in any way.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/3">Under Section 161 of the Highways Act 1980, it is an offence for any person, without lawful authority or excuse, to discharge any firearm within 50 feet of the centre of any highway which comprises a carriageway if, in consequence, any user is injured, interrupted or endangered. This applies to rights of way where there are vehicular rights only.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/4">Under the Local Government Act 1972, Schedule 14, paragraphs 23 and 26, it is an offence to discharge a firearm in any street.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/5">When it comes into force, the new right of access to open country and registered common land under Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act may be subject to exclusions or restrictions. An owner or agricultural tenant will have discretion to close or restrict access for up to 28 days each year and applications may be made for further closures or restrictions in the interests of land management and safety, for example, where it is proposed to shoot over land.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/6">If the police have reason to believe that a shooter represents a danger to public safety they can revoke the holder's certificate.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">We have today made an order which will bring into force Section 130 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 across England and Wales. It will do so on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-22">22 April 2002</phrase> in the 10 street-crime initiative areas&mdash;London, Manchester, West Midlands, Merseyside, Thames Valley, Lancashire, Avon &amp; Somerset, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire&mdash;and on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-16">16 September 2002</phrase> in the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/2">This section will give new powers to the courts to remand a 12 to 16 year-old into secure detention where they are of the view that the child or young person has a recent history of repeatedly committing imprisonable offences while on bail or in local authority accommodation. In such a case the court must be satisfied that only a secure remand would protect the public from serious harm from him or her or that only a secure remand would be adequate to prevent the commission of further imprisonable offences by him or her.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/3">We have also made an order which brings into force Sections 131 and 132 of the same Act which allow courts to tag 12 to 16 year-olds while on bail or on remand to local authority accommodation. This will increase the number of options available to the courts for dealing with children and young people who repeatedly offend while on bail as an alternative to custody. It will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-22">22 April 2002</phrase> in the 10 street-crime areas listed above, plus Northumbria, and in the rest of the country on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-01">1 June 2002</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.5/2">However, further information on courthouse closures has been received from the magistrates' courts committees since that Answer and there were five courthouses of which my department had not been informed previously. I have therefore added those closures to the attached list and identified them.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/3">The Government's policy is that decisions on the number and location of magistrates' courts in England and Wales are for the individual magistrates' courts committees to determine, in consultation with their local paying authority. In addition, the magistrates' courts committees are not statutorily required required to inform the Lord Chancellor's Department of proposed courthouse closures.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-04-16a.147.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100325" speakername="Lord Irvine of Lairg" colon=":" colnum="147"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020416/text/20416w02.htm#20416w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.147.2/1">In relation to the Crown Court and county courts, only Chepstow and Monmouth county courts have closed since November 2001. A proposal to close Gateshead county court is currently going through public consultation, but no final decision has been made. Public consultation has also taken place on the proposal to close Gravesend county court. Following the consultation the decision has been taken that the court will not close until an alternative venue can be found in Gravesend to hold hearings.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">No Crown Court closures are planned, with the exception of the satellite Crown Court at Knutsford, where public consultation started on <phrase class="date" code="">10 April</phrase>. There is an on-going process of consultation in relation to the civil courts which started with initial consultation through the Modernising the Civil Courts consultation process in 2001. This is looking to future methods by which the civil courts will deliver services. The aim is to maintain a sitting presence in current locations and in fact I anticipate an overall increase in the number of places where sittings take place, particularly in rural areas where there is a civil justice need not currently being met.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">The Government's policy is that decisions on the number and location of magistrates' courts in England and Wales are for the individual magistrates' courts committees to determine, in consultation with their local paying authorities. Although the department collects details concerning the closure of magistrates' courthouses only quarterly in arrears, we are aware so far that since November 2001 Arundel magistrates' courthouse was closed on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-01">1 December 2001</phrase> and Bridgenorth and Leominster courthouses were closed on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-31">31 January 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4">The magistrates' courts committees are not statutorily required to inform the Lord Chancellor's Department of proposed courthouse closures. However, a paying authority can lodge an appeal to the Lord Chancellor against a proposed courthouse closure. The department has received seven appeals that concern the proposed closure of the following courthouses:</p>

Successful elections in November, in which both Kosovar Albanians and Serbs participated, led to the establishment of the new provisional institutions of self-government. With the active support of the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo and the rest of the international community, progress is being made on rebuilding Kosovo's infrastructure and developing its economy.

He announced the results of the initial phase of work in his Written Answer in another place of <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-17">17 October 2001</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 1223&ndash;24W) to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1339" name="Anthony D Wright">my honourable friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr Wright)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/2">The review team has now completed its work and we have placed a summary of its conclusions in the Library of the House. In brief, the main points are that:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/3" class="indent">there must be a clearer focus on delivery of the two key defence medical outputs&mdash;deployable operational medical capability, and timely appropriate healthcare for service personnel;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/4" class="indent">accountability for the delivery of these outputs by both central and single-service authorities must be defined unambiguously, as part of a clear tri-service strategy and plan;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/5" class="indent">the Surgeon General (SG), working to the Vice Chief of Defence Staff, will be empowered to undertake effective oversight and direction of the DMS in meeting the key output requirements, including those elements which remain under single-service management;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/6" class="indent">a stronger partnership will be established between the DMS and the National Health Service;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/7" class="indent">management capabilities throughout the DMS will be strengthened, drawing on expertise from the parent services and, where relevant, the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/8">The Defence Medical Services will be re-aligned and restructured to focus more effectively on the two key defence medical outputs. The DSCA will be disestablished on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, with its training-related functions transferring to an expanded medical training agency, and healthcare commissioning being undertaken by a new group within the Surgeon General's staff. The MSA has now transferred into the Defence Logistics Organisation as of <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/9">The review has provided an important opportunity to take stock of the progress that has been made since the announcement of the new strategy for the DMS at the end of 1998. It is no surprise that it has concluded that while much has been done over the last three years, there are further steps to be taken&mdash;and changes to be made&mdash;that will help the process of restoring DMS capability and ensuring that key defence medical outputs are delivered. The Government are committed to achieving those aims and, subject to the normal consultative process, to implementing the outcome of the review.</p>

We asked the Advisory Committee on Consumer Products and the Environment to examine the case for setting up a national scheme as well as part of its remit to look at the role of product information in driving up standards of environmental performance. The committee's advice (in its first report, Choosing Green) was that it would not be cost-effective to set up a national ecolabelling award scheme at this stage and that resources for improving product information could be applied more effectively on other initiatives. The Minister for the Environment has indicated to the chair of the committee, Dr Alan Knight, that these other options seem more promising at this stage, and should be examined further.

	<p pid="a.153.3/1">Accounting standards are a matter for the Accounting Standards Board, which is independent of government. Financial Report Standard 17 sets out how companies must show the costs of retirement provision in their accounts. Companies must comply with FRS17 by 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.3/2">There is a proposal that EU companies should comply with international accounting standards by 2005. The international standard corresponding to FRS17 (IAS 19) currently allows companies to smooth the effects of fluctuations in pension scheme asset values in their balance sheets, although the International Accounting Standards Board is reviewing this standard. Smoothing is not permitted by FRS17.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.6/17">From <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-08">8 April 2002</phrase> the preserved rights rates of income support were abolished and local authorities became responsible for arranging and funding care for those customers. The residential allowance and Part 3 rates of income support also ceased to be paid for all new claims from <phrase class="date" code="">8 April</phrase>. This arrangement will provide a fairer system of funding for long-term care and will concentrate resources at the point where decisions are made on the appropriate care for individuals. This will ensure more effective and flexible support to the vulnerable people in our society.</p>
