Funds are channelled through the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees, and non-governmental organisations. All have an important role in Palestinian development. The Government's strategy for support to Palestinians aims to help the Palestinian Authority to be responsible for a larger percentage of services itself. Total budgeted expenditure for the current financial year of &pound;26.5 million is &pound;2 million more than the originally budgeted expenditure for the previous year. The Secretary of State for International Development announced at the weekend an additional &pound;2 million to help meet the immediate needs of the people of Rafah.</p>

In general, fire and rescue authorities may not charge for giving advice under Section 1(1)(f) or for acting as a statutory consultee. Similar provisions are included in the Fire and Rescue Services Bill currently before the House of Lords.

	<p pid="a.29.8/1">Under their accession agreements, each of the eight countries listed in the Excise Duty Points (Etc.) (New Member States) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1003) are allowed transitional periods within which to meet EU minimum duty rates on cigarettes and certain other tobacco products. During these transitional periods, member states may impose quantitative restrictions on quantities of these products from those countries imported for personal use. However, before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, both the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Malta met the minimum duty rate requirement. Therefore no quantitative restrictions have been required.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">Traditionally, efficiency in the National Health Service has been measured using the cost weighted efficiency index but changes in the way healthcare is delivered now mean that it gives an increasingly incomplete and misleading picture. Therefore, an update was not published in the 2004 departmental report.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/2">The main drawbacks of the cost weighted efficiency index are that it:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/3" class="indent">fails to count a large amount of NHS activity&mdash;for example primary care consultations/procedures, nurse led procedures, family health services prescriptions, NHS Direct calls and walk-in centre visits;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/4" class="indent">takes no account of quality such as better health outcomes, shorter waiting times, single sex wards or cleaner hospitals;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/5" class="indent">classifies activity in only 12 activity types, two of which (inpatients and outpatients) account for 85 per cent of the cost weights. This limits the ability to measure changes in case-mix; and</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/6" class="indent">perversely records shifts in activity from inpatients to outpatients and from outpatients to primary or community care as inefficiency.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.5/1">The Government are working to promote the most extensive rollout of broadband, including providing &pound;30 million via the UK Broadband Fund to regional development agencies and devolved administrations to develop broadband networks and run pilot projects and over &pound;1 billion between 2003&ndash;06 for broadband connectivity for public services. Defra and the DTI are working together to facilitate the rollout of broadband in rural areas both through the provision of advice and guidance and through support for community organisations. Our success to date has been recognised by the OECD. The OECD report on <i>The Development of Broadband Access in Rural and Remote Areas</i> published in May 2004 found the achievement of 85 per cent DSL coverage by the end of February 2004 and the revised goal of 99.6 per cent coverage by summer 2005 showed the success of the UK Government's approach in relying on competition to expand broadband availability.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/2">The Countryside Agency's maps relating to the new right of access under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 are available in paper form but they can also be viewed on the Internet using dial-up connections as well as via broadband. If landowners and tenant farmers prefer to make use of broadband connections and these are not available in their homes, over 85 per cent of libraries have such connections.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/3">The maps may be viewed in a number of places in paper form. Relevant provisional maps have been sent to library authorities, local libraries, local authorities (with additional copies to selected libraries and commons registration offices), national park authorities and parish councils. As conclusive maps are produced, they are also being sent in paper form to appropriate local authorities, national park authorities and parish councils. Both provisional and conclusive maps are available for viewing at Countryside Agency offices in Cheltenham, Bristol, Manchester, and regional offices within the mapping area concerned. Precise details of where members of the public may view the provisional and conclusive maps in paper form can be obtained by telephoning the Open Access Contact Centre on 0845 100 3298.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/4">Copies of the provisional and conclusive maps in paper form are also available to purchase by calling 0870 122 1242.</p>
