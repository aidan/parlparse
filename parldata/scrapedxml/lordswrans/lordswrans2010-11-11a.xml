I can confirm the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has full sovereign authority, including for security, over all 34 Afghan Provinces. Endorsed by United Nations Security Resolution 1386 and subsequent resolutions, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) assists the Afghan National Security Forces in the maintenance of security throughout Afghanistan. Work is now under way to set up a conditions-based process, overseen by a joint Afghan-North Atlantic Treaty Organisation board, to assess the readiness of provinces to start the process of transition from an ISAF to an Afghan security lead. We are confident that a number of provinces will be assessed as ready to begin transition in the first half of 2011, but we should not pre-empt the recommendations of the board.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-11-11a.101.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100286" speakername="Lord Henley" colon=":" colnum="101"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101111w0001.htm#10111153000004">
	<p pid="a.101.5/1">Defra does not carry out twice-yearly censuses. The only census we run is the June Census of Agriculture, which is required to be carried out only once every 10 years under EU Regulation 1166/2008. We introduced a threshold into the 2010 census so the smallest farms (of which there are around 100,000 in England) were not surveyed, and we only collected the minimum information possible to meet legal requirements. In non-census years we run a smaller sample survey to capture information on the structures of farms in terms of crop areas, livestock populations and farm employee numbers. A project is currently under way to substantially reduce the sample size and volume of information required from 2011 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/2">The second largest agricultural survey run by Defra, known to many as the December Census of Agriculture, has not been a census since the mid 1950s. This survey captures information on winter sown crop areas and cattle, pig and sheep populations under EU Regulations 543/2009 (crops) and 1165/2008 (livestock). The sampling size for this survey, which was 15,000 in 2009 (a sampling rate of 7 per cent), has been reduced to 5,000 for 2010 by using administrative sources such as the cattle tracing system (for cattle populations) and the sheep and goat inventory (for sheep populations).</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/3">The data obtained by the June and December surveys has many uses. For example, crop areas are used heavily by industry as estimates of the potential size of the cereals harvest and livestock data is collected to monitor long term trends in livestock populations and to estimate the effects of common agricultural policy reform on livestock sectors. The data are also used heavily in calculations for the inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/4">Declarations of the use of farm saved seed are the responsibility of the British Society of Plant Breeders (BSPB), which acts on behalf of its members who hold the plant breeders' rights. The Food and Environment Research Agency, which has overall responsibility for the plant breeders' rights legislation, understands that the BSPB works efficiently to collect this information from farmers and makes the declarations as simple as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/5">In relation to re-mapping, we will look to see that lessons are learnt from the recent Rural Payments Agency's mapping update exercise so that, going forward, the burden on farmers is minimised. During the next round of common agricultural policy reform we will be placing a particular emphasis on simplification, including reviewing the necessity of requiring the sometimes very small changes to maps that are currently demanded.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/6">Finally, the Task Force on Farming Regulation was set up in July 2010 to identify ways of reducing regulatory burdens on farmers and to advise on how best to achieve a risk-based system of regulation. The task force is consulting widely and will report to Government in April 2011. A full list of members and terms of reference can be found on the Defra website at <a href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/2010/07/09/_farm-review/">http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/2010/07/09/_farm-review/</a>.</p>

However, the minutes of some policy discussions (such as the meetings of Commissioner groups) are not made public.

	<p pid="a.129.5/4">There is no requirement under the Council of Europe Convention against trafficking to create a specific right of appeal. The reasonable grounds decision is a low threshold which is made following multi-agency consultation and engagement. There is also an opportunity for interested parties to provide additional information if the competent authority is initially unable to make a positive identification. This helps to ensure that the right decisions are taken and victims are properly identified. There are also standard avenues for appealing immigration decisions, and a reasonable grounds decision can be subject to judicial review.</p>

Non-publicly funded companies providing higher education, like any other provider of higher education, have been able to apply to the Privy Council for powers to award their own degrees since the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 came into force. In 2007 BPP University College of Professional Studies became the first private sector company to be granted taught-degree-awarding powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.9/2">The Government want to make it easier for new providers who can offer excellent teaching and a high-quality experience for students to enter the higher education sector. However, this is one of a number of institutional issues in the wake of Lord Browne's independent review of higher education and student finance which requires thorough debate and consultation. We intend therefore to publish a higher education White Paper with proposals to which experts from the sector can react, leading to a Higher Education Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.2/1">The <I>Guide to Parliamentary Work</I>, published by the Cabinet Office in October 2009, contains the following guidance about the use of published documents and web-based statistics in parliamentary Answers:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/2">Readily available information and published sources</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/3">7.32 Members are advised that Questions &quot;must be seeking information that is not readily available elsewhere in the public domain'' (including in Answers to identical or similar Questions in a previous Session). Increasingly, this is the case as more and more information is available on government websites, though not necessarily in the format requested in the Question.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/4">7.33 Where an Answer makes use of published material (e.g. statistics, economic data or quotations from reports) the source should be given, as appropriate, either in the text of the Answer or as a footnote. Attached papers (for example, statistical tables) should be deposited in the Libraries of the House. If reference is made to documents in a response, copies of these documents must also be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/5">Referring to websites or other published material</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/6">7.37 Where information already exists on a Government website, it may not be appropriate to simply give the web address in the Answer. MPs may want information placed on the permanent record (ie in <I>Hansard</I>) and web pages are rarely permanent. Furthermore, departments should be helpful to MPs and Peers, particularly where the fact or figure requested is contained in a much larger set of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/7">7.38 If referring to websites, it is important to consider the implications. departments are advised to ensure that any URL given in an Answer connects directly to the information referred to (not a departmental homepage) and is working.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/8">Links provided should be available in perpetuity. Any information referred to in this way should be supplied to the Member in hard copy, and deposited in the Library in accordance with relevant guidance. In short;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/9">when copying the link use the URL that connects directly to the webpage/document referred to. Do not simply provide a link to the relevant website;when the URL has been inserted double-check it is accurate by clicking on it and checking that there is a straight link to the relevant Webpage/document; andit is helpful to add in the title/heading of the Webpage/document, its author and the website the information appears on to assist users in interpretation.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/10">7.39 It is advised that the Answer should give the Member the factual information requested (including supplying paper copies of the website pages), with an additional line in the Answer indicating that the information is already made readily available. In the long term, this may help to reduce the amount of questions seeking information that is already publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/11">7.40 Similarly, where the information requested is available in a document that has already been placed in the Library it may not be appropriate to simply refer to the document. Departments are advised to copy the requested information from the main document, where this is appropriate, to assist MPs and Peers. This is particularly helpful where a requested figure is contained as part of a much larger table.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/12">7.41 Where an Answer makes use of published material (e.g. statistics, economic data or quotations from reports) the source should be given, as appropriate, either in the text of the Answer or as a footnote. Attached papers (for example, statistical tables) should be deposited in the Library. If reference is made to documents in a response, copies of these documents must also be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/13">The<I> Guide to Parliamentary Work</I> is produced by the Office of the Leader of the House of Commons. It is published on the Cabinet Office website at the following address:</p>

	<p pid="a.135.2/1">The numbers of full- and part-time students applying for maintenance and tuition fee loan support from Autumn 2012 will depend on how students and institutions respond to the changes outlined in the Governments response to the Browne Review on Higher Education Funding, and how many students decide to take up the loan support that is available to them. Confirmed projections of numbers for each of the years of the spending review are therefore not possible. However, based on current data, it is likely that, under the proposed changes to the support package, around 1 million full-time students and 150,000 part-time students will be eligible for loan support.</p>
