	<p pid="a.65.3/1">In the Strategic Defence Review we rigorously re-examined our nuclear deterrence requirements. The review was made as open as possible to outside views. One factor of many that we considered was the size of our Trident submarine fleet. We concluded that we need a fleet of four Trident submarines to ensure that our minimum deterrent remains effective. The review also reported the planned launch of HMS &quot;Vengeance&quot;, our fourth Trident submarine. She was launched on <phrase class="date" code="1998-09-19">19 September 1998</phrase>; it is planned that she will enter service next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/2">At the 2000 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, the nuclear weapon states gave an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals--the most explicit pledge ever to work for global nuclear disarmament. The Government have clearly demonstrated their commitment to further international progress on non-proliferation and disarmament; the constructive role we played at the conference has been widely recognised and welcomed, as has been the contribution we have already made by reducing our deterrence posture to the levels announced in the Strategic Defence Review.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">Following the decision of the Civil Service Benevolent Fund to withdraw from the contract to run the King Edward VII convalescent home on behalf of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport we have concluded that it would not be sensible, appropriate or cost-effective to enter into an agreement with another organisation to run the home while we await Parliament's approval to repeal the relevant provision of the Osborne Estate Act 1902.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">The convalescent home will therefore close on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-31">31 October 2000</phrase>. The accommodation will remain out of use at least until December 2001 to allow English Heritage to complete, in the most efficient and cost-effective way, the restoration and repair of the external fabric of the building.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/3">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport is considering how he should meet his responsibility after December 2001 to devote part of Osborne House for the benefit of the Armed Forces and the Civil Service--which is not specified as the running of a convalescent home--for such time as that statutory requirement is in force.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.3/1">Sport England has agreed to pay &pound;3.14 million of the costs of the 2006 World Cup Bid from its Lottery Fund: &pound;2,975,649 of that amount had been paid to the Football Association before <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-05">5 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/2">Direct costs to the Government have arisen in respect of the previous Minister of Sport's visits to a number of countries in support of the bid. The cost of these visits was &pound;102,780, although some other government business was also conducted. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has also agreed to pay &pound;20,000 of the travelling expenses for the Prime Minister's special envoy.</p>
