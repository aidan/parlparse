	<p pid="c.57.3/1">The maximum sentence for the offence of rape is life imprisonment. Guidelines suggest a starting point of a five-year determinate sentence if the victim is an adult and there are no aggravating features. Martin Walsh was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of six years, equivalent to a 12-year determinate sentence. As Mr Walsh has been sentenced to life, he will be released after six years only if the independent Parole Board considers that is safe.</p>
	<p pid="c.57.3/2">The Government are consulting on proposals to reform the way that minimum terms for those sentenced to life imprisonment are calculated. The consultation suggests options for making this process clearer to the public so as to deal with the misperception that all offenders will be released at the end of the minimum custodial term set by the judge. Many offenders sentenced to indeterminate sentences in practice spend significantly longer in prison than the minimum term specified.</p>
	<p pid="c.57.3/3">We have already announced that we want judges to have more discretion so that they no longer have to reduce the sentence they impose by up to one-third for an early guilty plea, regardless of the circumstances. The Sentencing Guidelines Council is currently reviewing its guilty plea discount guideline.</p>

	<p pid="c.59.5/1">Accommodation needs assessments are intended to be an in-depth look across the range of Gypsies and Travellers residing in or resorting to a local authority's area. The assessment should include, where possible, Gypsies and Travellers living in bricks and mortar accommodation and travelling show people. It may also look at future migration into and out of the area. The caravan count on the other hand is a twice yearly &quot;snapshot&quot; of the number of caravans occupied by Gypsies and Travellers within the area, whether on authorised or unauthorised sites. While the set of data can act as a reference point for the other, there are many reasons why their respective results might not coincide.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.5/2">The department has issued interim guidance on conducting accommodation needs assessments, which will be finalised next spring. It is also supporting research to assist regional assemblies in determining patterns of provision at regional level. On this basis, we do not see a need for additional research. Regional assemblies will need to take account of all relevant information in developing their strategies, which will also be subject to consultation and examination in public.</p>

	<p pid="c.60.5/1">Government departments and NHS bodies can, under special refund arrangements, reclaim the VAT they are charged on certain contracted-out services. This refund scheme is designed to ensure that VAT costs do not create a disincentive for these bodies to contract services out.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.5/2">This VAT refund scheme is an exception to the normal principles of public funding; that departmental and NHS spending allocations are calculated to take into account VAT costs incurred in the course of delivering public services. As with any such exception, eligibility and definitions are applied strictly.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.5/3">The services for which VAT refunds are available are specified in an HM Treasury direction. There have been no recent changes to this direction in respect of staff provided through agencies, although HM Revenue and Customs, which administers the refund scheme, has recently clarified the rules in this area. VAT has been reclaimable on nursing services, agency nursing staff and certain administrative and clerical services, since the early days of this VAT refund scheme. In contrast, VAT incurred on the supply of administrative and clerical staff, and the supply of health professionals such as doctors, radiographers and physiotherapists, has never been eligible for refund under the terms of the direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.5/4">The direction is amended periodically and new services are added where a sufficiently strong case has been made for inclusion. HM Treasury recently invited government departments to submit suggestions for the next revision, which we expect to implement early in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.64.0/1">No formal assessment has been made of the number of British Olympic medal winners who have attended schools in the independent sector. Through the National School Sport Strategy, the Government are committed to increasing both the quality and quantity of PE and school sport for all pupils. Our main aim&mdash;a public service agreement target shared by DCMS and DfES&mdash;is to increase the percentage of five to 16 year-olds who take part in at least two hours high-quality PE and sport each week, within and beyond the curriculum, to 75 per cent by 2006 and on to 85 per cent by 2008. With 80 per cent of pupils in partnership schools spending at least two hours in a typical week on high-quality PE and school sport, the 2006 target has been exceeded. As part of this strategy, the &quot;Gifted and Talented&quot; workstrand offers targeted opportunities to support and nurture pupils with talent in PE and school sport. The programme focuses on pupils with clear potential as well as those who may be at risk of underachieving.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.0/2">In addition, the Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS) supports young people to pursue their sporting interests while continuing in higher and further education. So far, 2,600 young people have been supported by the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.0/3">Over 1,200 talented young athletes took part in five different sports at the inaugural UK School Games staged in Glasgow in September 2006. Competitors were selected&mdash;based on ability&mdash;by the national governing bodies of the sports and their school sports associations. Competitors came from both the maintained and the independent sectors. It is planned to stage this event annually up to 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.0/4">UK Sport and the Home Country Sports Councils have developed and adopted the equality standard to guide governing bodies towards equitable provision to seek to widen participation by targeting under represented groups. Many sports have already developed schemes specifically for schools in disadvantaged areas where the aim is that individuals with talent and desire will be able to progress to performance sport regardless of their background.</p>

	<p pid="c.66.5/2">Alongside other counter-terrorist tools, financial sanctions play an important role in helping to prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks and member states are obliged by United Nations Security Council resolutions and directly applicable EC regulations to freeze the assets of suspected terrorists and al-Qaeda associates without delay. Businesses are already under an obligation to comply with these requirements. It is on this basis that Treasury Ministers have judged that the benefits of the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 outweigh the costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.5/3">The regulatory impact assessment sets out that the impact of the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 on compliance costs is minimal because financial institutions already have to check whether they hold funds in the name of designated persons. None the less, the Government are mindful that compliance costs do arise from financial sanctions and they seek to reduce these as far as possible by ensuring that financial sanctions are well targeted and based on good identifying information. The Treasury will shortly be publishing data on the administration costs associated with financial sanctions in the UK.</p>
