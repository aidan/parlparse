	<p pid="a.195.9/5">&pound;581 million from the New Opportunities Fund is being invested to build and refurbish PE and sports facilities in schools.

	<p pid="a.198.5/2">It is not possible to estimate a figure for the number of surgical practitioners needed to ensure compliance with the Working Time Directive because compliance requires a range of different approaches in different trusts and services, only some of which will involve surgical practitioners.</p>

While this is a different role from that of surgical practitioner, it illustrates how different staff can contribute to a team-based approach to providing patient care. The project has shown that practitioners can be extremely effective both at saving junior doctor time, which can help a trust to achieve compliant rotas, and at improving the quality of patient care by, for example, reducing waiting times in clinics and enabling earlier discharge from hospital. It is working closely with the new ways of working in surgery project to share expertise and learning, and in all of these projects new practitioner roles are being combined with changes to working patterns of medical staff and to service delivery, which together improve Working Time Directive compliance.</p>
