	<p pid="b.157.2/1">The Government have no plans to introduce a new offence that specifically outlaws the playing of loud music from open-windowed vehicles. Existing legislation already provides a range of options that enable police forces and local authorities to address this problem. Relevant legislation is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.157.2/2">Police Reform Act 2002: local police forces may serve anti-social behaviour orders that can impose bans from certain roads, and there are even confiscation powers over vehicle owners in more serious cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.2/3">The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986: Regulation 97 states that,</p>
	<p pid="b.157.2/4" class="indent">&quot;no motor vehicle shall be used on a road in such a manner as to cause any excessive noise which could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the driver&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.2/5">On-road enforcement is by the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.2/6">Environmental Protection Act 1990: under Section 79, as amended by the Noise and Statutory Nuisance Act 1993, loud music from stationary vehicles may also be defined as a statutory nuisance. Environmental health officers, therefore, have powers to serve abatement notices during these incidents. Failure to comply can lead to fines and confiscation of equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.2/7">As set out in Chapter 7 of the <i>Respect Action Plan</i>, the Government are also considering how law enforcement methods for such offences can be improved.</p>

	<p pid="b.157.5/1">All caseworkers in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate who are responsible for considering asylum claims are obliged to follow the asylum policy instruction on gender issues. I am satisfied that in most cases the guidance is being followed. I am aware of recent criticism by Asylum Aid that caseworkers do not always apply the gender guidelines correctly. The Home Office is carefully examining the Asylum Aid report and will make changes to the process if it is appropriate to do so. Home Office officials will meet Asylum Aid on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-12">12 May</phrase> to discuss the report.</p>

They will develop this with primary care trusts (PCTs) and NHS trusts in their area. This will include creating local reserves to deal with local problems.

	<p pid="b.161.5/1">The financial implications of amalgamating different levels of precept remain under consideration. We are presently working on transitional arrangements to allow for convergence of precepts over several years. We are committed to paying 100 per cent of reasonable set-up revenue and capital costs of restructuring, net of reasonable savings. The projected level of these costs and savings is a matter for negotiations currently taking place.</p>

	<p pid="b.162.2/1">Restructuring of the police service is about strengthening policing and ensuring that all police forces across England and Wales have the required capacity, capability and resilience to provide the most effective policing to the communities they serve. The number of police officers and police staff in each strategic force will be a matter for the chief constable and police authority concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.162.5/1">As part of our approach to communities and civil renewal, we are encouraging local people to volunteer their time to provide positive support for offenders, helping them to turn away from crime. The National Offender Management Service is developing a volunteering strategy to underpin this aim, and has commissioned a review of international evidence on the impact of mentoring in reducing re-offending. A young adult offender project will take account of any significant findings which result from these initiatives.</p>
