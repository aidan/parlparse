	<p pid="a.91.5/1">Professor Easterbrook has claimed that global average temperature may decrease over the next 30 years, due to the onset of a cool phase in a natural pattern of Pacific climate variability that is often referred to as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). My department is not, however, aware of any scientific articles published by Professor Easterbrook to support his claim and considers the suggested scenario to be very unlikely.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/2">Historical records of global average and regional temperatures show that the PDO produces at most only a small effect on global average temperature. As a result, the PDO is not expected to produce a global average effect large enough to overcome the amount of warming expected over the next 30 years from current and future levels of greenhouse gases.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.5/2">The benefits and pensions ordinarily uprated by September's retail price index are:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/3">basic state pension, and rates of widows and bereavement benefits linked to the rate of basic state pension;additional pensions, also known as SERPS or S2P;increments: for the deferment of state pension and guaranteed minimum pensions;attendance allowance;carer's allowance;disability living allowance;maternity allowance;industrial injuries disablement benefit;benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act and the Pneumoconiosis, Byssinosis, and Miscellaneous Diseases Scheme;industrial death benefit;widows/bereavement benefits rates are linked to the basic state pension rate; andstatutory payments for maternity, paternity, adoption and sick pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/4">Income-related benefits, such as income support, are usually uprated in line with the September Rossi index, which is retail price index excluding rent, mortgage interest payments, council tax and depreciation costs. Since April 2009, incapacity benefit has been uprated in line with the September Rossi index.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/5">Public sector pensions are increased in accordance with Section 59 of the Social Security Pensions Act, 1975 and I refer the noble Lord to my noble friend Lord Patel of Bradford's Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-03">3 March 2009</phrase> (<I>WA</I><I></I><I>141</I>) to Parliamentary Questions HL918 and HL1108.</p>

Uprating basic state pension by 2.5 per cent in April 2010 will deliver an increase worth around &pound;1 billion to pensioners over the course of the year. The current legislation does not allow for benefits and pensions to be reduced in the event of negative inflation so no calculations on benefit and pension reductions have been made.</p>

If the application is accepted, the IPC must hold a preliminary meeting. The Government have recently consulted on draft regulations which would require the IPC to give at least 21 days' notice of a preliminary meeting. The Planning Act sets a timetable for the IPC to complete its examination of the application within six months of the date of the preliminary meeting, and then a further three months for the IPC to issue a decision (or a recommendation to the Secretary of State when a national policy statement has not been designated). The exact time taken by the IPC to make decisions will reflect the nature and complexity of the application.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.3/1">Advice given to enquires from Forth Ports about the carbon reduction commitment energy efficiency scheme from both Defra and DECC was based on information supplied by the enquirer. Liability under the CRC rests with the counterparty to the supply contract. Initially Forth Ports stated they were a deemed electricity supplier in which case liability under the CRC would lie with their tenants. Further examination following the creation of DECC, confirmed that the port was the subject of a utility direction by HMRC for the purposes of the climate change levy in respect of supplies of electricity that it made. The direction was given under the provisions of Finance Act 2000 Schedule 6 paragraph 151(1). So in this instance the port authority is liable under CRC. The utility direction has effect from the date it is issued and treats that person as a utility only for the purposes of the climate change levy.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.5/1" qnum="HL6265">To ask Her Majesty's Government what are or will be the journey times between London and Edinburgh (calling at York and Newcastle) of (a) the proposed bi-mode super-express intercity train, (b) the existing high speed 125 mph diesel train, and (c) the existing C92 electric train with MK4 coaches.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">No London to Edinburgh trains currently call at York and Newcastle only.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">Typical fastest journey times of current services (Intercity 125s and Intercity 225s) London to Edinburgh are between four hours 20 minutes and four hours 30 minutes, with one train at four hours 13 minutes. There are usually three intermediate stops (eg Peterborough, York and Newcastle, or York, Newcastle and Berwick).</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/3">The indicative fastest super-express timetabled journey times are envisaged to be the same for both bi-mode and electric train types. This is four hours six minutes for services that call at four intermediate stations and four hours 11 minutes for services that call at five intermediate stations. It is planned to run all London-Edinburgh trains on these improved timings, not just the occasional headline train as is the case today.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/4">Super-express trains will improve the journey times as well as frequency and reliability of services. The introduction of super-express trains enables significant timetable optimisations which will also result in a reduction in journey times of services provided by existing rolling stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/5">The Class 92 locomotive was designed for use in the Channel Tunnel and is not used on UK intercity services.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.1/1" qnum="HL5467">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether there are enough personal advisers in Jobcentre Plus offices to deal with the number of people unemployed; and, if not, how many personal adviser posts are vacant.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-11-06a.104.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="104"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91106w0003.htm#09110657000186">
	<p pid="a.104.2/1">Jobcentre Plus monitors workloads very closely, both at local and national level, to enable it to plan for and deploy extra resources where these are needed to provide services to unemployed customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/2">Since November 2008 the Government have invested nearly &pound;5 billion to help people claiming out-of-work benefits get back to work. As part of this, funding to Jobcentre Plus has been increased by &pound;3 billion to ensure Jobcentre Plus continues to provide personal help and advice to customers who need it, despite the current recession. This money will also help ensure that the Flexible New Deal&mdash;which is now providing tailored help for the long-term unemployed&mdash;can cater effectively for higher volumes of jobseekers.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/3">The Budget 2009 funding meant that Jobcentre Plus was able to recruit up to 10,000 more staff, on top of 6,000 new staff previously announced in PBR. This increase is entirely for staff directly helping customers to find work or provide support until they get a job. Between October 2008 and July 2009, Jobcentre Plus had recruited 14,000 people. Once forthcoming official statistics for headcount are published we expect to be able to confirm that Jobcentre Plus had achieved its plan to reach 82,000 full-time equivalents in post by the end of September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/4">Meanwhile, customers are now using Jobcentre Plus services differently than previously. More of its face-to-face customer contact is on an appointment basis and information on job vacancies is readily available by telephone and the internet. We have introduced a single national telephone number for new benefit claims so that calls from the public can be directed to the next available member of staff, regardless of location, giving Jobcentre Plus flexibility in where it handles work. This enables staff in jobcentres to focus on those customers in greatest need of support to return to work, maximising the impact of our resources.</p>
