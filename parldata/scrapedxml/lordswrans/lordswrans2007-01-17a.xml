	<p pid="a.153.0/1">The information is not available in the format requested. The information available is set out below.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/2">Estimates from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) 2004-05 indicate that approximately 100,000 people are in receipt of incapacity benefit, but not the middle or higher rate care component of disability living allowance, and are receiving care for 20 hours or more a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/3">These data also suggest that approximately 300,000 people are receiving the lower rate of disability living allowance and are receiving care for 20 hours or more a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/4">The FRS does not allow all these people to be matched to the people providing care, some of whom will qualify for the basic state pension and state second pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/5">Further, the FRS does not allow us to identify reasons for the receipt of benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/6">Information from the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) shows the number and proportion of people who are receiving incapacity benefit and the lower rate of disability living allowance because they suffer from mental ill health. There are around 366,000 people in receipt of incapacity benefits with the lower rate of disability living allowance. Of these, around 108,000 are receiving incapacity benefits due to mental and behavioural disorders (at May 2006). The WPLS does not hold information about people receiving care for 20 hours or more a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/7">(The Pensions Bill, introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>, will help more people build up better state pensions. Around three-quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 will get full basic state pension under the Bill, rising to over 90 per cent by 2025. The Bill will also allow around 1 million extra people (over 90 per cent of whom are women) to accrue entitlement to the state second pension.)</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/8">Notes for information from the Family Resources Survey</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/9">1. Estimates are rounded to the nearest 100,000, and are based on self-reported information. 2. Information from the Family ResourcesSurvey relates to a point in time, so may not be representative of activity during the year.3. People who are receiving incapacity benefit and lower rate disability allowance and receive care for 20 or more hours a week may appear in both estimates from the FRS.4. The Family Resources Survey does not record information on individuals in retirement homes or nursing homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.8/1">The Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-08">8 June 2006</phrase> on planning policy statement 22 (PPS22) encouraged local planning authorities to take account fully of the positive approach to renewables set out in PPS22, including in paragraph 8. In doing so, the Government made clear that all planning authorities are expected to include policies in their development plans that require a percentage of the energy in new developments to come from on-site renewables where it is viable. Appropriate technologies and their potential will, however, vary from place to place and with the type and scale of development envisaged. Actual production of renewable energy will vary according to the level of energy need arsing in the developments in question. It is, therefore, extremely hard to forecast with any degree of accuracy the production of renewable energy to be expected from paragraph 8of PPS22.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.2/1">Childhood obesity is a serious issue, both in terms of the range of health problems it is associated with and the cost burden it places on the NHS and the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">To tackle this problem, the Government have set a public service agreement target,</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/3" class="indent">&quot;to halt, by 2010, the year-on-year increase in obesity among children under 11 in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as whole&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/4">This target is the joint responsibility of the Secretary of State for Health, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/5">There is no single cause of obesity but at its core is an imbalance between calories in and calories out. As such, there is no one intervention for obesity and a wide variety of government programmes make a valuable contribution to tackling it. Joint cross-departmental programme management arrangements have been established to drive action to meet this target which will be delivered using a three-tiered approach:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/6">universal programmes aimed at prevention;</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/7">early intervention for those at risk of being overweight/obese; and</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/8">targeted health interventions for those already obese.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/9">The first tier comprises universal programmes aimed at reversing obesity trends and creating a positive environment for healthy eating and physical activity. Policy initiatives within this tier includethe Healthy Schools programme, the &quot;5 a Day&quot; campaign, the Healthy Start scheme, the school fruit and vegetable scheme, statutory nutritional standards for food in schools, restrictions on the advertising and food promotion to children of foods high in fat, salt and sugar, increasing the amount of time pupils spend on high quality PE and school sport, and encouraging walking and cycling to school through school travel plans and walking-bus schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/10">The second tier comprises early interventions targeted at groups of children (and their parents) at higher risk of being overweight and obese. For example, we will be working with school sports partnerships in areas of higher obesity prevalence to engage overweight/obese children in physical activity, and we have agreed in principle an objective with the School Food Trust to similarly target some of their activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/11">The third tier comprises public health treatment interventions specifically aimed at helping obese children and families to lose weight and become healthier. We will be working with PCTs, local authorities, schools and other delivery partners to ensure that recommendations from the new clinical guidance on the treatment of obesity, published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in December last year, are developed and incorporated in our approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/12">In the spring we will be launching a social marketing campaign aimed at influencing behaviour change in parents and encouraging them to build healthier lifestyles for their children and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/13">Fundamental to the success of the programme will be the need to work in partnership with public bodies, the private sector, individuals and families (notably children and parents), and ensure obesity interventions are based on the best available evidence using an action-learning approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/14">Obesity is now included as a performance management indicator within the performance management framework for PCTs, and we are encouraging local authorities to include measures to reduce childhood obesity in their local area agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.0/2"><I>Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird dated January 2007</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Governmenta Parliamentary Question about what plans theyhave to introduce traffic-calming measures on the connecting roads between the Belmont and Upper Newtownards road in Belfast. As this issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/4">I can advise that in recent years Roads Servicehas carried out assessments on the following roads, which run between Belmont Road and Upper Newtownards Road, to help determine the needto introduce traffic-calming measures: Wandsworth Road; Earlswood Road; Belmont Church Road; and Ormiston Crescent.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/5">At Wandsworth Road, the assessment produceda score sufficient to warrant the inclusion of ascheme in the 2004-05 traffic-calming programme of works. However, Roads Service received a petition, representing a significant number of residents of the road, objecting to the proposed measures. Given the level of opposition, it was considered unlikelythat the legislative process could be completed without recourse to a public inquiry, which, as you will appreciate, would require considerable input from Roads Service staff and would compromise the ability to deliver traffic-calming schemes in other areas. In these circumstances, it was decided to target our limited resources for this type of work to sites where the greatest benefits could be achieved in terms ofthe successful implementation of a traffic-calming scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/6">In Earlswood Road and Belmont Church Road, scores from assessments were sufficient to merit the inclusion of schemes in the current traffic-calming programme of works and I am informed that initial residents' consultation has been completed and the legislative process has commenced. However, I understand that a number of objections to the proposals have been received and that these are currently being addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/7">An initial assessment of Ormiston Crescent has indicated that a traffic-calming scheme at this location would not be highly placed compared with other sites on the traffic-calming programme and other sites waiting to be treated. While Roads Service has no plans to construct traffic-calming measures at this site at present, it will continue to be considered for possible inclusion in future programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.0/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question regarding what plans they have to improve traffic flow through Dungiven in County Londonderry. As this issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/4">As you may be aware, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-13">13 December 2005</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced that a &pound;250 million scheme to dual the A6 between Londonderry and Dungiven was being added to the major roadworks forward planning schedule. This 30 kilometre dualling scheme, which will include a bypass of Dungiven, will be the biggest single road scheme ever built in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/5">Roads Service had already commissioned consultants to identify a corridor for the future dualling of the A6 between Castledawson and Londonderry and it is envisaged that this study,which will be completed shortly, will inform the development of the A6 Londonderry to Dungiven section.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/6">The bypass of Dungiven will greatly improve journey times on this route and will undoubtedly improve traffic flow through the town. While it will be several years before all the statutory proceduresare completed, it is hoped that construction of the scheme will commence in the latter half of the regional strategic transport network transport plan 2015 period, ie between 2010 and 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/7">In the mean time, Roads Service will enforce parking restrictions in Dungiven to improve traffic flow and will continue to consider other methods of safely improving traffic flow.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.3/5">The expanded programme is part of the investment strategy for Northern Ireland, which envisages the additional funding to be available towards the end of the period between now and 2015. Once the ESRIPis finalised, each scheme will be progressed on a measure-by-measure basis, subject to detailed economic appraisal, clearing the relevant statutory procedures and the availability of funds through the normal budgetary processes.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.5/1">The number of suicides in police custody in Northern Ireland in 1981 cannot be provided because to do so could be done only at disproportionate cost. This is because to collate this information would involve making a request to each of the 29 district command units asking for a trawl of any manual records held. Therefore we are unable to supply the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/2">The PSNI now records &quot;deaths in custody&quot; electronically. However, a verdict of suicide can be determined only at an inquest.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/3">For the figure of suicides in prison custodyeach year since 1980, I refer the noble Lord to the Answer I provided on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October 2006</phrase>. In addition, 10 individuals died in custody following a hunger strike in 1981.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.3/1">Most support for transport is provided to local authorities in England through revenue support grant, although the Department for Transport also provides a few specific grants. The main grant determinations are posted on the department's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.3/2">Several of these grants, for example rural bus grant, provide continuing rather than single-year support. Some support for specific major investments is made by allowing sufficient provision within revenue support grant to enable the authority to borrow. There is thus no clear category of one-off grants.</p>
