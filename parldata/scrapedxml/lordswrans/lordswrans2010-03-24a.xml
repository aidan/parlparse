	<p pid="a.295.5/1">Of the 145 fish stocks in the European waters of the Atlantic and neighbouring seas for which the European Commission proposed total allowable catches (TACs) for 2010, there were 111 for which either no new scientific advice was available or the scientific evidence was considered insufficient to determine the true state of the stock. A table listing these has been deposited in the House Library. The stocks that fall into these categories will vary from year to year and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), which reviews the scientific assessments of them, can still provide advice to the European Commission on a precautionary basis, using historic data.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.5/2">TAC areas do not always correspond to the areas covered by the biological stocks, and vice versa. It is not therefore straightforward to compare the scientific advice with the subsequent TACs. In addition, complete information on TACs for some stocks shared with Norway is not yet fully available. With those caveats these represent the stocks where the agreed TAC for 2010 exceeds the level advised by scientists. A table listing them has been deposited in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.2/1">Until 2000, the eldest sons of Peers of Parliament were traditionally permitted to sit on the steps of the Throne. The practice was changed as a result of the following recommendation made in the 4th Report from the House of Lords Offices Committee, Session 1999-2000:</p>
	<p pid="a.299.2/2">1. Steps of the Throne</p>
	<p pid="a.299.2/3">The Committee has considered the four categories of heirs to peerages currently allowed to sit on the Steps of the Throne:</p>
	<p pid="a.299.2/4">eldest sons of Peers of Parliament;eldest daughters or grand-daughters of such Peers when heiresses presumptive;grandsons of such Peers when heirs apparent;eldest sons of those who have disclaimed their peerage.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.2/5">In the case of hereditary peerages, these categories all assumed that those exercising the right would eventually become Members of the House. That is no longer true, except as the result of a by-election to become one of the 90 hereditary Peers who remain Members of the House. The chances of the eldest son, daughter or grandchild of a hereditary Peer who had been a Member of the House being elected would be uncertain, though not impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.2/6">As the original rationale for the four categories no longer applies, the Committee considers that in future the privilege should be granted to the eldest child of a Peer of Parliament, without regard to gender. The Committee was, however, mindful of the need to avoid any unfairness to eldest sons who had previously exercised their right to sit on the Steps of the Throne but who have older sisters, and therefore recommends that the privilege be granted to:</p>
	<p pid="a.299.2/7">&quot;the eldest child of a Peer of Parliament (or the eldest son where the right has been previously exercised)&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.8/1">National Health Service staff work for independent and autonomous employer organisations. They are responsible for making decisions on the dismissal of staff but are expected to do so in line with current employment law and human resource good practice. The compensation they receive will normally be dictated by the contractual arrangements in place between employee and employer. Any extra contractual payments are subject to Treasury approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.8/2">Redundancy payments to NHS staff are made in line with the arrangements set out in Section 16 of the Agenda for Change Terms and Conditions of Service Handbook. These came into force from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. At the same time changes were made to the National Health Service (Compensation for Premature Retirement) Regulations 2002 and the National Health Service Pension Scheme Regulations 1995. These were also negotiated in partnership with the NHS trade unions. Under these arrangements, the standard redundancy terms are one month's pay per year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 24 months pay. Members aged over the minimum pension age may choose to use their redundancy payment to pay for their retirement pension to be paid on redundancy without reduction. The previous redundancy arrangements involving enhancements of service of up to 10 years are being phased out and will cease to apply completely from October 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.8/3">A further form of early retirement available is retirement in the interests of the service where the employer pays for the cost of the members retiring without a reduction for early payment of pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.8/4">Section 16 of the Agenda for Change Terms and Conditions of Service Handbook makes clear that before making staff redundant employers should seek suitable alternative employment either in their own organisation or with another NHS employer.</p>
