	<p pid="a.106.5/1">Jerusalem, a UN presence and withdrawal from settlements are among the issues to be resolved by the parties during final status negotiations. It is not for the UK to prejudge the outcome of negotiations. With regard to the status of Jerusalem, pending agreement we recognise de facto Israeli control of west Jerusalem but consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory. We recognise no sovereignty over the city. Jerusalem has a unique religious and cultural importance for Christians, Jews and Muslims and we attach great importance to ensuring access and freedom of worship there for those of all faiths. An international presence could help both sides in their search for peace, if accepted by both sides. Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories are illegal and we have called for an immediate freeze to their growth. todd</p>

It is not possible to provide the number of medically downgraded personnel who are not fit for training, or the number who are able to carry out their normal duties in barracks or are on light duties, as this information is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. Personnel who are medically downgraded are able to undertake training and military duties in barracks within the employability restrictions of their category of medical downgrading, which will differ for each individual depending on the reason for their medical downgrading and the type of training and duties. Restriction to light duties is not a category of medical downgrading. Any personnel, whether or not medically downgraded, may be placed in this category on a temporary basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.9/1">Comparability with civilian levels of pay has been an element in the process of assessing the pay of the Armed Forces since 1958 when the adoption of recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Recruiting, under the chairmanship of Sir John Grigg, led to regular reviews of the pay of service personnel. Since its establishment in 1971, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body has always aimed to ensure that the rates of pay and allowances for servicemen and women, which it has recommended to the Government, have been based on broad comparability with those prevailing in civilian life. The use of this as an instrument for assessing the pay of the Armed Forces was acknowledged by its inclusion in the revised terms of reference which were agreed by AFPRB and the Government in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.9/2">In its recommendations, however, the review body has always included an additional element&mdash;the X Factor (currently 13 per cent of basic pay for service personnel up to lieutenant colonels and equivalents at the mid-pay point beyond which it tapers)&mdash;to reflect the differences between conditions of service experienced by members of the UK Armed Forces over a full career and conditions in UK civilian life, which cannot be taken directly into account in assessing broad pay comparability.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.5/1">Following a review in 1999, &pound;56 million was allocated over a period of four years to establish an Operational Welfare Package for Service personnel deployed on operations and long term exercises (of over two months' duration). The package includes measures to alleviate the strain placed on families when the serving partner is deployed overseas. Examples of those measures are a weekly telephone allowance (20 minutes); easy access to Internet terminals for most deployed personnel; concessionary parcel rates and electronic &quot;blueys&quot;. All these measures help families to stay in close touch during deployments.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.5/2">Additional leave is allocated to personnel (according to the length of absence) at the end of an operational deployment; and additional family travel warrants have been introduced for families in the UK to visit their own families.

Further work is planned to look at what additional support can be given to service dependants of deployed personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.5/3">The problems faced by service spouses in pursuit of a career are well recognised. Several trial schemes are under way to assist them to obtain employment, as well as schemes to seek co-operation with local businesses. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body is also examining this matter and has already sought evidence on employment patterns for spouses.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has funded extensive research into DU munitions over many years. This work has been complemented by studies on the health and environmental consequences of the testing, development and battlefield use of DU munitions carried out by a range of governmental and non-governmental bodies in the UK and overseas. These studies, and the Royal Society's report, all indicate that the health risks associated with the battlefield use of DU are minimal, other than in a small number of very specific circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/2">Nevertheless, there are a number of areas where we believe that further research is desirable to enhance the database on which to make judgments weighing the potential loss of life arising from not using DU munitions in battle against any potential longer term impact on human health and the environment resulting from its use. Some research will aid MoD in any future test-range decommissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/3">We therefore propose to carry out a programme of further research, which has been reviewed by the Royal Society, the Medical Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council. We have given veterans' representatives early sight of the programme. The full details of our proposals have been placed in the Library of the House. They have also been published on the MoD's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/4">Much of the work is in line with the recommendations of the Royal Society's report. In particular, we propose to conduct an epidemiological study to identify any links between exposure to DU and ill health and a critical review of literature relating to the effects of DU inhalation on the pulmonary lymph nodes. We also intend to study the ways in which DU is transported from the point of introduction into the environment to the point at which it has the potential to affect the health of plant, animal or human life. Furthermore, we have already begun research into the corrosion and dissolution rates of DU in typical corrosion environments and in controlled laboratory studies. We intend to consider a range of soil types and profiles and marine environments in this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/5">In addition, we propose to carry out research into the operational role of DU munitions and consider alternative penetrator materials. We aim to conduct a radiochemical analysis of DU rounds and examine contamination in the barrels used to fire DU rounds. Further to this, we aim to review and address work being conducted by others in biokinetic modelling related to uranic materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/6">These research activities are in addition to work that MoD is already undertaking. We have set up the independent Depleted Uranium Oversight Board, which includes independent members of the scientific community and veterans' representatives, as well as MoD staff, and is now overseeing the programme of work to devise a valid test for uranium isotopes in urine and a methodology for a voluntary DU screening programme for Balkans and Gulf veterans. We are developing our policy of biological monitoring for DU for troops on operations. We are also collecting data on the levels of DU in environmental samples in Kosovo. Annual surveys are already in progress at UK ranges where DU has been fired.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/7">It will be necessary to set priorities for funding each of the proposals and reassess their relevance and content as the research progresses.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">The Environment Act 1995 requires the Environment Agency to further the conservation of ecosystems as far as is reasonably consistent in carrying out its duties and exercising its powers. The Government's management statement and sustainability guidance to the agency emphasise this requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">Results from the Environment Agency's general quality assessment (GQA) scheme for the year 2000 show that 94 per cent of rivers in England and Wales were of good or fair biological quality compared with 87 per cent in 1990. Equivalent figures for chemical quality were 94 per cent and 85 per cent. This substantial improvement is due to a number of factors, including a major clean-up of discharges from sewage treatment works and industry. Under the Water Resources Act 1991 (as amended) tighter limits have been set for consented discharges to controlled waters and there has been tighter enforcement of discharge consents and much more focus on pollution prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">Under the GQA scheme the Environment Agency monitors the quality of just over 7,000 sites representing around 40,000km of rivers and canals. Sites are sampled twice a year for biological quality and this provides an indicator of overall &quot;health&quot; of rivers. For chemical quality, which gives an indicator of organic pollution in general, sites are sampled 12 times a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.5/1">I have today published the second stage report of the joint review of the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.5/2">The report underlines the value of both galleries and the contribution they make to this country's cultural life. Both galleries have achieved a great deal in the last few years and have risen to the challenges set by government and themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.5/3">The report also finds the need for a closer, more strategic relationship between the galleries and the department.</p>
