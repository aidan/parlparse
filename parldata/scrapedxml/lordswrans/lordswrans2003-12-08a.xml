	<p pid="a.41.2/1">The Human Rights Act 1998 sets out specific basic rights, including the right to peaceful enjoyment of property; the right to respect for private and family life and the home; and the entitlement to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal. Some of these rights are absolute while othes are considerations which have to be weighed in the balance against matters of public interest, such as the preservation of the environment in the case of planning decisions, when a public decision is being made and may interfere with an individual's rights. These principles are relevant in all areas of public law, including the planning system. Therefore, regard has to be paid too them to ensure that they are observed in the day-to-day operation of the planning system and that planning decisions are compatible with the Human Rights Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">It is a matter for the courts to determine whether any particular aspects of planning law or national planning policy are incompatible with the Human Rights Act. The House of Lords decided that the planning system was not incompatible with the right to a fair and public hearing as required by the Human Rights Act in its judgment in the case of R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport &amp; the Regions ex parte Holding &amp; Barnes plc.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.3/1">The Ministry of Defence's intention was that immunisations were to be voluntary. However, when instructions were cascaded down the command chain, in some cases the voluntary nature of immunisations was not adequately communicated by medical staff prior to immunisation which may have led to a perception that immunisation was mandatory. It appears that the voluntary nature of the anti-biological warfare immunisation programme, which included the use of pertussis vaccine, was clearly understood and implemented in some units, but not in others. A combination of leadership by example, peer pressure and lack of clear instructions left some personnel with either no conception that they could refuse the immunisations, or a definite understanding that they were not expected to do so. Where detailed documentary evidence exists it clearly shows a proportion of personnel refusing immunisations, implying proper application of the voluntary policy in at least these cases. Information on whether personnel were advised in 1991 of the pertussis vaccine licensing position is not available.</p>
