	<p pid="a.119.2/1">The functions themselves have not changed as a result of the coming into force of the Human Rights Act. Reviewing my practice to ensure that the functions are exercised compatibly with the convention is a process which predates the Act and which continues. For example, I responded to the Scottish case of Starrs and Chalmers by reviewing the terms on which part-time judges were appointed in order to enhance their security of tenure. This exercise was completed before the Act came into force. It involved putting in place administrative arrangements governing how part-time judges might be removed for cause, compatibly with the Act and with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/2">However, the Act brings the convention into sharp focus for all public authorities, including myself and my department. Convention rights are a major factor guiding what we do, and in the development of policy in those areas for which I have ministerial responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.5/1">The concrete road sections of the A14 in Suffolk were constructed in the 70s and early 80s. The concrete surface will be replaced as part of the Government's 10 year plan. The existing surface is in good condition, and the timing of that work will be determined in the light of the criteria announced by the Government in October 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/2">Those criteria are: that wherever possible the application of quieter surfaces will fit in with normal maintenance needs; that priority will be given to those sites where treatment would benefit the greatest number of people; that the work will be carried out in such a way as to minimise disruption to the general public and users of the network; and that priority will be given to roads, opened since June 1988, where actual noise levels have turned out to be significantly higher than predicted at the time of the public inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">Metaldehyde and other compounds approved for use to kill slugs may only be marketed and used if approved by Ministers. Approval is only granted following the evaluation of scientific data provided by the company in respect of risks to people and the environment. Any further research need to address subsequent questions about the effects of the product are referred back to the company; it is not the Government's role to support the approval of specific pesticide products. However, DEFRA is carrying out general research on integrated methods of slug control, including novel technologies, to reduce the impact on non-target species.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">A pesticide may only be used according to the conditions of its approval. For metaldehyde, these conditions include rules on the formulation of products so that they are not attractive to wild creatures, including birds, and rules for the use of the product so as to minimise the risk of harm to non-target creatures.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/3">Some slug pellets include small quantities of copper compounds to dye the product blue and thus make it unattractive to birds. The Pesticides Safety Dirctorate (PSD) is looking into the suggestion by the Froglife Trust that this practice may be leading to elevated levels of copper in frogs and that this in turn may be damaging their immune systems. If necessary, PSD will require the product approval holders to provide scientific information to clarify the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/4">Metaldehyde products are widely used in gardens in the United States. They carry warnings about risks to wildlife (as do similar products in the UK). The US rules do not appear to suggest the need for changes to the conditions attached to UK approvals.</p>
