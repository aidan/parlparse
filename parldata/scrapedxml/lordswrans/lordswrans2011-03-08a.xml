	<p pid="a.379.5/2">The meaning of &quot;participate in any treatment authorised by the Act&quot; in Section 4(1) of the Abortion Act was considered by the House of Lords in the case of Janaway v Salford Area Health Authority known as the Janaway case in 1988. In the Janaway case, the House of Lords held that the word &quot;participate&quot; should be given its ordinary and natural meaning and that to &quot;participate in any treatment authorised by the Act&quot; meant to actually take part in treatment administered for the termination of a pregnancy. The Janaway decision therefore governs the scope of the exemption for conscientious objection in relation to abortion.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.5/3">General practitioners who are ethically opposed to abortion should follow relevant professional guidance for those with conscientious objection.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.5/1">The risk of introducing the tapeworm echinococcus multilocularis into the UK is considered to be negligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.5/2">The UK's geographic separation from continental Europe essentially eliminates the risk of the introduction of E. multilocularis through the cross-border movement of wild animals. Ongoing surveillance of wild foxes has demonstrated that the fox population in the UK remains free of E. multilocularis. Similarly, no domestic cases of human infection by the tapeworm E. multilocularis have been found.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.5/3">A qualitative assessment of the risk of importing the tapeworm E. multilocularis via the movement of pet animals to the UK has been carried out by the Veterinary Science team in Defra. Exposure of a pet to infection depends on the country visited and whether the pet has ingested any infected rodents. Alveolar echinococcosis is restricted to the northern hemisphere and has become more of a problem in some urban fox populations. The risk is currently mitigated by a requirement to treat all cats and dogs with Praziquantel before entering the UK. This treatment must be certified by a vet in the pet passport or third country official veterinary certificate.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.5/4">We recognise that without our current treatment regime there would be an increased risk of disease introduction and the disease could become established in the UK rodent or fox population. We are currently in discussion with the European Commission with regard to the long-term tapeworm treatment requirements for pets entering the UK and certain other member states.</p>

It is also implemented in a number of other OECD countries, as well as in China, South Africa and Brazil. The UK Innovation Survey is the UK component of this. It is managed and led by the Science and Innovation Analysis Unit in BIS, and implemented by ONS.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.5/2">BIS produces two reports on the results of the survey, and these are used in departmental performance indicators, in the Annual Innovation Review, in the development of the current growth reviews and the department's forthcoming Innovation Strategy. The data are made available (subject to strict confidentiality controls) to academic researchers and is used in a wide variety for research projects. The department regards the Community Innovation Survey as a major resource for our understanding of patterns of innovation in the UK and elsewhere.</p>

Almost 500 responses were received, including from a number of organisations representing travellers. Ensuring pitches on traveller sites receive equal treatment as other homes was a key principle of the final scheme design. Additional pitches will therefore be eligible for the bonus and pitches available at sub-market rates will be eligible for the affordable homes enhancement.

The team carries out research and analysis projects in support of senior officials in their work on the level, composition and management of the UK Science Budget. It supports Innovation Policy officials with statistics-based analyses of patterns of innovation in the UK, and case-studies of specific innovation-related issues (such as the impacts of publicly-supported innovation infrastructures or the economics of innovation in the space economy). It plays an active role in evaluation of policy impacts. The team also sets up and manages external research projects on topics related to scientific and innovation activity in the UK. There are currently no plans to review the operations of the Science and Innovation Analysis Unit, other than through the usual process of regular quarterly performance reporting and the current change and reorganisation process that is underway in BIS.</p>

	<p pid="a.396.5/3">Blind person's allowance also provides favourable tax treatment to married couples or civil partners, if one of the couple is registered as blind. Any unused amount of the allowance (up to 100 per cent) can be transferred to the other partner where the couple lived together for at least part of the tax year.

	<p pid="a.396.5/4">The inheritance tax (IHT) system recognises marriage and civil partnerships. First, no IHT is usually due on assets transferred to a spouse or civil partner. Secondly, following the death of a spouse or civil partner the proportion of their unused IHT nil rate band allowance can be transferred to their widow or widower, or civil partner. In many cases, this means that the IHT allowance is effectively doubled for the survivor to &#163;650,000. Thirdly, gifts to someone getting married or registering a civil partnership are exempt from IHT, subject to certain limits.

	<p pid="a.397.2/1">European legislation came into effect in January 2007 that applies to all new goods vehicles above 3.5 tonnes gross mass that are registered for the first time in the European Union. The vehicles are required to have an enhanced wide-angle mirror on both sides and an enhanced close proximity mirror on the passenger side of the cab. For vehicles over 7.5 tonnes gross mass a front mirror above the windscreen is required. Vehicles where the close proximity and front mirrors cannot be fitted over 2m from the ground are exempt.</p>

This measure applies to all member states of the EU.</p>
