	<p pid="b.225.1/2" qnum="HL4415">What support they offer to farmers and the wider farming industry for the dissemination of information on innovative farming techniques.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-15b.225.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="225"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60315w01.htm#60315w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.225.2/1">The Government recognise the importance of ensuring that the farming industry remains dynamic and innovative. Viable and sustainable businesses are crucial to the prosperity of the countryside. In the <i>Rural Strategy 2004</i> Defra made a commitment to providing rural businesses with access to appropriate business support and training. Since then, we have worked with partners from central, regional and local government on a number of projects to help rural businesses get the help and advice they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/2">Building on work under the learning, skills and knowledge programme (LSK), Defra continues to work with the Sector Skills Council for the environmental and land-based sector (Lantra) on the provision of, and demand for, skills training and development for rural businesses. Lantra is developing a competence framework for the land-based sector and will be piloting this within selected sub-sectors. We are also working with Lantra to develop a mechanism for recognising skills gained through experience as well as formal qualifications attained.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/3">Some of the support offered to farmers and the wider industry for the dissemination of innovative farming information include:</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/4">The National Non-Food Crops Centre (NNFCC), which is sponsored by Defra, develops products, processes and technologies from agricultural materials and acquires and disseminates the latest information on non-food crops, technologies and markets to farmers and the wider farming industry, as well as to all other relevant stakeholders throughout the supply chain. The centre's purpose is to provide a single, independent and authoritative source of information on the use and implementation of non-food crop products and technologies in the United Kingdom. The NNFCC can also provide farmers with advice and guidance on contracts and procurement issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/5">The Farm Business Advice Service is helping farmers to consider options for the future of their business. The current service was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase>. Funded by Defra, it is available to farmers claiming the single payment scheme in England until March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/6">The rural enterprise scheme (RES), which forms part of the England rural development programme, can provide support to farmers for good quality, sustainable diversification projects to help businesses respond to new economic opportunities available in the rural economy, beyond agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/7">The vocational training scheme, which also forms part of the England rural development programme, provides funding for vocational training activities that contribute to an improvement of the occupational skill and competence of farmers and others involved in farming (including horticulture) and forestry activities and their conversion (that is, diversification).</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/8">As ERDP is coming to an end, the last application date for the RES and VS is <phrase class="date" code="">30 June 2006</phrase>. We are currently consulting on a successor scheme for ERDP.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.2/1">I do not believe that there is a conflict between the ACP's statement in its commentary on the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution report and the guidelines in scientific analysis in policy making. The ACP made its statement to draw attention to the potential risks in what the committee viewed as an over-precautionary approach and the need for a proportionate approach in regulation. I do not believe that this will have an adverse effect on public confidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.5/1">This information is not held centrally. It is a matter for individual schools of architecture to determine the curriculum content of their courses. The qualifications that are provided by the schools of architecture are subject to the criteria established by the Architects Registration Board (ARB), the body responsible for prescribing the qualifications and practical training experience required for entry on to the UK register of architects. The criteria set out the minimum levels of awareness, knowledge, understanding and ability that students of architecture must acquire. They do not encompass any expectations about preferred architectural style or approach. However, it is expected that students should demonstrate knowledge of the history and cultural context of architecture. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) validates courses against the criteria which it holds in common with the ARB.</p>

However, given the increasingly multi-disciplinary nature of research and the way that information is held on research funding, this is likely to be an underestimate as social science routinely complements natural science within projects. As stated in our <i>Evidence and Innovation Strategy 2005&ndash;08</i> consultation document, an increase in social science research is anticipated in this period but, at this stage, it is not possible to provide a reliable quantification of this in terms of expenditure share.</p>

	<p pid="b.236.2/1">The application process for obtaining traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) status for products such as Gloucestershire Old Spot pig meat involves two stages. The first stage involves an assessment by Defra that the relevant requirements for registration are fulfilled. This assessment was completed in early 2004 and officials concluded that the application was justified and met the requirements of the EU regulations. The application was therefore forwarded to the European Commission for its consideration (the second stage of the process). As Written Answer (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 2043W) stated that we are still waiting to hear the outcome of the Commission's deliberations and have been in regular contact with the Commission to chase up progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.238.2/1">The Highways Agency is continuing to work closely with the supply chain to drive down costs of construction across the whole of the targeted programme of improvements (TPI) and is taking a far more realistic view of .the likely final costs of projects. The programme is subject to external cost pressures, including rising energy prices, which have driven cost inflation above the retail price index in the road construction industry. The agency continuously reviews its forecasts of scheme costs and the reported increases record updates in estimates for schemes during their planning phase, not over expenditure under construction. Rigorous processes for cost control are in place. The agency scrutinises thoroughly individual potential cost increases and a review of the impact on the overall programme is undertaken, together with an independent evaluation of value for money, to inform the decision whether or not to continue to take the scheme forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/2">No agency staff have been disciplined over scheme cost increases. The agency's project teams are working hard to identify and .manage the risks of potential cost increases in advance of any final commitment to construct the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/3">The Highways Agency is continuing to deliver its agreed programme, as set out in its 2005&ndash;06 business plan, within the funding levels agreed in the 2004 spending review. The level of funding agreed in the 2004 spending review took account of the fact that some schemes were subject to cost increases. Within the Highways Agency's total budget envelope, individual scheme budgets are adjusted to reflect increases in scheme costs, subject to the satisfactory completion of the necessary reappraisal and approval procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/4">There has been no significant delay to schemes as a result of cost pressures. Progress of the TPI is monitored through a progress point system where points, up to a maximum of 100, are awarded upon completion of various events during the delivery of a scheme. Each year business plan targets are set for progress points, representing 95 per cent. of what the agency is expecting to deliver. The agency met its progress point target in 2004&ndash;05 and is on course to do so again in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/5">The agency's chief executive meets regularly with the Department for Transport board and Ministers to consider and review cost pressures and the resultant impact on the programme. A robust cost control action plan has been developed to drive down inflation pressures.</p>

The socio-economic figures (which show decreases of 6 per cent. for classifications 1 to 3 and 5.6 per cent. for classifications 4 to 7) do not fit with the overall decrease of 4.5 per cent. as there has been an increase of 1.2 per cent. in the number of applicants whose socio-economic background is not known. But the proportions of English applicants to UK institutions from the standardly-defined higher and lower socio-economic backgrounds were unchanged from 2005: 69 per cent. of applicants to UK institutions came from socio-economic classifications 1 to 3, and 31 per cent. from classifications 4 to 7.</p>

	<p pid="b.248.0/1">The Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 have not yet been laid in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/2">It is important to note that it is already an offence to burn waste in some circumstances. Section 2 of the Clean Air Act 1993 prohibits emissions of dark smoke from the open burning of material on industrial and trade premises, subject to certain exceptions, and provides for a maximum fine of &pound;20,000. Section 20 of the 1993 Act prohibits emissions of smoke from chimneys of properties in smoke control areas and provides for a maximum fine of &pound;1,000 on summary conviction. If the area is not a smoke control area, it could be a statutory nuisance offence under Section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/3">The change to Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act will make it an offence to treat, keep or dispose of household waste within the curtilage of a dwelling in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/4">Local authorities have powers to taken action against offenders but it will be for local authorities to decide how this power is used, in line with local enforcement policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/5">In addition to the previous public consultation and national press releases, when the change is made, Defra will encourage the Local Government Association to send out an alert to its local authority members announcing the legislative changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.248.3/1">The Environment Agency is the competent authority for the waste management licensing regime. However, waste collection authorities have powers to take action against illegal waste disposal or &quot;fly-tipping&quot;. Under the voluntary fly-tipping protocol agreement, local authorities focus on the smaller incidents of illegal waste disposal whereas the Environment Agency deals with larger, more serious incidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.3/2">The Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 will implement some provisions of the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC).</p>
