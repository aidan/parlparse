	<p pid="a.161.2/2">Building on this work, the Government's legacy action plan target is to get 2 million more people active by 2012, and Sport England has developed a new strategy to deliver 1 million of these new participants through sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/3">Under this strategy, national governing bodies (NGBs) will be commissioned by Sport England to drive up participation, and given increased responsibility to control the development of their sport. The new generation of whole sport plans will provide a single funding stream through which NGBs can co-ordinate the development of their facilities stock, improving their quality in concert with their participation objectives, and ensuring new demand is met.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/4">From 2001, in excess of &pound;1 billion government and National Lottery funding has helped develop or refurbish over 4,000 sports facilities. Many of these support multisport usage, which allow these resources to be maximised. And Sport England has now established a facilities improvement service, alongside a range of planning tools for local authorities, as part of its core funded offer. This will encourage similar strategic planning at a local level and ensure that every community has access to as wide a range of facilities as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.0/1">Updated figures show that the UK exported a total of 2.35 million tonnes of packaging waste in 2007. This waste comprised approximately:</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/2">1.54 million tonnes of paper;</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/3">271,000 tonnes of glass;</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/4">19,000 tonnes of aluminium;</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/5">164,000 tonnes of steel; and</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/6">324,000 tonnes of plastic.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/7">Forty-two per cent of all packaging aluminium collected in the UK was exported for recovery. The remaining 58 per cent of aluminium was reprocessed in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/8">Aluminium, as with other valuable materials, is a globally traded commodity and is exported for recovery to where the best price is paid. Many products are manufactured in the Far East and there is an increasing demand, therefore, for recyclable materials in these countries. Overall, this helps the global effort to boost recycling and reduce reliance on natural resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/9">Under the controls that apply to the export of waste, aluminium scrap is classed as a green list waste, and as such it can be exported for recycling to many countries under normal commercial controls. Those countries have informed the European Commission that they are content to receive such wastes for recycling.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.3/1">The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) is a wholly owned research centre of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), which is in turn funded by the DIUS. The CEH has developed a set of new modelling approaches that enables users to describe and predict the fate and behaviour of oestrogenic steroids in water bodies, and in particular their concentrations in rivers. Research into the application of the new methodology is still in progress and the modelling system is being tested and improved by the CEH and its spin-out partner Wallingford HydroSolutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.2/1">Over the financial years 2008-11, the Government are investing over &pound;3 billion in Sure Start children's centres for children under five and their families. The greater part of this investment is intended for intensive support to families in the most disadvantaged communities and those children who face the greatest risk of poor outcomes in life. Children's centres provide a range of services for families with young children, including parenting and family support, social care services, integrated early learning and daycare, health services and advice and information on training and employment for parents. There are currently 2,900 centres and by 2010 there will be over 3,500&mdash;one for every community. The national evaluation of Sure Start shows that Sure Start is beginning to have real and demonstrable benefits, helping improve parenting and lay the foundations for children's happiness, well-being and future success. In addition, as part of the roll-out of intensive family support announced in the <I>Youth Crime Action Plan</I><I>,</I> some local authorities may develop family intervention projects to support vulnerable families with young children. This will promote positive outcomes for children and families and help prevent future problems such as anti-social behaviour and offending.</p>
