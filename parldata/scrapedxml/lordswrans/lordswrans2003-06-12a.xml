	<p pid="a.51.5/1">Government's proposals for a single piece of enforcement agent law aim to eliminate the differences between the rules for different types of judgment debts. Few enforcement agents currently have the power to undertake forcible entry to residential premises. Existing case law relating to bailiffs is complex. However, we are looking to simplify the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/2">We are proposing a stricter definition of the term &quot;normal entry&quot;, which currently permits an enforcement agent to enter through such means as an open window. In order to offer the debtor more protection, we propose that enforcement agents should only be allowed to enter a domestic property through an open or unlocked door or with the permission of the debtor.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/3">Prior judicial authority will be required for forcible entry to be permitted in domestic properties. It is my intention that forcible entry to residential property should rarely be used and then only in very specific circumstances. The court will need to be satisfied that certain criteria have been met before granting such authority. All enforcement agents will be licensed and subject to strict regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/4">We are keen to protect those who genuinely cannot pay from being subject to any undue pressure, including forcible entry to their premises.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.1/2" qnum="HL3151">How many religiously motivated attacks on persons or property occurred in England and Wales in the most recent three months and in each previous quarter since September 2001; and what preventative methods they are using.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">Statistics at national level for religiously motivated attacks are currently not kept centrally. The Metropolitan Police Force has begun to keep its own statistics on such attacks, following the introduction of new religiously aggravated offences in December 2001 as part of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act. All police services now keep records of racist incidents in their areas, and the Home Office will be looking to encourage all forces similarly to record instances of religiously motivated incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/2">Since January 2002 the Crown Prosecution Service has had 37 cases of religiously aggravated offences referred to it for prosecution by the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/3">A number of forces have dedicated liaison officers at management level (inspector or chief inspector) with a borough or local authority wide remit. These play a pivotal role, which is likely to include responsibility for reducing crimes against groups identified by, among other characteristics, ethnic, racial or religious status.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/4">The Metropolitan Police Service holds regular meetings with representatives from many of faith groups in order to record and react, where necessary, to community concerns. In the aftermath of the events of September 11 2001 and more recently the war in Iraq, high visibility uniformed patrols were assigned to potentially vulnerable religious premises. Dialogue has been encouraged between police and faith groups at a local level, and these together with local initiatives have assisted in keeping faith crimes at a low level in what have been tense times for many faith groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.2/1">The first objective set for the review of Armed Forces compensation arrangements was to provide a fair deal for all who are injured or killed as a result of service, rather than to look at the particular numbers that might be eligible for compensation. The review team has proposed a balance of probabilities standard of proof&mdash;as used in the civil courts&mdash;as the best measure of whether an injury or illness was due to service in the Armed Forces. They have included provision for exceptional review where, for example, a condition emerges late or where there is a relevant change in the medical understanding of the causation of an illness. It has also recommended a completely independent channel of appeal to the Pensions Appeals Tribunal where a claimant considers that his or her case has not been properly considered by the department. Ministers are giving careful consideration to whether these proposals will address properly the particular demands of service life and we expect to announce a decision shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">For the current scheme and for any new scheme, there will be the normal entitlements to claim state benefits where the department decides that a condition is not due to service and where any appeal is not upheld. Under proposals for the new scheme, welfare support would be provided and could assist any unsuccessful claimant with applying for state benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.3/1">In a Written Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-05">5 February</phrase> by my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary (Official Report, Commons; cols 11-12 WS) in another place, he informed the House that the Government had agreed to a US request to upgrade the early warning radar at RAF Fylingdales as part of the US missile defence programme. Since then, we have been engaged in negotiating agreements with the US intended further to develop bilateral co-operation on aspects of the US missile defence programme. The United States Secretary of Defense and my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary have today signed a Framework Memorandum of Understanding on missile defence that facilitates bilateral information exchanges on missile defence matters, establishes a top-level management structure to oversee co-operative work, and prepares the way for fair opportunities to be given to UK industry to participate in the US programme. It also contains general provisions for security, personnel and other administrative matters. Further MOUs are being negotiated covering the detailed arrangements for the upgrade of the Fylingdales radar, and setting up specific UK/US technical co-operative programmes. The details of these bilateral arrangements are confidential between the respective governments at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/2">None of these agreements commits the UK Government to the acquisition or deployment of a missile defence system. But the Framework MOU is an important step forward that will enable us to improve our understanding of the capabilities of the US system, in order to inform any future decisions on missile defence for the UK or for Europe as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.3/1">A review by the University of York found that the evidence showed that fluoridating water helps to reduce tooth decay with no evidence of other adverse effects on general health. The report did, however, identify the need for more good quality research and the Department of Health asked the Medical Research Council (MRC) to suggest where it might be possible to strengthen the evidence base.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/2">In its report, the MRC stated that available evidence does not suggest a link between water fluoridation and either cancer in general or any specific cancer type (including osteosarcoma, primary bone cancer), but recommended that we monitored data collected on the incidence of cancer so that any aberrant trends in populations receiving fluoridated water could be investigated.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/3">Other claims have been made for an association between fluoride ingestion and deficiencies in the immune system, reproductive and developmental (birth) defects, and effects on the kidney and gastrointestinal tract. The MRC considered the evidence for any significant health effects to be weak and did not recommend any specific research, although it recommended we keep research in these areas under review.</p>

These will often cover the same geographical area as, and have similar functions to, the former regional specialised commissioning groups (RSCGs). However, collaborative commissioning groups' exact remit, powers and rules of engagement will be decided by their member primary care trusts (PCTs), as will the Level 1 collaborative commissioning groups for specialised services. It is therefore open to member PCTs to decide that these groups act as a direct replacement for RSCGs, but it is a matter for local decision. What might constitute good reasons for change to existing commissioning arrangements is a matter for local determination.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-12a.67.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="67"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030612/text/30612w04.htm#30612w04_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.67.5/1">In 1999 the Department of Health asked the Royal College of Physicians to lead a multidisciplinary working party to devise new clinical guidelines for the use of domiciliary oxygen. Although the working party's terms of reference precluded making specific recommendations about alterations in service provision, a number of the guidelines had implications for the content of the existing domiciliary oxygen service and for the way in which the service is delivered. It was clear, therefore, that this vital resource&mdash;that has seen only one significant change, the introduction of oxygen concentrators, in the past 50 years&mdash;had become out of date, both in terms of the service offered to patients and its cost effectiveness. It was against this background that the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, directed that a review of the domiciliary oxygen service should take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/2">This review is now complete and we are ready to move forward to create a modernised and integrated service for the provision of domiciliary oxygen.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/3">At present domiciliary oxygen is ordered for patients by general practitioners. The service consists principally of the provision of oxygen either from large cylinders supplied by community pharmacies, or delivered by way of an oxygen concentrator, installed in the patient's home by a contractor.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/4">The modern, integrated service that is proposed represents a considerable advance on this organisational and service model. The new model will transfer responsibility for ordering oxygen for long-term oxygen therapy from general practitioners to specialist consultants in hospital. This will relieve general practitioners of the bureaucratic burden of writing prescriptions, effectively on the direction of hospital doctors. (Patients who need long-term oxygen will invariably have their needs assessed by hospital staff). The hospital consultant will decide, in discussion with the patient, what the patient's needs for oxygen are. For example, many patients would benefit from having oxygen available in a form that allows them greater freedom of movement both in and outside the home than is possible with large cylinders or oxygen concentrators. General practitioners will continue to be able to prescribe oxygen for patients who need small amounts of oxygen.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/5">Once the hospital consultant or general practitioner has discussed and determined the patient's need for oxygen, it will be the responsibility of contractors to work closely with the patient and decide what technology&mdash;that is, what type and method of oxygen supply&mdash;will best suit the patient's therapeutic need, and to provide it. These specialist contractors will be well placed to keep pace with developments in the technical aspects of service delivery, so patients will benefit from advances in technology as they are developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/6">Thus the modernised integrated service represents a sensible division of responsibility in the provision of domiciliary oxygen services. It places clinical responsibility for assessing oxygen need with doctors, and places technical decisions on the best and most up-to-date method of delivery with service contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/7">Over the next few months a specification for the provision of the integrated service will be drawn up. Contractors will be invited to tender against this specification and contracts will be let. It is expected that the integrated service will be fully operational early in 2005. The current arrangements for the provision of domiciliary oxygen will continue as at present to cover this transitional period.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">Although there is no clear evidence of the extent of the problem, we are aware that young carers are prone to bullying. We recognise that some of those who care for people with mental health problems are particularly susceptible to bullying at school. We are taking steps to raise awareness of these issues, for example, through citizenship education and initial teacher training. Schools need to take all bullying very seriously. Head teachers are required to draw up and implement measures to prevent all forms of bullying in school. Schools should recognise bullying as it occurs and take firm steps to tackle it. They need to be aware that any risk of bullying, particularly if it is not dealt with firmly, could result in young carers dropping out of school.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.2/1">The Government strongly believe that all residents are entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their housing, a right undermined by anti-social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">As the consultation paper makes clear, we are not proposing housing benefit sanctions as the only way of addressing bad behaviour. Sanctions would be one of a number of measures that might be used to address the type of anti-social behaviour that can blight neighbourhoods. We are seeking the views of those involved in dealing with anti-social behaviour on whether a power to impose sanctions would be a useful and effective additional tool.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">Housing benefit continues to be paid when a convicted person is in prison for 13 weeks or less. Many prisoners spend relatively short periods in detention for comparatively minor offences and it would be inappropriate to remove housing benefit from these persons. However, if the offence also involved anti-social behaviour, a benefit sanction might also be appropriate.</p>
