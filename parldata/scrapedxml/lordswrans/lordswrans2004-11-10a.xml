	<p pid="a.77.2/1">The Government are not currently undertaking any analysis of potential impacts on mortality rates of subsidised European Union food exports to developing countries, nor are we aware of other research on this issue. The Government do, however recognise the damaging economic impact that trade-distorting subsidies in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries have on developing countries and we are committed to securing reductions in these subsidies, through reform of the common agricultural policy and the World Trade Organisation talks.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2">The common agricultural policy reform package agreed by EU Agriculture Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-26">26 June</phrase> last year marks a significant shift in the EU's agricultural policy. The decoupling of subsidies from production should increase the market orientation of European farmers, leading to reductions in production and disposal of subsidised surpluses abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/3">The Government also fully support the commitment made at the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in 2001 &quot;to reduce, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies, and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support&quot;. These commitments have been further progressed in the World Trade Organisation through the Framework Agreement reached in August this year.</p>

The Government have accepted in full the findings of Lord Butler's review. The UK was not in a position to share all the intelligence on this issue with the ISG.</p>

My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Bill Rammell, discussed various aspects of social inclusion with the Russian Human Rights Ombudsman, Vladimir Lukin, during his visit to Moscow in April this year. This subject was also covered during the official level bilateral UK-Russia human rights talks held at the FCO in September. It is due to be discussed again during Mr Lukin's scheduled visit to the UK later this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/2">Outside these discussions, the Department for International Development is actively engaged with federal and regional authorities in Russia on a range of programmes and activities designed to support planned reforms in the areas of social inclusion and social services.

In the first year of implementation of the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, the basic counternarcotics structures have been put in place: drug control legislation, a Counter Narcotics Directorate, the Ministry of Interior's Afghan Special Narcotics Force, the Counter Narcotics Police and a central eradication capability.

	<p pid="a.81.6/1">Indian citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship lose their Indian citizenship. However, minors are incapable of voluntarily acquiring another citizenship.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.6/2">Making an application for registration is indeed a voluntary act. In the case of minors, however, the application is made by the parents acting on the child's behalf. It is not made by the child. Children who are registered as British nationals have not, therefore, voluntarily acquired another citizenship.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.6/3">It is our understanding that Indian dual nationals would lose their Indian citizenship only if, on reaching the age of majority, they failed to renounce any other nationality then held.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">Fisheries Action Plans (FAPs) provide a new process for fisheries development across England and Wales. These will incorporate Salmon Action Plans (SAPs) and other species-specific plans that may be needed in the future. Their objective is to maximise sustainable development of fisheries and associated ecological, social, economic and recreational benefits. Developed in partnership between the Environment Agency and local angling and fisheries interests, with input from conservation bodies, FAPs will result in realistic deliverable plans for local fisheries. FAPs provide the mechanism by which issues affecting fisheries, including bird predation, can be reviewed and prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">Currently there are seven FAPs implemented, or in the process of implementation. A further 12 are in development. There are many actions arising as a consequence of these plans such as the reconnection of Shopham Loop on the Western Rother, the launch of <i>The Broads</i> angling magazine and the installation of fish refuges (to provide protection from cormorants) on the River Lee.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">Of the seven FAPs completed to date, five identify cormorants as an issue, with three ranking this as a high priority issue and two as a medium priority issue. In the remaining 12 FAPs still under development, cormorants are considered likely to be an issue in at least six cases and a high priority issue in at least three.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">FAPs have been successful at improving stakeholder involvement and consultation in resolving issues and contributing towards fisheries development at the local level. These plans may include managing predation of fisheries by cormorants through the licensing mechanism. However, it is too early to ascertain whether these licences have had any benefits on reducing the damage to fisheries by cormorants.</p>
