	<p pid="a.147.5/1">The increase in the number of people detained is a reflection of the gradual expansion of the number of detainee places available. An additional 112 places came on stream at the centre at Lindholme in July and built up to full capacity in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/2">The Government are committed to increasing the number of failed asylum applicants, inadmissible passengers and illegal entrants removed from the country. Last year about 8,000 failed asylum applicants were removed. This year the target is 12,000. Regrettably, detention is necessary because of the lack of compliance with conditions of temporary admission. Only about 1/3 of people leave the country voluntarily following adverse decisions and completion of the appeal process.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.3/2">Letter to Earl Russell from the National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales, Office for National Statistics, Mr Len Cook, dated <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-08">8 November 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary Question asking for the excess winter deaths for each English region, and for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in each year 1998-99 to 1999-2000, with a breakdown by age for each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/4">Figures are provided in the attached table for English Government Office Regions and for Wales. Figures for Scotland are now the responsibility of the Scottish Executive. Figures for Northern Ireland are now the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/5">Numbers of excess winter deaths can vary greatly from year to year, depending, for example, on the winter's severity or the occurrence of infectious disease epidemics. To allow for comparison, figures are therefore also presented for the two previous winters, 1996-97 and 1997-98, to cover the period since Government Office Regions were established. The figures for winter 1999-2000 are provisional and will only be finalised in October 2001, when data for all deaths occurring in 2000 become complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/6">Excess winter deaths are defined by National Statistics as the difference between the number of deaths during the four winter months (December to March) and the average number of deaths during the preceding autumn (August to November) and the following summer (April to July).</p>

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">Camelot's licence to operate the National Lottery comes to an end on 30th September 2001. Contrary to an inaccurate media report, Camelot has not been granted an interim licence to operate the Lottery beyond then. I understand that the National Lottery Commission intends to negotiate a possible interim licence with Camelot, in order to allow a 12-month handover period in the event of a change of operator. The commission also intends to ensure that any handover does not fall during the Christmas period. Should an interim licence become necessary, the precise length of it will be finalised after the award of the seven-year licence. The details of any such licence will be made public once negotiations are complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.5/1">We recognise that some pupils are working behind their normal year group for sound educational or other reasons. Decisions on such matters are for individual schools in consultation with parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/2">We announced in July that pupils who have recently arrived from overseas with English language difficulties may, on the request of a school, be excluded from the information published in the annual school performance tables. We accept that such pupils will not do their best in National Curriculum tests or public examinations until they have had a chance to improve their language skills and to become more familiar with the school curriculum. We have no plans, however, to make further changes in the way we report on achievements in the school performance tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/3">The primary school tables report on the achievements of all pupils eligible for assessment at the end of National Curriculum Key Stage 2, before they proceed to secondary education. New Progress Tests in English and mathematics are being introduced in May 2001. These tests, taken at the end of Year 7, are for pupils who do not achieve the expected level at the end of Key Stage 2 and will help to ensure that these pupils catch up with their peers as soon as possible. The secondary school tables report on the GCSE and GNVQ achievements of all pupils who by age are in their final year of compulsory schooling. This both ensures that a consistent approach to the calculations is taken for all schools in the country and provides parents and others in local communities with valuable information on the achievements of children as they reach these crucial stages in their education.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/4">Basing the GCSE/GNVQ information on the achievements of all pupils in Year 11, regardless of their age, could introduce inconsistencies into the data, since decisions on such matters as the year group in which individual pupils are educated are entirely for local determination and policies vary from one school to another. Doing so could also encourage an increase in the number of pupils completing their compulsory schooling with no GCSE or GNVQ passes if as a consequence more pupils are held back. This year 32,000 pupils in England reached school leaving age with no GCSEs or GNVQs. Although that figure has fallen over recent years as a consequence of our policies to improve standards in schools, we want to do all we can to reduce it still further. We hope that the big expansion of nursery education and the emphasis on catch up provision for those behind their peers will help to ameliorate the problem.</p>

Introduced by the Reserve Forces Act 1996, this new form of reserve service extends the ability of the private sector and government agencies to provide specialist support on operations as well as in peacetime.

Members will be routinely called out on a rotational basis under the terms and conditions of employment developed from the broad consultation process with industry that followed the Reserve Forces Act's coming into force in April 1997. This agreement represents the first use of the SR concept by my department and builds on the established working pattern of the MMU which has supported operations since 1962 with great distinction.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.8/1">The Government wish to see the fishing industry develop a positive safety culture. Former schemes providing grants simply for equipment have not been successful in cutting accident rates. One of the keys to improving safety is good training and that will be our priority. We therefore propose to make up to &pound;0.5 million available in each of the next three financial years to deliver safety training for fishermen in England. These payments, to be funded through the EU structural fund for fisheries, will cover the fees to enable courses to be offered to fishermen without charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.8/2">We are in discussion with the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Fisheries Departments of the developed administrations to develop a suitable new package of training measures. These will include courses to update safety awareness among fishermen hitherto exempt from the requirement for safety training; to provide training in accident prevention and risk assessment; and safety training for newcomers to the industry. We will consult the fishing industry on our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.8/3">We also intend that grant aid should be available through FIFG to support the trialling of innovative and experimental equipment to improve vessel safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.2/1">There are a number of schemes across Manchester which are successful in helping chronically sick and disabled people to obtain and retain employment.

This will be managed by the Manchester Mental Health Partnership. A similar scheme for learning disability users is being currently implemented.</p>
