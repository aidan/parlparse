	<p pid="a.78.8/1">The contracts which were signed between English Partnerships, Meridian Delta Ltd, AEG and Quintain in May 2002 provide for AEG to have a 12-month period, after the transaction becomes unconditional, during which to commence construction of the Arena. This is needed to allow time for the necessary construction contracts to be procured.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/2">Although theoretically construction inside the Dome might have been able to begin as soon as the deal went unconditional, commercial practicalities do not allow this and English Partnerships has budgeted in accordance with the May 2002 contracts to continue to pay core Dome costs for the period after the deal has gone unconditional and until construction of the new arena starts. Similarly while the arena is under construction English Partnerships has also budgeted to pay a reduced level of costs. Those costs will cease on practical completion of the arena.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/3">The details of English Partnerships' ongoing costs of Dome upkeep after the MDL deal has gone unconditional are dependent on practical arrangements within the overall terms of the contracts agreed in May 2002. Other costs in relation to the Dome&mdash;that is, any remaining decommissioning costs and the costs of the sale process&mdash;will cease when the deal with MDL goes unconditional.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-12-11a.79.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="79"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo031211/text/31211w01.htm#31211w01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.79.2/1">In June the Government published the White Paper Our Fire and Rescue Service. It set out a package of reforms designed to improve the service and to save more lives. Today the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is publishing a draft Fire and Rescue National Framework that will outline how to implement the White Paper's proposals. It sets out the Government's objectives for the Fire and Rescue Service and what fire and rescue authorities should do to achieve these outcomes. It also sets out what the Government will do to improve the service and what support it will provide to fire and rescue authorities. In due course, the expectations in the framework will also help to shape the Audit Commission's fire and rescue comprehensive performance assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">The framework is based on a partnership approach. The Government are committed to giving fire and rescue authorities adequate support and flexibility to help them to meet the specific needs of their local communities. For this reason we are initially issuing it in draft form and welcome comments and suggestions by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-12">12 March 2004</phrase> on both the proposals in the draft framework and how to make the future versions as helpful and relevant as possible. We aim to publish the first national framework in spring 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">The legislation announced in the Queen's Speech will place the framework on a statutory footing. It will require the Government to report to Parliament on the extent to which fire and rescue authorities are acting in accordance with the national framework and any steps the Government have taken to ensure that they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/4">We are also today publishing Mott MacDonald's most recent study into fire and rescue control rooms, and HM Fire Service Inspectorate's review of the subject. The study reinforced the report's conclusions that regional control rooms would significantly enhance national resilience. The Government are persuaded by the conclusions of study and propose to establish regional control rooms in England, including the one already established in London, working closely with fire and rescue authorities through their regional management boards. We have written to the practitioners forum asking for their views on our proposed approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/5">The Fire and Rescue Service is, rightly, widely admired for its professionalism and the dedication of its staff. The White Paper made clear, however, that it was also in need of urgent reform. Publication of the draft national framework sets out the Government's expectations of the service, what fire and rescue authorities should do and the support the Government will provide. It demonstrates the Government's continued commitment, in partnership with fire and rescue authorities, to driving down the number of fire deaths and injuries, improving fire and rescue services and saving more lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/6">Copies of the draft Fire and Rescue National Framework 2004&ndash;05, the full Mott MacDonald report, the summary of the Mott MacDonald report, and the HM Fire Service Inspectorate review are available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

This process is being managed by the London Development Agency, working closely with local business groups that are in direct contact with all the businesses which may be affected by the plan.

	<p pid="a.83.3/1">The BBC's Royal Charter&mdash;the seventh in the history of the corporation&mdash;is due to expire on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-31">31 December 2006</phrase>. We have today launched the first phase of a process of review that will result in a strong BBC, independent of government, from the end of the current charter and beyond. That period will be marked by continuing rapid advances in technology, and changes in society, culture and practice&mdash;the way people receive and make use of broadcast content. Charter review will be characterised by our openness, our efforts to engage as broad a section of the population as we can, and our commitment to listen to what people have to say. We are being helped in this by Lord Burns who will provide us with independent advice throughout.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/2">Charter review is not a single process. It will take a range of existing and planned work, including Ofcom's review of public service television, the independent review of BBC online and the forthcoming reviews of the BBC's new digital services. But it will also feature widespread public involvement, built around a three-phase process of consultation. Phase one starts today, based on a very broad consultation document&mdash;The Review of the BBC's Royal Charter&mdash;which we have published today. We have placed copies of the document&mdash;and a supporting leaflet&mdash;in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/3">Phase two, timed to begin around the end of 2004, will aim to bring together the results of phase one, the conclusions of various reviews taking place over the course of next year and the findings of our own programme of research into a Green Paper, which will be published for a further stage of consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/4">A White Paper will follow, with a further round of consultation. We will conclude the process with a full and formal opportunity for both Houses to contribute their views.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/5">Today's publication forms the central plank of phase one. It sets out a framework for consultation&mdash;based on a series of key themes&mdash;within which there is plenty of room for discussion of all aspects of the BBC's role, structure and function. The consultation will be supported by a programme of survey research and direct engagement with the public and stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/6">The BBC belongs to everyone. It is one of our most valued institutions. In many ways, it reflects what is best about the values, culture and society of the United Kingdom, at home and abroad. Charter review gives the whole country an opportunity to have its say about the kind of BBC it wants for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.5/2">Regulatory fee income is to assist with the funding of the NCSC, with the intention of achieving full cost recovery after five years, with a review in 2004. The policy on regulatory fees&mdash;including the intention of full cost recovery and the consequences for later years&mdash;was established following consultation in 2001. The fee structure also makes the costs of regulation transparent and borne by those who stand to benefit from more consistent national minimum standards so that pressures will apply to the regulatory process to ensure that it continues to be effective and efficient.</p>

The regulation of private and voluntary healthcare providers will move from the NCSC to the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection. The new commissions will further strengthen the system for inspecting those services.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.5/4">Individual letters are being sent to all providers of care services regulated by the NCSC to notify them about the increases.</p>

All post offices are able to arrange the issue of a game licence but not all offices stock licences on their premises. This is an operational matter for individual post offices and would normally reflect past demand. Large, directly managed post offices are most likely to keep stocks of licences.

The Post Office, in liaison with Defra officials, is currently exploring options for improving the availability of licences in the future. The Game Licences Act 1860 (Section 4) requires that every person taking or killing game, or assisting in such activities, takes out a licence to kill game under this Act. The penalty for acting without a valid licence is level 2 on the standard scale. Whether or not extenuating factors, such as the availability of licences, are taken into account during the legal process is a matter for the police, Crown Prosecution Service and, ultimately, the courts to decide.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.3/1">Evaluating the accessibility of a website is a complex issue and experts in this area, such as the RNIB, City University and AbilityNet advise that it cannot be undertaken by automated testing alone. The e-Envoy has recently had discussions with Business2WWW about how their latest automated testing is undertaken and upon what criteria the reported results are based. The e-government Metadata Framework was superseded by the e-Government Metadata Standard in 2001 (e-GMS). e-GMS is mandatory for new public sector IT systems and the number of sites meeting the standard will therefore improve as sites are replaced or upgraded. The e-Envoy encourages compliance through provision of guidance and good practice. Compliance is the responsibility of individual departments and local services and is self-regulatory through the use of National Computing Centre services and the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.6/1">The White Paper, Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain, published in February 2002, set out the Government's proposals for enhancing the significance of the acquisition of British citizenship. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 duly included provisions which, when brought into force at the start of 2004, will require all adult applicants for British citizenship to take an Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen and Pledge of Loyalty to the United Kingdom at a citizenship ceremony. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase> we published a consultation document which set out the Government's provisional views on the form and content of that citizenship ceremony. The 12-week period of consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-17">17 October</phrase> and 145 responses were received. Broadly, the responses supported the proposal that national symbols such as the Union flag and national anthem should feature in ceremonies throughout the United Kingdom and that these should be augmented with local features and symbols. A small minority of responses did not support the idea. The Government themselves remain strongly of the view that it would be right for these United Kingdom symbols to be used, given that the citizenship being bestowed is that of the United Kingdom as a whole. Other countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand certainly believe it appropriate to display national symbols at these events. We would encourage those who disagree to reflect further and to consider this issue from the viewpoint of the new citizens and what they might reasonably expect of a British citizenship ceremony, rather than impose their own views on what is appropriate. There was a positive response to the suggestion that local authorities might wish to impart their own flavour on ceremonies taking place in their area, and to the notion that prominent and recognised members of the local community might take part in ceremonies and formally welcome new citizens to their area. The suggestions on what form this local flavour might take recognised the importance of local adaptations not detracting from the dignified, celebratory and meaningful nature that government intend for citizenship ceremonies. Many areas proposed that they would involve local schools and community groups in their ceremonies. In terms of the musical content of ceremonies, the majority supported the playing of the national anthem immediately after the taking of the oath and pledge. Many areas said that they also intended to play recognised and appropriate pieces of music as new citizens entered and left the ceremony. A list will be given in the guidance for local authorities and registrars. The consultation document proposed a form of words for the ceremony welcome speech and for the address given by the local dignitary. The majority of responses supported the notion of standardisation of the main portions of these addresses, but said that they would ensure that any local additions did not detract from the formal welcome to both the UK and the local area. In terms of a commemorative gift, most thought that a commemorative certificate bearing that area's coat of arms or logo would be most appropriate. There was a unanimous view that any gift given must be meaningful of the event. A small percentage of respondents took the view that there was no need for a gift as such in that the grant of citizenship was in itself a gift. The Government are grateful to all of those individuals and organisations who took the time to read and respond to this document. The nature of the comments give us reason to believe that our proposals carry general suppport. We shall therefore proceed broadly in line with the format set out in the consultation document. The cost of the ceremonies will be included in an increased nationality fee, the details of which have been included in a statutory instrument to be laid today, which will mean no additional charge to the taxpayer. Details are in the attached table.</p>
