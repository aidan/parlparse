	<p pid="c.145.2/1">DfID leads the Government's efforts to develop alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan. In the financial year 2005&ndash;06, it is spending nearly &pound;50 million for this purpose. This is an almost tenfold increase on the amount spent in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/2">A proportion of this spending is specifically targeted on improving agricultural opportunities for Afghan farmers. This includes research to help identify, test and implement new crops and technologies. Between October 2002 and September 2005 DfID has agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilisers and poppy. Innovative ways for farmers to make a living are also being pursued, including apricot drying, honey bee keeping, tailoring and weaving and the introduction of fruit tree nurseries and greenhouses for vegetable production.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/3">At the same time as developing agricultural opportunities, it is important to develop non-farm alternative livelihoods if we are to ensure longer term sustainability. DfID activities in Badakshan and the Eastern Hazarajat provinces are developing sustainable economic alternatives and social incentives to enable farmers to stop growing poppy.</p>

Other personnel serve with the US-led coalition. All contribute to ensuring that the remnants of the Taliban cannot threaten the establishment of a stable, peaceful and democratic Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.5/2">ISAF support for counter-narcotics (CN) activity on the ground in Afghanistan is set out within the CN annex to the NATO operations plan and includes the sharing of information, support for the counter-narcotics information campaign through a variety of methods, such as poster and leaflet distribution and radio broadcasts, and the provision of enabling logistical support to Afghan and international CN agencies. It precludes proactive eradication and interdiction activity.</p>

	<p pid="c.146.2/1">The international community is providing assistance across all strands of the government of Afghanistan's 2005 counter-narcotics (CN) implementation plan. Using its G8 lead nation status for CN in Afghanistan, the UK has been pressing for increased financial and other support from international partners, particularly in G8 and EU fora. We have negotiated strong wording on support for Afghan counter-narcotics in the EU Drugs Action Plan. Under the UK presidency, we have been working with member states to produce a matrix of increased EU assistance that will also act as a lobbying tool to lever assistance from other countries. At our invitation, Afghan CN Minister Qaderi took part in the EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Informal on <phrase class="date" code="">9 September</phrase>, as well as the first EU-Afghanistan drugs troika on <phrase class="date" code="">6 September</phrase>. He delivered strong messages on the need for increased EU and other international support, including making contributions to the government of Afghanistan's CN trust fund. We are encouraging member states, as well as other countries, to channel funding through the CN trust fund, and to provide training and expert assistance, including mentors for the CN Criminal Justice Task Force and Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA). Recently, Poland has offered to provide CNPA with trainers for an 18-month period and the European Commission has committed &euro;15 million to the CN trust fund.</p>

	<p pid="c.154.0/1">Since its arrival in December 2004, the European Union force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR) has, under the leadership of Major General David Leakey, successfully carried out its primary mission of providing deterrence, reassurance and a safe and secure environment for the Bosnian and international authorities to carry out their work. In addition to this primary mission, EUFOR has also vigorously pursued its key supporting tasks, including providing assistance to the fight against organised crime, supporting the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHR) mission implementation plan and supporting the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Key activity has included intelligence-based weapons collection operations and a number of significant operations targeting organised crime. In a typical three-month period, EUFOR collect some 500 small arms, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 2,500 hand grenades and over 250 kilograms of explosives. As a direct result of EUFOR's operations against fuel smugglers and illegal loggers, well over 100 cases have been brought to trial, and tax revenues on fuel have increased significantly. EUFOR has and will continue to work closely with NATO, the special representative, the EU police mission and others to provide an environment in which reform and reconstruction can take place.</p>

However, the Government believe that such a change is neither necessary nor appropriate. The Government introduced Holocaust Memorial Day as an annual national commemoration, taking place each year on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January</phrase>, for the victims of the Nazis' genocide of the Jewish people, and for the other victims of Nazi genocidal and racial policies.

	<p pid="c.159.2/1">From July 2001, when English Partnerships, the national regeneration agency, took ownership of the Dome, to the end of September 2005, the total cost to English Partnerships of the Dome was &pound;31.55 million, or &pound;30.15 million net after deducting income of &pound;1.4 million from interim events. These totals include &pound;9.76 million gross, or &pound;8.36 million net after deduction of income of &pound;1.4 million from interim events, for management, maintenance and security of the Dome, including English Partnerships' staff costs, and a one-off payment of &pound;588,000 for insurance. In addition, English Partnerships spent &pound;6.7 million on decommissioning some of the Dome contents, and &pound;14.5 million on the sale process from March 1999 to June 2004 when the commercial deal between English Partnerships and Meridian Delta Ltd and Anschutz Entertainment Group went unconditional.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.2/2">Of the above totals, some &pound;1 million was incurred on the first sale process up until the Dome closed to the public on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-31">31 December 2000</phrase>. All other costs have been incurred after closure of the Dome to the public, in preparation for its future use.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.2/3">The current average monthly cost of the dome to English Partnerships is around &pound;35,000, which is unlikely to change significantly. As indicated before, English Partnerships will hand over full responsibility for the Dome to Anschutz Entertainment Group in June 2007, when the arena inside the Dome is expected to be completed.</p>

	<p pid="c.160.6/1">The Government are concerned by instability in the North Caucasus. A number of factors have contributed to this instability, including popular discontent with poor socio-economic conditions, corruption, ethnic and clan-based tensions and ongoing security problems related to the recent history of conflict in the region, as last week's attack in Nalchik illustrated. But local extremists, some of whom have adopted the ideology and tactics of international terrorism, have, exploited the situation in the region. And international terrorists have taken advantage of the instability for propaganda purposes. We welcome President Putin's acknowledgement of the need to address broader problems, including the need to respect human rights, as the best means to bring stability to the region.</p>

	<p pid="c.163.2/1">Following news of the south Asia earthquake, DfID immediately mobilised its emergency response system. In response to a specific request from the government of Pakistan, search and rescue teams were sent to the non-affected areas. The first, a 12-person team, provided by the non-governmental organisation RAPID and accompanied by a humanitarian adviser from DfID departed the UK in the early evening of <phrase class="date" code="">Saturday 8 October</phrase>. This team was the first international team to arrive in Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="c.163.2/2">In addition, an aircraft carrying a further 75 search and rescue personnel from the UK Fire Service, the International Rescue corps, dog rescue teams from BIRD and CANIS, together with a further team from RAPID, left the UK at 2 am on <phrase class="date" code="">Sunday 9 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.163.2/3">These personnel worked tirelessly to save the lives of those trapped under the rubble of the buildings and rescued a total of 14 people.</p>
	<p pid="c.163.2/4">The UK search and rescue teams are now making a phased withdrawal from Pakistan and personnel begin arriving back on Friday.</p>
	<p pid="c.163.2/5">Our priorities now are assisting the government of Pakistan with the provision of shelter, bedding, food, water, sanitation and medical supplies for those who have been affected by the earthquake. DfID has pledged a total of &pound;13 million to the relief effort.</p>

	<p pid="c.163.5/1">The Government are committed to pressing for an improvement in the situation in Sudan and will be seeking discussion in the UN Security Council on a range of further measures. The UK already implements an embargo against the whole of Sudan in line with the EU arms embargo against the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.163.5/2">Under the terms of the UN arms embargo on Darfur, provision of military equipment, such as armoured personnel carriers (APC), to any of the parties in Darfur is prohibited without obtaining the prior permission of the UN sanctions committee. However, as part of the effort to resource the African Union (AU) force effectively, Canada has donated 105 APCs to the UN which are awaiting delivery. With the EU, we are insisting that the government of Sudan expedite their delivery. These will allow the AU force to better carry out their mission in the light of recent attacks upon them.</p>
	<p pid="c.163.5/3">The International Criminal Court began a formal investigation into the events in Darfur on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June</phrase>. The Court will carry out its investigations into Darfur, as with all other investigations, in an entirely independent capacity. The timing of the indictments, like the names and numbers of those to be investigated or prosecuted, is solely within the prosecutor's discretion. The chief prosecutor is due to update the Security Council on the status of the investigation in December.</p>

The AU has requested further funding assistance from donors, including a further &euro;70 million from the EU's African Peace Facility. The AU is planning a joint assessment mission to consider whether a further increase is needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.164.2/2">The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) liaises closely with AMIS, through the AU Commission chairperson's special representative in Sudan, through meetings with the AU in Addis Ababa and through its constant presence and increasing joint activities on the ground in Darfur such as training in policing and operational planning. UNMIS has a liaison staff permanently deployed to the AMIS headquarters in El Fasher to ensure this support is closely co-ordinated. Additionally, the UN assistance cell to the AU, based in Addis Ababa, helps support the African Union in planning and providing technical advice for AMIS and works closely with other partners to facilitate the AU Commission's efforts to secure required resources and other support needs for AMIS.</p>
