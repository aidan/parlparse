	<p pid="a.61.8/1">Identity interviews were added to the passport process primarily to address first time application fraud through deterrence and fraud detection arising from a personal interview.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.8/2">In 2008 one application was refused as a direct result of a confirmation of identity interview. In 2009 two applications were refused as a result of this process and a further two were refused up to the end of August 2010. In addition to the five instances of confirmed fraud mentioned above, applications have also been withdrawn when customers are advised that an identity interview is required. From September 2007 to August 2010, 3,153 applications were withdrawn at this stage. Together this information underlines the usefulness of the interview as a deterrent to those attempting to make a fraudulent passport application. Notwithstanding this IPS is currently reviewing its interview processes to improve on fraud prevention and deterrence.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">The Government have put in place the necessary arrangements to create a special four-day Jubilee weekend over the first week in June in 2012. This will allow communities to come together to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Although planning for the Diamond Jubilee is still at an early stage, we are considering a number of ideas and working closely with Royal Household colleagues who are developing a programme of events for 2012.
