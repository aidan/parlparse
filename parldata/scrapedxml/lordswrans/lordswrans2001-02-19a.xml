	<p pid="a.69.2/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport wrote to the Football Supporters' Association and National Federation of Football Supporters' Clubs last year asking them to draw the IFC chairman post to the attention of those they thought would be good candidates for the post. The Government have made clear that the process of appointing the chairman is to be conducted in an open and transparent manner according to the standards that would apply to a public appointment. Therefore the consideration of applications once received, following open advertisement, is a matter for the Independent Public Appointments Advisory Panel.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.5/1">It is my understanding of the matter that the authorities in Jersey have not yet frozen funds related to the Abacha affair, but that the financial institutions there are aware of the sanctions--on the fronts of constructive trusteeship, regulatory law and criminal law--which attach to any transfer of funds which transpire to have been the proceeds of crime, and may therefore have taken precautionary steps for their own protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.5/2">In respect of the request to freeze funds in the United Kingdom, the position remains that we await further information from the Nigerian authorities before we can take the action sought. We are actively pursuing the solicitors acting for the Nigerian Government to secure the information needed, and repeat our willingness to assist the Nigerian authorities whenever it is possible to do so, according to United Kingdom law. It is my understanding that the Jersey authorities are in the same position.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">The Government will shortly be inviting Parliament to approve a wide-ranging package of improvements to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. The scheme provides payment to those who have been the victim of a crime of violence or who have been injured in trying to apprehend criminals or prevent crime in England, Wales and Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/2">The introduction of the statutory scheme in 1996 broke the link with the common law damages basis of assessing compensation used under the earlier, non-statutory scheme. Compensation is now determined on the basis of a tariff (scale) of awards for injuries of comparable severity. Additional compensation for loss of earnings or earning capacity and the costs of care are payable to victims more seriously affected by their injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/3">In 1999 the Government published a consultation paper Compensating Victims of Violent Crime: Possible Changes to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. The paper sought views on how the scheme might be improved in the interests of victims of violent crime. It was sent to individuals and organisations with a particular interest in the scheme, to the media, and to members of the public on request. Those responding included victims' organisations, academics, trades unions, the legal profession, police, charities and individual victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/4">The Government made it clear in the consultation paper that any changes to the scheme would have to be made within the existing legislative framework. In the light of the responses to the consultation paper, and of the outcome of the Spending Review 2000, the Government have carried out a thorough review of the scheme and have drawn up a wide-ranging package of improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/5">The Great Britain Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is already one of the most generous and comprehensive in the world. The improvements that the Government are now proposing will mean that many victims of violent crime, especially those more seriously injured, will receive even more compensation for their injuries, and that all victims will find the scheme clearer and easier to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/6">Outline details of the changes proposed are as follows: Uprating the tariff levels:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/7">Some respondents to the consultation exercise argued that the value of the tariff awards had been eroded since the tariff scheme's inception in 1996. However, an across the board reflation of all tariff bands would be very expensive, and the Government do not consider that this is either necessary or would make best use of the available resources. Awards at the top end and bottom end of the tariff do not, in the main, differ too significantly from the level of damages typically awarded by a court. It is in the middle bands where any divergence is more noticeable. The Government accordingly propose to uplift tariff bands 7 to 23 inclusive by 10 per cent. This will significantly increase the compensation payable to many more seriously injured victims. Increased Awards for Sexual Assault and Child Abuse:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/8">The view was widespread amongst respondents to the consultation exercise that compensation for rape and child abuse was too low. The Government have looked carefully at this very complex area, and are proposing that there should be a significant increase in awards for rape and sexual assault and for serious sexual and/or physical abuse of children. For example, the minimum award for rape would be increased by almost 50 per cent (from &pound;7,000 to &pound;11,000), and the maximum payable for serious physical child abuse would more than double. All the injury descriptions relating to physical and sexual abuse have been carefully reviewed and the relevant sections of the tariff re-ordered for greater clarity. The Government also propose additional payments of compensation for victims infected with HIV/Aids. Increasing awards for serious multiple injuries:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/9">Compensation for victims who suffer serious multiple injuries is calculated by formula. Under the present scheme, victims receive 100 per cent of the tariff award for the most serious (highest value) injury, 10 per cent of the award for the second, and 5 per cent for the third. Many respondents to the consultation exercise thought this formula left more seriously injured victims under-compensated, despite the formula being developed on the basis of practice in the civil courts. The Government share that concern, and propose to increase the formula to 100 per cent, 30 per cent, 15 per cent. Extending eligibility for fatal awards to partners of the same sex:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/10">Under the current arrangements, only parents, children, spouses or long-term heterosexual partners of homicide victims can qualify for a fatal award under the tariff. The Government believe that there are no grounds for continuing to exclude long-term homosexual or lesbian partners from this aspect of the scheme, an issue that was highlighted following the bombing of the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho in 1999. The Government will be recommending that Parliament makes the appropriate change to the scheme. Other detailed changes:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/11">Having thoroughly reviewed the scheme, and in the light of the advice of the bodies charged with its administration, the Government are proposing to refine many of the injury descriptions and make presentational changes to the layout of the tariff of awards to make it simpler for victims to understand. The Government also propose making a number of minor, textual changes to the scheme itself to remove possible ambiguities and provide greater clarity where experience has suggested this would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/12">The proposed changes to the scheme would cost some &pound;20 million in a full year. The Government believe that the proposed package of changes will greatly improve the scheme for the benefit of victims of violent crime, and that the wide-ranging changes proposed would make the most effective use of the resources available.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/13">The Government will shortly be laying a draft of the scheme incorporating the proposed changes before Parliament, and inviting approval by the affirmative resolution procedure.

	<p pid="a.75.5/1">Extending the fixed penalty system to offences associated with disorderly behaviour will provide the police with an immediate and swift response to a range of minor offending. The scheme will provide the police with an additional means of dealing with these offenders: all existing options will remain open. Although we expect there to be a net saving of police time, the precise effect on police workload will depend upon the operation of the scheme in practice. If penalty notices are issued to offenders who would otherwise have been charged, there will be a saving in police paperwork and time attending court. Issuing notices to offenders who were previously moved on or informally warned would clearly bring additional offending within the criminal justice system, with the extra demands on time that that entails.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-02-19a.80.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="80"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010219/text/10219w03.htm#10219w03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.80.2/1">The works referred to are on the A.12 Brentwood Bypass and the M.11 between Junction 8 and to a point where the motorway crosses the A.1060 near Little Hallingbury. These are the latest in a series of major maintenance schemes on these roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2">Although both routes have been regularly maintained in the past, this has largely been on the basis of localised and emergency repair works. As a result of our Comprehensive Spending and Trunk Road Reviews, we have now made road maintenance a priority and, with the extra and guaranteed funding, the Highways Agency has been able to tackle the backlog of essential maintenance with a concerted programme of major works on both these roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/3">The Highways Agency very carefully considers the impact that such schemes will have on users of the trunk road and motorway network. Its aim is to keep disruption and inconvenience to a minimum and to make sure that, wherever possible, major roadworks on existing routes are no more than 2.5 miles long and at least 6 miles apart. The agency also has targets to keep 95 per cent of lanes on the motorway and trunk road network as a whole free of roadworks at all times and to keep 93 per cent of lanes on each motorway and trunk road free of roadworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/4">Wherever possible, the agency tries to leave an alternative strategic route unaffected. Although the M.11 and A.12 cannot be considered as direct alternatives to each other, the current works were originally planned not to coincide on these vital routes to and from East Anglia. However, major schemes such as these require considerable time in preparation and unforeseen circumstances can delay the start of works, as has happened in the case of the A.12.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/5">After careful consideration, the agency decided that the works could not be postponed on either route until the other had been completed. It concluded that the overall effect on the network of working on both the A.12 and M.11 simultaneously would not be severe if the schemes were carefully planned. The experience of earlier phases in the major maintenance programme and the evidence to date on the current works have shown this to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/6">The agency has taken extensive steps to limit the severity of any disruption. Work on both schemes is being carried out 24 hours a day to ensure that they are completed as quickly as possible. At peak times the work is organised so that as many lanes as possible are open to traffic. The agency has also extensively publicised the schemes to encourage people to consider using alternative routes or public transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/7">I believe these measures have reduced the levels of inconvenience to the public a great deal and the agency will continue to use them to limit levels of congestion during future major maintenance works on these and other routes.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.2/1">The Government are committed to protecting endangered species and habitats--it is a key part of our sustainable development agenda. This was demonstrated by the new measures introduced through the Countryside and Rights of Way Act. Penalties for killing protected species have been increased and a new offence of recklessly damaging or destroying any structure or place occupied by these animals has been introduced. Increased protection was also given to Sites of Special Scientific Interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/2">The regulations which implement the EC Habitats Directive in the United Kingdom clearly state that licences to damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of a protected species as a result of development can only be issued if there is no satisfactory alternative; that the action authorised will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the population of the species concerned at a favourable conservation status and for imperative reasons of overriding public interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.5/2">John Steele proposed the payment of lump sums to pre-<phrase class="date" code="1982-11-25">25 November 1982</phrase> widows whose husbands had been killed as a result of terrorism. This proposal was accepted by the Government and we have been working to implement it by April 2001. As John Steele noted in his report (paragraph 42) there are complicated tax issues to be considered and we are looking at these with the Inland Revenue.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.0/1">Historically, South Armagh has been a very dangerous area for the security forces. The towers helped to reduce that risk considerably and it is only when that danger disappears or is reduced to a minimal level that significant movement can be made in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/2">We do want to see the removal of all the special security measures in South Armagh in due course. This must however be assessed against the threat posed.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/3">Any change to the current security force infrastructure in South Armagh will depend on the ongoing assessment of the threat. We will not take risks with the lives of the people of Northern Ireland and we will take further measures only when it is safe to do so.</p>
