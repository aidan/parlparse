	<p pid="b.31.5/1">The British Antarctic Survey advises that almost all the Larsen B ice shelf has already disintegrated and this has added little to global sea level rise. It is unlikely that the west Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) will collapse completely during the next 50 years but a study commissioned by Defra in 2002 suggested that there was a 5 per cent. chance of WAIS disintegration within the next two centuries. Recent changes to the WAIS are contributing between 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm/year to global (and thus UK) sea level rise. By 2050 this could cause a total additional increase in sea level of between 5 mm and 10 mm.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.5/2">To put these figures in context, global sea levels are currently rising at between 10 mm and 20 mm/decade because of thermal expansion of the ocean and glacier melt. Future sea level rises around the UK are not expected to be uniform because of regional factors. The 2002 UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) scenarios for the south-east of the country indicate an increase of 260 mm and 860 mm above current levels by the 2080s.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase>, European Union Foreign Ministers added the EU's voice to the growing support for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms, and called for the start of a formal negotiation process at the United Nations (UN) at the earliest opportunity.

The Insolvency Rules place similar duties on the personal representatives of insolvency practitioners to make notifications in the case of the death of an administrator, a liquidator, or a trustee in bankruptcy. In all cases, including energy administration, notice can instead be given by a partner in the firm of the deceased insolvency practitioner, or by anyone else producing a copy of the relevant death certificate.

The estimates themselves have not been published at this time as this information is commercially sensitive and discussion of estimated costs may prejudice the procurement process by limiting the department's ability to secure value for money from the market. The capital costs for the scheme will be amortised in line with this department's published resource accounting policies and the Government's resource accounting manual. Capital costs will be depreciated over varying lengths of time dependent upon the estimated working life of the asset.

	<p pid="b.44.0/1">The organisation of festivals is primarily a matter for festival organisers. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will shortly consult on a draft policy and guidance framework for festivals. Part of the rationale for the draft policy is to seek to improve event management and organisational capacity in community festivals.</p>

Individuals in receipt of jobseekers allowance are however required to be available for and demonstrate that they are actively seeking work. If individuals offer to seek specific jobs as part of their jobseekers agreement then they are expected to follow up such applications.

	<p pid="b.53.5/1">Within the broad statutory limits set by Parliament, it is for the courts to decide in individual cases whether a prison sentence is appropriate. The latest information on the prison population by offence group is published in Table two of the September 2005 <i>Population in Custody</i> monthly tables, a copy of which will be placed in the House of Lords Library. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 recognises the need to protect the public from dangerous offenders by the creation of extended and indefinite sentences ensuring greater scrutiny of whether or not the offender is safe to release and, in some cases, enabling detention for the rest of the offender's life. Prisoners who are considered to be of low risk to the public may be released early under the home detention curfew scheme (HDC) if they meet the eligibility criteria and pass a careful risk assessment. HDC allows prisoners to spend the final part of their sentence on curfew at a suitable, approved address. HDC will not be granted to those who pose a significant risk to victims or the public.</p>

The research indicated a number of reasons for the decline of which predation by domestic cats and sparrowhawks was thought to be one of the reasons of decline in urban house sparrows.
