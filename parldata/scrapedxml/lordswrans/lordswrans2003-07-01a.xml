	<p pid="a.74.5/1">A report on the 2001 census key statistics for wards in England and Wales is being laid before Parliament today. Copies in electronic media are available in the Libraries of the House and from the Office for National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.5/2">The report will provide a compact and self-contained reference, providing key results covering a wide range of census topics. Figures for the 8,875 wards and electoral divisions in England and Wales, presented generally as percentage distributions, can be readily compared with those for other areas and with the national averages. The report, in the form of a CD ROM, is effectively a supplement to the 2001 census report on key statistics for local authorities in England and Wales, laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase>, but which, for technical reasons, could not be released at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.5/3">The report will comprise a set of 24 tables covering all the 8,005 wards in England and the 870 electoral divisions in Wales, as well as comparable national figures for England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.5/4">A similar range of statistics for census output areas, prepared under Section 4(2) of the Census Act, is also being made publicly available today. Output areas are the smallest geographical area level for which detailed census information is produced. They are areas that typically comprise around 125 households, and have a minimum population threshold of 100 persons and 40 resident households, below which key statistics may not be released.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.5/5">These key statistics for wards and output areas will also be freely available on the National Statistics website through the Neighbourhood Statistic Service from today.</p>

The artwork is comprised of eight drawings, two paintings, four glass pieces and a wooden/copper sculpture. Only the latter item of artwork, costing &pound;864, was actually paid for by the SEUPB. The other items predated the SEUPB and were transferred at no cost from DOF to the SEUPB upon occupation of the Monaghan premises. This one item was ordered by DOF in 1999, but only arrived in 2000 and it is this item which the SEUPB actually paid for.

	<p pid="a.81.2/1">We are assisting Ulsterbus under the Northern Ireland rural transport fund to introduce and operate new bus services in rural areas, which are economically unviable. The fund currently supports 53 Ulsterbus routes, which provide 1,158 additional services each week to people in rural areas. Of these routes 21 have been introduced since April 2002. The fund also supports the operations of 16 rural community transport partnerships, which provides door-to-door and group hire services using accessible mini-buses. Most of rural Northern Ireland is now covered by partnerships and we are working to extend coverage to those areas currently without such services. The resources available to the fund are due to increase to &pound;4.1 million in 2005&ndash;06 from the current level of &pound;1.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/2">Public transport in rural areas will also benefit from measures being taken to improve services in Northern Ireland generally. Grant aid of &pound;46 million over the next three years to assist Translink to purchase new buses will enable the company to introduce more new low-floor buses on rural routes. We have also initiated a pilot scheme to tender for the supply of new bus services outside the Belfast area to be supported by bus route subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/3">The regional transportation strategy (RTS) 2002&ndash;12 identifies a range of possible measures to improve public transport in rural areas, including new flexible demand-responsive services. The RTS is being implemented throught three transport plans. The sub-regional transport plan will consider the appropriate mix of different types of public transport services needed in different locations. We are committed to the development of an accessible transport strategy by December 2004. That strategy will help inform the emerging transport plans and assist targeting of resources to promote social inclusion and target social need in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.8/1">The rules governing the free postage scheme, which was introduced in 2001, have been kept under review by the Administration and Works Committee. In November 2001 the committee increased the maximum number of pre-paid envelopes that could be issued at one time from 50 to 100, and agreed that Members' staff who are pass-holders could collect envelopes on Members' behalf. In December 2002 the committee agreed to a request to add self-seal envelopes to the range of stationery available. However, the committee's view remains that it is appropriate to have rules in place to ensure that the overall take-up and cost of the scheme can be monitored. These rules will also assist the House authorities in implementing the decision of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-14">14 January</phrase> to include the costs of the free postage scheme within the House of Lords' publication scheme, in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The rules in the House of Commons are a matter for the authorities of that House.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.2/1">The Government of Mozambique have outlined their plan to tackle poverty in the Plano de Accoano de Reducoano da Pobreza Absoluta (PARPA) 2001&ndash;05, which constitutes the country's poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP). The PARPA was approved in September 2001. It has as its central objective the reduction of the incidence of absolute poverty from its 1999 level of 70 per cent to less than 60 per cent by 2005 and less than 50 per cent by 2010. The PARPA identifies five priority areas: health, education, agriculture and rural development, good governance and infrastructure. An operational matrix has been developed that contains the main actions to be carried out in each sector over the five-year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.2/2">The Government of Mozambique have also developed a strategic framework for the monitoring and evaluation of the PARPA and are committed to ensuring that this framework is implemented in partnership with key stakeholders including civil society. In April 2003, the government established the poverty observatory (OP)&mdash;one of the central planks of the monitoring and evaluation strategy. DfID welcomes the establishment of the poverty observatory as an important mechanism to facilitate dialogue on the PARPA by a range of actors.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.2/3">Civil society organisations participated in the first meetings of the poverty observatory but their engagement was constrained by a lack of clarity about their role in the process and the unclear agenda that was set for the consultation. In addition, civil society representation was disproportionately Maputo-based. There is a need now to build on the foundations of the poverty observatory so as to make it a more meaningful instrument for dialogue and exchange between government and civil society.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.2/4">In 2001 DfID-Mozambique funded a consultancy to appraise civil society participation in the PARPA process. We are now taking this forward, working closely with a number of other donor agencies. It is hoped that this will lead to a more strategic approach to supporting the strengthening of the level and nature of civil society participation in the PARPA monitoring and evaluation process.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.1/2" qnum="HL3534">Whether issues of international trade affecting developing countries should not be taken in isolation but should be discussed in conjunction with debt relief, development aid, poverty reduction, the environment, movement of labour and health; and, if so, what steps they will take to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.2/1">The Government fully support an integrated approach to development that looks at all dimensions of poverty in a holistic way. The UK's trade strategy for poor countries is no exception and is embedded in the overall development strategy of DfID, as set out in the two White Papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/2">Globalisation is reinforcing the need for an integrated approach to policy-making. Policies no longer fit into neat sectoral boxes and the distinction between domestic and international policy is increasingly blurred. Most domestic policies, such as taxation, have international implications and most international policies, such as trade, have domestic implications. The formulation of sustainable development strategies in a global economy requires developed and developing countries to have more joined-up and coherent policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/3">Developed countries have a particular responsibility. There is no sense, for example, in using development assistance to support countries, and then undermining this through trade restrictions and unfair subsidies. All developed country policies towards the world's poorest countries should be consistent with a commitment to sustainable development and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/4">DfID's integrated approach to development policy also maximises the effectiveness of its development assistance. There has been a significant shift in DfID's approach away from stand-alone projects towards creating institutions and policies required to build accountable and effective states. International development assistance is more effective at reducing poverty when it is used to support a shared agenda set by a credible poverty reduction strategy (PRS). This approach&mdash;to which DfID and other donors committed themselves at Monterrey&mdash;provides the right framework for governments and donors to agree the priorities for policy reform and expenditure together with their citizens. Aid is provided in support of these poverty reduction strategies and is conditional on governments staying on course with the reform agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/5">DfID's new country assistance plans (CAP) start from the basis of our partner countries' own PRSs and set out in detail how DfID will work in an integrated way to support these as part of the international development effort.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.5/1">The Government's position, set out in the 2000 White Paper Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work For The Poor, is that we will indeed urge the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to commit itself with the rest of the international community to achieving the international development targets. Dr Supachai, Director General of the WTO, has stated that he is also personally committed to these goals, though he recognizes that the WTO is not a development organization, and thus must work with other agencies such as the World Bank, UNCTAD, and UNDP to ensure complementary policies to achieve these targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/2">The WTO and its members can best contribute to attainment of the MDGs by ensuring that the current WTO round delivers on the ambition of the Doha development agenda and that the negotiations result in tangible benefits for developing countries and the poor. This is particularly true of progress needed in the various negotiations of most importance to developing countries, such as agriculture, TRIPS and public health and special and differential treatment. We will be working hard in the run-up to the 5th WTO ministerial meeting in Mexico in September to ensure that we secure a successful outcome to these negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.0/1">Government has a duty to act in the best interest of citizens. Exposing the Crown to criminal liability generally could promote an excessively cautious approach to government and could divert public resources into litigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.0/2">However, Crown immunity is being removed, where appropriate, as legislative opportunities arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.3/1">We have a substantial strategic stock of smallpox vaccine, which would be rapidly deployed to contain any outbreak. We have taken steps to considerably increase our supplies. We are planning for every eventuality and this includes the ability to vaccinate the entire population if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.3/2">With regard to anthrax and other biological agents that could be used as deliberate release weapons for example plague and tularaemia, the first line treatment for these would be antibiotics rather than vaccines.</p>
