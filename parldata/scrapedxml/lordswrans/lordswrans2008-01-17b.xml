	Alcohol: Hospital Admissions
</minor-heading>

<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-01-17b.273.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100949" speakername="Baroness Coussins" colon="" colnum="273"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80117w0001.htm#08011759000026">
	<p pid="b.273.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/2" qnum="HL859">What will be the exact definition of the term &quot;alcohol-related&quot; in the new indicator to be used by the NHS from April 2008 in relation to hospital admission; who will elicit and record this information; and whether all NHS hospitals will be obliged to use the same definition and monitoring method.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-01-17b.273.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100960" speakername="Lord Darzi of Denham" colon=":" colnum="273"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80117w0001.htm#08011759000027">
	<p pid="b.273.2/1">The recently announced public service agreement on reducing the harm caused by alcohol and drugs included, as one of the national outcome-focused performance measures, an indicator relating to the rate of alcohol-related hospital admissions. The same indicator will also be included in the set of performance management indicators for both primary care trusts and local authorities (referred to respectively as the <I>Outcomes and Accountability Framework</I> and the <I>Performance Framework for Local Authorities and Local Authority Partnerships: Single Set of National Indicators</I>.)</p>
	<p pid="b.273.2/2">The definition of the alcohol indicator is &quot;Rate of hospital admissions for alcohol related harm per 100,000 population&quot;. Local figures on the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol-related harm per 100,000 population will be derived from the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.2/3">The rate is calculated using data on those finished in-year admissions that are classified as ordinary or day cases and that have a primary or subsidiary diagnosis code shown in the following table. Only those alcohol-related diagnoses with a sufficiently high attributable fraction (greater than 0.2) are used. Alcohol-related admissions are estimated by multiplying the total admissions within each diagnosis category, age group and sex by the corresponding attributable fraction. The numbers are standardised using the European age profile.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.2/4">These data are available on a frequent and timely basis through an existing national data set (currently the HES.) This indicator will therefore measure the impact of prevention interventions, without creating an additional burden for local healthcare organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.2/5">The HES are considered to be sensitive to the impact of prevention interventions&mdash;ie, when prevention interventions are improved, hospital admission for specific chronic and acute conditions should slow in the short, medium and long term.</p>

	<p pid="b.282.5/1">The disproportionate cost threshold (DCT) currently stands at &pound;700. Since 1991 the DCT has been set at eight times the average marginal cost of answering Written Parliamentary Questions. Marginal cost is taken as the direct cost of civil servants' time. Average cost is based on a sample of all Written Parliamentary Questions answered by those departments with the highest volume of Questions. Such samples are taken on a quinquennial basis, the next being due in 2009. In years between quinquennial samples, the Treasury applies indexation to the DCT but only increases it in &pound;50 steps to avoid the need for frequent small increases. The last such increase was in November 2006.</p>
