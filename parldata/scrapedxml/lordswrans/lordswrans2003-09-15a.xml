	<p pid="a.153.5/1">No. The overriding principle is that judges are appointed on merit and that those appointed are the most able and suitable. However, it is important to be able to make appointments from the widest possible pool of applicants, and the judicial appointments process should seek to bring forward the most talented candidates for appointment from the diverse groups within our society. The creation of a Judicial Appointments Commission will provide a fresh opportunity to look at the ways in which the appointments process works.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/1">I am pleased to announce the publication today of the second annual report of the Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements (the MAPPA) of the 42 police and probation areas in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/2">The MAPPA have made a significant difference to the way the police and probation services protect the public from the risks posed by sexual and other violent offenders. The MAPPA were established by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 and introduced in April 2001. As a direct result there is now greater consistency and robustness in arrangements to manage these offenders and an increasing involvement of other agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/3">I am very pleased that the statutory arrangements we introduced are proving to be so effective. However, there is no room for complacency: to consolidate good practice we have included provision in the Criminal Justice Bill to formalise the involvement of other agencies in this very important area of public protection. I congratulate the police and probation services for their commitment and achievement in developing the MAPPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/4">Each annual report contains the number of MAPPA offenders in that area. The total number has increased. As expected, some offenders remain within the MAPPA longer than a year, some for life or for as long as they present a serious risk of harm to the public. The total number of MAPPA offenders increased 12 per cent to 52,809, of which 21,413 are registered sex offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/5">For the first time annual reports contain information about the number of MAPPA offenders referred to the highest level of MAPPA activity&mdash;the multi-agency public protection panels (MAPPPs). Offenders are referred to a MAPPP because they present a particularly high risk or difficulties. In England and Wales 2,843 offenders (5 per cent of the total) were managed through referral to a MAPPP. Early indications are that the recidivism of offenders managed through MAPPPs is significantly reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/6">Public protection is one of this government's highest priorities and the excellent work the police and probation services have done to improve it through the MAPPA deserves to be widely acknowledged.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/7">I have placed in the Library a copy of each area report together with other background information about the operation of the MAPPA.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.2/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is today publishing a draft, for public consultation, of a new planning policy statement (PPS) on Sustainable Development in Rural Areas in England. It is the Government's intention that the new PPS (PPS7) should, in due course, replace existing planning policy guidance note 7 (PPG7), The Countryside&mdash;Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development) published February 1997).</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/2">The December 2001 planning Green Paper, Planning&mdash;delivering a fundamental change, announced that, as part of their proposals for reforming the planning system, the Government intended to review all their planning policy guidance to see whether it is needed; to seek greater clarity; and to remove from national policy guidance advice on practical implementation and policies which are better expressed at a regional or local level. In line with these proposals, the ODPM, in close consultation with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), carried out a review of PPG7. The conclusion of this review was that there remains a strong requirement for a distinct set of national planning policies that address the particular circumstances of rural areas and the wider countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/3">Consequently, a consultation draft of new PPS7 has been prepared, setting out key national planning policies for achieving thriving, sustainable rural communities, supporting development that meets the economic, social and recreational needs of all, and protecting the quality of the countryside and its landscapes. The PPS also recognises the importance of supporting a sustainable and diverse agricultural industry, and of the role of the tourism and leisure sectors in rural areas.When, in due course, they are issued in their final form, these policies will inform planning authorities, regional planning bodies and planning inspectors in carrying out their land use planning and development control responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/4">In the mean time, the Government are seeking views on draft PPS7 from a wide range of interested parties. The consultation period will run for 12 weeks, closing on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-12">12 December 2003</phrase>. Copies of the consultation document are being made available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.2/1">Despite above inflation increases in grant for all English local authorities in 2003&ndash;04, we were disappointed that the average council tax increase was 12.9 per cent. Having looked at the budget returns from all English authorities, we have considered very carefully whether to use our powers under Part IVA of the Local Government Act 1992 to cap any local authority budgets. We have decided against doing so this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/2">Every local authority has a responsibility to its own taxpayers and electors. However, the Government are clear that the current trend in council tax rises is not sustainable. We will look at council tax rises very closely next year and we will also want to take account of the trend in increases over more than one year. Local authorities should be aware that we are prepared to use our targeted capping powers in 2004&ndash;05. In exceptional circumstances I do not rule out the possibility of capping authorities categorised as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot; in the current and future comprehensive performance assessments.</p>
