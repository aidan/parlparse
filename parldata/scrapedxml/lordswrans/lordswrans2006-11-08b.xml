	<p pid="b.159.5/1">Mining of Afghanistan's natural resources such as coal, gas and minerals represents a significant economic opportunity over the medium and long term. DfID, the US and the World Bank have provided support to help the Government of Afghanistan develop this sector. DfID provides &pound;3.85 million in technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and the Afghan Geological Survey, to help build institutional capacity to manage these resources and attract foreign investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.5/2">DfID provides &pound;1 million to the Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Fund (AIGF)&mdash;a World Bank administered trust fund that pools funding from the Asian Development Bank and Germany. This is an innovative mechanism which seeks to help entrepreneurs overcome the risks involved in investing in fragile and post-conflict states. To date, $18 million in foreign investment has been leveraged for an agri-business project in northern Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.5/3">DfID also provides funding for research on other economic opportunities that create jobs andwealth. For example, the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU) has explored the prospects for trade and enterprise in sectors such as carpets, raisins, and construction materials.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.5/4">DfID is providing &pound;3 million for research into potential agricultural livelihood options for rural Afghans. The fund helps identify local, national and international market opportunities for high-value alternative crops, including an organic export feasibility study. DfID also provides &pound;3.7 million for new and innovative ways for farmers to make a living in Eastern Hazarajat (one of the poorest areas in Afghanistan), including apricot drying, poultry, honey bee keeping, tailoring and weaving, silk and cashmere wool production and the introduction of fruit tree nurseries and greenhouses for vegetable production.</p>

This aims to help the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) identify and remove barriers to private sector development, and create an investment climate conducive to economic growth. DfID also provides &pound;3.85 million to the Ministry of Mines to help the GoA manage its natural resources and attract foreign investment.

	<p pid="b.162.2/1">A review of the Army post-operational stress management (POSM) policy was undertaken in September 2005. No substantive changes were made to the section of the policy relating to the role of families and colleagues in detecting mental ill health, since it already recognised that friends and family, colleagues, and those in the chain of command all have a part to play in detecting and managing operational stress. The policy recognises that they are often the first to notice changes of mood, behaviour or work performance in someone who has returned from an operational tour.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/2">We emphasise the importance of families being made fully aware of the warning signs and symptoms, what they can do and who can help them, and we offer presentations and leaflets as part of this educational process.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/3">Efforts are also made to arrange a &quot;decompression period&quot; for personnel immediately prior returning from deployment. The exact form of the decompression period varies between the services and depends on the individual unit's circumstances, but in general it allows personnel mentally and physically to unwind after their operational tour and provides them the opportunity to talk to friends, colleagues and superiors about their experiences.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/4">The individual unit's chain of command uses the decompression period to monitor and identify those personnel who are apparently most vulnerable to any form of post-operational stress or stress-related condition. During this time, all personnel are offered a briefing on post-operational stress.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/5">Once back at their home base, if treatment is required for a mental health condition this is provided either as out-patient treatment in one of our 15 regional departments of community mental health (DCMHs) in the UK or satellite centres overseas, or as in-patient treatment at regional facilities run by the Priory Group. The regional locations of the DCMHs and the Priory facilities mean that treatment can be provided close to an individual's unit, base or home, thus allowing the vital support from families to continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.169.6/1">The NIO equality scheme, approved by the Equality Commission in November 2001, set out how the department proposed to fulfil the duties of Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, with regard to all of its policies and functions. In 2006, the NIO conducted a comprehensive review of the operation of the scheme during its first five years,and this report was submitted to the Equality Commission in July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.6/2">Information on consultations prior to 2001 is not available. However, as part of the equality screening and equality impact assessment processes set out in the equality scheme, the Northern Ireland Office provides an opportunity for consultation groups, stakeholders and the wider public to contribute to NIO polices and legislation including, where appropriate, written consultation exercises, focus groups and public meetings. The aim is to increase the involvement of people and groups in public consultation and to seek their views. Obtaining views from across the community in the form of public consultations is considered an important part of policy-making and development.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.6/3">Consultations are carried out in accordance with the Cabinet Office code of practice on written consultation, and the consultation period will normally last for a minimum of 12 weeks to give the public time to respond. The Northern Ireland Office consults with the list of consultees named in the Northern Ireland Equality Commission's guide to the statutory duties, and since 2001 this list has been updated annually and on request throughout the year. Further details on equality-related consultation exercises may be found in the five-year review of the NIO equality scheme on the Northern Ireland Office website at <a href="http://www.nio.gov.uk">www.nio.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.6/4">There would be disproportionate costs associated with the collation of information on responses toall consultations. However, the Northern Ireland Office website at <a href="http://www.nio.gov.uk">www.nio.gov.uk</a> provides a libraryof consultations and, where available, the summary of responses and any associated revision to the policy or legislation, although, as equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision making, it can be difficult to identify changes to a policy made as a result of consultation alone.</p>

	<p pid="b.170.2/1">Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern IrelandAct 1998 began after equality schemes were approved by the Equality Commission in 2001. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, there were15 equality-related consultations. Further details can be found in the department's statutory five-year review of its equality scheme which is publicly available on its website at <a href="http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/equality">http://www.ofmd fmni.gov.uk/index/equality</a>. For each consultation, the department consults groups and individuals who have requested that they be included on the Section 75 consultation list (this is also available on the OFMDFM website as noted above), which was established as part of the department's equality scheme for these purposes. This list is updated every year.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.2/2">In relation to whether and how groups respond to consultation, this information is not readily available in the form requested and could only be obtainedat disproportionate cost. However, the noble Lord may wish to note that for every equality-related consultation issued, officials record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses is published (usually on the department's website).</p>
	<p pid="b.170.2/3">In relation to policy changes arising from consultation, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development process, there may be no changes to the policy <I>per se</I> at a later stage.</p>

Following the initial registration, an incident will be recorded as a crime (notifiable offence) if, on the balance of probability: (a) the circumstances, as reported, amount to a crime defined by law (the police will determine this, based on their knowledge of the law and counting rules), and (b) there is no credible evidence to the contrary&quot;.</p>

Like all large organisations, Defra faces new financial pressures each year which require us constantly to review and adjust our spending plans. We conducted a rigorous review of financial allocations during the summer of 2006 which included detailed discussions with our agencies and other external bodies to agree where spending might best be reduced. This review was comprehensive in nature and has ensured that Defra's funding for the current year is placed where it can have the greatest impact. Switches of funding between budget categories result where the review identifies that priorities are best served by transferring allocation between them and estimate and budgetary rules allow.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Bach indicated in a Written Answer on<phrase class="date" code="2003-11-18">18 November 2003</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WA 280</I>), the range of vaccines used represented the &quot;worst case&quot; scenario. Environmental and other conditions to which some individuals may have been exposed during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict were not part of the vaccines interactions research programme. The possible adverse health effects of other potential exposures are either already well understood or have been the subject of other research programmes. The wider evidence currently available makes clear that the ill health reported among Gulf veterans also affects individuals who have not experienced such other exposures.</p>

This was the only safe way to travel in a dangerous environment in northern Uganda. The helicopter was hired from a commercial company in Kenya as the cheapest option available at the time and cost &pound;126,347 (funds used were from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool).

	<p pid="b.191.3/1">Like a lot of commentators on this issue, I confused the request for a stop order for specific protection purposes with a possible request to designate the area as a special area for conservation to protect the reefs and wider biodiversity. English Nature did advise that increased scalloping was having a significant impact on important reef features and it recommended the closure of 60 square miles&mdash;8 per cent&mdash;of Lyme Bay. It also provided advice that the area is the habitatof pink sea fans, ross corals and sunset corals that have been afforded protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended. However, in subsequent discussions, English Nature concentrated on the need to protect pink sea fans and the department took this on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.3/2">After due consideration of all of the evidence produced in relation to this matter, my honourable friend the Minister for Fisheries, Mr Ben Bradshaw, concluded that a zonal solution was the most appropriate in all the circumstances to date. That afforded seven times the protection for pink sea fans that had existed under the previous voluntary agreement and the areas provided protection to over 92 per cent of the known pink sea fan sites.</p>

	<p pid="b.195.5/1">The numbers of premature deaths attributed to air pollution are not routinely estimated on a weekly basis. It is not possible to identify individual patients affected by air pollution. The link between air pollution and deaths brought forward is derived from statistical correlations between daily air pollution levels and routine daily statistics on total deaths.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.5/2">Air pollution is associated with adverse health effects. An assessment carried out for the review of the air quality strategy<sup>1</sup> estimated that the level of man-made particulate air pollution experienced in the UK in 2005 would be expected to reduce average life expectancy by up to about eight months. This health impact in 2005 is estimated to cost up to &pound;9 billionto &pound;21.4 billion per annum. Road transport will contribute to these effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.5/3">Ozone and particulate matter are long-range pollutants which may travel hundreds of miles before reaching the UK. Particulate matter does have a local component, and local road transport contributes a proportion of this. For ozone, local road transport emissions actually reduce peak levels in cities due to the destruction of ozone in reaction with vehicle emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.5/4">The Department of Health's Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) quantification sub-group, in its report <I>The quantification of the effects of air pollution on health in the United Kingdom</I>, estimated in 1998<sup>2</sup> the number of deaths brought forward due to short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM10), ozone and sulphur dioxide as up to 24,000 per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.5/5">Assuming that around a quarter of the PM10<sup>3</sup> in urban areas is due directly or indirectly to emissions from transport, as a rough estimate it can be assumed that up to around 2,000 deaths brought forward in urban areas may have been related to emissions from transport at that time.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.5/6">This estimate does not include the impact of transport emissions on life expectancy and on cardiovascular admissions. These were not quantified by COMEAP at the time of the 1998 report. Further work on this issue is likely to be considered as part of the work of the COMEAP sub-group on quantification.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.5/7">Estimates are made for intense pollutionepisodes. For example, an estimate was made for the summer smog episode in August 2003<sup>4</sup>. Some 220 to 570 deaths were estimated to have been brought forward over the two-week period due to ozone and a further 202 due to particulate matter (PM10). A report and estimate is also being produced on the summer smog episodes during the June and July 2006 heatwave. This will be available in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.197.8/1">Under the Mental Health Act 1983 the courts have powers to assess mentally disordered offenders before sentencing and to divert them to receive specialist treatment in hospital rather than punishment. In 2004, 1,195 convicted offenders were diverted from prison to hospital by this route. In addition, in 2005-06 the Secretary of State directed the transfer of 427 sentenced prisoners and 495 remand prisoners to hospital for mental health treatment. The process of transferring prisoners to hospital has been reviewed and new instructions issued this year to maximise co-operation between HM Prison Service and the mental health services.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.3/1">Local authorities have statutory responsibility for leading the process of improvement at schools in special measures or other Ofsted categories of concern.

Programmes of training, guidance and teaching support are available through the national strategies where the underlying problems identified concern the quality of teaching in the core subjects. Where weak leadership of the school is a key issue, support may be offered from one of the national leaders of education&mdash;head teachers at strong schools selected and accredited by the National College for School Leadership for deployment by the relevant local authority to support the turn around of the school in special measures. Tailored packages of support with additional financial resources can be offered by the department to particular schools where the local authority is unable to meet the immediate needs. In cases where the replacement of the school is necessary, the new Schools Commissioner may be involved to broker a new academy or a trust.</p>
