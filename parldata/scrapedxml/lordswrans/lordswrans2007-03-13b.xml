	<p pid="b.101.47/1">My officials sent all English planning authorities a copy of the Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-08">8 June 2006</phrase> on planning policy statement 22 (PPS22), which encouraged them to take account fully of the positive approach to renewables that it sets out. In doing so they emphasised that the Government expected authorities that had not yet taken steps to include such policies in their plans to do so at the next available opportunity. Government Offices are active in their regions in encouraging regional planning bodies and planning authorities to bring forward regional spatial strategies and local development documents in line with national policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.47/2">All inspectors who will examine development plan documents have had the Statement drawn to their attention and been made aware of the importance placed by government on the use of renewable energy. An inspector will check that the planning authority has prepared a development plan document legally and test whether it is sound. In doing so, the inspector will consider whether the document is consistent with national planning policy. After the examination, the inspector will produce a report, with recommendations that will be binding on the authority. Where necessary, the report will set out precise recommendations on how the document must be changed.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.47/3">We have recently consulted on a draft planning policy statement (PPS), <I>Planning and Climate Change</I>, which sets out our proposals on how planning should contribute to reducing emissions and stabilising climate change. Planning is expected to make a full contribution to delivering the Government's Climate Change Programme and energy policies. That includes giving greater emphasis to local renewable sources for supplying the energy needs of new developments. At the local level, development plan documents are expected to set policies on the provision of low-carbon and renewable sources of energy to provide the platform necessary for securing and complementing the increasingly high levels of energy and carbon performance required by building regulations. This provision is expected to be &quot;significant&quot; to reflect the full potential of local opportunities consistent with securing the new development needed in communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.71/1">I am pleased to announce that the multi-professional education and training budgets will be issued shortly to strategic health authorities (SHAs) and represent a 3.6 per cent increase on 2006-07 allocations. The year 2006-07 was exceptional and we had to give SHAs the maximum flexibility to manage their financial position to address the deficits in their area. SHAs are aware of the need to secure the future workforce of the National Health Service and to invest in education and training. This will be reinforced by a service-level agreement setting out the key priorities for them to address.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.74/1">The eligible rents for housing benefit (HB) have not been reduced by 14.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.74/2">The HB subsidy for temporary accommodation has more than doubled between 2002-03 and 2005-06, with approximately 80 per cent of the increase occurring in London authorities. Such an increase in expenditure is unsustainable and therefore the subsidy thresholds and caps have been reduced by 5 per cent for London authorities from April 2007. Outside London the subsidy thresholds and caps have been frozen.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.74/3">We are confident that local authorities in London will be able to continue to secure good-quality leased temporary accommodation and meet all their reasonable costs within the limits of the subsidy system.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.74/4">Local authorities in London will be able to claim full subsidy on rents up to at least &pound;337.55 per week when they house a homeless person in short-term leased accommodation, and 15 authorities in London will be able to claim more than that.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.74/5">The Government are also keen to ensure that local authorities provide a settled housing solution for households placed into temporary accommodation as soon as they are realistically able to do so.</p>

Invariably such testing identifies a range of issues that require subsequent rectification and/or risk acceptance. Specific details are classified; however, as a measure of the results, all systems tested last year retained their security-accredited status.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.110/1">Discussions on reducing packaging waste are being led by my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with the support of the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) through the medium of the Courtauld commitment. The commitment, which now has as signatories 13 major retailers, responsible for 92 per cent of the grocery market in the UK, together with eight of the largest suppliers to the grocery sector, has the objective of stopping the growth of packaging waste by 2008 and securing an absolute reduction by 2010. WRAP is also working closely with industry players across the supply chain on initiatives to reduce the volume of packaging, including looking at the design and light-weighting of packaging, and to increase the recyclable content of packaging material. With these developments in mind, it is my view that there is no need for a specific national conference at the moment.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.113/1">The same criteria are used to determine the healthcare funding allocation for all prison establishments in England, including operational capacity and prison type. Funds are allocated as a global sum to the local primary care trust (PCT) and it is the responsibility of a prison's partnership board to ensure that its healthcare provision is of an equivalent quality and range to that which the public receives from the National Health Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.113/2">The healthcare allocation for HMP Grendon in 2006-07 was &pound;770,000, including mental health in-reach funding. That represents an increase of 25 per cent on the 2003-04 figure of &pound;615,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.113/3">The PCT has confirmed that no payments have been suspended. HMP Grendon runs a unique regime, with therapeutic personnel employed as part of a specialised custodial service funded by the Prison Service. During 2006, the PCT has worked with the prison to draw up a service specification and tender for supplementary mental health in-reach services. Funding to provide this service has been estimated at &pound;150,000 to &pound;200,000 per annum and is being considered as part of the local delivery plan process.</p>
