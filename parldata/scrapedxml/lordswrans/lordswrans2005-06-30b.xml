	<p pid="b.36.8/1">Section 10 of the FoI Act requires public authorities to respond to requests for information promptly, and in any event no later than the 20th working day following receipt of the request. This timescale can be extended if the public authority requires additional time in order to determine whether the balance of the public interest requires disclosure of information that falls within a qualified exemption. The deadline for response is such time as is reasonable in the circumstances. In some circumstances, the requirement to respond &quot;promptly&quot; may oblige a public authority to respond to a request before the end of the 20th working day following receipt.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.8/2">The enforcement process established by the FoI Act applies not only to decisions that are taken on disclosure, but also to compliance with the procedural requirements in the Act. This includes compliance with the time limits for response. If applicant complains about the handling of a request, public authorities' own internal complaints procedures will need to consider whether the request was processed within the time limits prescribed in the FoI Act. The Information Commissioner and the Information Tribunal will also be able to consider the timeliness of responses in determining whether public authorities have acted lawfully and in accordance with their obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Questions of whether a public authority has responded &quot;promptly&quot; will be dealt with within this enforcement process.</p>

Developed countries have already committed within the WTO to agree an end date for phasing out agricultural export subsidies.</p>

	<p pid="b.40.0/1">The Identity Cards Bill Regulatory Impact Assessment (<phrase class="date" code="2005-05-25">25 May 2005</phrase>) gave a current best estimate of &pound;93 for the unit cost of an adult passport/ID card package for UK citizens valid for 10 years. This figure reflects the greater robustness of the cost estimates in relation to the identity card scheme, following on from a more detailed specification of the requirements of the scheme both in terms of enrolment and verification services. The analysis was also able to make allowance for non-recoverable VAT, inflation, optimism bias and contingency. In addition, the estimates were based on a better understanding of the cost of improving the security of passports, which is a key building block of the scheme. After November 2004, the Government had decided to deliver the scheme by creating a new agency to issue ID cards and provide verification services which incorporates the UK Passport Service. Other estimates were the best available figures at the time, but did not benefit from the same degree of consultation and discussions with stakeholders and potential suppliers as the unit cost figure above. The earliest estimates were also not informed by decisions on how the scheme would be administered, which made, for example, overhead costs difficult to estimate. The Identity Cards Regulatory Impact Assessment 2004 gave, what was then, a best estimate of &pound;85 for the indicative cost for a combined ID card and passport package, which was linked to a unit cost of &pound;88. This followed consultation with the wider public and interested groups, particularly the Home Affairs Select Committee, which identified additional facilities which will be needed to increase public confidence in the scheme. The Home Office publication, <i>Identity Cards: The Next Steps</i> (CM 6020), from November 2003, gave an estimated cost for a passport and ID card of &pound;77, with a plain card costing &pound;35.</p>

	<p pid="b.48.2/1">The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 sets out the system of protection for buildings and areas of special architectural or historic interest. The listing of buildings is the responsibility of DCMS and English Heritage, while the development control system that protects them is the responsibility of ODPM. In addition, local authorities are open to create &quot;local lists&quot; which include buildings of special local interest, although these do not have the same statutory protection that listing provides.

	<p pid="b.49.3/1">In general, works that amount to &quot;development&quot; in planning law require a planning application to be made to the relevant local authority.

	<p pid="b.49.3/2">As a general rule, those in houses can install solar panels and photovoltaic cells without needing to make a planning application, provided the panels do not project significantly above the plane of the roof. Similarly, whether household wind turbines require planning permission would depend on the type of development that would be required, for example, whether the highest part of the roof was exceeded or whether the shape of any roof slope fronting a highway was altered to a material extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/3">If these works were deemed to be permitted development they would not require planning permission in a conservation area unless the local planning authority had made a direction under Article 4 of the GPDO to remove permitted development rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/4">Where a planning application is required, Planning Policy Statement 22, Renewable Energy (PPS22) will apply. While PPS22 does not contain an explicit presumption in favour of renewable energy developments, it recognises that small-scale renewable energy schemes including solar panels, small-scale wind turbines and photovoltaic cells can be incorporated into both new developments and some existing buildings. It says that local planning authorities should specifically encourage such schemes through positively expressed policies in local development documents.</p>
