	<p pid="a.32.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-15">15 July 2003</phrase> the Government published in full the independent report of Mr Justice Butterfield into the current practices and procedures relating to disclosure, associated investigation techniques and case management in HM Customs and Excise's criminal cases. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I had asked Mr Justice Butterfield to examine the circumstances that led to the termination of the London City Bond prosecutions in Liverpool Crown Court on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November 2002</phrase>, the changes in practice within Customs since the time of the cases to which those prosecutions related, and Customs' compliance with best practice in the use of investigation techniques. Mr Justice Butterfield also examined the preparation for and presentation of cases for court on behalf of customs.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/2">On publication of the report, as I said in my answer to Lord Barnett on <phrase class="date" code="">15 July</phrase> [Official Report, col. WA 96&ndash;99], the Government accepted in full a number of Mr Justice Butterfield's recommendations, many of which have now been implemented. On the recommendation that, in order to make its independence from Customs even more transparent, the Customs and Excise Prosecution Office (CEPO) should become an entirely separate prosecuting authority accountable to me as Attorney-General, the Government undertook to provide a response in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/3">In his report, Mr Justice Butterfield acknowledged the revitalisation of CEPO following the injection of additional resources and the improvement in the engagement with investigators. He referred to a palpable and detectable improvement in morale in CEPO. He went on to recommend that the solicitor for Customs and Excise should relinquish responsibility for prosecutions resulting from Customs investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/4">The Government agree that, to be most effective, these prosecutors must be independent, and be seen to be independent by judges, barristers and solicitors in the wider criminal justice system. The Government consider it is essential that there should be full confidence in prosecutors acting on behalf of Customs and accept the case for radical change.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/5">The Government accordingly accept the recommendation of Mr Justice Butterfield to separate the prosecution and investigation functions in Customs, and to create an independent Customs and Excise Prosecutions Office during the course of 2004, led by a director accountable directly to me as Attorney-General. The office will be subject to a regular, independent and thorough inspection regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/6">The Government intend to move to appoint a director as soon as practicable, who will be closely involved in the creation of an independent CEPO.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/7">The Government also accept the recommendation that investigation legal advisers should now move to become the responsibility of HM Commissioners of Customs and Excise, and that these advisers will not be involved in the prosecution process. This arrangement will be reviewed after two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/8">The creation of an independent CEPO will require the resolution of a number of practical issues, to which the Economic Secretary and I are giving careful consideration.</p>

Special arrangements are available under the national curriculum and from awarding bodies to allow children with SEN to take examinations and tests on an equal footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.5/3">There are no qualifications or records of achievement that are specific to children and young people with autism. However, there is a range of arrangements for assessing the progress and recording the achievements of children with special educational needs, including those with autism, for whom the usual assessment arrangements and public examinations are not suitable. The department, with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, has published guidance to help schools, including special schools, to set targets for children with SEN who are performing below national curriculum level 1 or within levels 1 and 2 in English, mathematics and science. The guidance contains performance criteria, the 'P' scales, which can be used to assess pupils' progress. Award schemes are available through which the key life skills of young people with SEN can be recognised and &quot;progress files&quot; can be used to record their academic and non-academic achievements. The working group on our 14 to 19 reforms, under the chairmanship of Mike Tomlinson, will be looking at assessment arrangements and how they can be used to motivate all learners.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.5/4">A primary aim of SEN support is to enable young people with SEN to make successful transitions from school to further education, training and adult life. The SEN Code of Practice, effective from January 2002, contains strengthened transition planning arrangements involving the Connexions service. In addition, under the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the Connexions service, on behalf of the Secretary of State, must carry out assessments of all young people with statements of SEN who are in the last year of compulsory schooling and are intending to go on to further education or training or higher education and may carry out assessments in other circumstances. The assessments are of the young person's education and training needs and the provision required to meet those needs. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) must have regard to these assessments when arranging a young person's provision and the Connexions service is expected to work with the LSC and other providers to make suitable learning opportunities available to young people with SEN. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, further and higher education and training providers must make reasonable adjustments to prevent discrimination against disabled students and potential students and, since September 2003, provide auxiliary aids and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.5/5">The Government will shortly be publishing its SEN strategy. The strategy will contain practical measures to support local education authorities and schools, working in partnership with others, in improving provision for all children and young people with special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.2/1">There is no statutory requirement for airlines to inform passengers of the restrictions on imports of meat and other animal products.

Defra and HM Customs are working in co-operation with airlines, and an increasing number are making announcements or showing our information video in-flight.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.</p>
