	<p pid="a.18.0/1">I very much regret that incorrect figures were inadvertently included in my previous Answers to the noble Lord (HL5721) and to Lord Carter (HL5237 and HL5238) on this subject. The formulae used for converting the rate of duty for road fuel gases from kilogrammes to an equivalent rate per litre were calculated wrongly.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/2">The current duty rate for gas used as road fuel, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid natural gas (LNG), is 9p per kilogramme. The petrol equivalent measured in pence per litre for these gas fuels is listed below.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.18.0/5"> <td>Type of fuel</td> <td>Duty rate (pence per KG)</td> <td>Duty rate for gas calculated on equivalent basis to petrol (pence per litre)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.18.0/6"> <td>CNG</td> <td>9</td> <td>6.1</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.18.0/7"> <td>LPG</td> <td>9</td> <td>5.4</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.18.0/8"> <td>LNG</td> <td>9</td> <td>6.1</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.18.0/11">The figures showing the duty in pence per litre are calculated by comparing the units of energy of each gas and its petrol equivalent. This calculation takes into account the energy value and engine efficiency of the different fuels and therefore gives the most accurate comparison between one fuel and another.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/12">The rate of duty for biodiesel is 25.82p per litre and for bioethanol it is 45.82p per litre.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.2/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/2" qnum="HL6255">What action is being taken to tackle cross-Channel smuggling.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-10-29a.18.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100399" speakername="Lord McIntosh of Haringey" colon=":" colnum="18"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo021029/text/21029w01.htm#21029w01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.18.3/1">Tobacco smuggling grew very rapidly in the late 1990s until by 2000&ndash;01 over 20 per cent of the cigarette market was illicit. The cost of that tobacco smuggling to UK taxpayers was &pound;3.5 billion. A further 6 per cent of the market was legally non-tax paid product bought abroad and brought back for own use.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/2">The great majority of cigarette smuggling is undertaken by serious and organised criminals who conceal large volumes of cigarettes in excess of one million at a time in freight consignments. In 2000, a smaller proportion was smuggled by cross-Channel passengers. However in that year the total cost of such passenger excise smuggling was still &pound;1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/3">Had no action been taken over the last two years Customs and Excise estimates that the illicit share of the cigarette market would have reached 31 per cent by the end of March 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/4">Since the launch of the Tackling Tobacco Strategy in March 2000 Customs and Excise has been successful in containing growth in the illicit cigarette market, has disrupted over 100 organised crime gangs responsible for the vast majority of the smuggling and has had dramatic success in cutting losses from cross-Channel passenger smuggling by almost three-quarters. Figures for 2001&ndash;02, the second year of this strategy, will be published at the time of the Pre-Budget Report and we anticipate they will show that the strategy remains on track. In the same period consumer expenditure on legitimate cross-border shopping for alcohol and tobacco has grown by 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/5">In 2000&ndash;01 Customs seized 2.8 billion cigarettes. Of these 0.9 billion were seized overseas through the work of Customs overseas' liaison officer network, a further 1.2 billion were seized in freight consignments, 400 million were seized inland and 55 million were seized at the ports from cross-Channel passenger smugglers.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/6">The sole focus of Customs excise enforcement activity in respect of cross-Channel passenger traffic is to tackle those who smuggle tobacco or alcohol having received or intending to receive money or money's worth for those goods. The Government have consistently made clear that people are entitled to bring into the UK without liability to tax as much EU tax-paid tobacco or alcohol as they wish for their own use. Customs literature also makes this clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/7">Just one-tenth of 1 per cent of those who have crossed the Channel in the past two years have had tobacco or alcohol seized by Customs. Since the start of the strategy, the average quantity seized by Customs from cross-Channel passenger smugglers was approximately 4,900 cigarettes and 15 kilos of hand rolling tobacco (equivalent to at least 18,000 cigarettes).</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/8">Of the 0.1 per cent of cross-Channel passengers who had tobacco or alcohol seized in the years 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02, over 75 per cent chose not to make any sort of appeal against that seizure. Of those that did appeal, magistrates' courts overwhelmingly backed the judgments made by Customs and found against Customs in less than 0.1 per cent of cases, and only 1 per cent of cases were either overturned or restored by a Customs review officer or by an independent tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/9">Building on the success of the Budget 2000 anti-smuggling measures, we are today announcing the next stage of the tackling tobacco strategy. Despite cross-Channel tobacco smuggling having been cut by around three-quarters in the past two years, smugglers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their attempts to blend in with honest shoppers. So the measures we are announcing today will help make the distinction between smugglers and honest shoppers even clearer. The measures make clear that Customs activity is legal and fair but tough upon those who attempt to smuggle. It comprises the following components.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/10" class="indent">Regulations will be laid before Parliament today to abolish the 1992 Personal Reliefs Order and replace it with new provisions that effectively define shopping and smuggling, specify the factors Customs will take into account in distinguishing one from the other and place the onus for that decision upon Customs; reaffirm that all Customs stops are lawful and those for excise-specific purposes based on reasonable grounds for suspicion; and increase the indicative levels for tobacco from 800 to 3,200 cigarettes and from 1kg to 3kgs of hand rolling tobacco, representing around six months' supply for an average smoker. Those bringing back larger quantities of tobacco must expect, if asked, to explain how it is that such goods are for their own use. Customs will continue to seize quantities below these levels as well as above them where they are satisfied that those goods are intended for resale or other exchange for money or money's worth.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/11" class="indent">In addition, the announcements the Government are making today will confirm that vehicles used to smuggle tobacco or alcohol will continue to be liable to seizure, but for small first offences Customs will offer restoration of the vehicle for the value of the attempted revenue evasion. Those who use vehicles to smuggle on a large scale or a repeat basis will not be offered such an opportunity and must expect to lose their vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/12" class="indent">A new clearer guide to appealing/complaining is being published by Customs today and will be given to all those who have goods seized or wish to complain about Customs behaviour towards them.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/13" class="indent">Customs is to undertake, in conjunction with the Lord Chancellor's Department, a review of the present appeals structure and to present proposals for streamlining and simplifying these arrangements by the end of January 2003. The terms of reference will be available today in the Library of the House and on the Customs website (<a href="http://www.hmce.gov.uk">www.hmce.gov.uk</a>), together with details for submitting contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/14" class="indent">Having brought cross-Channel passenger smuggling under control, the Government are determined that it should remain so. To this end Customs expects to conduct an increased number of prosecutions against large-scale and serial cross-Channel passenger smugglers.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/15" class="indent">Violence against Customs officers in the course of carrying out their duties will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Customs will toughen its policy and prosecute anyone who perpetrates serious assaults on staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/16">This set of measures provides the public with a clear guide to their right to shop for alcohol or tobacco for their own use within the EU and to the consequences for those who attempt to evade tax in bringing in such goods, having received or intending to receive money or money's worth for some or all of them. It will also enable Customs to continue to prevent the smuggling of tobacco or alcohol and the disorder which accompanies such smuggling from ruining the enjoyment of honest cross-border shoppers. It will also enable Customs to prevent the smugglers from undermining the UK economy in alcohol or tobacco products and from depriving our public services of essential tax revenues. Customs will act fairly and in accordance with the law but it will also act firmly and with the full weight of sanctions against those who break the law.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.3/1">The Government are keen to encourage waste minimisation and to maximise recycling. We have a voluntary agreement with the Newspaper Publishers' Association which sets targets for the recycled content of its newspapers. It exceeded the target of 60 per cent by the end of 2001, and is on track to meet the future targets of 65 per cent by the end of 2003 and 70 per cent by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/2">Like any industry, the newspaper industry has to pay for the proper treatment and disposal of the wastes it produces. Whether this involves recovery of materials or disposal through landfill, the operator of the waste treatment facility would be entitled to charge for the service. As such charges generally relate to the tonnage of waste produced, they also relate to the size of the newspaper printer's operation. The Climate Change Levy provides businesses a further incentive to improve energy efficiency and reduce impacts on the environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">The Government are fully committed to providing good quality English language provision for adults who do not speak English as a first language. Neither the Department for Education and Skills nor the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) holds information on waiting lists of ESOL provision across England. Some areas have higher demand for ESOL provision than others, and the LSC will ensure that where colleges can identify a need to expand their ESOL provision, sufficient funding will be available to them. In addition, the LSC has commissioned research into any unmet demand for ESOL. This includes a survey of providers to establish whether any individuals are on waiting lists for ESOL courses and whether there are constraints on growth to meet demand. The department has recently established ESOL pathfinders, including one in Burnley and Pendle, where Nelson and Colne College is a main partner, to test the new ESOL teaching and learning infrastructure and how we can improve and widen access to ESOL learning.</p>

This ensures that pupils have the opportunity to learn English in a meaningful subject-specific context. My department's role is to ensure that the particular needs of bilingual learners are properly taken into account in all policies and programmes aimed at raising standards.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-10-29a.28.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100395" speakername="Lord Macdonald of Tradeston" colon=":" colnum="28"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo021029/text/21029w03.htm#21029w03_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.28.0/1">Under the terms of existing legislation, there are no powers under which the Government can require marine lessees and operators regularly to remove flotsam and jetsam from within their areas of responsibility of ownership. There is no general legal requirement on operators to clear litter from marina waters. The responsibilities of any lessee will depend on the terms of the lease. However, there are powers which do apply in specific circumstances, and they can also differ depending whether the origin of the material is from a land source or from ships.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/2">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will shortly be publishing a consultation paper that includes 27 recommendations for improving the quality of public space. One of these recommendations is to examine the &quot;legislative controls to address litter in areas not covered by Part IV of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (in particular, on beaches, rivers and canals)&quot;. Although flotsam and jetsam is not strictly litter, it may be considered by certain groups to be an unsightly nuisance and something that authorities should have a duty to clear. This factor will be considered as part of the Defra-led consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/3">Sections 79 and 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 require a local authority to investigate any complaint of a statutory nuisance made to it by a person living within its area. If satisfied of the existence of the nuisance, it must serve a notice requiring the person responsible (meaning the person to whose act, default or sufferance the nuisance is attributable or, where that person cannot be found, the owner or occupier of the premises) to abate any nuisance. The matters which may constitute a statutory nuisance for these purposes include any premises in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance; and any accumulation or deposit which is prejudicial to health or a nuisance. For the purposes of statutory nuisance, the local authority area includes the territorial sea lying seawards from the shore. The word premises includes land and any vessel, the occupier of the latter being the master of the vessel. Accordingly, it is possible that a local authority would be able to take action to require the private owner of a beach to remove jetsam if it were such as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance. The situation with flotsam might be more difficult, although at private moorings or within a harbour it might be practicable for the local authority to identify the person responsible or an owner or occupier and serve notice if they considered that a statutory nuisance existed.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/4">There are also provisions in place which apply when any vessel is sunk, stranded or abandoned in, or in or near any approach to, any harbour or tidal water under the control of a harbour authority or conservancy authority in such a manner as, in the opinion of the authority, to be, or be likely to become, an obstruction or danger to navigation or to lifeboats. In these circumstances, Section 252 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 gives power to harbour and conservancy authorities to take possession of, and raise, remove or destroy the whole of or any part of a vessel. The same power also applies to every article, thing or collection of things being or forming part of the equipment, cargo, stores or ballast of the vessel.</p>

This means that performance in terms of a reduction in those killed and seriously injured (KSI) will vary in each case.
