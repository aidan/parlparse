	<p pid="a.59.1/2" qnum="HL4483">Further to the Answer by Lord Rooker to the Oral Question of Lord Livsey of Talgarth on 26 June that the United Kingdom has adopted a voluntary scheme of vaccination control for bluetongue, whether they expect to benefit from co-financing from the European Union for this programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">Under European Union (EU) law, the European Commission has a limited role in approving the eligibility of national plans for EU co-funding. Eligibility depends on an extensive audit trail and a high level of veterinary supervision. Having fully considered those options for England and Wales, we concluded they would both hinder rapid rollout of vaccination and add unnecessarily to farmers' costs, thus reducing take-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">The Commission has indicated that a compulsory scheme administered by official vets is likely to be the only type of scheme eligible for co-funding. This type of scheme would substantially slow down delivery, and would, based on certain assumptions, cost over twice as much overall as voluntary vaccination, thus significantly outweighing the potential financial benefit of any co-funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">Although the plan for England and Wales will not receive EU co-funding, the European Commission has expressed confidence that it is capable of achieving its objectives of minimising the impact of bluetongue and reducing the risk of disease spread.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/4">Scotland and Northern Ireland have submitted annexes to the UK plan to the European Commission to seek potential co-funding. The Scottish Executive expect to undertake a compulsory vaccination campaign during winter 2008.</p>

English Partnerships, the national regeneration agency, is working alongside 14 local authorities to develop the LHC model. The LHC model may involve local authorities investing land suitable for housing which is in their ownership into the LHC and deferring some or all of their land receipt until such time as the LHC generates returns.</p>

So that the Government meets their objectives, English Partnerships is working in collaboration with public sector landowners to accelerate the process of bringing land forward for housing development while ensuring minimum standards are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.6/2">English Partnerships standards include a 50 per cent minimum target for developing affordable homes on surplus public sector sites. This target will help maintain the pace of housing delivery. On sites where it is not possible to deliver 50 per cent affordable homes, English Partnerships will seek to maximise the potential for these sites to deliver affordable housing in accordance with local need.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.3/1">The information requested is published in the annual volume <I>Offender Management Caseload Statistics</I> and monthly <I>Population in Custody</I>, copies of which are available via the Library of the House and from the Ministry of Justice website at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/statistics.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/statistics.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/2">At the end of June 1997, the total prison population in England and Wales, including in police cells, was 61,467, and at the end of June 2007 the corresponding figure was 80,205, an increase of 18,738.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/3">These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems, which, as with any large-scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/4">An account of the drivers of the prison population can be found in the report by Lord Carter of Coles, <I>Securing the future: Proposals for the efficient and sustainable use of custody in England and Wales</I>, published in December 2007, a copy of which is available from the Library of the House and from the department's website at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/securing-the-future.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/securing-the-future.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/5">Lord Carter's report commented that:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/6" class="indent">&quot;The increased prison population of the past decade is a result of a concerted and successful effort to catch, convict and detain for longer periods the most dangerous and serious offenders ... There are a number of factors behind the increase in the prison population in England and Wales since 1995. They include both legislative and non-legislative elements which, in some cases, overlap with each other. The drivers include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/7" class="indent">changes in public attitudes and the political climate;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/8" class="indent">changes to legislation and the sentencing framework;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/9" class="indent">more offenders brought to justice, increased custody rates and longer sentence lengths;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/10" class="indent">greater focus on enforcement of sentences; and</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/11" class="indent">greater awareness of risk, and greater political prominence of public protection&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/12">The key recommendations of this report are:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/13">a significant expansion of the current prison-building programme should begin immediately so that up to 6,500 additional new places, on top of the significant expansion already planned, can be provided by the end of 2012;larger, state-of-the-art prisons should be planned and developed now so that from 2012 there can be approximately 5,000 new places that will allow for a programme of closures of old, inefficient and ineffective prisons offering better value for money and much improved chances of reducing re-offending and crime;a structured sentencing framework and permanent sentencing commission should be developed, with judicial leadership, to improve the transparency, predictability and consistency of sentencing and the criminal justice system; andthere are grounds for a more efficient approach to the way operations and headquarters' overheads are structured and managed.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/14">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase> (col. 1703) I repeated a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice on the report on the prisons review carried out by Lord Carter.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/15">Further information can be found in the department's analysis, <I>Story of the Prison Population: 1997-2007</I>, a copy of which can be found in the House of Commons Library (Reference: Dep 2008-0362).
