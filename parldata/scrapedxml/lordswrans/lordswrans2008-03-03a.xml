	<p pid="a.142.0/1">The central-local concordat, agreed between the Government and the Local Government Association (LGA), on behalf of local authorities in England, was signed in December last year. It commits both parties to a framework of principles to secure a new relationship between central government and local government. The operation of this agreement will be monitored on a continuing basis, through renewed central-local partnership arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/2">The noble Lord may be aware that CLG are currently consulting on guidance to local authorities and their partners (including the Environment Agency and NE) on creating strong safe and prosperous communities, specifically relating to new legislation introduced in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. The guidance covers local strategic partnerships, sustainable community strategies, the new duty to involve, local area agreements, the revised best value regime and commissioning. The Environment Agency is one of about 20 &quot;named partners&quot; given a new duty under this Act to co-operate with local authorities in identifying the right mix of targets for a draft LAA (based on the agreed evidence-base and longer term priorities in the Sustainable Community Strategy), and helping to deliver those targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.6/1">The data are not available in the format requested. In relation to the number charged or reported for prosecution, prior to the introduction of the Causeway programme in June 2005, this information was collated only once the police had prosecuted in court. Figures for 1998 to 2005 therefore relate to the number of persons aged 10 to 17 years who were prosecuted in court. After June 2005, this information was recorded once the police recommended prosecution, which was taken forward by the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland and therefore figures for 2006 and 2007 relate to the number of charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.6/2">Table 1 gives the number of persons aged 10 to 17 years who were prosecuted or charged for offences, and the number subsequently convicted for criminal offences, while table 2 provides information on the disposals given to those convicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.6/3">Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) weeding policy meant that caution records, for certain offences, after appropriate periods of time were &quot;weeded out&quot; in compliance with data protection and rehabilitation of offenders legislation. Since Bichard (2006), PSNI has stopped weeding. Data are therefore not available for the years 1998 to 2005; in 2006 there were 2,529 cautions and in 2007 there were 1,707 cautions.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.6/4">A violent crime is defined as one which relates to sexual, violence against the person and robbery offences. Table 3 shows the total number of persons aged 10 to 17 years prosecuted and convicted for violent offences broken down by type of offence, while tables 4 to 7 provide information on disposals given to those convicted for these offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.6/5">Tables 8 and 10 provide information on the number of persons aged 10 to 17 years who were prosecuted and convicted for other non-violent offences broken down by indictable and non-indictable offences, while Tables 9 and 11 provide information on the disposals given to those convicted for these categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.6/6">Data in table 1 cover the calendar years 1998 to 2007 (the latest available year for which charges are available) while data in tables 2 to 11 cover the calendar years 1998 to 2006 (the latest available year for which convictions are available). Data are collated on the principal offence rule, so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.2/17" class="indent">1 Total international migration (TIM) is the most comprehensive and only official estimate of long-term civilian migration covering both flows to and from the UK. The Office for National Statistics uses the UN recommended definition of an international migrant (someone who changes their country of usual residence for at least a year, so that the country of destination effectively becomes the country of usual residence). TIM is based mainly on data from the international passenger survey (IPS). It includes adjustments for (1) those whose intended length of stay changes so that their migrant status changes; (2) asylum seekers and their dependants not identified by the IPS; and (3) flows between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

The views of the public will also be taken into account and the Government have published a public consultation on who should be a relevant third party to forced marriage proceedings. The draft rules of court have also been published for consultation.

	<p pid="a.154.3/1">The Government have not received any representations. Sharia law has no jurisdiction in England and Wales. There are, however, a number of Sharia councils in England and Wales which, on a private basis where the parties consent, deal with the mediation and resolution of personal and contractual disputes. These councils are not part of the court system. In all cases, parties will always have recourse to the national courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.3/2">The Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002, which amended the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, allows a court to refuse a decree absolute until a religious divorce is granted. It applies to members of the Jewish faith or to any other prescribed religious group, including Islam. The option does, however, depend on the religious community itself deciding to make use of the provisions of the Act and then asking the Lord Chancellor to prescribe the religious group for that purpose. No application has been received from any Islamic group requesting such recognition.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.6/1">The term &quot;senior public post&quot; is being interpreted in this instance as a reference to public appointments. With one exception, all first appointments to NIO public bodies in 2007 were filled by open competition. In line with legislation, 10 members of the Northern Ireland Policing Board were appointed following their nomination by the main Northern Ireland political parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/2">The NIO also made appointments to three non-statutory ad hoc advisory bodies in 2007: the Northern Ireland Bill of Rights Forum, the Strategic Review of Parading and the Consultative Group on the Past. Given the need to establish these bodies without undue delay and considering their ad hoc nature and short duration, it was not considered proportionate to embark on public appointment processes. These non-statutory bodies fall under the Cabinet Office classification of short-term task force, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews.</p>

This is subject to the researcher obtaining appropriate legal and ethical permissions. ONS does not produce statistics for this purpose.

	<p pid="a.163.5/1">The term &quot;historic ethnic minority&quot; is not defined in statute in the UK; however the Government recognise the importance of Ulster-Scots culture in Northern Ireland, as reflected in commitments made in the 1998 Belfast agreement and the 2006 St Andrews agreement. Cultural matters are now the responsibility of the devolved administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.5/2">The rights in the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated in domestic law in the Human Rights Act 1998, apply to everyone within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, irrespective of ethnic identity. Part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages applies to Ulster-Scots.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.5/1">A number of scientific studies, together with the regulatory impact assessment supporting the consultation on proposals to revise nitrate vulnerable zones regulations, estimated that agriculture contributes approximately 61 per cent of the nitrogen entering surface waters in England. Discharges from sewage treatment-works account for up to 30 per cent. The remainder comes from a variety of sources, including road transport. According to the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, road transport accounted for about 34 per cent of total nitrogen oxide emissions to air in 2005. Data are not available on the amount of nitrogen entering surface waters through aerial deposition.</p>
