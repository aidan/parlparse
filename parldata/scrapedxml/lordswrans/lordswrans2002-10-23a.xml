	<p pid="a.101.2/1">To the best of our knowledge, five Zimbabweans on the EU travel ban list have travelled to the EU since the targeted sanctions were imposed on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-18">18 February 2002</phrase>. Robert Mugabe, Stan Mudenge and Joseph Made visited Rome to attend World Food Summit meetings between 10 and <phrase class="date" code="">13 June</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.101.2/2">The EU's Common Position 2002/145/CFSP imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe specifically allows member states to grant exemptions where travel is justified on grounds of attending meetings of international bodies. In all these cases, the EU country in question had a legal obligation to grant visas. In doing so, they attached maximum restrictions, ensuring that the visas were for a limited time and restricted to the host country of the meeting concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.5/1">The Organization of American States (OAS) concluded its two-year process to help the governments of Guatemala and Belize settle their territorial dispute on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase>. Detailed proposals drawn up by independent facilitators appointed by both governments were presented to the governments on <phrase class="date" code="">16 September</phrase> and provide the basis for a fair and honourable settlement to this long-standing dispute. We hope both governments will now seize this historic opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/2">The facilitators have recommended some adjustment to the land border and proposed new maritime limits giving Guatemala an economic exclusion zone and continental shelf in the Gulf of Honduras of some 2,000 square nautical miles. The governments of Belize and Honduras have each agreed to contribute 1,000 square nautical miles to this zone.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/3">The facilitators have also recommended the establishment of a tri-national ecological park covering coastal, insular and maritime areas of Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and a substantial development trust fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/4">Details can be found on the Belize Government's website <a href="http://www.belize.gov">www.belize.gov</a>.bz/.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/5">At a ceremony in Washington on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> marking the end of the facilitation process, Dr MacShane spoke of the UK's full support for the OAS process. He welcomed the proposals highlighting the potential for investment and economic growth that will result if the referendums that are now due to be held simultaneously in both countries are successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/6">Her Majesty's Government believe that the facilitators have worked patiently and meticulously to produce proposals that are fair and honourable to the governments of Guatemala and Belize. They represent the best chance yet of settling the dispute. Settlement would also have a global significance, demonstrating that with good will and determination even the most intractable problems can be resolved by negotiation. A settlement would open a new chapter of peace and harmony between the two countries and reduce the risk of potential conflict along the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/7">We urge the governments and civil society of both countries to enter into constructive debate on what a settlement would mean to their populace before putting the proposals to referendums.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">The Government have considered very carefully the arguments put forward for the early implementation of this section, which makes it an offence for a person to destroy or alter a record requested under either the Freedom of Information Act 2000 or the Data Protection Act 1998. The Government have decided to retain the original date for implementation of this section&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">The reason for this decision is that the policy intention behind the creation of the offence was that greater deterrence was needed to prevent the destruction of paper records, to which the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Act will apply from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>, than was needed for computerised or structured records, to which the Data Protection Act currently applies. It is far easier to conceal the destruction of paper records than of computerised records as in the latter case an audit trail is available. There is no evidence to suggest that the existing provisions in the Data Protection Act are defective in preventing the wrongful destruction of records. The Government do not believe that it would be right to create a new offence where there is no mischief to be addressed. Accordingly, the Government have decided to retain the <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> implementation date for Section 77.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.6/2">At the time the last repayment was made the oustanding principal owed to the United States by the United Kingdom was $4.368 billion, which at 1934 exchange rates was around &pound;866 million.

	<p pid="a.105.7/2" qnum="HL5946">Whether they agree with the findings of recent research carried out by Trafficmaster, the traffic monitoring company, that congestion has more than doubled on several key sections of the motorway network in the last five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.8/1">A preliminary investigation by the Highways Agency suggests that the results are statistically unrepresentative of underlying congestion trends. That is because it appears that the results have been skewed by short-term effects such as roadworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.8/2">The department's 2001 Trunk Road Speeds Survey shows that average speeds were 2.6 mph faster in 2001 in the morning peak period when compared to the equivalent speed in the 1998 survey. In the evening peak, they were 2.2 mph faster. This suggests that overall across trunk troads and motorways congestion has been falling, not rising.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.2/1">There are currently five schemes in the Highways Agency's targeted programme of improvements designed to address problems of congestion on the motorway network. The Highways Agency is also developing a programme of lower cost schemes to address local problems. I have arranged for a list of these schemes to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses with an indication of the expected timescales for delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/2">Further schemes may be added to the targeted programme of improvements which will address congestion on the motorway network in the light of recommendations from the ongoing programme of multi-modal studies. These studies were commissioned in order to look at some of the most serious congestion problems on the strategic road network and to identify the contribution that all transport modes might make to providing sustainable solutions. The Highways Agency has been closely involved in the studies and the Government agreed last year that it could carry out parallel appraisal and validation work on any road schemes likely to be recommended by the studies. This should reduce the time required for schemes to enter the TPI once the Secretary of State has announced his conclusions on each of the study findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/3">The multi-modal study programme is now well advanced. The studies report initially to the appropriate regional planning body. The Secretary of State for Transport will consider study recommendations in the light of their advice. I am also arranging for a list of the studies to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
