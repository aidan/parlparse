Since the local elections in May 2000 we have been piloting, with local authorities and in close consultation with the Electoral Commission, a series of new and innovative ways of voting, such as allowing people to do so by telephone and the internet, or allowing everyone to vote by post. We have recently published a prospectus inviting local authorities to suggest further schemes for the 2003 local elections. We are currently considering very carefully whether we should hold pilots at the proposed combined local, GLA and European Parliament elections in 2004. To do this would require separate changes to primary legislation, since piloting is not currently possible in local elections combined with European Parliamentary elections&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.5/1">In April 2001 the Government approved a number of changes to the constitution of the Police Negotiating Board following agreement with the official and staff sides. Both sides agreed to reduce their membership of the full board and to include the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Chief Police officers in Scotland as members of the official side. The language of the constitution was simplified.

	<p pid="a.89.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the chief executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-05">5 November 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/3">The Minister for the Cabinet Office, Lord Macdonald, has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the number of tourist signs on the M6 Motorway, and whether any are planned on that motorway directing traffic to the attractions of Southport.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/4">There are currently 50 brown tourist signs on the M6 on its full length through the West Midlands and the North West of England. Although there are no signs on the M6 to tourist attractions in Southport, there are two tourist signs for attractions in Southport on the M58 motorway for westbound traffic prior to the exit to the A570. The town itself is signed on the M6 for both north and southbound traffic at its junction with the M58 (Junction 26), and for northbound traffic at its junction with the M62 (Junction 21A).</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/5">The provision of tourist signs is only considered when a request is received from the owner or operator of a particular attraction. The cost of providing signs falls to the applicant. We have not received any requests for tourist signs on the M6 for attractions in Southport and there are therefore no plans to provide any such signs at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/6">Currently, tourist signs are provided on the motorway network only where there are clear traffic management and safety benefits. On receipt of an application for tourist signs, the Agency considers a number of factors including the size of the tourist attraction in terms of the number of visitors it attracts, the distance of the attraction from the motorway, the need to ensure a safe environment for road users by not providing too much information on signs and the need for consistency and continuity in the signing proposals. There is clearly a need for road users to be able to quickly assimilate information on traffic signs, so that they can react safely, especially when travelling at high speeds.ralph</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/7">I hope this is helpful. If you would like any further information about signing for Southport you may wish to contact the Agency's Route Manager for the M6 in Lancashire, Roy Wood, at Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4BE, telephone 0161 930 5686.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/1">The Department for Transport (DfT) and the Highways Agency have undertaken a range of work on the impacts of their policies on the levels of road traffic, including their effects on congestion. The results of this research have fed into DfT's modelling of the transport network, leading to more confident forecasts of congestion. In particular, in 2001 DfT commissioned work on public perceptions of congestion. This was published last year and a copy is available in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">DfT has recently let a contract to examine the potential for new methods of congestion measurement which it is hoped will improve our coverage of congestion levels at a more detailed level. It should also capture information about aspects of congestion, such as travel time variability, which are not covered by our current measure.</p>

A new signal is about to be installed closer to the station so that trains awaiting platform clearance are stopped nearer the station than at present. This will speed up station operations.

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">The European Commission's proposal to amend Regulation (EEC) 3820/85 on drivers' hours does not include specific measures to bring historic vehicles into the scope of the rules. The new draft regulation would still allow member states, with the consent of the Commission, to grant exceptions on their territory for operations carried out in exceptional circumstances, as we have for all vehicles built before January 1947 and certain public service vehicles over 25 years old.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2">The exemption of historic goods vehicles built since 1947 has hitherto relied upon another provision of the regulation which exempts &quot;vehicles used for the non-commercial carriage of goods for personal use&quot;. The Commission proposal would place a 7.5 tonne limit on this exemption and the UK and several other member states have pointed out that this would bring historic vehicles above this weight into scope. The UK and some other member states will continue to press for historic vehicles used non-commercially to remain outside the scope of the rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.8/1">Following the Strategic Defence Review, a strategic assessment has been made of the Ministry of Defence's future estate needs in the London area. This has shown that there is considerable scope to focus activity on to a smaller number of sites. The review is part of a wider rationalisation strategy to reduce the size of the defence estate by co-locating activities on to core sites, which will become a focus for future investment. The objective is to have a fit-for-purpose estate of the right size, shape and quality to meet defence outputs.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.8/2">RAF Northolt will become the centrepiece for Ministry of Defence plans to develop a core site for tasks that need to be based in north west London. As the only government-controlled airfield close to central London, studies have revealed that it is possible to develop the site for additional non-flying activities, most of which are currently based at RAF Uxbridge and at Inglis Barracks, Mill Hill.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.8/3">The Queens's Colour Squadron, HQ Music Services and the Central Band of the RAF have operational synergies with RAF Northolt in relation to VIP and ceremonial tasks carried out at the airfield. It is intended that these units should transfer from RAF Uxbridge, together with elements of the Personnel Services Wing and other minor lodgers from the Uxbridge site. In addition, space can be found for the British Forces Post Office and Defence Courier Service to move to Northolt from Mill Hill. Once Inglis Barracks has been vacated, the Mill Hill site will be sold for alternative civilian use.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.8/4">It will be possible to close the Uxbridge site for MoD use once the only other remaining task, the London Transit Centre, has moved to utilise surplus capacity at the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich. However, a parallel stream of work relating to the United States Navy's occupation of MoD sites in London has shown that it is possible to co-locate the bulk of the USN tasks at RAF Uxbridge, leading to the eventual closure of RAF Eastcote, RAF West Ruislip, RAF Daws Hill, Blenheim Crescent and Kennington Barracks and other leased property. Subject to further discussion with United States authorities and to reaching agreement with them, it is our intention to transfer RAF Uxbridge for the co-location of USN tasks from other parts of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.8/5">Combining Ministry of Defence and USN rationalisation activities as one programme of work presents a unique opportunity for the United Kingdom and United States Governments to work together to the advantage of both parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.8/6">Operational efficiency will be maintained or enhanced with personnel levels and employment activity broadly maintained. Starting with the relocation of BFPO, due to complete early in 2005 but with a stretch target of late 2004, the rationalisation process as a whole will take approximately five years to complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.8/7">In accordance with Government policy on sustainable development, the potential impact of all the options was assessed in terms of strategic environmental assessment and other sustainability issues, such as transport and the needs of the local economy. Once implemented, the brownfield sites released will be available for alternative civilian development.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.8/8">We hope the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, will recognise that these are imaginative proposals that will bring benefits to the Ministry of Defence and the local communities in which these military activities are based. We shall now embark on a period of consultation with the trade unions concerned and we shall keep the noble Lord informed as our plans progress.John B</p>

The members of the committee have considerable expertise relevant to such applications, but they also seek expert external advice on specialist areas as and when appropriate. The Medical Research Council is one body of expert advice that the authority approaches for additional input, as it did in the case of Professor Smith's research application. The authority anonymises applications when referring them for such advice becuse they are submitted to the authority in confidence and because doing so helps to remove the possibility of personal bias for or against the applicant. The Medical Research Council then unwittingly asked Professor Smith to review the application on its behalf. However, it is the council's standard practice to require people it consults to declare any potential conflict of interest. Professor Smith duly did so.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.3/1">Clause 28(1)(f) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill provides the Government with the power to provide education in an accommodation centre. Clause 35(7) states that the education provider shall make appropriate facilities available for a child with special educational needs unless it is incompatible with the special educational provision his learning difficulty calls for, the provision of efficient education for other children resident in the centre or the efficient use of resources.
