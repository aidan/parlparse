	<p pid="a.15.2/3" class="indent">(b) whether the applicant would qualify financially for full civil legal aid in other circumstances;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/4" class="indent">(c) whether an effective investigation of the death by the state is needed, and whether the inquest is the only way to conduct it;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/5" class="indent">(d) whether the applicant has a sufficiently close relationship to the deceased to warrant funding;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/6" class="indent">(e) whether an alternative to public funding is available;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/7" class="indent">(f) whether the applicant needs representation in order to participate effectively in the inquest--for example, because there are unusually complex questions of law or fact, or evidential difficulties, or because of the level of representation of others who have an interest in or are involved in the inquest;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/8" class="indent">(g) whether there is a significant wider public interest in representation being provided;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/9" class="indent">(h) the views of the coroner, if expressed; and</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/10" class="indent">(i) any other matters which appear to be relevant to the individual circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/11">I am writing to interested parties to invite their views on the criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/12">The consultation exercise for these criteria will conclude on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.17.5/1">The NHS Cancer Plan of September 2000 said that the Director of NHS Research and Development and the National Cancer Director had been asked to work with all those involved in the funding and delivery of cancer research and to come forward with definitive proposals for a national cancer research institute. They have done so, and we have agreed their proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">The National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) is a partnership between all the United Kingdom Health Departments, the Medical Research Council, the Cancer Research Campaign, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, the Marie Curie Research Institute and the pharmaceutical industry. The greatest benefit for patients is likely to be achieved if all the main funders of cancer research work together to ensure the best use of research resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/3">The NCRI will be established from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April</phrase>. It will provide the focus for cancer research conducted across the UK, and provide strategic oversight of that research. It will take the lead in identifying where further research initiatives are indicated and are most likely to lead to progress. It will also co-ordinate research into cancer genetics in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/4">But the NCRI will not be a single, large &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; facility. It will have a core staff of about six people, and total running costs of about &pound;500,000 a year. All the partners have agreed to contribute. The details have to be worked out, but the Government are prepared to underwrite the costs in the first instance so that the NCRI can make progress without delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.8/1">The Prison Service standard on religion is due to be issued in early April. Members of the Advisory Group on Religion in Prisons were consulted on the draft standard in September 1999 and will be sent a copy of the published standard. The standard reflects long established Prison Service policy as set out in the Directory and Guide on Religious Practices in Her Majesty's Prison Service (page 116), which is in the Library. This advises that, where there is no space available which can be considered reasonably adequate in terms of decency and the dignity of a religious community at prayer, chaplains may, as a temporary measure, and after consulting with the bishops and Methodist Chairman, give their consent for the chapel to be used for worship by non-Christian groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-22">22 March</phrase>, the Government announced measures designed to alleviate the immediate financial hardship of small businesses in rural areas which have been badly hit by the effects of foot and mouth disease. Local authorities already have discretion to grant rate relief to businesses suffering from hardship. The Government have announced that the central government contribution to rate relief will be increased from 75 per cent to 95 per cent for small businesses in rural authorities, which are suffering hardship as a result of foot and mouth disease. Local authorities may also use their existing powers to defer or reschedule the payment of rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/2">Businesses affected by foot and mouth may also apply to the Valuation Office Agency for a temporary reduction in their rateable value. Proposals should be made to the agency as soon as possible, but the Government have announced their intention to extend the deadline for making an application so that successful proposals received by <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase> may be backdated into the 2000-01 financial year, if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-19">19 March</phrase>, the Government presented a Bill that will extend mandatory rate relief to all food shops with a rateable value below &pound;6,000 in small rural settlements, and has said that it will lay regulations to extend mandatory 50 per cent rate relief to sole village pubs and garages with a rateable value of less than &pound;9,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.0/1">We are pleased to announce that today the Government have selected the Airline Group as the strategic partner for the National Air Traffic Services Public/Private Partnership. The Airline Group has satisfied the Government that it will maintain the high safety standards achieved by NATS. Its strategic investment plan will provide NATS with the investment it needs to meet the demands of steadily increasing air traffic, and will guarantee the future of the new air traffic control centres at Swanwick and Prestwick. The Airline Group will also introduce management skills into NATS which will help it to operate efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/2">The NATS Public/Private Partnership will be regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, which will ensure that NATS continues to operate safely, while reducing costs to users. The Government will retain a 49 per cent shareholding to enable them to protect the public interest on strategic matters. Staff will have a direct interest in the company through a 5 per cent stake.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/3">Since last November, when the legislation enabling the establishment of the public/private partnership was announced, the Government have been taking the views of all sections of the aviation community on their proposals. The report on the discussions held during this three-month period is being laid in the Libraries of both Houses today.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/4">This will be the first true public/private partnership, helping to ensure the safe and efficient provision of air traffic services, and providing the opportunity for NATS to emerge as a major worldwide player in its field.</p>
