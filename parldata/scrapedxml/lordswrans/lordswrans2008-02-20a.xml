In order to allow affected farmers this possibility, we provided guidance in consultation with experts from the EU reference laboratory at Pirbright. However, the necessary conditions are onerous and could not be achieved under commercial farm conditions, although such facilities do exist elsewhere in the EU. We would not wish to compromise on this standard because it could increase the risk of the disease spreading to bluetongue-free areas of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.2/1">The Central-Local Concordat, agreed between the Government and the Local Government Association (LGA), on behalf of local authorities in England, was signed in December last year. It commits both parties to a framework of principles to secure a new relationship between central government and local government. This framework will apply to non-departmental public bodies, including Arts Council England. Discharging the rights and responsibilities of central government and local government set out in the Concordat will require major changes in the behaviour and practice of all parties. The operation of this agreement will be monitored on a continuing basis, through renewed central-local partnership arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/2">We are discussing with the LGA how we take forward the Concordat, focusing on its guiding principles and specific commitments. These include encouraging councils to make effective use of their power to promote the well-being of their area; enabling local government to conduct a growing share of the business of government; central government consulting and collaborating with councils in setting national policies and proposing legislation; reducing the burden of appraisal and approval regimes and the volume of guidance issued by central government to local authorities; supporting and encouraging strong leadership and effective partnership working at local level; and increasing local democratic accountability of key public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/3">Local authorities across England are currently engaged in discussions with government offices on behalf of all government departments on the content of new-style local area agreements, which will have effect from 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.5/1">The Government Historic Estates Unit deals with a wide range of casework in relation to the government historic estate ranging from general inquiries about disposals and buildings at risk to statutory notifications in relation to development proposals. Although precise statistics are not available, a breakdown of the different types of work carried out by the unit is contained in their biennial report.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/2">The last report, published in 2006, included a commentary on progress with disposals and referred to several cases on the MoD estate that were then current. These were HMS Daedalus (Hampshire), RAF Upper Heyford (Oxfordshire), RAF Bicester (Oxfordshire), RAF West Raynham (Norfolk), RAF Coltishall (Norfolk) and RAF Neatishead (Norfolk).The report also included two case studies of completed disposals&mdash;the Royal Army Medical College on Millbank and Shoebury Garrison in Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/3">The next report is due to be published in about three weeks' time. This will refer to more recent disposal cases on the MoD estate, including heritage buildings at Aldershot and Colchester garrisons. The report will also give an account of work that English Heritage and GHEU have been doing on the assessment of the redundant NHS hospital sites, in partnership with English Partnerships. I will arrange for copies of the 2008 report to be placed in the House Libraries on publication.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.6/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) does not currently regard an epidemiological study as a priority for our work in Iraq. We are focusing our efforts on meeting urgent humanitarian needs, including in the field of health. For example, we are supporting the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is providing urgently needed medical supplies, such as war wounded kits to hospitals dealing with mass casualties, and improving health facilities (physical rehabilitation and training for staff). We are also supporting the United National High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), which is helping healthcare services in Syria and Jordan to cope with the influx of Iraqi refugees. As part of this support, Iraqis are receiving treatment for cancer in Syrian hospitals. The British Council and Department of Health are also building the capacity of the Iraqi health sector by training Iraqi doctors.

	<p pid="a.72.5/1">The UK pledged up to &pound;243 million over three years at the Paris Conference. In order to meet the Palestinian Authority's urgent funding needs we are doubling our assistance from &pound;30 million in 2007 to &pound;62 million in 2008. This funding will benefit Gazans directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.5/2">The Paris Conference pledges from the 87 participant nations and international organisations will more than cover the $5.5 billion (&pound;2.8 billion) financing gap identified by Palestinian Prime Minister Mr Fayyad. The Palestinian leadership is committed to helping Gazans benefit from the Paris pledges.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.5/3">In addition the European Commission has recently secured a further &euro;85 million (&pound;65 million) to support the temporary international mechanism until the end of March 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/2">Estimates of the extent of illegal logging and forest clearance are unreliable but could be between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of these totals.

A new EU regulation will ensure that only timber from these countries licensed as legal will be allowed into the EU. The agreements will also seek to address broader governance problems that allow illegal logging and forest destruction in these countries.</p>
