	<p pid="b.143.2/1">The ActionAid report on HIV/AIDS in Afghanistan is a very welcome contribution to the body of knowledge on the disease in Afghanistan. We agree with the overall conclusion that while Afghanistan does not yet have a large number of reported cases, there is a need to take action now, before it is too late to make a difference to the course of the epidemic.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.2/2">The proposal in the report for international organisations and NGOs to provide co-ordinated support to the National Aids Control Programme makes good sense and we would expect the small number of donors involved in this sector to respond positively to this suggestion. DfID is not directly engaged in HIV/AIDS or the wider health sector in Afghanistan, and therefore not in a position to judge whether there is a need to review the World Health Organisation's AIDS-related assistance.</p>

This includes helping them to move to low-carbon development strategies and to adapt to the impact of climate change. The International Development Association and the rest of the World Bank group have an important role in assisting developing countries in tackling these challenges and promoting sustainable low-carbon growth to tackle poverty. IDA and the other international financial institutions are important sources of finance, analysis and expertise to assist developing countries to tackle climate change, access carbon finance and prepare themselves for a post-2012 future framework.</p>

UK aid partnerships are based on a shared commitment with partner countries to respect human rights. In fulfilling this commitment, DfID complies with international standards which set out the rights of all people, including indigenous and tribal people. The rights in the main international conventions, which are similar to ILO Convention 169, include the right to freedom from discrimination, the right to health and education, the right to participation in public life and the right to respect for cultural life.</p>

	<p pid="b.148.3/1">We condemn the use of violence against peaceful demonstrations. Together with EU partners we are making representations to the authorities about the excessive use of violence by the police in suppressing peaceful protests not only in Karachi but also in other cities. Our High Commissioner in Islamabad attended a follow-up meeting with some of those in Karachi who had been detained. We continue to urge the Government of Pakistan to lift all media restrictions.</p>
