	<p pid="a.59.8/1">Her Majesty's Government seek to apply &quot;zero real growth&quot;--in some cases zero nominal growth--to the budget of all international organisations to which they belong. This is a necessary discipline which encourages these organisations to keep their working methods and priorities under constant and rigorous review, thus eliminating work which is no longer a priority for most member states. Her Majesty's Government would naturally prefer initiatives agreed by the Committee of Ministers to be funded, wherever possible, within the existing budget by identifying savings and reprioritising commitments. Where unforseen but important activities have arisen, such as the monitoring of the Kosovo elections, Her Majesty's Government have made voluntary contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.9/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-22">22 December</phrase>, 1999 (when Turkey's economic reform programme began), the IMF has committed SDR 15 billion ($18.8 billion) (for the period to November 2002), of which SDR 6.9 billion ($8.7 billion) has been disbursed. Of this, SDR 221.7 million ($277.1 million) was disbursed prior to <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.61.9/2">The IMF and the Turkish authorities have together identified a number of deficiencies in the operation of the Turkish banking system, such as subsidised lending by state banks, and unhedged foreign borrowing by private banks. Measures to address these problems have also been agreed, including recapitalising, restructuring and eventually privatising state banks, and either selling or liquidating insolvent private sector banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.9/3">In addition to these banking reforms, the IMF and the Turkish authorities have agreed on a range of other actions on which Turkey's economic programme should focus. These include: fiscal consolidation to improve debt sustainability; privatisation and liberalisation of key elements of the economy; and disinflation via inflation targeting. The full details of the programme were set out in the Turkish authorities' Letter of Intent and Memorandum on Economic Policies of <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-03">3 May 2001</phrase>; which has been posted on the IMF's website.</p>

Any evidence of torture is taken very seriously and caseworkers are aware of the need for sensitivity when interviewing victims of torture, as well as the United Kingdom's obligations to protect victims of torture. If there are substantial grounds to believe that there is a real risk that a person will, if returned, be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, it would be inappropriate to remove them. In such cases, if the applicant does not qualify for asylum, exceptional leave would be granted.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.0/1">It is the Government's intention to implement the Freedom of Information Act well within the statutory five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/2">Comparisons between the time taken to implement legislation in other countries and the time needed to implement the Act in the United Kingdom must be made with great care. Central government in the United Kingdom provides service for some 60 million people. The Republic of Ireland has 3.6 million inhabitants, New Zealand 3.4 million and Canada 27 million. Moreover, the equivalent legislation in the Republic of Ireland was prospective only, unlike the UK Act, and the legislation in Canada applies only to the federal government, which covers a narrower range of services than central government in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/3">The scale of the task of preparing central government in the UK for the implementation of Freedom of Information is therefore significantly greater than that in Canada, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland. A much greater number of people have to be trained in the operation of the Act, and it is important to ensure that the training is of the extent and quality required for the major new rights that the public will derive from the Act to be delivered effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/4">The Information Commissioner also needs to increase substantially the staff complement of her office. The kind of people she needs to recruit to police the Act effectively cannot simply be recruited overnight. She needs people with knowledge of the way the public sector works and with proper investigative and project management skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/5">All this takes time, but the Government intend to complete these tasks as quickly as they can.</p>
