The observed generic change does not indicate or predict disease, and the study itself confirms that it was not designed to make any comment on clinical outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.6/1">In order to make this comparison, a Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) has been calculated. An SMR compares the number of suicides in the Armed Forces to the number of civilian suicides by standardising the Armed Forces population. The SMR is then used to assess the &quot;risk&quot; of death for a sub-population, in this case the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.6/2">As part of the calculation, the civilian population is set to a value of 100. A ratio greater than 100 would indicate higher suicide rate in the UK Armed Forces than the comparable UK civilian population. Likewise, an SMR value less than 100 would indicate that the suicide rate in the UK Armed Forces is lower than the corresponding group in the UK civilian population. An SMR value of 55 would mean that the UK Armed Forces were at a 45 per cent decreased risk of suicide.</p>

The FSA supervises and regulates banks incorporated in the UK which offer Sharia-compliant accounts in the same way as any other UK institution with a regulatory permission to accept deposits. These banks are required to comply with FSA rules covering capital, liquidity, complaints and other conduct of business matters and are subject to requirements to participate in the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).

	<p pid="a.101.3/1">The department has carefully considered the position of people with a range of serious and life threatening illnesses-including cancer-in relation to the benefit system. We do not aim to reduce the levels of support for the most severely ill or disabled people but it is clearly important that we ensure it is well targeted, is fair to those on low pay and that the right money goes to the right people.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/2">Following an internal review we have recently made changes to the work capability assessment (WCA) so that more individuals undergoing certain chemotherapy treatments will automatically be placed in the support group without the need for an assessment. Those in the support group, including many cancer patients, will not be affected by the time-limiting measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/3">People will still be able to claim income-related employment and support allowance (ESA) subject to meeting the conditions of entitlement. Access to income-related ESA is not affected by this measure. This measure will not leave people destitute-only those who have alternative resources will not qualify for income-related ESA. Typically they would have a partner in full-time work or have savings in excess of &#163;16,000 in order not to qualify for income-related ESA.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/4">Dependent on individual circumstances, a person may be able to claim a number of benefits, for example housing benefit, council tax benefit, pension credit and tax credits. Additionally, those who do not qualify for income-related ESA will still be able to claim ESA on a &quot;credits only&quot; basis so that they can maintain their national insurance contribution record.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/5">A claimant will also retain any entitlement to disability living allowance, provided they continue to meet the qualifying conditions. Not all those affected with cancer will be financially worse off as a result of this measure as some will be fully or partially compensated by income-related ESA.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/6">Additionally, Professor Harrington, as part of his second independent review, asked Macmillan Cancer Support to look in detail at how the WCA assesses people with cancer and to provide him with recommendations for further improvements. We have recently received these recommendations from Professor Harrington. We are considering them carefully to understand whether they will improve the assessment further for individuals with cancer. We will come forward with any proposals shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/7">We are determined that the social security system should support people who are diagnosed with cancer in the most sensitive, fair and appropriate way and have been working with Macmillan Cancer Support and others to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.3/1">The department has provided grants to After Adoption Yorkshire to run the UK DonorLink voluntary contact register for pre-1991 donor-conceived people and their donors since 2004. In the current economic climate, the department has to weigh carefully the pressures on and priorities for its funding against the value of the service that UK DonorLink provides.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.3/2">The department agreed to provide a grant of &#163;60,000 in 2011-12 to support the running of UK DonorLink on the basis that After Adoption Yorkshire would develop, in-year, a transition to operating the service on a self-sustaining basis. The department is disappointed that After Adoption Yorkshire declared in August that it has been unable to move the UK DonorLink service to that self-sustaining status.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.3/3">The department will be considering other options over the next few months for running a voluntary contact register. In the mean time, the department has offered a further grant to After Adoption Yorkshire, until the end of March 2012, to support the UK DonorLink service while this consideration takes place.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.5/1">Our policy on Hamas is clear; the quartet has set out clearly that Hamas must renounce violence, recognise Israel and accept previously signed agreements. Hamas must make credible movement towards these conditions, which remain the benchmark against which its intentions should be judged. The clear focus for now must be a return to direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/2">Hamas continues to pursue an ideology of violence and directly to undermine prospects for peace in the region. It is part of the problem. It has yet to provide evidence that it can also be part of the solution, and this must clearly be the case if we are to review our position.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/3">We have no plans to talk to Hamas at present. We are therefore not in a position to assess the extent of Hamas's control in Gaza or to work with it to tackle militancy. We do however raise these issues in our regular dialogue and co-operation on security issues with the Palestinian Authority. We will continue to call on all sides to act with restraint and avoid civilian casualties.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">The UK frequently raises with the Israeli authorities the issue of easing restrictions on Gaza, but we have not made specific representations concerning fishing limits off the coast of Gaza. There has been no fundamental change in the crossings regime, and economic stagnation and de-development in Gaza remain the norm, although Israel's decision to move from a list of 120 permitted goods to a list of specific prohibited items was a positive step. We are clear that more needs to be done, including on easing restrictions on exports, construction material imports and the movement of people.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">The term &quot;chronic alcoholics&quot; is not one that is used by the department, although we recognise that there are varying levels of alcohol dependence.</p>

Of those, 111,381 people are estimated to have received treatment as indicated in the National Alcohol Treatment Monitoring System Annual Report 2009-10. This shows that 7 per cent of adults showing signs of dependence accessed treatment in that year.

All the treatments studied produced significant improvements in alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, alcohol-related problems and aspects of general functioning.

	<p pid="a.125.3/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister made the UK's position on recognition of a Palestinian state clear during the visit of President Obama. He agreed with the President that a Palestinian state was a legitimate goal, and the best way of achieving this was through a comprehensive agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/2">Palestinian action at the UN this month is now looking increasingly likely but it is not yet clear exactly what they are proposing. We are working with partners to build consensus on a way forward that recognises the progress the Palestinians have made on their state-building efforts, that meets Israel's legitimate security concerns, and that avoids confrontation in the UN. Whatever action is taken in New York, it is important that this increases the prospects for a return to negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/3">We have reserved our position on the question of recognition of a Palestinian state while we continue to urge all parties back to talks. Recognition is a matter for each Government to decide bilaterally, and if needed, we will take a decision nearer to the time, in consultation with EU and other partners.</p>

Within the existing UN sanctions regimes, there are several exemptions which enable member states, either by notifying or seeking the approval of the UN Sanctions Committee, to release frozen assets for the purchase of food and other necessities. Over the past six months, many requests of this nature have been agreed. There is no food security crisis in Libya but we continue to liaise closely with the World Food Programme, which is leading the UN food security response in Libya, to monitor the situation on the ground and respond appropriately.</p>

The Department for Transport could not simply stop the current procurement and immediately start a new one but would need to demonstrate that the current procurement is inappropriate then formulate a revised scope for any future procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/2">Based on experience to date, thereafter a procurement exercise for a train project of this complexity, involving an innovative design with requirements for maintenance, finance and depots would take between two and three years to conclude.</p>

The number of cases involved is considerable. In 1999 there were 606,000 deductions for social fund repayments and 131,000 for overpayment recoveries in a typical week.

In addition, the SSAC has drawn attention to the dangers of the proliferation of such deductions, which 'is likely to lead to a large number of items competing for a finite amount or the possibility that creditors' bills are met at the expense of food and other essential items of day to day living'&quot;.</p>

However, housing benefit and council tax benefit can continue to be paid in some circumstances if the period of absence from the home is 13 weeks or less.

It is the combined impact of these that provides the best overall view of the impacts on households. This shows that in 2014-15, the top 20 per cent of households are estimated to make the greatest overall contribution towards reducing the deficit as a percentage of their income and benefits in kind from public services.</p>

The General Court determined that the Council had infringed Regulation 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (the Regulation) by withholding the identities of member states making proposals in relation to a particular ongoing legislative procedure. In doing so the General Court rejected the argument that disclosure of this information would harm the decision making process of the European institutions and ruled that it could not therefore be withheld on the basis of the exception in Article 4(3) of the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">The Government strongly support the right of access provided by the regulation. However it is also important that truly sensitive information is adequately protected. It is the Government's view that, as a general rule, the negotiating positions of member states on European legislation should be protected from disclosure while those negotiations are ongoing. Our concern is that this decision could well undermine that important principle, and could have very significant negative implications for the future use, where necessary, of Article 4(3) of the regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.2/2">The Government are taking action to repair the damage done by the previous Government and improve the competitiveness of the UK tax system. At the June Budget 2010, the Government set out their aim to create the most competitive corporate tax system in the G20 and has since set out more detailed proposals in its Corporate Tax Road Map (which is accessible online at: <a href="http://www.hmtreasury.gov.uk/corporate">http://www.hmtreasury.gov.uk/corporate</a> taxreform.htm). This includes four annual one per cent reductions in the main rate of corporate tax which, together with the further one per cent reduction announced in Budget 2011, will see the rate reach 23 per cent by 2014. Critical changes to the scope of corporation tax in order to enhance competitiveness will include the introduction of a patent box, to incentivise the creation of intellectual property in the UK and a new controlled foreign company regime, to make the UK a more attractive base for multinational groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/3">The Government recognise that tax competitiveness is not just about rates and incidence of tax and have also committed to restoring the UK tax system's reputation for stability, simplicity and predictability.

	<p pid="a.183.0/1">Resolution of the Middle East peace process is a high priority for the UK Government. The EU and EU member states as a collective are the biggest financial supporters of the Palestinian Authority.

	<p pid="a.183.6/1">The Government want to help individuals by having a stable economy with sustained and balanced growth, which is why we are taking action to tackle the deficit, support business in creating jobs with most competitive tax system in the G20, to make the UK the best place in Europe to start finance and grow a business, to encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy and to create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe. The Government's Growth Review will continue for the rest of this Parliament, providing ongoing focus on what the Government can do to support growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.6/2">We believe that pension provision is important, and that is why we are introducing workplace pension reform. Automatic enrolment will be introduced from 2012 requiring all employers to enrol eligible workers into workplace pension saving and to make an employer contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.6/3">The aim of automatic enrolment is to encourage people to start saving, continue saving and save for longer to meet their retirement needs. As a result of automatic enrolment we expect there to be around 5 to 8 million people newly saving or saving more in all forms of workplace pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.6/4">Automatic enrolment is widely recognised as the best way to overcome people's savings inertia-rather than having to make an active decision to save in a workplace pension, an employee has to make an active decision not to save. Even where an individual opts out, the employer is required to re-enrol them every three years, encouraging individuals to rethink about the need to save for their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.6/5">A programme of communications and information is being designed to help people understand the need to save to meet their aspirations for retirement, build awareness of the changes and support a behavioural shift amongst working age people so that saving in a pension becomes the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.6/6">In addition, the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) has been established to provide access to suitable, low cost pension provision for all employers, and will be particularly suited to the needs of those workers on low to moderate incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.6/7">And for future pensioners the Government are looking at reforming the state pension system which would be simple, easy to understand, efficient to deliver, affordable-providing a firm foundation for workplace saving.</p>

Our budget support will decline over the four-year period and will represent 14 per cent of our aid to Uganda by 2014/15 down from a peak of over 50 per cent under the last Government. It will comprise both general support to the budget worth a maximum of &#163;50 million and sector support to health worth up to &#163;27.5 million. Through UK budget support, we will strengthen budgetary processes and public investments, improve value for money in public service delivery; increase tax collection; and ensure better transparency and accountability for the management of oil revenues. These steps will ultimately pave the way for Uganda's independence from development assistance. In addition, our health sector support will increase the number of attended births by over 100,000, immunise almost 125,000 children and ensure over 700,000 children to get rapid access to malaria treatment. We will link a proportion of both general and health sector payments to performance in these areas.</p>

We continue to call, both bilaterally and within the EU member states, for an end to all such abuses and the restoration of internationally accepted human rights standards in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/3">Following the allegations made in the BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, we have urged the Kimberley Process, through the EU, to investigate the allegations. The Kimberley Process chair has written to the BBC asking it to pass its evidence for consideration, and to the Government of Zimbabwe requesting clarification of the allegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/4">We also call on the Zimbabwean authorities to transparently investigate this footage. Until all Marange mines meet Kimberley Process standards, the UK will continue to argue for a robust international response to Zimbabwe's failure to comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/5">There are limitations to the Kimberley Process's ability to deliver on issues such as human rights and there is a need to reform the Kimberley Process to make it a more effective mechanism. We are working with European Union partners to explore ways to strengthen and enhance the Kimberley Process to ensure it remains effective, accountable and relevant. In particular, we support reform of the Kimberley Process that would enable it to take human rights abuses by states more explicitly into consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">It is for all businesses to assess whether their proposed business activities are compliant with existing restrictive measures and seek appropriate independent legal advice. The restrictive measures imposed on Zimbabwe prohibit the making available of funds or economic resources to directly or indirectly listed entities. Marange Resources (formerly Canadile Miners) and Mbada Diamonds are not themselves designated entities. However, if making resources available to them conferred a significant financial benefit on a designated entity such as ZMDC, as would often be the case with joint ventures, this would be a breach of the measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">There are also restrictions under the Kimberley Process (KP) on diamonds exports from the Marange region in which the mining operations of Marange Resources (formerly Canadile Mines) and Mbada Diamonds are located. Given the continuing absence of a KP agreement allowing Zimbabwe to export Marange diamonds, the EU Chair of the Working Group on Monitoring (WGM) has issued a statement to all KP participants which makes clear that until consensus is reached, KP participants should not trade in Marange diamonds. We have informed the UK diamond industry of this statement by the WGM chair.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">The Kimberley Process was originally designed to combat the trade in conflict diamonds, defined as rough diamonds being sold by rebel groups to fund conflict. In this respect, the Kimberley Process has had considerable success; conflict diamonds now represent less than 1 per cent of the global trade in rough diamonds, compared to 15 per cent in the 1990s. However, given the narrow definition of conflict diamonds, which does not include the actions of states, and the fact that the Kimberley Process operates by consensus, there are limitations to the Kimberley Process's ability to deliver on issues such as human rights and transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/2">We accept therefore that there is a need to reform the Kimberley Process to make it a more effective mechanism. We are working with European Union partners to explore ways to strengthen and enhance the Kimberley Process to ensure it remains effective, accountable and relevant. In particular, we support reform of the Kimberley Process that would enable it to take human rights abuses by states more explicitly into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/3">In addition to Kimberley Process reform, we are also exploring alternative and complementary schemes to work alongside and strengthen the Kimberley Process, including industry-led regulatory initiatives to provide a higher level of assurance across the diamond supply chain, taking into account issues such as human rights.</p>
