	<p pid="a.76.2/1">Any substance, whether or not it is a mineral oil, is subject to excise duty where it is used as a road fuel. This duty is normally charged at the rate of the fuel for which that substance is substituting. Because cooking oil can only be used in some diesel-engined cars, it will normally be liable at the rate set for ultra-low sulphur diesel, which is 45.82p per litre. Some cooking oil may meet the specification for biodiesel for duty purposes. To support the growth of the biodiesel industry the Government introduced a reduced duty rate in this year's Budget for biodiesel used as a road fuel, which is 25.82p per litre.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/1">As the Economic Secretary to the Treasury announced in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-12">12 December 2001</phrase> (WA 890-891W) the Government propose to give the Financial Services Authority (FSA) responsibility for regulating general insurance and reinsurance mediation. The Government have today published a consultation document that sets out the intended approach to regulating the sale of general insurance products following adoption on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase> by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers under the co-decision procedure of the Insurance Mediation Directive (the directive).</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/2">The consultation document explains that the FSA will regulate the following activities: introducing, proposing or carrying out other work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance or reinsurance; assisting in the administration and performance of such contracts, in particular in the event of a claim; and concluding contracts of insurance or reinsurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/3">The directive requires the regulation of mediation activities in relation to all contracts of insurance. However, it provides certain exemptions for insurance sold as part of a package, including travel insurance sold with a holiday and extended warranties that are contracts of insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/4">It is for the UK Government to decide whether to regulate those insurances that are exempted from the directive and the Government have decided to defer a decision on whether the FSA should regulate extended warranties pending the outcome of the Competition Commission inquiry into extended warranties for electrical goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/5">As to travel insurances that are sold with a holiday, we need carefully to weigh the consumer protection issues against regulatory costs. The Government also need to weigh fairly the competition issues between those intermediaries that sell travel insurance direct and travel agents that sell insurance alongside a holiday. The Government have decided, therefore, to consult on whether to give the FSA responsibility for regulating these products. There are three options:</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/6" class="indent">no statutory regulation of sales of travel insurance sold as part of a package;</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/7" class="indent">FSA regulation to cover these sales in the same way as stand alone sales of travel insurance; or</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/8" class="indent">industry-specific regulation, requiring sellers of these products to be authorised by the FSA unless they are subject to an ABTA code which would be certified by the FSA. Sellers who were subject to the ABTA code but who also carried on other FSMA regulated activity, including selling any insurance other than packaged travel insurance, would be subject to FSA authorisation in relation to all of their regulated activities (including the activities to which the ABTA code applied).</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/9">Responses to the consultation on general insurance and reinsurance regulation, and on the options for travel insurance sold as part of a holiday, should be sent to HM Treasury by <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>.</p>

Four of these deaths occurred overseas, and despite inquiries by MoD staff, the precise cause of the deaths has not been established.

	<p pid="a.79.0/1">The case of Matthews v Ministry of Defence, which tested the compatibility of Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 with the claimant's rights under Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, was heard in the Court of Appeal on 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-23">23 April 2002</phrase>. A unanimous judgment was handed down by Lord Phillips, Master of the Rolls, on <phrase class="date" code="">29 May</phrase>. The Court of Appeal found in favour of the MoD but granted leave for the claimant to take the matter to the House of Lords. A date has not been set for the hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/2">When Parliament debated the repeal of Section 10, the question of retrospection was considered, and motions to allow all past and present members of HM Forces to pursue compensation claims for injury or death were moved. They were defeated or withdrawn. The view then, as it is now, was that there is no logical point at which to draw a line, short of trying to cover all types of injury going back to 1947, and this would create more examples of unfairness and injustice. The Government, therefore, have no plans to introduce legislation to allow ex-service personnel suffering illness or injury before May 1987 to be paid common-law compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/3">Compensation in the form of a war pension is, however, available to all former members of HM Forces suffering from service-attributable illness or injury. War pensions are paid by the Veterans Agency and are non-discretionary, not means-tested, and are made on a no-fault, tax free and retrospective basis. They are uprated annually.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.8/1">There is no national target set on bed occupancy. As part of routine capacity planning each National Health Service trust needs to establish the levels of occupancy required for different specialties and types of care depending on their own particular circumstances. Appropriate levels of occupancy will depend on a number of factors, including specialty, the balance between emergency and planned admissions and the size of the hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.8/2">The Police Service of Northern Ireland, in conjunction with relevant agencies, is taking forward the installation work. It is intended that the system will provide for one pole with two cameras at the Cluan Place/Clandeboye Drive interface, with another pole and a single camera at the Cluan Place/Clandeboye Gardens interface. In addition, a single camera is to be situated at Bridge End and a similar unit for the central traffic island at the junction of Albertbridge Road/Woodstock Link.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.8/3">In addition to the requirement to manufacture component parts for the cameras, PSNI has identified the need for a new and dedicated monitoring suite for the system. While it is not possible to give an exact date when the system will become operational, I can say that work on this very important project is progressing apace.</p>

An investigation by his line management, and reported to the department's central personnel section, did not produce any firm evidence to substantiate that concern.

	<p pid="a.82.5/4">In October 2001 the Compensation Agency, an agency of the NIO, required a messenger to fill a temporary vacancy. Mr Mackessy was moved to the post. At the stage when he became surplus to the agency's requirements, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) had declared a number of vacancies for messengers which they needed to fill urgently. Mr Mackessy transferred to DETI on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-19">19 November 2001</phrase> to fill one of those vacancies. The transfer was arranged through normal personnel channels.</p>
