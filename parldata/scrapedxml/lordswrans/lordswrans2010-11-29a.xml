	<p pid="a.405.6/2">In the case of reducing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infections, the approach of the previous Government was to use national targets, which placed no specific obligation on individual organisations to reduce their own infection rates as part of measuring their success. While there has been progress nationally in reducing the numbers of these infections, some NHS organisations have not contributed as significantly as other comparable organisations.</p>

The key aim will be to remove variations in C. difficile infection rates between organisations, by driving all organisations towards the best rates. We propose to set an objective for each NHS. organisation (acute trusts and primary care organisations) based on its historical rates of infection. Those organisations with the highest rates will be set the largest challenge to improve. This will result in a more clinically relevant objective for all organisations and address the variations in performance that have occurred in the past.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-11-29a.406.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="406"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101129w0001.htm#10112934000064">
	<p pid="a.406.2/1">Details on the level of ambition we will set from April 2011 for the National Health Service to reduce the level of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infections and how progress will be monitored will be confirmed next month. We propose to set an objective for each NHS organisation who based on its historical performance, with the largest challenge set in those with the highest rates of infection and, therefore, with the capacity to make the most significant progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.2/2">The C. difficile objective for 2011-12 will be measured using data reported to the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on the number of C. difficile infections each month. Before the start of 2011-12, organisations will produce plans on how they will deliver the annual objective throughout the course of the year. In-year progress towards delivering the annual objective will be measured by comparing performance against these plans. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) will observe organisational performance and, in turn, the department will hold SHAs to account for performance management of organisations towards delivering their individual objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.2/3">In terms of infections within care homes, we are committed to ensuring that the objective reflects the need for a whole economy approach to be undertaken in order to reduce these infections, recognising that action needs to be taken in the hospital and outside of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.2/4">We will do this by making primary care organisations (PCOs) responsible for all C. difficile infections within their locality from whatever source they come, including those in care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.2/5">Currently, PCOs and other organisations, such as the Care Quality Commission (CQC), use data from the HPA mandatory surveillance system to support them in ensuring effective infection prevention and control measures are being operated within all providers of health and social care services. The mandatory surveillance system receives information on all C. difficile infections from laboratories and includes cases from all settings, including those occurring in care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.2/6">It is important to note that the C. difficile objective is not the only means to ensure effective infection prevention and control within care homes. From October this year, the social care sector became subject to the requirements of the code of practice for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections against which the CQC assess compliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.408.2/1">The Government have set out plans to reform higher education student finance in England which will offer a more generous package of financial support for low-income students living in England wishing to attend university in 2012-13. No full-time student will need to contribute to their tuition costs up front and students from families with incomes of &#163;25,000 or less will be entitled to a more generous full maintenance grant of &#163;3,250 a year. Students starting part-time courses in 2012-13, often those from non-traditional backgrounds, will be entitled to an up-front loan to meet their tuition costs so long as they are studying at an intensity of at least 33 per cent of a full-time course.</p>
	<p pid="a.408.2/2">We are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation, and greater government investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Universities wanting to charge more than a &#163;6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support. This will include a requirement to participate in the new &#163;150 million National Scholarships Programme. This work will be further supported by the &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium to turn their school-based achievement into success at university.</p>
	<p pid="a.408.2/3">Participation in higher education has improved in recent years. In 2008-09 88 per cent of young entrants to full-time degree courses in England were from state schools. However, there is more to do. Access will remain a focus for all institutions, which will continue to submit a widening participation strategic assessment to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Universities charging above the &#163;6,000 threshold will draw up a new access agreement with the director of fair access, who will expect most of those whose records show they have furthest to go in securing a diverse student body.</p>

	<p pid="a.412.5/1">The Natural Hazards Team was formed within the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the Cabinet Office in May 2009. The purpose of this team is to establish a cross-sector programme to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure to disruption from natural hazards.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.5/2">One of the team's early priorities was to work with government departments, regulators and infrastructure owners to produce the first sector resilience plans. Produced during 2009, these plans identified and assessed the vulnerability to flooding of the most critical infrastructure of each of the nine sectors of essential services and the measures necessary to secure the resilience of those sites to flooding. The sector resilience plans are being used as the basis for a long-term programme to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure to a broader range of hazards.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.5/3">Subsequently, in March 2010, the Government published:</p>
	<p pid="a.412.5/4">a strategic framework and policy statement, setting out the process, timetable and expectations for the resilience programme;interim guidance for the economically regulated sectors; anda summary of sector resilience plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.5/5">More recently, the Government set out in the strategic defence and security review their intention to build upon this work and put in place measures significantly to enhance co-operation between government, regulators and industry to improve resilience against all kinds of hazards and threats. In addition, Infrastructure UK within HM Treasury has set out in the national infrastructure plan the Government's intention to move towards the greater co-ordination of programmes to ensure the inherent security and resilience of the national infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.5/6">All sector resilience plans include measures to improve the business continuity planning and management during emergencies by the owners and operators of critical infrastructure, and also rapid response capabilities of local responders.</p>

	<p pid="a.420.5/1">Phonics is an approach to teaching reading and writing that focuses on the relationships between letters and sounds. This is different, for instance, from the whole word approach, or guessing words according to picture clues.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.5/2">Synthetic phonics refers to an approach where children learn to use their knowledge of the relationship between letters and sounds to blend together the individual sounds in words to read them, and the reverse process of segmenting words to spell them. Unlike other approaches, with synthetic phonics phonemes (sounds) associated with particular graphemes (letters) are pronounced in isolation and blended together (synthesised). For example, children are taught to take a single-syllable word such as cat apart into its three letters, pronounce a phoneme for each letter in turn, and blend the phonemes together to form a word.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.5/3">We are committed to strengthening the use of systematic synthetic phonics in the teaching of early reading. The evidence is clear that good synthetic phonics teaching leads children to the next stage-of becoming fluent and confident readers and writers. There is also evidence that synthetic phonics has a major and long-lasting effect on children's reading and spelling attainment.</p>

It will be worth around &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 and will bring together funding for a number of early intervention and preventive services, for example families with multiple problems, and targeted support for young people.</p>

The Defence Reform Unit aims to take forward some of the conclusions of the strategic defence and security review and reform the structure and business practices of the defence organisation. This work will create an organisation that is simpler, more efficient and better able to deal with current and future challenges, as well as significantly reducing the running costs of defence. Over the coming months exactly how this restructuring will impact upon current manning configurations and levels will be set out.</p>

	<p pid="a.423.2/1">The Government currently have no plans to introduce short-term unpaid work.

	<p pid="a.423.2/2">When a Jobcentre Plus adviser refers an individual to mandatory work activity, they will be making an assessment of approach and motivation, not skills and qualifications. The small number of people who are referred to this programme will be selected for participation because they need to develop the skills and discipline associated with full-time employment, for example attending on time and regularly, carrying out specific tasks and working under supervision.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.2/3">Mandatory work activity is one of a range of options available to a Jobcentre Plus personal adviser when they work with an individual to understand what activities might help them move into employment as quickly as possible. Any decision to refer an individual to a specific area of support activity will take into account a wide range of factors including, where appropriate, qualifications.</p>
