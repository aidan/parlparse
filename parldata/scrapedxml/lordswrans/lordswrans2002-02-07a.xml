It found that the benefits to government (for example, in reducing our defence equipment costs) outweigh the costs by a significant margin. The Government broadly agree with its findings, which concluded that, rather than being subsidised, defence exports represented a significant net benefit to the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/2">It reported that defence export sales averaged about &pound;6 billion in 1998 and 1999 and supported almost 100,000 jobs, many of them high quality jobs in cutting-edge industry. It estimated that the ending of defence exports from the UK would involve a one-off adjustment cost of between &pound;4 billion and &pound;5 billion, equivalent to about 0.5 per cent of one year's GDP. In addition there would be a continuous net cost to government of between &pound;90 million and &pound;200 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/3">As I made clear on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-08">8 January</phrase>, the Government's policy of supporting the legitimate efforts made by UK industry to win export orders are primarily based on their contribution to our defence and international security interests. Defence exports help support a strong UK defence industry and contribute to the security of our friends and allies.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.5/1">It is the head of state or government holding the Presidency who decides on the agenda of European Council meetings and writes to colleagues to inform them. This often happens at short notice just before the European Council meets. It is therefore difficult for COREPER to prepare these agenda items in great detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/2">Some of the items on the agenda have been the subject of considerable discussion and negotiation in COREPER and other Council formations and are put to the European Council for attention or for resolution. Other agenda items are for political orientation and do not need extensive preparation or are new initiatives which are given political approval before going to working level for negotiation.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">All products of animal origin imported from third countries into the UK must enter at designated UK border inspection posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary inspections. The inspection services at a BIP are the responsibility of the local authority or port health authority, in the case of Heathrow, the London Borough of Hillingdon. It is their responsibility to deploy appropriate inspection staff at the BIP in response to the volume and nature of the products imported through the BIP. At the Heathrow BIP, there are currently 10 environmental health officers, three official veterinary surgeons and 10 other staff involved in the monitoring of imported meats coming into the UK but these figures will vary.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">London Borough of Hillingdon environmental health officers and H M Customs officers also carry out checks for the presence of illegally imported meat and other animal products in passengers' luggage. in addition, State Veterinary Service staff, who are present at Heathrow to check imported live animals, are also empowered to deal with illegally imported animal products when they are found. No additional resources have been allocated since February 2001 but there has been greater coordination between the authorities at Heathrow in conducting checks and other duties.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.5/1">The red tractor is a private industry-led initiative which is administered by Assured Food Standards. Imported products produced to standards equivalent to those of qualifying British assurance schemes would be eligible to carry the symbol. This is in line with the requirements of EU single market and competition rules. We understand that currently no non-UK products are carrying the symbol.</p>

There are some 1,500 passenger Mark 1 carriages still operating. The number of these to be fitted with cup and cone override protection will depend on how many carriages are withdrawn from service before the end of 2002, and on the Health and Safety Executive's decision on any case for exemption which train operators may make.</p>
