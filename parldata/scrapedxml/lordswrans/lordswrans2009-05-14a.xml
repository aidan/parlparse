The results are widely used by business and are presented along with a set of recommendations aimed at improving the resilience or organisations. They suggest that, in the years since the Civil Contingencies Act was passed in 2004, there has been a modest increase in the proportion of organisations surveyed that have a specific business continuity plan from 47 per cent in 2004 to 52 per cent in 2009. They also suggest however that only 25 per cent of small organisations have business continuity plans; and only 14 per cent were aware of business continuity management guidance provided by their local authority. By comparison 49 per cent of medium and 64 per cent of large organisations had business continuity plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.2/1">We share concerns about England's high rate of teenage pregnancies including among children in care. That is why this Government launched the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy in 1999, following a detailed report by the Social Exclusion Unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/2">Between 1998 and 2007 we have achieved a 10.7 per cent fall in the under-18 conception rate and a 6.4 per cent fall in the under-16 rate, reversing the previous upward trend. Within the overall reduction in teenage conceptions, teenage births have fallen by 23.3 per cent over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/3">Our strategy places a strong focus on targeted interventions with young people at greatest risk of teenage pregnancy, in particular looked-after children and care leavers. Government guidance to local areas on effective local teenage pregnancy strategies highlights the importance of training and support for foster carers in helping them talk to their foster children about sex and relationships. The CWDC's Foster Care Training, Support and Development Standards, which set out the skills which all foster carers are expected to demonstrate, include sexual health promotion.</p>

This includes specific guidance relating to the prevention of teenage pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/5">While girls and young women in care are still far more likely to give birth than those not in care, there has been a welcome recent fall in the number of girls and young women who are mothers in the looked-after population (12 years old and older) from 360 in 2007 to 280 in 2008 (source: SSDA903 return on children looked after).</p>

	<p pid="a.224.2/1">The vast majority of looked after children do not commit offences. However, we recognise that as a group they are more likely to be subject to a final reprimand or warning or convicted of a crime than other children. To support local authorities to prevent looked after children becoming involved in crime, in 2005 the Government funded the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (NACRO) to produce a handbook for local authorities on reducing offending by looked after children with practical examples setting out how authorities might work with partner agencies to minimise the involvement of looked after children in offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/2">To meet the commitments set out in the <I>Care Matters </I>White Paper and the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 we will be revising guidance to local authorities about how they must carry out their responsibilities towards looked after children. This revised guidance will include information about how we would expect looked after children to be supported and cared for to prevent them getting involved in offending, or, where they have committed offences, to minimise any further reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.2/1">Most department websites and the main government website for citizens, direct.gov.uk, are run largely by internal teams that take responsibility for the content and overall management, although technical delivery and hosting is usually outsourced. NHS Choices and businesslink.gov.uk are outsourced, with management of the contracts by the Department for Health and HMRC respectively. The COI website's guidance on costs of websites, applicable from April 2009, contains a detailed list of the components in running websites (appendix B) and departments are free to organise themselves in what they consider to be the most effective and efficient way. No central record is currently available.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.11/1">The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) gives full protection of the law to staff who whistleblow in the public interest and the penalties for those who penalise staff for doing so are potentially very severe. The department has therefore, in light of the Act, made it clear that every National Health Service trust should have in place local policies and procedures that comply with the Act. Decisions on professional registration are made by independent regulatory bodies, not the Government, but we would expect them to make their decisions cognisant of a national context that encourages whistleblowing.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.6/1">Journey sharing has an important role to play in reducing carbon. The effectiveness, of course, depends on the number of people sharing the vehicle. An average car commuter drives 12 miles a day. Cutting that by even half through car sharing would save around 400kg of carbon dioxide in one year&mdash;equivalent to around 170 litres of petrol. Transferring single occupancy car journeys to larger multiple occupancy vehicles, such as coaches, has the potential (depending on vehicle occupancy and vehicle emissions) to make significant further reductions to the emissions for a journey. However, there are no plans to specifically promote coaches above other multi-occupancy modes with regard to journey sharing.</p>
