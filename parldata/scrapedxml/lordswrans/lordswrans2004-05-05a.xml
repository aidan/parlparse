	<p pid="a.117.8/1">The <phrase class="date" code="">8 April</phrase> Ceasefire Agreement provides for a Ceasefire Commission, with a role for the international community. DfID hopes that such a monitoring mechanism will help ensure the protection of civilians and also the effective disbursement of humanitarian assistance. DfID is in close contact with the parties and other members of the international community, including the African Union (AU), to try to help set up such a monitoring mechanism as quickly as possible. The AU chaired a meeting on this matter in Addis Ababa on 19 to <phrase class="date" code="">20 April</phrase>, and we understand that it is currently in consultation with the parties. DfID is in almost daily contact with the government of Sudan and the Darfur groups about the crisis in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.8/2">In order for a meaningful humanitarian response to be conducted, the government of Sudan must allow unfettered access for humanitarian agencies and ensure civilians are protected from attack. Access has improved over the past few weeks, but is still limited. Agencies continue to be frustrated in their attempts to scale up their responses appropriate to the deteriorating context. Security is a real concern, with ongoing attacks on civilians. Capacity to deliver remains stretched. It will be important for humanitarian agencies to pre-position and distribute sufficient relief items across the region before the rainy season begins in earnest in June. This will need to be done in an appropriate manner to ensure adequate and effective protection.</p>

This coincides with the implementation of our proposals on immigration and asylum legal aid announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-27">27 November 2003</phrase> (I refer the noble Lord to the Answer given by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, Lords Hansard col. WA 2). The LSC is not yet in a position to give final figures on contracts from April 2004, as some decisions are subject to appeal, or acceptable audit results. However, provisional figures indicate that there will, overall, be 100 fewer immigration contracts than last year. This reduction is almost entirely due to the fact that the number of asylum seekers has halved and as such reduced the need for legal services. The LSC has also sought to reduce the significant numbers of poor quality solicitors' firms undertaking this work. We are confident that there is sufficient supply to meet current levels of demand for legally aided immigration and asylum advice both nationally and at Lindholme.</p>
