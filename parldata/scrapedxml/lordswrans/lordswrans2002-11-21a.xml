	<p pid="a.8.6/1">The EWS refuelling facility at Stratford had to be moved to make way for the ongoing construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. It was relocated at Temple Mills under the terms of an undertaking given by Viscount Goschen to the Select Committee of this House that considered the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill. The undertaking required the Secretary of State to ensure that land is made available on the Stratford Railway Lands (including Temple Mills) for EWS' refuelling point. The move was financed by Union Railways (North) Ltd, the nominated undertaker for the construction of this part of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The estimated capital cost of moving the refuelling facility is around &pound;1 million; it came into operation at the beginning of July 2001.</p>

This was because it had become clear that part of this land was required for servicing and maintaining Eurostar trains earlier than anticipated. The refuelling facility may not need to be relocated until about 2020, but it will remain on an appropriate site on the Stratford lands including Temple Mills, in accordance with an undertaking given by Viscount Goschen to the Select Committee to this House that considered the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill.

These include an evidence-based briefing for clinicians on the use of stimulant medication (1999) and fact sheets for parents, teachers and young people on attention deficit problems and hyperactivity, both produced by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The Government's main concern is to ensure that practical and effective arrangements are in place to promote rural regeneration rather than to promote a particular delivery vehicle. We consider proposals for the formation of regeneration companies on their merits, as is the case with the proposal for a rural regeneration company to administer the Cumbria Rural Action Zone programme which is currently being considered by the relevant departments.</p>
