	<p pid="a.100.8/1">Autism is a significant area of work in speech and language therapy. It is, however, a specialised area, and as a consequence there are only a limited number of therapists with the highly developed skills required to work effectively with this client group.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.8/2">We need to see further increases in the number of speech and language therapists employed within the National Health Service. The NHS Plan commits the Government to 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals, with 4,450 more therapists and other key professions being trained each year by 2004. We have made good progress in the past two years. However we are currently conducting a labour market analysis in order to inform future education commissioning decisions and this report will be available in the late spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.8/3">An increase in the total number of speech and language therapists working in the National Health Service will have a positive impact in all areas. It will also increase the number of therapists currently able to develop the more specialist skills required with particular client groups such as people with autistic spectrum disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.8/4">The Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) is providing significant levels of financial support for the training and professional development of teachers and other staff working with children with special educational needs (SEN), including those children on the autistic spectrum. Under the Standards Fund 2000-01, DfEE is supporting expenditure of &pound;26 million on SEN training and development--an increase from &pound;21 million in 1999-2000. In 2001-02 DfEE envisages that &pound;30 million of the overall SEN Standards Fund allocation of &pound;82 million will be spent on SEN training.</p>

From the positions of the casualties relative to the wreckage, we cannot be certain where the two crewmen were at impact. It is possible that one of the crewmen was either sitting in the jump seat or standing behind the pilots. The jump seat, which folds up so that a member of the crew may also stand in this position, is in a small gap between the back of the two pilots' seats and the main cabin area, with large cabinets to each side. It takes but one step to move from the main cabin to the folded-seat area.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.2/1">Various categories of overseas tours are recorded on an individual's record of service, and these records are held centrally. However, searches can be made only on one category at a time and no single search would produce all the information relevant to the widest definition of &quot;overseas tour&quot;. To put together such a record would, therefore, entail a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/2">Monitoring deployments at unit level gives a clearer picture of the pattern of deployment and operational commitment within the Army. Some 22 per cent of the trained Army is currently committed to operations; this figure includes units preparing for, deployed on and recovering from operations. Within this, 15 per cent of the trained Army is currently deployed on operations.</p>

The United Kingdom National Central Bureau (NCB) for Interpol, based in the National Criminal Intelligence Service, is responsible for co-ordinating all requests from overseas law enforcement agencies for information on an individual's previous convictions. Subject to receiving proof of identity of the individual seeking disclosure of such information, the NCB will confirm what information about his/her convictions was provided in response to a request from overseas. However, the NCB would not provide information about messages sent relating to another individual with the same name as the enquirer. Although they share the same name, they do not share right of access to information held about each other's previous convictions. All information held on previous convictions is subject to the Data Protection Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.5/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-01">1 July 1999</phrase> this has been a matter for the National Assembly for Wales. The latest farm income figures were published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-04">4 December 2000</phrase> and are available from the Economic Advice Division of the National Assembly for Wales. They showed that average Net Farm Income (NFI) for all full-time farms in Wales was estimated to be &pound;5,700 in 1999-2000. NFI is a measure of the economic return to these with an entreprenurial interest in the farm. It incorporates allowances for depreciation and for rent (on a notional basis if the farmer is an owner-occupier). Cash income for 1999-2000 was estimated to be &pound;20,500. The index of NFI at current prices for all full-time farms in Wales shows a decline of 57 per cent between 1997-98 and 1999-2000. The equivalent decline for cash income is 6 per cent.</p>
