	<p pid="a.5.9/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that disabled people are given the support they need to get a job and remain in employment. We will continue to review our programmes to ensure that the support they provide remains appropriate, effective and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.9/2">Recent changes to the Access to Work programme are designed to improve take up among under-represented groups, including people working for small employers, people with mental health conditions and people with learning difficulties. These changes included:</p>
	<p pid="a.5.9/3">asking larger employers to make a more substantial contribution towards aids or equipment to help their disabled workers, freeing up resources so that smaller employers pay less and any contribution by microemployers and the self-employed is waived;developing an even more personalised package of support with an individual development plan to help customers overcome their particular difficulties; more frequent reviews; and more intensive discussion about building independence and self-reliance; andextending support for job coaches, which is likely to help in particular people with learning disabilities, enabling support for longer periods and at different points as they settle into their new job.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.9/4">Following representations, guidance was also changed to make it clear that elected councillors who were disabled could be eligible for support from Access to Work.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.9/5">Access to Work guidance has for many years specified that funding cannot be provided for standard equipment that an employer would need to provide for any employee. We have in the past allowed Access to Work advisers to form local judgments about what should be regarded as standard equipment, and this has led to inconsistent decisions. A revised list of equipment has therefore been included in the Access to Work guidance in order to assist advisers in making operational decisions on each case under consideration for funding and ensure consistency across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.9/6">The coalition agreement set out our commitment to Access to Work, including plans to reform the programme so that disabled people can apply for jobs with funding already secured for any adaptations and equipment they will need. The Minister for Disabled People will make an announcement about this shortly.</p>

However, a number of respondents expressed views on this issue. Responses have now been published on the Treasury website.

	<p pid="a.14.3/1">Statutory lifetime tenure for social housing was introduced in 1981. Times have changed, and it is no longer right that central government should require every social tenancy to be for life, regardless of the particular local circumstances. The system must be more flexible-so that this scarce public resource can be focused on those who need it most, for as long as they need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.3/2">We believe it is right to provide for a minimum fixed-term for local authority flexible tenancies in primary legislation and that this period should be significantly longer than the minimum six months provided by an assured shorthold tenancy in the private sector. We therefore intend to provide that the minimum fixed term will be at least two years. We do not intend to set a maximum fixed term-landlords would be free to set a fixed term of 10 years, 20 years or longer, depending on local circumstances and local policies.</p>

Negotiations to agree the terms of repayment are ongoing.
