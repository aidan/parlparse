	<p pid="a.307.8/1">The strategic defence and security review assessed that over the next five years the over-riding priority is operations in Afghanistan. Retaining Tornado over Harrier allows a fast jet contribution to be sustained there while also supporting concurrent operations. This would not have been possible with Harrier.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.8/2">After 2015 Harriers-whether they were operating from HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;, or at the end of the decade from HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; or HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;-would provide only a very limited coercive capability. We judge it unlikely that this would be sufficiently useful in the latter half of the decade to be a cost effective use of resources as we reduce the variety of aircraft types and hence costs. Furthermore, we neither have over-flight restrictions where our forces are likely to operate nor foresee any in the next 10 years. Therefore, we assume we will need current strike capability around 2020. However, this will be reviewed as part of the next strategic defence and security review in 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.309.0/1">The decision to resume enforced returns of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe reflects the improved situation on the ground in Zimbabwe since the formation of the Inclusive Government in 2009 and the fact that the courts have found that not all Zimbabweans are in need of international protection. It will end the anomaly of failed asylum seekers from Zimbabwe being treated differently from those of all other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/2">The decision does not reflect any change in our categorical opposition to human rights abuses in Zimbabwe. We will continue to call, both bilaterally and with our international partners, for an end to all such abuses and the restoration of internationally accepted human rights standards in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/3">EU member states will shortly begin discussions on the EU Measures, which are due for renewal in February. The recent decision to resume the enforced return of those not in need of international protection is not of direct relevance to these discussions. There is no inconsistency in saying that a small, corrupt elite implicated in human rights abuses cannot benefit from travelling to EU countries, and in returning to their country of origin Zimbabweans who are here illegally. We return failed asylum seekers to all other countries that are under EU or UN restrictive measures or sanctions.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.8/1">The Government are disappointed with the outcome of the recent votes in the European Parliament on increasing maternity pay. The Government's impact assessment suggests that providing 20 weeks of fully paid maternity leave would cost the UK approximately &#163;2 billion per annum, while providing little benefit since 92 per cent of pregnant women in the UK already take at least 20 weeks leave. The proposals would be socially regressive since higher earners would gain the greatest benefits. These votes are not the end of the process, and the UK will continue to work to oppose the imposition of a requirement for fully paid maternity leave when the directive comes before the European Council of Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.323.5/1">As a major provider of aid, the EU is critical to achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs). We will work with others to ensure that EU institutions and EU member states continue to focus their efforts on achieving the MDGs. As part of the multilateral aid review, we are currently conducting a wide-ranging review of our support through EU institutions to improve the impact of aid and achieve greater value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.5/2">The UK Government also work with the European Commission to make sure that its MDG initiative, which has been announced by President Barroso in New York, will accelerate progress towards the MDGs. The Commission has offered up to &#8364;1 billion from the current European Development Fund for this initiative. We will work to ensure that the Commission focuses these funds on the most off-track MDGs and demonstrates a clear focus on results. In addition, together with the Commission, the UK Government will keep encouraging other member states to meet the EU aid target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.3/1">Capita, who pay pensions on behalf of the Civil Service pension scheme, became aware that they were missing Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) information or were receiving notification later than expected. It raised the issue with Cabinet Office, which then contacted HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) to compare GMP details for all pension scheme members, before informing other public sector pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.3/2">The National Audit Office agrees with the HMRC and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) view (from work undertaken in 2009) that there is no single cause for the overpayments. Responsibility for the overpayments is shared between the public sector pension schemes and their scheme administrators, HMRC and DWP. All parties are working collaboratively and in partnership to put in place robust processes designed to ensure that this problem does not occur again in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.333.8/1">Section 7 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 requires birds listed on Schedule 4 to the Act to be registered and marked if kept in captivity. It is not a sales control. Following public consultation in 2006, Schedule 4 to the Act was amended with changes coming into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase>. The number of bird species on this schedule was reduced from 59 to nine.</p>
	<p pid="a.333.8/2">Of the original 59 bird species on Schedule 4, none was owls. Owls were not included on Schedule 4 because their conservation status was not considered at risk from unlawful taking from the wild and there would therefore be little benefit in registering owls held in captivity.</p>

	<p pid="a.336.5/1">Later in the year, the Home Office will publish the draft freedom Bill (exact title to be confirmed). Ideas posted on Your Freedom will be used to inform the drafting process.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.5/2">The Government have always made it clear that they will not publish responses to every idea posted on the Your Freedom website but have committed to give due consideration to each one. This process is on-going.</p>

	<p pid="a.337.0/1">Staff from around 30 government departments and non-departmental public bodies have been involved in considering the ideas submitted to the Your Freedom project. In most cases this work has been carried out as part of their wider roles. Information on the numbers of staff and costs incurred by these departments is not held centrally and could be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.338.2/1">Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) involvement in the Inclusive Government has played a significant role in the improvements in Zimbabwe since February 2009, particularly the revival of the economy and the resumption of basic services.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/2">The UK Government have acknowledged the impressive performance of Finance Minister Tendai Biti in securing macro-economic stability and curbing inflation thus increasing the availability of goods, revenue and employment and leading the country to economic growth for the first time since 1997. MDC Ministers have also played a crucial role in reinvigorating the education and health sectors, getting schools, universities and hospitals working again, thus greatly improving the humanitarian situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/3">Persistent intransigence from hardliners continues to hamper reform, particularly in the judicial and security sectors. However, in the absence of a roadmap to credible and properly monitored elections, the Inclusive Government continue to offer the only credible means of transforming Zimbabwe and delivering basic services to its people.</p>
