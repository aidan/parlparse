	<p pid="a.25.2/1">We share your concern about the impact of poverty and illiteracy on women in Afghanistan and regularly work closely with the various ministries within the Afghan Government on tackling these issues. We also recognise that while progress has been made to advance the status of women since 2001, much remains to be done. The UK therefore actively supports the promotion of women's rights in Afghanistan in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/2">In 2007-08 we provided &pound;55 million to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund to help finance the salaries of over 100,000 teachers. These resources have contributed to the increase of pupils in school from 2 million in 2002 to around 6 million enrolled today. A third of the pupils in school are now girls, up from virtually none under the Taliban. This has helped to address the problem of widespread illiteracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/3">The UK gave the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission $l million to fund its three-year action plan 2006-08. This Afghan-led and run organisation has around 600 staff and has offices throughout Afghanistan. In its 2007 annual report, the commission states that it organised nearly 600 educational workshops and awareness-raising meetings for almost 20,000 people (including over 6,000 men) on women's rights issues, including tackling violence against women. The commission pays particular attention to reaching community leaders such as mullahs, elders, civil-society representatives and government officials.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.5/1">In the light of Russia's military actions in Georgia and the situation on the ground at the time, it was not felt appropriate for British Army musicians to attend. The decision to cancel the participation of pipers from the Royal Gurkha Rifles and the Irish Guards in the Kremlin Zoria Military Tattoo was taken in consultation with the Ministry of Defence. The UK took into account the approach adopted by other countries sending pipers who were serving military officers. Several countries, including Canada, also withdrew their pipers. Our decision to withdraw was consistent with our wider policy on military-to-military co-operation with Russia, including withdrawal from a joint naval exercise due to take place around that time.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/1">Table 1 below shows the number of public law care and supervision applications under Section 31 of the Children Act 1989. A total of 6,200 applications were made from May to September 2007, and a total of 4,800 applications were made from May to September 2008. A drop in the number of applications was expected as revised statutory guidance for local authorities and a new practice direction, the <I>Public Law Outline</I>, were introduced across England and Wales from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/2">Table 2 below shows the number of public law care and supervision applications under Section 31 of the Children Act 1989.

	<p pid="a.26.5/3">There is no evidence that the decrease in the number of care applications is attributable to increased court fees. It is probable that the decrease has been caused by recent reforms to the care proceedings system. The <I>Public Law Outline</I> and revised statutory guidance issued to local authorities encourage early resolution and exploration of alternatives to care proceedings, where safe and appropriate to do so. A similar pattern of decline in the number of care and supervision applications was also noted when the public law protocol was issued in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/26" class="indent">Notes for table 1 and 2:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/27" class="indent">(1) Historically, there have been data-quality issues with figures for the Family Proceedings Courts, which were likely to be an undercount prior to April 2007. A new method of data collection was introduced in April 2007 which has improved the coverage and completeness of data. Any comparison with figures prior to April 2007 may be affected by the improved data recording.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/28" class="indent">(2) Figures relate to the number of children subject to each application. For example, an application relating to two children will be counted twice.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/29" class="indent">Figures have been rounded.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/30" class="indent">(3) The figures taken from the FamilyMan system are as at October 2008. Because the data are only downloaded on to the central system once a month, these will only include applications made up to the end of September 2008. The 2008 figures are provisional subject to future updates. September figures for FPCs do not include two courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/31" class="indent">(4) County Court figures exclude cases recorded on FamilyMan as transfers from other courts. Research undertaken on behalf of the Ministry of Justice has identified that some cases that have transferred from the Family Proceedings Court to the county court have been incorrectly recorded as new applications in the county court, thus inflating the number of new applications (see Masson et al, 2008).</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/2">We recognise the improvements that have been made to nuclear safety at Ignalina to allow short-term continued electricity generation until 2009, financed through the EU TACIS programme and the UK's Nuclear Safety Programme. The UK also contributed to the Ignalina International Decommissioning Support Fund&mdash;managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&mdash;and delivered a separate UK programme to address the social and economic consequences of nuclear power plant closure. While the agreed timing of the closure of the two reactors at Ignalina was part of a package of pre-EU accession treaty considerations agreed by the Government of Lithuania, we support the view of the EU Commission and other member states that Lithuania should stand by this obligation, freely entered into. However, we also believe that the EU should look sympathetically at the options for mitigating the short-term consequences of closure. The energy security concerns of Lithuania and the other Baltic states would be most appropriately addressed by a combination of an increased focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency and by increased interconnection with the rest of the European Union. We anticipate that the European Commission's upcoming second strategic EU energy review will include proposals on how to help to address the energy isolation of Lithuania and the other Baltic states.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.0/1">The Government have not responded to the reports that Lord Hylton mentions. However, the FCO is in the process of studying them. The UK raised the issue of discrimination against Dalits at the last EU-India Human Rights Dialogue and will continue to raise it on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-15">15 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/2">We frequently raise concerns about minority rights including recently with the Indian Government through the EU presidency. India is one of the priority countries for the FCO Human Rights and Democracy Programme. We support projects locally aimed at addressing the structural causes of discrimination against women, ethnic and national minorities and disabled people (and their participation in public and political life).</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/3">The FCO has met different organisations that promote the rights of Dalits and has undertaken to support their request to the UN Human Rights Council to publish the special rapporteurs' report on discrimination based on work and descent.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.5/1">The UK continues to offer its political support for Nigerian-led initiatives to address the conflict in the Niger Delta. Solutions to the delta must include an inclusive peace process which respects the rights and interests of all stakeholders, improvements to the security situation in the short term, and commitment by federal and state Governments to improve governance and the livelihoods of local populations. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister made clear to President Yar'Adua when he visited the UK in July that we stood ready to support the Nigerian Government in their peace initiatives. My honourable friend Malcolm Wicks, Minister of State at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and I reiterated UK support during our visits to Nigeria in August and September respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.5/2">The Government fund a number of projects to promote development and participatory governance in Nigeria and specifically in the delta. As agreed with President Yar'Adua during his visit, the Government have offered training and advisory support to help improve Nigerian military capability to provide security for the people of the delta. The Government are the biggest supporter of the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI). We work with international partners to promote the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Initiative in Nigeria and to support the Gulf of Guinea Energy Security Strategy, a Nigerian-led forum for discussion on how to address security and sustainable development in the delta. The UK actively encourages the Nigerian Government to work closely with international oil companies to find a mutually acceptable timeframe for ending the practice of gas flaring, one of the main causes of environmental degradation in the delta region. The UK funds research into oil-fingerprinting in response to a Nigerian request for international assistance to combat oil bunkering.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.6/1">Some 97 per cent of post offices are privately owned and operated so the Government can never introduce an absolute moratorium on post office closures. However the Government's funding package for the post office network, announced in May 2007, includes provision for a subsidy of up to &pound;150 million a year to 2011 to support the social network of non-commercial offices. The Government's funding package and Post Office Ltd's business case are both based on the network, after the present Network Change programme, being sustained at around 11,500 outlets to 2011. The Government continue to view such a network as necessary to provide an appropriate level of national coverage and have no plans for a further closure programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.8/1">The requirement for fitment of spark guards is part of the specification in the Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI) for freight wagon rolling stock where the floor of the wagon cannot offer an equivalent level of protection. The TSI is currently under revision and both UK and railway-sector representatives on the TSI drafting group will have the opportunity to argue for the disaggregation of the requirement for spark guards from wagons that use composite brake blocks. If such a revision is not supported by other European railways, the revised TSI could be drafted to include a specific case for the UK to provide for an ongoing alternative national requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.8/2">Until the TSI is revised, individual vehicle projects can apply for derogation from the requirements of the TSI through a process set out in the directives on interoperability, as transposed in the current Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2006.

	<p pid="a.52.6/1">Following the report of the Mubarek inquiry the Prison Service considered whether there was sufficient evidence to bring disciplinary action against any of the 38 staff still employed directly or indirectly by the service identified by the report as having been involved in the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Zahid Mubarek. Of those 38 staff, 27 worked at HM young offender institution Feltham at the time of his death and eight currently work there.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.6/2">In response to the death of Zahid Mubarek, a national cell sharing risk assessment (CSRA) tool was introduced across the prison estate in June 2002. A violence reduction strategy was introduced in 2004 which is designed to be nationally and locally responsive to any new issues that arise. A revised version, issued in June 2007, incorporates recommendations from the inquiry into the death of Zahid Mubarek, analysis of practice and feedback from consultation with violence reduction co-ordinators (VRCs). The CSRA tool is used in all closed prisons, including Feltham and all other young offender institutions, to assess the risk a prisoner might pose to another prisoner in shared accommodation. The assessment is based on the information that accompanies the prisoner and through a prisoner interview; this includes any known history of violence which is seen as the strongest indicator of potential future violence. An initial assessment takes place on reception, before a prisoner spends their first night in custody.</p>
