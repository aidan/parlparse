	<p pid="b.19.2/1">The structure and content of the aircraft carrier alliance integrated team is dependent on the stage of the project, the skills required and the resources available from the alliance participants. Around 40 companies have also, at differing times, been involved in supplying personnel into the project team. In terms of the industrial alliance participants, currently BAe Systems provides around 60 to 65 core personnel, Thales UK around 40 to 45 core personnel, and KBR UK around 15 to 20 personnel. The numbers and distribution between alliance participants will evolve and change over the life of the project. The team is currently located across three sites in the Bristol area.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/2">Membership of the Alliance Management Board (AMB) currently consists of: the MoD's CVF IPT Leader; the managing director BAe Systems CVF; the managing director Thales Naval Ltd; and the director KBR Maritime Operations.

	<p pid="b.22.9/1">Obligations imposed upon the United Kingdom by international humanitarian law are covered within Her Majesty's Armed Forces through instruction and training in the Law of Armed Conflict (LoAC). All new entrants to the Armed Forces, of all ranks, receive training on LoAC during initial training and specialist training courses. Such training has been delivered throughout the past four years. On entry into productive service Army and Royal Marines personnel renew this training annually as part of their individual training directives.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.9/2">Prior to deployment to an operational theatre, all personnel receive pre-deployment training (PDT), either collectively or as individuals. Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel receive specific training on LoAC during PDT as, unlike their Army and Royal Marine counterparts, they do not receive such training on an annual basis. All personnel receive an additional theatre-specific operational law brief and cultural awareness training as part of PDT.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.9/3">In addition, officers receive enhanced packages during their career development and through attendance at the Joint Services Command and Staff College, where they receive education on the analysis of international law, the role of ethics and their impact on military operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.9/4">International human rights law is not taught as a subject in its own right to service personnel. However, all service personnel are subject to their respective service disciplinary codes and will be dealt with by their commanding officers or (depending on the gravity of the offences) by courts martial for breaches overseas of service discipline or the commission of criminal law offences contrary to the law of England and Wales. The object of service disciplinary law has always been to maintain discipline within the Armed Forces and thereby both to guarantee respect from the local population overseas for the behaviour of service personnel and to help maintain operational effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.9/5">Service personnel receive annual common core skills training, part of which relates to live armed guarding duties in peacetime within the United Kingdom. The law of self-defence is an essential part of that training and seeks to impart the basic principle that only reasonable and proportionate force may be used where a necessity of defence arises. The teaching, which is given partly by video and partly by instructors, is in line with Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 and supporting case law. Section 3 comprises the basis for the use of force in most peace-keeping operations conducted by HM forces overseas.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.2/1">No substantive change will be made, only a typographical correction.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.2/2">The amendment regulations were made to correct some errors in the Recreational Craft Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/1464); those regulations continue the implementation of Directive 94/25/EC on recreational craft and transpose the amending Directive 2003/44/EC. At the same time as correcting other more significant errors in those regulations, it was decided also to amend the incorrect references to Annexe I, which should have been written using Roman numeral &quot;I&quot; (to properly reflect the directives) instead of the Arabic numeral &quot;1&quot; which was used in the Recreational Craft Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/1464). Accordingly, Regulation 2(c) does not affect the intent of the principal regulations in any material way.</p>

They act in a quasi-judicial capacity and, under the supervision of the Council of Tribunals, they act as single person tribunals when conducting public inquiries on licence applications or an existing licence holder's fitness to hold a licence.
