	<p pid="a.40.0/1">&quot;Catholic&quot; students means students who are baptised Roman Catholics.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/2">&quot;Catholic&quot; sixth-form education means general sixth-form education offered by an institution, directed by Catholic leadership, underpinned by an understanding of Catholic values shared by all teaching staff and governors and where Catholic religious education and pastoral support are available to all students.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/3">The&quot;Catholic character&quot; of a sixth-form college manifests itself differently to some extent in each institution but all colleges have in common Catholic leadership through the principal and foundation governor representatives on the governing body as well as an understanding of Catholic values shared by teaching staff and members of the senior management team.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/4">The term&quot;religious ethos&quot; is the legislative term used in the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations and is to be understood in the context of that legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/5">The&quot;religious character&quot; of an institution describes its religious ethos and mission.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/6">It is not necessary to be a professing Catholic in order to benefit from being educated in a Catholic sixth-form college. Many students at Catholic sixth-form colleges are not baptised or practising Catholics but have chosen to attend the colleges to benefit from the opportunities for educational and spiritual development and pastoral support that they offer. The institutions also benefit from the diversity of having students of other faiths and none.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/7">The department allocates funds to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) for provision in the post-16 learning and skills sector. The department does not provide a specific budget to the LSC for Catholic sixth-form colleges. It is for the LSC to determine the right level of investment in sixth-form colleges to meet the needs of learners. Mark Haysom, the council's chief executive, will write to the noble Lord providing details of the public funding of Catholic sixth-form colleges and a copy of his letter will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/8">The Government do not, and do not intend to, treat the Catholic faith and Catholic institutions differently from other religious or belief institutions. The proposed regulations, which are yet to be laid, are specifically drafted to permit only those institutions listed in a schedule to give preference in their admissions in respect of non-vocational provision to persons of a particular religion or belief in order to preserve that institutions's religious ethos. The amendment is not specific to any religion or belief and the schedule lists Catholic sixth-form colleges because they are the only religion or belief-based institutions incorporated into the further education sector. We have no plans to incorporate any further religion or belief-based institutions into the further education sector. Nothing in the regulations allows an institution to discriminate otherwise against a person of a particular religion or belief.</p>

The Veterans Agency decided, taking account of all the evidence before it, that a reasonable doubt was not raised that disablement was caused by service and the claim was not accepted. On appeal, the Pensions Appeal Tribunal disagreed, finding that a reasonable doubt was raised. The Ministry of Defence has accepted this decision and an award has now been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.0/1">(a) The average marginal rate on both individual and employers contributions is estimated to have been around 30 per cent in 2002&ndash;03. If there were no changes in contributions or behaviour this would be a tax neutral single rate compared with the current system. (b) Assuming the current rate of contributions and again no change in behaviour a 1 per cent reduction in a single rate of relief would reduce the current annual cost of tax relief by around half a billion pounds. (c) Around 2.5 million higher rate taxpayers would see the relief on their contributions reduced compared with now, which would also include a new tax charge on those with employer contributions, and around 13 million non-higher rate taxpayers would see their rate of relief on their contributions increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/2">However, introducing a single rate of relief would not necessarily result in increased pension savings. There could be significant behavioural changes by individual pension contributors, employers and pension schemes. This is particularly likely for defined benefit schemes where the current net pay arrangements deliver relief at the individual's marginal rate of income tax and where employer contributions are typically made to satisfy the overall funding of the scheme rather than being attributable to particular individuals. Given the uncertain direction of these behavioural effects on contributions, it is unlikely that the figures given above would be realised.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.8/1">Information is not held centrally on all public sector occupational pension arrangements. The design of pension schemes is largely a matter for public service employers, who have differing needs. However, the main multi-employer schemes covering public service occupations for teachers, the NHS, Civil Service and local government, police and fire services all offer defined benefit pensions to eligible employees. There are over 4 million active members of these major public service schemes, but this number does not include employers in the wider public sector like the Bank of England, BBC or Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/2">Public service schemes are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are a cost effective part of the overall remuneration package. Modernisation of pension arrangements may mean that a scheme or section of a scheme, closes to new members as a new scheme or section replaces it. In October 2002 the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme opened a new section giving all new civil servants the choice of a defined benefit or defined contribution pension. Similar closures of schemes or sections may result from the pension scheme reviews of benefit structure to reflect, among other things, the decisions announced in the Green Paper Action on Occupational Pensions (Cmnd <phrase class="date" code="">5835 June 2003</phrase>) to raise the normal pension age of public servants.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/1">Whole economy average earnings growth has remained well within sustainable limits over the past two years, responding flexibly to global developments and supporting UK employment. The decline in the 12-month rate of earnings growth between October and November 2003 reflects private sector bonus effects and timing effects in the award of public sector settlements. Nevertheless, earnings growth in the three months to November remained above rates recorded for most of the year. Macro-economic stability based on low and stable inflation, low interest rates and high employment supports consumers' ability to meet the costs of borrowing.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.5/1">We welcome the publication by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) of its Financial Risk Outlook for 2004. As the outlook explains, it highlights economic, financial, political and social developments that affect its ability to meet their statutory objectives. It puts its regulatory work in context by explaining the risks it is responding to. The FSA publishes the document to increase awareness of these risks and understanding of its actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.5/2">The outlook refers to seven separate priorities, including challenges to the life insurance industry, reform of retail regulation, other reforms, the threat from terrorism, financial crime, and consumers' inadequate understanding of financial concepts and issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.5/3">The Government have long recognised the challenges consumers face. That it is why the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 gave the FSA statutory objectives to promote public understanding of the financial system and secure the appropriate degree of protection for consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.5/4">The Government are responding to those challenges through a comprehensive strategy that embraces the establishment of a suite of simplified products, by work across government to improve access and understanding, through supporting the regulatory work of the FSA, and by taking part in the work of the Financial Capability Steering Group.</p>

Following the recommendations of this review, my right honourable friend asked Dean Tyson from the London Business School to examine how companies might recruit directors from more diverse backgrounds in order to improve board effectiveness. Both these reports made a number of proposals which boards must consider how to apply in practice.</p>
