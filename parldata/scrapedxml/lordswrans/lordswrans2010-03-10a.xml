	<p pid="a.61.2/1">The American Academy of Environmental Medicine published a position paper on genetically modified foods in May 2009 and its conclusion is reported to be based on six peer-reviewed publications. Five of these have been considered by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes and other regulatory bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority, which have advised that they do not provide evidence of harm following the consumption of genetically modified foods. The sixth paper concludes that an insecticide that is widely used in commercial genetically modified crops had no adverse effects on the immune system of rats.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.5/1">There is strong public interest in the publication of high-quality research into genetically modified (GM) crops and food. The availability of authentic test materials and corresponding control materials are among the prerequisites for such research to take place. Companies may choose to impose conditions on the use of their GM seeds, but we believe it is in their interests to allow the scientific community to conduct independent research into these products. The relevant EU legislation already provides for all of the information contained in applications to market GM food or feed products to be made publicly available, where it relates to the potential effects on human health, animal health and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">The Government support open publication of scientific data as it allows interested parties to review the findings and the conclusions that have been drawn by the researchers. Researchers claiming to demonstrate the presence or absence of risks with GM products should be equally able to publish and discuss their results without fear of intimidation.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.2/2">Net lending to businesses in the UK declined in 2009 in percentage terms at a similar rate to the 1990s recession. Similar trends have also been seen in the US, the euro area and Japan. The subdued level of lending over the past year reflects a number of factors. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/3">a reappraisal of risk by lenders, investors and borrowers following the crisis;uncertainty about the prospects for the economy;financial institutions restructuring to deliver higher capital levels and more conservative loan exposures;larger businesses turning to reviving corporate bond and equity markets as an alternative source of external finance; andbusinesses restructuring and paying off debt during the recession.</p>
