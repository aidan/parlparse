	<p pid="a.43.1/2" qnum="HL33">Why, when Article 12 of the Cotonou agreement provides for the consultation whenever the interests of African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries are affected, there was no prior consultation in the case of the proposal from the European Union Trade Commissioner, Mr Lamy, to grant duty free and quota free access to all products from the least developed countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.2/1">The Cotonou agreement contains a commitment to extend duty free and quota free access to least developed countries (LDCs). The Lamy proposal, to grant duty free and quota free access to all products except arms from LDCs, with a transition period for sugar, rice and bananas, is the Commission's response to this commitment. The Commission informed the ACP Secretariat of its proposal shortly after it informed member states, as it is required to do under the Cotonou agreement. Consultations are under way between the Commission, the ACP countries and member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.5/1">The formal position is that the Council is one body, which comes together in different configurations to discuss specific proposals. In the case of the UK, it is standard practice that negotiators consult all interested departments before taking a position in Brussels. Ministers have already made the point that the proposals on reform of the sugar regime and the &quot;Everything But Arms&quot; (EBA) proposal need to be considered in relation to each other and have pressed for the impact of the EBA proposal to be discussed in the context of the reform proposals in the Agriculture Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.5/1">This afternoon we are publishing a framework of a new system to handle complaints made against police officers. There are some areas which require further work and we are inviting views on these so that they can be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/2">It was last May that the Government published a consultation document which was based on reports of two separate studies. The first study was commissioned from the management consultants KPMG in order to take forward recommendations made by the Home Affairs Select Committee in its report on the police disciplinary and complaints procedures and by Sir William Macpherson's report of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry. The second study was by the human rights organisation Liberty.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/3">The outcome of the consultation is that the Government propose to set up a new body to handle complaints; it will be called the independent police complaints commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/4">My honourable friend the Minister of State for the department, Mr Charles Clarke, previously indicated his sympathy for the principle of an independent system for investigating complaints against the police and we are pleased to announce that a key element of the new system will be the independent investigations of the more serious complaints. Two other key elements of the new system will be easier accessibility to the system for complainants and more openness in dealing with complainants.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/5">We are very grateful to all those who took part in the consultation; in particular, the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), which has called repeatedly for reforms so that it could increase its effectiveness and independence. The PCA's response pointed the way towards independent investigations, easier accessibility and more openness.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.8/1">We are pleased to announce that, on the advice of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, Her Majesty the Queen has commanded that city status should be granted to Brighton &amp; Hove, Inverness and Wolverhampton to mark the Millennium.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/2">Although the grant of the honour remains a rare mark of distinction, the Queen accepted the Prime Minister's recommendation to grant city status to more than one town to commemorate the Millennium. City status will be granted by Letters Patent, which will now be prepared for presentation to Brighton &amp; Hove, Inverness and Wolverhampton in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/3">The unsuccessful applicants will, of course, be disappointed not to have been honoured on this occasion. The quality of the 39 applications received was very high, however, and demonstrated the pride in their communities felt by local people in towns across the United Kingdom. They will all have an opportunity for their applications to be considered again for the grant of city status to mark Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee in 2002. The Queen has agreed to the Prime Minister's recommendation that her Jubilee should be marked, exceptionally, by grants of city status to a suitably qualified town in each of Wales, Northern Ireland, England and Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.8/4">My officials will now initiate a review of the procedures used in the Millennium competition. Further details of the Golden Jubilee competition will be announced during the first half of next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, wrote in the House Magazine on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-11">11 December</phrase> that Xthe Order Paper is unclear, the visibility of the House is poor and the audibility of the speeches in the Chamber is worse. In this audio/visual age it is surely not beyond the wit of man to provide for our fellow citizens a gallery which enables them to see, hear and understand what is going on in their name in the Chamber before them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">The Order Paper can certainly be difficult to understand for those unfamiliar with it. Every visitor to the Public Gallery receives an illustrated Guide for Visitors to the Galleries, which includes, among other things, an explanation of what the different items on the Order Paper mean. For the visually impaired, two Braille versions of the Guide are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">I accept that in certain parts of the public gallery there is a restricted view of the Chamber. That is why there are two television monitors in the Gallery. One of the monitors shows the current business, while the other is tuned to the Lords' annunciator and records the business before the House and the name of the speaker in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/4">On the question of audibility, a speaker system identical to the one used in the Chamber has been fitted to every bench in the Gallery and there is an induction loop for the hard of hearing.</p>
