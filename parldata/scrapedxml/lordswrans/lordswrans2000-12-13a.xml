	<p pid="a.18.2/1">The Continence Foundation urged the Government to apply a reduced rate of 5 per cent VAT to incontinence products, pointing out that some people may find it is difficult to buy incontinence products at the zero rate. The Government have made clear that they do not consider that adding VAT at the 5 per cent rate to incontinence products is the right way to solve this problem and have asked Customs and Excise to explore other ways to help individuals to buy these products at the zero rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.5/1">The new format is being introduced this Session, using new computer software which has had to be developed. The change will be staged to allow everyone involved to become accustomed to working in the new format and to minimise the risk of disruption should there turn out to be flaws in the software.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/2">For the time being, Bills will continue to be introduced in the old format, apart from any Bill originating from the Tax Law Rewrite. Each Bill will be published in the new format in the second House, once it has completed its passage through the first.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/3">So, Bills introduced in this House will be in the old format during their stages in this House; but Bills brought from the other place will be in the new format throughout our consideration of them. Similarly, the other place will deal with Bills introduced there in the old format but deal with Bills brought from this House in the new format.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/4">All Acts passed after <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase> will be in the new format.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/5">When we are fully confident that the new format and software are problem-free, it will be used for all Bills at all stages.</p>
