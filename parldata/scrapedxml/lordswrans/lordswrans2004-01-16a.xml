	<p pid="a.106.5/2">The assessment system examines family and personal relationships and whether any incidence of bereavement or loss continues to have an impact on the young offender's life. If bereavement is identified as a risk factor, then bereavement counselling can be offered as part of any overall programme to address the young person's offending behaviour and risk factors. No resources are provided specifically for bereavement counselling but it would form part of the menu of interventions that youth offending teams currently offer those young offenders with the identified need.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.2/1">Ministers have yet to make their final decisions on the reform of the death certification and coroner system. I anticipate that a paper will be published early this year that will set out the Government's position based on consideration of all the recent reports. The experiences of bereaved families when coming into contact with the coroner service were looked at in detail as part of the fundamental review 2003 and as part of the work of the Shipman inquiry. Any changes will take into account the requirements and expectations of different faith groups and communities, as discussed in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-24">24 January 2001</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.5/1">The Priorities and Planning Framework for 2003&ndash;06 includes targets for reducing coronary heart disease. One of these targets requires practice-based registers (for patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes) and systematic treatment regimes, including appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking. This also covers the majority of patients at high risk of coronary heart disease, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.5/2">Under the new General Medical Services contract, from April 2004, practices will be required to offer relevant health promotion advice to their patients, as appropriate, together with any treatment that may be necessary. The new contract will also allow practice staff more time to deliver high quality primary care, including more preventative interventions, and to improve the health of the practice populations. Under the Quality and Outcomes Framework, practices are incentivised to provide ongoing management of patients with diabetes, including those whose notes record BMI in the previous 15 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.5/3">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), collaborating with the Health Development Agency, have been tasked by the Department of Health to develop guidance on the prevention and management of obesity. NICE guidance is already available on prescribing drugs (Orlistat and Sibutramine), treatment with which should be supported by specific advice, support and counselling on diet, physical activity and behavioural strategy, and surgery.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.5/4">New action by the Department of Health will develop more cohesive support for health professionals to develop capacity for prevention and management of obesity in primary care. Working with the primary care sector we are looking to develop practical ways of enhancing evidence-based prevention in primary care.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/2" qnum="HL345">Whether, when an on-shore wind farm is constructed on mountain, moor, heath or downland, the area it covers remains open access; and whether it is legally possible for on-shore wind farms to be constructed on common land.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">Schedule 1, Part 1(2) to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides that land covered by buildings or the curtilage of such land is excepted from the new statutory right of access regardless of whether the land appears on a conclusive map of open country and registered common land. We consider that wind turbines would qualify as &quot;buildings&quot; for the purposes of the Act. Whether the entire wind farm would be excepted from the right of access would depend on whether it all formed the curtilage of the land covered by the wind turbines: this would turn on the facts of each case and ultimately would be for the courts to decide, if called upon, rather than Defra.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">Schedule 1, Part 1(8) to the Act provides that land covered by works that are used for the purposes of a statutory undertaking, or the curtilage of any such land is also excepted from the right of access. To satisfy these criteria the operator of the wind farm would need to hold a licence under Section 6(1) of the Electricity Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/3">On-shore wind farms may be constructed on common land under the provisions of Section 194 of the Law of Property Act 1925. This requires works that prevent or impede access to land that was, on <phrase class="date" code="1926-01-01">1 January 1926</phrase>, subject to rights of common, to be approved by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Alternatively there are other legislative provisions, for example Section 147 of the Inclosure Act 1845 and Section 19 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 which may enable wind farms to be constructed.</p>
