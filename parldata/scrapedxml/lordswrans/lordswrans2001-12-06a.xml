	<p pid="a.151.2/1">The Government believe that prison is right for dangerous, serious and some persistent offenders and that sentences should be as long as necessary for punishment and public protection, but no longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/2">Home detention curfew plays an important role by enabling prisoners to be released from prison early, while still subject to restrictions placed on their liberty. This facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into the community and helps offenders to secure or resume employment or training as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/3">The Government believe that community punishments can make a major impact and support their increased use, particularly for some non-violent offenders such as those convicted of theft and handling or fraud. The Government's reform of the probation service, with its focus on reducing reoffending, means that rigorously enforced community sentences are a real and tough alternative to imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/4">In the longer term the proposed sentencing reforms, including sentencing guidelines and new flexible sentences incorporating both custody and supervision, should have a significant impact. In this context the Government are also exploring the scope for innovative new sentences, such as intermittent custody, and for restorative justice interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/5">There is no power to set a legal limit and we have no plans to introduce such powers. However, Prison Service orders require establishments to ensure operational capacity is not exceeded except in exceptional circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/2">The MRC spent approximately &pound;4 million on arthritis research in the year 2000&ndash;01. This figure includes work on the causes and treatment of arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammation.

Work being carried out at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research may contribute to the development of new drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases; for example, septic shock.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/3">The Department of Health has funded several research projects on rheumatoid arthritis via its NHS research and development programmes. The department is currently funding three such projects: the British rheumatoid outcome study group trial of symptomatic versus aggressive therapy in established rheumatoid arthritis, at the University of Manchester; a randomised controlled trial of different knee prostheses at the University of Dundee; and, the costs and outcome measures of hydrotherapy programmes compared with physiotherapy in children with rheumatoid conditions at University College London.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.0/1">We are supporting research and development into technologies that might create new and better products using small and low-grade logs. There has been some success with gluing technology for small pieces of unseasoned hardwood and softwood species. In 1998 we commissioned a major market development study for softwood. This identified some potential for inward investment for a large-scale development to exploit long fibre spruce round wood. Unfortunately, there is little likelihood of attracting a large industrial plant for predominantly hardwood growing areas where woodlands are more dispersed, therefore solutions are more likely to be small scale. The Forestry Commission is working with other organisations, including the regional development agencies, to try to encourage the development of wood processing facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/2">We are also encouraging the development of the energy and heat market which will provide another important use for small hardwood and softwood timber. Wood-fuelled plants are already being used, for example, for small-scale industrial heating in rural areas. Both energy and heat production from wood can also benefit from the extra &pound;100 million announced by the Prime Minister in June to support the development of renewable energy technologies.</p>

Consultation is still being undertaken and the possible options to ensure that all objects that have been accepted in lieu are made fully accessible to the public are being evaluated. It is expected that the review will be completed sometime in 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">The British Tourist Authority (BTA) has a dedicated Business Tourism department which brings together buyers and suppliers internationally and markets business tourism professionally.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">The Government have also supported the creation of the Business Tourism Partnership as a voice for this diverse sector. We have encouraged the recent joint initiative between the partnership and Trade Partners UK (TPUK), in conjunction with the DTI, to stimulate trade development opportunities and attract more international conferences and exhibitions to the UK. Business tourism can also take advantage of a range of government schemes to help business promote innovation, regeneration and export earnings.</p>

We welcomed, therefore, the XMusic in Europe&quot; conference arranged by the Belgian presidency as a way of bringing together representatives from the music industry across Europe to discuss current issues of common concern, share and disseminate examples of best practice and propose areas for possible action to promote the industry. We were pleased that many key figures from the UK music industry were able to speak at and attend the event, together with a representative from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.3/1">The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) decided at its council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">26 November</phrase> to reject the offer of Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium as an alternative to Pickett's Lock and to reopen the bidding for the 2005 World Athletics Championships. The IAAF's decision is clearly disappointing; Sheffield would have provided an outstanding venue for the 2005 World Championships. At a meeting attended by my right honourable friend the Minister for Sport, UK Athletics, Sheffield City Council, UK Sport, Sport England and the British Olympic Association on <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase>, it was agreed unanimously that UK Athletics should not enter a Sheffield bid.</p>
