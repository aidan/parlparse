The Charities Act 2006 makes a number of changes to improve the regulation of exempt charities as charities, with groups of exempt charities either coming directly under the Charity Commission's regulatory jurisdiction, or having an existing regulator appointed as their principal regulator, to promote charity law compliance. These changes have been implemented for several groups of exempt charities, with further implementation due later this year and in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.5/1">The department is aware of the potential of thorium-fuelled nuclear reactor designs and is in the process of assessing claims regarding its suitability as an alternative to uranium based reactors in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/2">The Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir John Beddington, with input from a number of sources, recently co-ordinated an assessment of the prospects for research into advanced thorium reactors. Additionally, the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) undertook a recent independent assessment, in which it assessed a number of claims made by proponents of thorium fuel. The report can be found at: <a href="http://www.nnl.co.uk/positionpapers">www.nnl.co.uk/positionpapers</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/3">The conclusion was that, while the science is reasonably sound, developing reactors based on a thorium fuel cycle would carry major commercial risks. The resources required to develop these technologies to the point at which they might be deployed successfully at a commercial scale are also very significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/4">To date, both in the UK and elsewhere in the world, this has prevented private industry and government investing in the development of the technology. No thorium reactor design has been implemented beyond relatively small, experimental systems, while many either exist only on paper or have only had specific subsystems demonstrated. As an indicator of the challenge of taking this technology further, the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates a development period of at least 20 years will be required before a demonstration thorium molten salt breeder reactor might be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/5">While thorium does not appear to have a part to play in the UK's near-to-mid-term energy market, we do maintain an interest in its development. The Secretary of State has asked the NNL to look further into the wider benefits of next generation reactor designs and to compare the use of thorium and uranium fuels in them. We are expecting the findings to be available by the end of the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.6/1">The Localism Bill contains a wide range of measures to devolve more powers to councils and neighbourhoods and give local communities greater control over local decisions like housing and planning. As such, aspects of the Localism Bill relate to policies across the department, many of which stem from the coalition agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.6/2">The department has carried out or is carrying out the following public consultations:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.6/3">consultation on the community right to challenge. Deadline for responses was <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-03">3 May 2011</phrase>;consultation on assets of community value. Deadline for responses was <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-03">3 May 2011</phrase>;consultation on thresholds for the pre-application consultation measure, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-21">21 March 2011</phrase>; and in addition, we published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-22">22 November 2010</phrase> a policy paper <I>Local Decisions: A Fairer Future For Social Housing</I> which included consultation questions on a range of social housing policies, some of which featured in the Localism Bill. This consultation has now closed and a response was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-28">28 February 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.6/4">The department has also confirmed that it plans to issue the following further public consultations:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.6/5">a consultation on how best to apply the local referendums regime to parishes;a consultation on the detail of draft regulations to implement our reforms to the community infrastructure levy;a consultation on draft directions to the Social Housing Regulator, including on the potential use of the powers in Clauses 128 and 148 of the Localism Bill; anda consultation on the draft direction on mutual exchange standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.6/6">Ministers will continue to consider where future public consultation may be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.6/7">As is common practice, policy discussions on aspects of the Localism Bill continue take place on an ongoing basis between the department and relevant third parties, devolved Administrations and other government departments. These informal consultations have not been listed.</p>

These estimates are based on the costs of other national elections, and costings are therefore not available for each force area. However, the money was allocated separately by the Treasury as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review; consequently no money for elections will come out of police force budgets.</p>
