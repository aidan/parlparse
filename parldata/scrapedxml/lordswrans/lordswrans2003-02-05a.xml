The major contributors are the USA $66.9 million; the EC $38.8 million; and the UK $18.27 million (including our share of EC contributions which is around 19 per cent). DFID also provided assistance to the first WFP appeal, and has provided &pound;20 million for feeding through non-governmental organisations working in parallel with the WFP.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.2/1">We welcome partnerships like the Accelerating Access Initiative, which in the past two years has resulted in some increased access to HIV/AIDS drugs in Africa, yet progress and coverage are low and the challenges remain immense. The recent Governmental Working Group on Access to Medicines examined the impact of existing research and development-based pharmaceutical industry initiatives offering differential pricing. Our report on Access to Medicines concluded that, provided it is supported by other actions, differential pricing has a real role to play in substantially increasing poor people's access to essential drugs. As part of a differential pricing framework the report recommends, among other things, actions to improve health systems, and positive trade action to prevent leakage of medicines, and work to facilitate predictability and sustainability of access to affordable medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/2">The Government hope to gain further international commitment to improved access to medicines through the G8 process and to demonstrate success of the differential pricing framework by piloting it in a few developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/1">As set out in the Answer I gave to a Question by my noble friend Lady Billingham on <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase> (WA 48&ndash;50), in the light of a review of the projected likely capacity of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) against projected demand for its service, it has been necessary to take temporary measures not to increase the level of demand by postponing certain requirements for mandatory checks.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/2">In care homes for adults, only providers and managers were subject to checks prior to <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. An estimated 100,000 new staff per year will continue to be subject to CRB checks, as will providers and managers. But an estimated 300,000 staff who were already in post on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> and who have not already applied for checks will not need to be checked for the time being.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/3">Both new and existing nurses supplied by nurses' agencies and staff supplied by domiciliary care agencies will also not need to be checked for the time being. A requirement for all such personnel to be checked in the current financial year would have entailed up to an estimated 200,000 in each group. Thereafter, it is estimated that some 50,000 staff supplied by nurses' agencies and 60,000 staff supplied by domiciliary care agencies would have needed to be checked each year. Nurses supplied as new staff to establishments where requirements for mandatory checks are in force (including adult care homes and children's homes) will continue to be subject to checks. So will providers and managers of nurses' agencies and domiciliary care agencies. The Nurses Agency and Domiciliary Care Agency Regulations will still come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, but without the requirement for CRB checks for care workers and nurses supplied by agencies. Care workers and nurses supplied by agencies will be required to provide a statement that they have no criminal convictions or to provide a statement of any criminal convictions that they do have.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/4">The Government remain committed to introducing CRB checks in these areas at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/5">Finally, school governors will also not be required to have CRB checks for the time being. Such checks would have generated an estimated 70,000&ndash;90,000 applications per year. The Department for Education and Skills will still be going ahead with the introduction of the School Governance (Constitution) Regulations to come into effect in March 2003 but without the requirement for CRB checks.</p>

In all, 36 organisations and four private individuals responded to the consultation. Almost all agreed to the Government's proposal to pilot a comparative car label. The majority of the respondents favoured an A-G energy label format similar to that used on domestic fridges and freezers. A full summary of responses has been published on the DfT website at <a href="http://www.roads.dft.gov.uk/consult/carlabel/responses/index.htm">www.roads.dft.gov.uk/consult/carlabel/responses/index.htm</a>.
