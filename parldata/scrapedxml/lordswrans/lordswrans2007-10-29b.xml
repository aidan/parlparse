	<p pid="b.143.6/1">The Diplomatic Service List was first published in 1966 as the successor to the Foreign Office List, dating from 1852. The case for the continued publication of the list was reviewed in 2006 and concluded that the cost of maintaining and collating biographical and operational data of staff outweighed the benefits. The 2006 edition was the last to be published by The Stationery Office on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) behalf. The FCO public website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>) carries information on diplomatic posts overseas. This may be found by going to directory and selecting UK embassies overseas.</p>

	<p pid="b.144.5/1">The draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill was published in May 2007. The draft Bill was scrutinised by a Joint Committee. Recommendation 17 of the report related to tissue typing. The Government accepted the committee's recommendation to replace the word &quot;life-threatening&quot; with &quot;serious&quot; in the Bill and also removed the reference to umbilical cord blood. This will give the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) discretion to license tissue typing for conditions where tissue other than umbilical cord blood can be used to treat an older sibling affected by a serious medical condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/2">The HFEA is required by statute to produce a code of practice. This will continue to be a requirement following the introduction of the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill. The seventh edition of the code of practice (G12.5.6) lists factors that should be taken into account when deciding the appropriateness of preimplantation tissue typing. The code of practice (section G12.5.7) also requires that consideration is given to the possible consequences for any child born as a result of tissue typing. Tissue typing is approved by an HFEA licence committee on a case by case basis based on this guidance. To date, all cases of tissue typing have been licensed for the harvesting of umbilical cord blood to treat an affected sibling. The seriousness of the condition for which tissue typing can be carried out would be subject to HFEA guidance and ultimately decision by a licence committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/3">Following licensing approval of the creation and transfer of a &quot;saviour sibling&quot; embryo, this issue falls outside the remit of the HFEA. However, the Human Tissue Act 2004 requires that the Human Tissue Authority must approve any transplants involving organs from living donors. In the case of adults that lack capacity, and children who are not competent to consent, this extends to bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells.</p>

These reports concluded that although the technology had a future in the longer term, environmental concerns, including CO2 related emissions, would need attention before it could be seen as a commercially viable technology. Thus the Government have committed themselves to maintaining a watching brief on its development.</p>

	<p pid="b.149.3/1">It is common practice for government departments to undertake consultation with relevant stakeholders before and after governing body meetings of the UN specialised agencies. Such consultations also take place in other parts of the UN system and for major UN summits and conferences, such as the 2005 world summit.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.3/2">Stakeholder consultation has typically included, though not exclusively, a dialogue across government departments and also with a range of non-government actors, including: private sector companies, industry representatives, non-governmental organisations, professional, academic and research bodies, interest groups and representatives from civil society. Individuals from these groups have often formed part of the UK's delegation to UN meetings.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.3/3">By way of example, the Met Office represents the UK at the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), a UN specialised agency. In preparing for the WMO's quadrennial congress, the Met Office consults a number of government departments (e.g. the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Department for International Development, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Ministry of Defence) and other meteorological and hydrological stakeholders, including the Royal Meteorological Society and the Natural Environment Research Council. In 2007, the UK's delegation to the WMO congress included officials from Defra, the FCO and representatives from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the Bermudan Weather Service, a private sector company.</p>

	<p pid="b.154.0/1">We are unable to state the number of places available in 2007-08 as the number of places available for ESOL is not a pre-determined figure. However, the number of enrolments in 2005-06 was 490,000, which we expect to be a comparable estimate of the numbers on ESOL courses in this academic year. Places on courses for English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) are funded through budgets which are allocated from the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). Funding is passed from the LSC to learning providers based on the provider's ability to deliver certain provision. The number of ESOL places on offer within each provider is dependent on a number of issues: the capacity of the provider and corresponding budget and learner demand. Learner data are collected by the LSC via the Individual Learner Record (ILR). It is currently too early in the academic year for ILR data to report the number of enrolments on to ESOL provision for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.0/2">The requirements for citizenship or indefinite leave to remain are identical. The two methods by which applicants can demonstrate their knowledge of language and of life in the UK are:</p>
	<p pid="b.154.0/3">for those already at or above English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) Entry 3, by taking a specially developed short test based on the handbook <I>Life in the United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship</I>; and for those below ESOL Entry 3, by successfully completing a language course with learning materials incorporating information about life in the UK. Courses are pitched at a level appropriate to the learners' needs and success is measured by acquiring an &quot;ESOL&mdash;Skills for Life&quot; qualification from one of the recognised UK awarding bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.0/4">Three thousand ESOL teachers have been trained to use the citizenship materials and that training is ongoing, managed by &quot;lead trainers&quot; in each local area. Five thousand hard copies of the citizenship materials which were developed by NIACE and LLU+ have been distributed and there have been many thousands of additional downloads of all or part of the materials from the NIACE website.</p>

Each awarding body has its own rigorous accreditation process, which is used to approve providers and centres for delivery of their qualifications. Awarding bodies are regulated by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA). This ensures consistency of quality and rigour.

We will continue to raise our concerns with the Israeli authorities. On July 19, the quartet welcomed the resumption of bilateral talks between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas, and expressed support for the Israeli Government's decision to release Palestinian prisoners. Since then more than 300 Palestinian prisoners have been released and other militants wanted by Israel were granted amnesty in exchange for laying down their arms.</p>
