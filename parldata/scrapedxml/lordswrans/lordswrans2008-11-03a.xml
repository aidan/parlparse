	<p pid="a.1.2/1">One of the basic eligibility criteria for access to work is that applicants should be in or about to start paid employment. Councillors and elected officials who receive payment only for expenses such as travel and subsistence are treated as voluntary workers and are not eligible for access to work. Some councillors, however, receive allowances over and above payment for expenses. Where these allowances are classed as taxable income by HM Revenue and Customs we can treat the person as in employment and provided other conditions are satisfied, we can pay access to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">We are reviewing our guidance to access to work advisers to ensure it is clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.2/1">The purpose of a service inquiry is to establish the facts and to make recommendations in order to prevent recurrence.

	<p pid="a.10.2/3">It is a matter of Ministry of Defence policy that a service inquiry should also be held in the following circumstances where the convening authority considers that anything of consequence may be learned, which is not readily apparent and which has not been or is unlikely to be identified by any other report into the matter:</p>

Part 2 created the offence of introducing water to or supplying water from a water undertaker's supply system without being a water undertaker or a licensed supply person. Under Part 3 it is an offence for an owner of manager of a large raised reservoir to fail to prepare a flood plan when required to do so. Part 3 also extended the offence of supplying water unfit for human consumption to apply to persons including employees of the water undertaker and self-employed people involved with the supply of water;</p>

	<p pid="a.13.3/8">During the 2004-05 Session the following Act created criminal offences:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/9">the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 (c. 16) created offences in relation to nuisance parking which is the selling or repairing of vehicles on a road by persons in business. Part 6 of the Act created offences in relation to breach of Dog Control Orders, which in relation to specified land may exclude dogs from the land, or prohibit the fouling of the land, or require dogs to be kept on leads when on the land or may limit the number of dogs a person may take on to the specified land. In relation to certain premises in an alarm notification area Part 7 of the Act created offences of failing to nominate a key-holder where an audible intruder alarm is present.The Act also made many existing offences punishable by a fixed penalty notice.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/1">The Interministerial Commission for the review of logging concessions in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reported its preliminary findings on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-06">6 October 2008</phrase>. It recommended the cancellation of approximately 70 per cent of existing logging titles, reducing from 22 million hectares to 7 million hectares the forest area dedicated to industrial logging. When presenting the findings, the DRC Environment Minister also confirmed that the current moratorium on new logging concessions will remain in place for another three years, which is welcome news. At the same time, it is important to note that the most important drivers of deforestation are agricultural and fuel wood production which are likely to grow in importance as the DRC economy continues its recovery after years of conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/2">If implemented in full, the Commission's recommendations should be positive for the DRC environment because they will actually reduce the area open to commercial logging to 11 per cent of the country's productive forests. The same ratio for the Central Africa Forests Commission (COMIFAC) region (excluding the DRC) is 73 per cent. We are therefore not planning specific representations to the DRC Government on the Commission's findings, but will instead help strengthen governance and management of the forestry sector. Through a partnership with Germany funded by the Congo Basin Forest Start-up Fund, the UK is working directly with the DRC Forestry and Environment Ministry to strengthen its capacity at national and provincial levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.3/1">The police service has made substantial progress over the past nine years in increasing the proportion of minority ethnic officers and staff in its workforce. Currently, minority ethnic officers and staff together represent 5.6 per cent of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/2">The increase of minority ethnic officers to 4.1 per cent of warranted officers represents a doubling in representation since 1999. However, despite this progress, the service recognises that there is a lot more to do to achieve a truly representative service which is reflective of the communities it serves.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/3">The policing Green Paper: Cm 7448 &quot;From the Neighbourhood to National: Policing Our Communities Together&quot; <a href="http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/">http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/</a> policereform/Policing_Green.pdf, sets out a shift in the Government's approach to targets, setting out performance management generally. In future, there will be a single top-down numerical target for forces relating to public confidence. The emphasis will be on national support with greater local responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/4">The Green Paper also sets out proposals to develop an equality, diversity and human rights strategy. The strategy will include local setting of equality standards. The aim of these standards, which are currently being developed by the National Policing Improvement Agency, will be to assist the service to continue to improve performance and mainstream activity on equality and diversity. The standards will be set within a framework which will support authorities and forces in setting equality standards locally with national oversight retained through a new, more robust HMIC inspection regime including a proposed 2010 workforce inspection which will scrutinise (among other issues) the equality standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/5">The Government are currently consulting on whether the equality standards should include local employment targets such as for race and gender. This shift from national target-setting will provide for targets being agreed locally by police authorities in consultation with communities. This local approach would provide more local ownership and help reflect the needs of local diverse communities.</p>
