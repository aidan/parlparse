	<p pid="b.140.3/2">As noted there, the Government could have made the amendments to the packaging regulations under the powers in the Environment Act 1995, but were faced with calls for very quick action in amending the regulations. In light of the (at the time) impending election and the associated restriction in the actions that can be taken, the Government considered that the quickest way to respond to the calls for rapid action was to make the changes using the powers in Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.</p>

	<p pid="b.141.3/1">The strategic transport improvements that Crossrail will bring will be felt across the country and the scheme will be a catalyst for safeguarding a national economy that is strongly related to the performance of London. The same is unlikely to be the case for a new underground railway in Birmingham or Manchester. The Secretary of State exercises quasi-judicial functions under Part I of the Transport and Works Act 1992 and this only provides for orders relating to government schemes in the limited circumstances set out in Section 7 of the Act (concerning defence purposes and the interests of safety). A government scheme for these purposes is simply one promoted directly by the Secretary of State. So, where the Secretary of State decides to promote a railway scheme, such as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link or Crossrail, he must do so by means of a hybrid Bill.</p>
