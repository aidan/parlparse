<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-11-07a.141.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100325" speakername="Lord Irvine of Lairg" colon=":" colnum="141"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001107/text/01107w01.htm#01107w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.141.2/1">The Government are committed to improving the performance of the criminal justice system in England and Wales (CJS) and have set out clear aims, objectives and targets for the CJS as a whole. A strategic plan for the CJS was published in March 1999 covering 1999 to 2002 and a business plan for the CJS in 2000-01 in May 2000 (copies have been placed in the Library). An updated CJS business plan for 2001-02 will be published early in 2001</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/2">The strategy for the CJS is overseen by the Ministerial Group on the Criminal Justice System, chaired by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, of which I am a member together with my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General, my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and other ministerial colleagues and senior officials from the main CJS departments. As part of the 2000 spending review, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in July 2000 a new reserve of &pound;525 million over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04 to be used to help deliver the objectives and targets set out in the latest CJS public service agreement. Initial decisions on use of the reserve will be made in the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/3">Alongside these new resources the Government are working with the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, courts and probation and prison services on an on-going programme of modernisation and reform and are engaged in a number of important reviews of the criminal justice process. These include Sir Robin Auld's review of the criminal courts and a review of the present sentencing framework, led by John Halliday, formerly Director of Criminal Justice Policy at the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/4">The Home Office, my department, the Law Officers' Department and Her Majesty's Treasury are now pursuing work to draw together the experience of the last three-and-a-half years, and taking account of the current reviews, to identify the way forward for the longer term. Any firm conclusions which emerge from this work will be reported to the House.</p>

Under Section 72(1) of that Act conditions may be imposed on the grant of planning permission requiring the removal of any building or works mast authorised by the permission or the discontinuance of any use of land so authorised at the end of a specified period and the carrying out of any works required for the reinstatement of land at the end of that period.</p>

The exercise will demonstrate the joint rapid reaction force concept which was a central pillar of our Strategic Defence Review by deploying, sustaining and recovering a joint task force at medium scale to conduct an out of area operation. It sends a very clear signal about our commitment to the Gulf region and will show Britain's ability to deploy rapidly a considerable force, with real punch, over large distances. The UK contribution will include a naval carrier task group, armoured and commando brigades and around 50 combat aircraft. The exact number of personnel taking part has yet to be finalised but our contribution will be in excess of 20,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.0/1">I understand from Westminster City Council that these works began in February this year and are expected to be completed by March 2001. These works are part of a traffic management scheme which is funded by the City of Westminster to improve conditions in the Belgravia area. Questions regarding the progress of these works should be addressed to the City of Westminster and Transport for London which have responsibility for the highway.</p>
