However, there are indications that awareness of the guidelines is patchy and that more contact centres are needed. The department is taking steps to address these issues.

	<p pid="a.83.9/1">The Government take the view that the environmental impact caused by the disposal of consumer batteries is largely attenuated by their burial as a very small element of landfilled household waste. Most studies of household waste in the UK have found the level of consumer batteries in the household waste-stream to be less than 0.1 per cent. The levels of heavy metals classified as special or hazardous waste is very low in most consumer batteries. It is an EU requirement for the level of mercury contained in the type of batteries used in torches must not exceed 0.0005 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.9/2">The Government welcome the European Commission intention to propose a new EU directive aimed at promoting greater recycling of consumer batteries later this year, but an analysis of the likely environmental impact and costs of an early draft commissioned by my department demonstrates that the environmental costs of small batteries collection can sometimes outweigh the benefits of material reclamation. lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.86.2/4">As you may be aware, the Government's intention to transfer to Local Highway Authorities responsibility for around 40 per cent. of the then trunk road network (a process known as de-trunking) was announced in 'A new Deal for Trunk Roads in England' in July 1998. The aim was to get decisions on these roads taken at the level at which the relevant factors were best understood so that their management and improvement could be fully integrated with land use planning and local transport plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/5">The A570 was one of the roads identified for detrunking. Our intention is to transfer responsibility for it to the local highway authorities, Lancashire County Council and Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council, in April 2003. The necessary De-trunking Orders have been published and we are meeting the local authorities to discuss their concerns about the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/6">In the run-up to de-trunking, we will be implementing a safety scheme to create a one-way gyratory system around the St Helens Road Park, signalise the junction and improve pedestrian facilities in the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/7">If you would like any further information about this please contact the Agency's Route Manager for the A570, Ziad El-balbisi, at Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4BE (telephone 0161 930 5822). lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.88.3/1">National planning policy with regard to windfarms is set out in PPG 22 (renewable energy), which provides planning authorities with guidance on a range of issues that affect the siting of wind turbines and other renewable energy developments. We are currently reviewing the guidance and will consult widely on the revised draft.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/2">The Secretary of State's general approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. Parliament has entrusted them with responsibility for day-to-day planning control in their areas. Local planning authorities are normally best placed to make decisions relating to their areas and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly, with the minimum of interference. There will be occasions, however, when the Secretary of State may consider it necessary to call in a planning application to determine himself instead of leaving it to the local planning authority. His policy is to be very selective about calling in planning applications. He will in general take this step only if planning issues of more than local importance are involved and if those issues need to be decided by the Secretary of State rather than at a local level. Each case is, however, considered on its own facts. Barry</p>

	<p pid="a.91.5/1">Costs for running the unit in each of the years were as follows: 2000&ndash;01 &pound;957, 302 1999&ndash;2000 &pound;838, 421 1998&ndash;99 &pound;716, 672</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/2">A large proportion of these costs are attributable to the continuing development and support of the No 10 Downing Street website, which is one of the most frequently visited government websites in the UK, receiving over 4 million hits a week.</p>
