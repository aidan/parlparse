	<p pid="a.99.2/1">The Ministry of Defence (MoD) adopts a neutral position on the use of real fur in ceremonial clothing and the department is entirely open to the use of faux fur where this provides a suitable and affordable alternative. However, in the case of bearskins, no alternative has yet been identified that matches the impressive properties and visual appearance of black bear fur.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">My honourable friend the Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology (Peter Luff) met with representatives from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in July 2010 where he agreed to the MoD testing samples of a synthetic fur identified by PETA as a possible alternative. The department stands ready to proceed with this work once suitable samples are available.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.5/1">The bank levy has been designed specifically to target risky short-term funding which led to serious liquidity problems that played a key role in the financial crisis. By design, the levy is not charged on insured customer deposits and applies at only half-rate to uninsured customer deposits (except for those from financial institutions) and to funding that has over one year remaining to maturity. The levy therefore ensures that banks make a contribution reflective of the risks they pose to the UK financial system and wider economy. The treatment of deposits also reflects the general desirability of encouraging banks to increase the proportion of their funding from deposits.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/2">The Government are also clear that competition drives efficiency and helps to ensure that consumers are able to access the wide range of financial products that they need. As part of its remit, the Independent Commission on Banking is looking at the state of competition in the industry and how customers and taxpayers can be sure of the best deal.</p>

We are concerned that restrictive laws controlling freedom of expression in the new Parliament do not promote accountability and good governance but instead will hamper opposition parties from playing an effective role in policy reform. We expect that senior government positions will be filled by military figures from the existing leadership. This and the Government's recent rejection of the National League for Democracy's appeal against dissolution leaves little room for doubt that the military's intention is maintain their grip on power.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.5/4">To ask Her Majesty's Government to what extent they expect any demand deflationary effect of the increase in the rate of VAT to 20 per cent to offset the effect on prices. [HL6499]</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/5">The OBR's November forecast incorporated the estimated impact of policy measures announced at or before the June Budget, including the increase in the standard rate of VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent that took effect from <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-04">4 January 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/6">Drawing on evidence from previous changes in VAT rates in the UK and elsewhere, the November forecast assumed that around two-thirds of the VAT increase would be passed on relatively quickly to prices, with further adjustment over the remainder of 2011. The impact on the annual rate of CPI inflation is to add 0.7 percentage points to the annual rate in 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/7">The OBR applied a range of fiscal multipliers to help inform its judgement on the impact of VAT on aggregate demand in the economy. These multipliers are set out in Table C8 of the interim OBR's June Budget document. The interim OBR's June 2010 Budget forecast and the OBR's November forecast assumed that the increase in the standard rate of VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent would reduce the level of real GDP in 2011-12 by around 0.3 per cent. All else equal, this will tend to increase the level of spare capacity in the economy and reduce the level of inflationary pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/8">However, the assessment of the output gap is subject to a wide margin of error and it is difficult to judge the exact degree to which spare capacity will exert downward pressure on inflation.</p>
