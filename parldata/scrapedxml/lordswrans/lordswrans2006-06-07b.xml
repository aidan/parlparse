	<p pid="b.192.14/1">Pupils of primary or post-primary age without significant hearing impairment have provision made in mainstream schools or in special units attached to mainstream schools. Specialist teachers of the deaf provide support to children, parents and teachers in these settings. The education and library boards' hearing support services provide support to pre-school children in liaison with specialist clinics. Jordanstown Special School makes special educational provision for children with more severe hearing losses. This school uses total communication methods; that is to say, a mixture of speech, lip-reading and signing.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.14/2">The Department for Employment and Learning has put in place a range of initiatives to assist colleges to discharge their responsibility towards all students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, including the deaf and hearing impaired. The initiatives include enhanced funding under the further education funding formula, support for staff development activities and the additional support fund, which provides financial assistance towards the costs of technical or carer support.</p>
