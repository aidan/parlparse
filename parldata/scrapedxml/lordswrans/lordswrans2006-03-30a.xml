	<p pid="a.133.8/1">In response to the Commission for Africa report, the UK played a key role in establishing the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA). This major new effort to accelerate progress towards meeting the infrastructure needs of Africa was inaugurated in London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October 2005</phrase>. The ICA brings together all the main donors financing infrastructure in Africa. It will be results-orientated: prioritising the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) regional infrastructure projects identified in its short term action plan; acting as a broker for the funding of projects; and identifying and taking action to remove bottlenecks to progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/2">The UK has committed $20 million over three years to help with the initial work of the ICA. We have also seconded an individual to the secretariat which has been set up in the African Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/3">Many commentators suggest that the problem is not just a shortage of funds&mdash;but a lack of good projects to fund. The ICA has an important role in helping prepare good projects and demonstrating that sound, sustainable infrastructure projects will secure funding. Improving donor and private sector confidence in the sector to deliver good infrastructure is likely to have a significant positive impact on future funding. Progress on financing has already been made. Key donors have announced new resources or signalled their intention to increase resources, amounting to around an additional $2 billion annually.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.0/10">The AHWG agreed the following terms of reference:</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/11">The Aviation Health Working Group will meet on a regular basis and will work in partnership with other interested parties to give effect to the government response to the House of Lords inquiry into Air Travel and Health. Particular responsibilities identified in the response are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/12" class="indent">provide a forum for interested government departments and agencies to consider issues relevant to aviation health;</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/13" class="indent">provide an interface with the air transport industry, health experts and other interested parties on aviation health issues of mutual interest;</p>

	<p pid="a.135.0/16" class="indent">monitor developments that impinge on the health of those travelling by air.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/17">The initial focus of the work of the AHWG was to produce government-approved advice on the risks of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for air travellers. To this end the Government provided funding with the European Commission to conduct research to assess whether there is a direct link between air travel and the incidence of DVT. The summary results of this research, which was carried out by a consortium of medical research scientists under the auspices of the World Health Organisation, was published on the department's website on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-21">21 December</phrase> last year.

	<p pid="a.135.0/18">The AHWG has asked the independent Committee on Toxicity to review the evidence relating to cabin air contamination during fume events. This will help to identify the way forward on research and/or monitoring in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/19">The group has also given consideration to other aviation health matters such as research into the use of aspirin for the prevention of DVT; medical equipment on board aircraft; and provision of supplementary oxygen to passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/20">On the issue of recommendations, the terms of reference of the group specify the provision of advice to government. The group was not set up to make recommendations independent of government.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.3/3" class="indent">the planned allocation of grant-in-aid to the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) is &pound;20.902 million; this includes provision for work deriving from the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 including the forthcoming public sector duty to promote equality for disabled people.

	<p pid="a.142.3/4">Officials are still finalising the allocation for the Equal Opportunities Commission, including funding in respect of its work to promote the forthcoming gender duty.

The CEHR will take on the responsibilities of the CRE in relation to race relations by the end of March 2009, putting expertise on equality, diversity and human rights all in one place. The annual budget will be &pound;70 million which represents a 43 per cent. increase on the budget of the existing three commissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.6/1">Most wild-caught fish imported into the UK as pets are tropical species. No specific assessment has been made of mortalities on arrival or of mortalities between arrival and point of sale. However, all commercial consignments of live fish imported directly to the UK from third countries must be routed through a border inspection post and all consignments are subject to a programme of targeted inspection. Evidence from this inspection programme suggests that mortalities account for approximately 1 per cent. of consignments of live fish.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.2/1">When the provisional anti-dumping duty is fully imposed in September this year at a rate of 19.4 per cent. for China and 16.8 per cent. for Vietnam, the European Commission estimates that it will add approximately &euro;1.50 (about &pound;1) per pair to the import price of certain footwear with uppers of leather, based on an average import price of &euro;8.50 per pair. Special technology athletic footwear (STAF), children's footwear and footwear with a protective toecap have been excluded from the duty.

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">We do not believe any school should be deterred from providing a comprehensive programme of sex and relationship education tailored to the age and maturity of pupils. Guidance on sex and relationship education was issued to schools in July 2000. This sets out the statutory requirements on schools in relation to sex education, including the requirements to teach pupils aged 14 to 16 about contraception. Schools must set out their approach to sex and relationship education within a policy available for inspection by parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">The pilots demonstrated that direct action with procurers and small businesses can result in increased levels of small businesses tendering for government business. During the pilot project in the West Midlands (June 2003 to June 2004) over 500 small businesses and 17 partner organizations from central and local government participated. At the start of the pilot, 14 per cent. of the small businesses had successfully tendered for government contracts. Of contracts awarded through the pilot's opportunities portal at <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>, 26 per cent. were won by small businesses helped in the pilot, and 26 per cent. of businesses involved in the Haringey pilot increased their turnover.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/2">The following lessons were learnt:</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/3">1. That small businesses liked and used the central portal on which public sector procurers advertised opportunities. Subsequently the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) has supported the Small Business Service (SBS) to develop a web-based national opportunities portal on which public sector procurers can advertise contract opportunities easily accessible to small businesses (mainly those of a financial value beneath EU thresholds). The portal is due to go live in spring 2006 <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/4">2. That it will help if government develop supply chain guidance that raises awareness of the potential of small businesses among key suppliers to government. The Haringey pilot found that prime contractors in some sectors were more open to developing supply chain activities than in others, and recommended engagement with key prime contractors at a national level. As a result of the pilots, OGC has developed guidance on supply chain management and is working with both key suppliers and procurers to ensure that opportunities for small businesses in their supply chains are visible and accessible.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/5">3. That training for small businesses on how to tender helps small business to win tenders. The Small Business Service has worked with the nine regional development agencies to train over 3,000 small businesses based on content produced by OGC.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/6">4. That training for procurers is necessary to complement small business training and to encourage consistency. Over the past 12 months OGC has trained over 800 procurers nationwide focusing on the benefits of appropriate use of small businesses and a diverse supplier base; and how to remove obstacles.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/7">5. That a standardised pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ) is a useful tool to cut down on bureaucracy. OGC has developed a standard, simplified pre-qualification document based on a self-certification model, specifically for use in procurements with a financial value beneath EU thresholds, and is now leading on the nationwide promotion of its use.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/8">6. That good practice and experience need to be shared. Haringey Council has disseminated its experience from the pilot to other boroughs though the London Regional Centre of Excellence.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/9">7. That local authority procurement processes should be explained on council websites&mdash;the SBS, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Local Government Association have promoted this through the small business concordat (a voluntary, non-statutory code of practice which sets out what small firms and others supplying local government can expect when tendering for local authority contracts).</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/10">8. That the link between procurement strategy and the local community strategy should be recognised. The OGC has published guidance on the use of social clauses in procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/11" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> (EC directives apply to public sector procurements above certain monetary thresholds. For central government, these thresholds are approximately &pound;100,000 for goods and services and &pound;4,000,000 for works)</p>

	<p pid="a.155.0/1">The full-year yield for 2006&ndash;07 from abolishing marginal relief for profits over &pound;300,000 would range from around &pound;0.5 billion against a main rate of corporation tax of 30 per cent. to around &pound;0.1 billion against a main rate of 25 per cent. The lower figure of &pound;410 million for cost of relief against the 30 per cent. rate given in the previous reply related to 2003&ndash;04, the latest year for which actual figures were available.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/2">As published in the 2005 Tax Ready Reckoner located at <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/FA1/96/pbr05-taxreadyreckoner-223.pdf">www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/FA1/96/pbr05&ndash;taxreadyreckoner&ndash;223.pdf</a>, the full-year cost for 2006&ndash;07 of reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 30 per cent. to 29 per cent. would be around &pound;1.5 billion, ignoring behavioural effects. The full year direct revenue effect of a one percentage point reduction in main rate and abolition of marginal relief for profits over &pound;300,000 would therefore be a net cost in excess of &pound;1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/3">It is not appropriate to extrapolate the cost of reducing the main rate to lower values because a change of this magnitude would be likely to have a major impact on company behaviour and therefore major indirect as well direct effects on tax revenues.</p>
