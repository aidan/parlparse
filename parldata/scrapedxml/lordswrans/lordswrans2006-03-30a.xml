	<p pid="a.133.2/1">It is not a question of asking British service personnel to distinguish between an insurgent and a terrorist. It is a matter of force posture. The NATO-led international security assistance force mission is to help the Afghan Government expand their authority and to maintain security. It specifically excludes a counter-terrorism mission. United Kingdom troops always have the right to use force in self-defence regardless of whether an attacker is judged to be a terrorist or an insurgent.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.8/1">In response to the Commission for Africa report, the UK played a key role in establishing the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA). This major new effort to accelerate progress towards meeting the infrastructure needs of Africa was inaugurated in London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October 2005</phrase>. The ICA brings together all the main donors financing infrastructure in Africa. It will be results-orientated: prioritising the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) regional infrastructure projects identified in its short term action plan; acting as a broker for the funding of projects; and identifying and taking action to remove bottlenecks to progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/2">The UK has committed $20 million over three years to help with the initial work of the ICA. We have also seconded an individual to the secretariat which has been set up in the African Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/3">Many commentators suggest that the problem is not just a shortage of funds&mdash;but a lack of good projects to fund. The ICA has an important role in helping prepare good projects and demonstrating that sound, sustainable infrastructure projects will secure funding. Improving donor and private sector confidence in the sector to deliver good infrastructure is likely to have a significant positive impact on future funding. Progress on financing has already been made. Key donors have announced new resources or signalled their intention to increase resources, amounting to around an additional $2 billion annually.</p>

To this end the Government provided funding with the European Commission to conduct research to assess whether there is a direct link between air travel and the incidence of DVT. The summary results of this research, which was carried out by a consortium of medical research scientists under the auspices of the World Health Organisation, was published on the department's website on <phrase class="date" code="">21 December</phrase> last year.

	<p pid="a.137.2/1">The conduct of trade unions deducting fees from claimants' compensations is currently before the courts.

The results of this consultation exercise, including the DTI's assessment, will be published later this year. The assessment recognised that in order to ensure reliable energy supplies in the long-term, the UK will need a dependable system of physical distribution networks and access to sufficient and affordable energy.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.4/2" qnum="HL4565">What lessons were learnt from the small to medium-sized enterprises procurement pilot projects led by the Office of Government Commerce in the West Midlands and the Department of Trade and Industry's Small Business Services in Haringey.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-30a.151.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="151"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60330w06.htm#60330w06_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.151.5/1">The pilots demonstrated that direct action with procurers and small businesses can result in increased levels of small businesses tendering for government business. During the pilot project in the West Midlands (June 2003 to June 2004) over 500 small businesses and 17 partner organizations from central and local government participated. At the start of the pilot, 14 per cent. of the small businesses had successfully tendered for government contracts. Of contracts awarded through the pilot's opportunities portal at <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>, 26 per cent. were won by small businesses helped in the pilot, and 26 per cent. of businesses involved in the Haringey pilot increased their turnover.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/2">The following lessons were learnt:</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/3">1. That small businesses liked and used the central portal on which public sector procurers advertised opportunities. Subsequently the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) has supported the Small Business Service (SBS) to develop a web-based national opportunities portal on which public sector procurers can advertise contract opportunities easily accessible to small businesses (mainly those of a financial value beneath EU thresholds). The portal is due to go live in spring 2006 <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/4">2. That it will help if government develop supply chain guidance that raises awareness of the potential of small businesses among key suppliers to government. The Haringey pilot found that prime contractors in some sectors were more open to developing supply chain activities than in others, and recommended engagement with key prime contractors at a national level. As a result of the pilots, OGC has developed guidance on supply chain management and is working with both key suppliers and procurers to ensure that opportunities for small businesses in their supply chains are visible and accessible.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/5">3. That training for small businesses on how to tender helps small business to win tenders. The Small Business Service has worked with the nine regional development agencies to train over 3,000 small businesses based on content produced by OGC.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/6">4. That training for procurers is necessary to complement small business training and to encourage consistency. Over the past 12 months OGC has trained over 800 procurers nationwide focusing on the benefits of appropriate use of small businesses and a diverse supplier base; and how to remove obstacles.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/7">5. That a standardised pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ) is a useful tool to cut down on bureaucracy. OGC has developed a standard, simplified pre-qualification document based on a self-certification model, specifically for use in procurements with a financial value beneath EU thresholds, and is now leading on the nationwide promotion of its use.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/8">6. That good practice and experience need to be shared. Haringey Council has disseminated its experience from the pilot to other boroughs though the London Regional Centre of Excellence.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/9">7. That local authority procurement processes should be explained on council websites&mdash;the SBS, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Local Government Association have promoted this through the small business concordat (a voluntary, non-statutory code of practice which sets out what small firms and others supplying local government can expect when tendering for local authority contracts).</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/10">8. That the link between procurement strategy and the local community strategy should be recognised. The OGC has published guidance on the use of social clauses in procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/11" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> (EC directives apply to public sector procurements above certain monetary thresholds. For central government, these thresholds are approximately &pound;100,000 for goods and services and &pound;4,000,000 for works)</p>

	<p pid="a.155.0/1">The full-year yield for 2006&ndash;07 from abolishing marginal relief for profits over &pound;300,000 would range from around &pound;0.5 billion against a main rate of corporation tax of 30 per cent. to around &pound;0.1 billion against a main rate of 25 per cent. The lower figure of &pound;410 million for cost of relief against the 30 per cent. rate given in the previous reply related to 2003&ndash;04, the latest year for which actual figures were available.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/2">As published in the 2005 Tax Ready Reckoner located at <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/FA1/96/pbr05-taxreadyreckoner-223.pdf">www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/FA1/96/pbr05&ndash;taxreadyreckoner&ndash;223.pdf</a>, the full-year cost for 2006&ndash;07 of reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 30 per cent. to 29 per cent. would be around &pound;1.5 billion, ignoring behavioural effects. The full year direct revenue effect of a one percentage point reduction in main rate and abolition of marginal relief for profits over &pound;300,000 would therefore be a net cost in excess of &pound;1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/3">It is not appropriate to extrapolate the cost of reducing the main rate to lower values because a change of this magnitude would be likely to have a major impact on company behaviour and therefore major indirect as well direct effects on tax revenues.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.3/2">The corporation tax regime is a UK-wide system and to introduce different rates in different parts of the UK could distort competition. Many companies trade in different regions of the UK. It would not be easy to determine which proportion of their profits were liable at which rate. In addition, such a measure could also create opportunities for some companies to manipulate the rules simply to benefit from a lower rate. This would result in a system that would place a significant administrative burden on both businesses and the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.3/2">The information is based on the Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) and 2003&ndash;04 is the latest survey year.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.3/3">Caution should be exercised when drawing trends from regional estimates because the estimates are subject to larger sampling errors due to year-on-year sampling variations in the survey.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.2/1">The VAT reduced rate for the renovation and repair of private dwellings is one of a number introduced into EU legislation on an experimental basis whose objective is to create employment opportunities by stimulating demand through lower prices. The Government have always chosen not to participate, as we believe that our employment objectives are better targeted through measures such as the welfare to work strategy and New Deal, which have contributed to the 2.4 million rise in employment since 1997. We continue to take this view.</p>
