	<p pid="c.156.2/1">The Government's guidance, <i>Safeguarding Children in whom Illness is Fabricated or Induced</i> (2002), focuses on children when there is a concern that the child is or is likely to suffer harm as a result of their carer inducing or fabricating illness. The key issue is the impact of fabricated or induced illness of the child's health and development, and consideration of how best to safeguard the child's welfare. The guidance emphasises the importance of carefully evaluating the child's signs and symptoms of illness in order to understand the reasons for them and that professionals should be open to all possible explanations. The General Medical Council's decision to strike Professor Sir Roy Meadow off the medical register related to him giving erroneous and misleading information in a criminal trial about the likelihood of two cot deaths in one family. It had no connection to the contents of the guidance on fabricated or induced illness. We therefore have no plans to amend the guidance.</p>

	<p pid="c.164.3/1">The Government are fully committed to tackling the problem of oils fraud in Northern Ireland. In September 2000 Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs began to increase the number of officers in Northern Ireland. Since January 2001 160 customs officers have been deployed to break up criminal gangs behind oils fraud, especially laundering plants, and are actively working under the umbrella of the Organised Crime Task Force with a range of agencies to tackle non-compliance in the fuel sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.164.3/2">In 2002 the Government announced the introduction of a UK Oils Strategy for tackling the problem. The strategy consists of a range of additional measures to help combat the problem including stronger regulatory regimes to control the sale and distribution of rebated fuel, a central intelligence unit to drive operational activity against fuel smugglers and launderers and the application of new technology.</p>
	<p pid="c.164.3/3">The latest available data indicate that deliveries of legitimate road fuel to Northern Ireland have increased for the third year in a row after five preceding years of decline which is a clear indicator that the illicit market is shrinking and that the UK Oils Strategy is having a positive effect.</p>
