This information is contained in a quality and risk profile (QRP) for each provider. QRPs are constantly updated and are used to identify problems and act as a prompt for further action.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/3">Any concerns raised with the CQC by a member of the public or a whistleblower are added to the providers QRP. This helps the CQC to:</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/4">spot problems or concerns in local services that it may need to act upon;make decisions about whether a service should be registered;monitor on an ongoing basis whether care services continue to meet the essential standards of quality and safety;look at how commissioners of services find out what services people need, and if money is being spent wisely to provide services in the local area; andcheck what providers tell CQC about their own performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.2/1">The Government have introduced welfare to work reforms which aim to fight poverty, support the most vulnerable and help people, including deaf people, to break any cycle of benefit dependency and to find employment.</p>

The exact nature and range of help on offer, delivered in conjunction with local and national partner organisations, will vary from area to area as local managers have the discretion to deliver the services that they believe will help people in their area to secure work the most.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.2/3">In addition, Jobcentre Plus is committed to helping disabled people find a suitable, sustainable job in their local area through the support it delivers through its network of disability employment advisers. Disability employment advisers can identify suitable job opportunities and act as an advocate on a customer's behalf with employers, if appropriate. They will also aim to identify work solutions that will overcome or minimise difficulties relating to a customer's disability and can signpost customers and their employers to the Access to Work Service. Jobcentre Plus also has specialist programmes that help disabled people move into paid work, such as residential training, or for those with the most complex support needs, Work Choice. Disability employment advisers also use the professional expertise of work psychologists specialising in working with disabled people, or refer people for occupational health assessment, if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.2/4">Underpinning Get Britain Working is the introduction of the Work Programme which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-01">1 June</phrase>. The Work Programme will provide a single, personalised, welfare to work programme for all customer groups. It will be delivered through a combination of contracted employment provision via private, public and voluntary sectors as well as Jobcentre Plus-led service delivery. The Work Programme is a new approach to delivering employment-related support services. It will simplify the complex array of existing employment programmes and deliver coherent, integrated support more capable of dealing with complex and overlapping barriers to work, providing personalised help for people who find themselves out of work regardless of the benefit they claim.</p>

Over the long term the UK stands to benefit from cleaner, cheaper and more reliable sources of low-carbon energy. An estimated &#163;110 billion of investment is needed in electricity generation and transmission to 2020 in Great Britain, of which around &#163;70-75 billion is in generation.</p>

There are now around 60 safeguarding co-ordinators throughout the UK Border Agency with the role of raising awareness of and embedding best practice on children's issues throughout the agency. More than 13,000 staff members have now taken part in an online programme of training on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children. Improved arrangements have been introduced in the way that we work with children and families, such as our approach in asylum screening, closer engagement with local authorities, improvements in our culture of care, and facilities such as child-friendly areas. Last year we announced the ending of detention of children for immigration purposes. This is now being put into effect by the introduction of a new process which focuses on engagement with families.

Each NHS trust is currently working on a tripartite formal agreement with their strategic health authority and the department. Once the agreements have been signed by all parties, they will be published locally. We will then have a clearer picture of when each NHS trust will submit their FT application and expects to achieve FT status.</p>

In Haiti, for example, Digicel, the main telecoms provider, gave free credit worth &#163;10 million to its 2 million subscribers allowing them to keep in touch with family and friends. It also prepaid its taxes to local government to give them extra resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.6/2">DfID already has important relationships with private sector actors providing transportation, logistics and expert assistance in disaster relief. We will become more active and focus on those areas where private sector actors have specific comparative advantages, for instance when responding to disasters in an urban area. By building up relationships pre-disaster as part of our resilience and preparedness work we will ensure rapid deployment is possible once a disaster has struck.</p>

	<p pid="a.379.5/1">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.5/2">The arrests collection held by the Home Office covers arrests for recorded crime (notifiable offences) only, broken down at a main offence group level, covering categories such as violence against the person and robbery. Holding a mobile phone while driving (without using it) is not a criminal offence; the only relevant offence is the offence of using a mobile phone while driving, which is not a notifiable offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.379.8/1">The recent events have been disappointing and the sentiments expressed cannot be condoned. However, it is important that decisions do not distract from the central task of helping supporters to become more involved in the running of their clubs. So, it is pleasing to learn that the Football Stadia Improvement Fund has been clear that funding will still be available to supporter' trusts. The Minister for Sport and the Olympics is reassured that the new acting chief executive has met the fund and understands that a new funding application will be welcomed.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.5/1">The UK has regular discussions on its development assistance to Zimbabwe with a large range of partners, including parts of the Government of Zimbabwe. This helps to maximise the impact of our support through aligning it closely with the support of others and where we judge it appropriate the Government's own policy priorities. To that extent the Government of Zimbabwe can have an influence over the direction of development assistance and vice versa. But the Zimbabwean Government do not hold any control over development assistance provided by the UK.</p>
