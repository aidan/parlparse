	<p pid="c.123.2/1">The majority of UK forces in Afghanistan are deployed with the International Security Assistance Force under NATO leadership. NATO's operational plan enables forces to support Afghan-led operations, but not to lead on targeted counter-narcotics operations such as eradication of poppy fields or heroin production factories. These general constraints are reflected in UK forces rules of engagement. The objective of ISAF and the UK is to help the Afghans create a secure environment in their country which is an essential contribution to the eventual elimination of the Afghan opium industry.</p>

	<p pid="c.127.2/1">The increase in drink-drive fatalities from 580 in 2003 to an estimated 590 in 2004 is disappointing, bearing in mind the downward trend in drink-related collisions and casualties overall in the past two years. It is also an indictment of the irresponsible behaviour of a small minority of drivers in this country.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.2/2">There are no plans to reduce the legal alcohol limit for drivers to zero. The Government's priority for reducing drink-drive casualties is through well targeted national publicity campaigns and effective enforcement, including the use of additional police powers for roadside testing for alcohol, as provided for in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. This will be supported by a number of provisions in the Road Safety Bill which is now before this House.</p>

The proposed treaty would therefore not control the trade only in small arms, but would have a wider remit to include large weapons platforms. The Council further encouraged &quot;all states, regional organisations and multilateral institutions to join the growing international consensus for action in this area&quot;.

	<p pid="c.133.0/1">We are aware of the hijacking of the merchant vessels &quot;Semlow&quot;, &quot;Ibn Batuta&quot; and &quot;MV Torgelow&quot; in Somali waters. After being detained for some time, the &quot;Semlow&quot; has been released and her crew freed. The International Maritime Bureau has logged some 20 attacks on ships in Somali waters since March.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/2">We take a very serious view of piracy along the Somali coast, but we do not believe that a UN mandate to use force would address the root causes of this problem or the wider problems of lawlessness within Somalia. We are working closely with the international community to promote the establishment of an effective government in Somalia. We believe that only by assisting the return of Somalia to stability, good governance and the rule of law can piracy, terrorism and other forms of criminal activity be brought under control.</p>

	<p pid="c.133.6/1">We make regular representations to all parties in the Darfur conflict on the harassment, abduction and attacks on non-governmental organisation (NGO) workers in Darfur. During my visit to Sudan on 5 to <phrase class="date" code="">8 October</phrase> I met NGOs in Darfur and heard their views on the security situation there which is severely hampering the humanitarian relief effort. I raised these issues directly with the Sudanese Government and the African Union, pressing the importance of improving the security situation there and allowing NGO workers to operate freely.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.6/2">The past two weeks have seen a significant increase in attacks and harassment of NGO workers in Darfur. Reports indicate that these attacks have been conducted by both bandits and armed movements. Humanitarian operation is critical in supporting the civilians in Darfur, and any attacks on NGOs put their work in jeopardy and limits access to those who need assistance.</p>

	<p pid="c.134.8/1">Heavy goods vehicle drivers employed by agencies are subject to the requirements of Directive 2002/15/EC in the same way as any other in-scope drivers.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.8/2">The implementing regulations are enforced in Great Britain by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and in Northern Ireland by the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency (DVTA)&mdash;primarily in response to specific complaints they receive.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.8/3">The enforcers' response will be proportionate, with an initial onus on educating employers and employees rather than prosecution. In most cases, it is anticipated that the act of following-up a specific complaint or concern will be enough to ensure compliance. However, if, it appears that a driver is not complying, VOSA or DVTA may initiate formal enforcement action&mdash;for example, they can use:</p>
	<p pid="c.134.8/4" class="indent">improvement notices&mdash;for instance, to notify an employer of a likely breach of the regulations and to set out the changes that need to be made in a given timescale, or,</p>
	<p pid="c.134.8/5" class="indent">prohibition notices for instance, requiring a driver to stop a dangerous activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.8/6">Ultimately, an offender can be prosecuted in Court and, if found guilty, will be sentenced.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.8/7">At the roadside, breaches of the working time rules with a road safety impact will produce parallel breaches of drivers' hours rules. VOSA, DVTA and the police can take action against foreign drivers who offend. The primary sanction in such cases is the prohibition notice. A prohibition notice will stop the driver in question from continuing his or her journey, until any breach of the rules has been rectified.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.8/8">Details of all prohibition notices issued to foreign drivers and/or operators are reported to the licensing authority in the offending vehicle operator's country of origin.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.8/9">The Road Safety Bill includes powers for the police and VOSA to issue fixed penalty notices in respect of drivers' hours offences. Drivers without a suitable UK address will be required to pay immediately a deposit equal to the amount of the penalty notice.</p>
