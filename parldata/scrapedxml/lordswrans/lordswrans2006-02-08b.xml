	<p pid="b.95.2/1">Research has not examined the link specifically between high-volume repeat offending and alcohol consumption. The National Offender Management Service has developed a comprehensive alcohol strategy for prisoners. Detoxification is available on reception in all local and remand prisons. Some prisons run alcohol awareness courses and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) run groups in around 50 per cent. of prisons. Additionally, general offending behaviour programmes address the underlying causal factors, which occur in alcohol-related crime.</p>

The Government have not entered into any debate on the concept of &quot;functional food&quot;, which is not used for legislative purposes in the United Kingdom or the EU, and are therefore unaware of any conflicts in definitions. We assess consumption of all foods in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey programme and use this assessment to inform nutrition policy, including healthy eating and the five-a-day campaign.</p>

	<p pid="b.103.5/1">The arrangements in respect of north/south implementation bodies for managing funding allocations between financial years are similar to those for other public bodies and provide flexibility to manage slippage in approved capital projects but require that any unused current expenditure allocations be returned for reallocation by Ministers. Where a body requires additional funding in any year, arising either from underspends in a previous year or any other reason, this must be reflected in the relevant business plan and submitted to the relevant sponsor department for consideration as part of the normal budgetary process.</p>

	<p pid="b.107.3/1">The Government will announce plans aimed at tackling disadvantage in Northern Ireland (with a particular emphasis on working-class Protestant communities) in March of this year. The announcement will focus on ways of making government money work harder by refocusing existing policies, programmes and services to better serve the needs of disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland. A number of key areas for action have been identified, including community capacity building.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.3/2">Plans will be informed by the outcomes of both the government-appointed task force to look at the particular social and economic challenges faced by Protestant working-class communities and by David Hanson's personal programme of engagement with civic and elected representatives of Protestant communities.

	<p pid="b.108.6/1">We continue to see a vital role for police authorities in setting policing priorities for the force and holding the chief officer to account for the delivery of an efficient, effective and responsive policing service to local communities and we have included provisions in the Police and Justice Bill to set out these responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.6/2">Below the strategic force level, we have recently published the results of our review of the partnership arrangements set out in the Crime and Disorder Act and propose to strengthen the effectiveness of crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs) including by ensuring that elected local authority members responsible for community safety issues play a full part in setting community safety priorities. CDRPs will be subject to periodic scrutiny, by local authority scrutiny committees, and inspection, by the new Inspectorate for Justice, Community Safety and Custody. We also propose that basic command unit (BCU) commanders and local authority chief executives hold regular public briefing sessions to respond to issues raised by local communities. The Police and Justice Bill will establish the community call for action to trigger intervention by the local authority scrutiny committee if community safety issues have not been adequately addressed by the police or their partners. Taken together, these measures amount to a significant enhancement of the accountability arrangements at BCU and CDRP level.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.5/1">The Government have neither designated tallow as waste nor banned its use as a fuel. The effect of the EU Animal By-Products Regulation (ABPR) ((EC) No. 1774/2002)) is to require a range of animal by-products and substances derived from them (for example, tallow) to be disposed of as waste. Where the method of disposal is incineration or co-incineration (that is, use as a fuel), it must be carried out in compliance with the Waste Incineration Directive (WID) (2000/76/EC) which came fully into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-28">28 December 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/2">In June 2005, the Government wrote to the European Commission expressing their view that the existing requirements of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) (75/442/EEC as amended) and the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (96/61/EC) are sufficient to ensure that the burning of waste tallow as fuel is carried out in ways which protect the environment and public and animal health. The Government called for the ABPR and the WID to be amended accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/3">In response, the Commission has stated that there does not appear to be sufficient justification at present for it to propose an exclusion of the burning of waste tallow from the WID. However, the Commission has also confirmed that the WID is not intended to discourage uses of waste as competitive and efficient alternative energy sources; has agreed that it is desirable that it does not have such an effect; and has initiated further analysis of the issue in the form of a study. This study should help to clarify the wider environmental and economic impacts of the current legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-21">21 December 2005</phrase>, the European Commission published its thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste together with a proposed revision of the WFD. The draft revised WFD contains a proposal which would enable the adoption of environmental and quality criteria for specified waste streams. Where these criteria are met, the effect would be to deem that the recovery of the specified waste had been completed and that it had ceased to be waste. The Commission's thematic strategy proposes that, subject to the outcome of the study mentioned above, the waste streams addressed by this system should include the use of tallow as a fuel.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/5">I recognise that recent announcements by the European Commission have raised the possibility that this legal position might change in the future. My understanding is that the Commission's study of the environmental impacts of burning tallow will report in the second half of 2006. If the outcome of this study were favourable to the burning of waste tallow as fuel without having to meet the requirements of the WID, then this could lead to a change in the relevant legislation although it is suggested that this is unlikely to occur before 2009. I must also stress that such an outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/6">It is therefore for individual businesses to make a commercial decision whether to upgrade their plant to meet the requirements of the ABPR and the WID or to burn an alternative fuel until it is clearer whether the law is likely to be changed.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.2/1">The requirement for insurance is that a particular person's use of a vehicle is insured, not that the vehicle itself is. A constable can seize a vehicle from someone who cannot prove his use is so insured and whom the constable reasonably believes to be using the vehicle without insurance. The owner or registered keeper of a seized vehicle is entitled to reclaim it if he pays the prescribed removal and storage fees and if he, or a person he nominates, produces a valid driving licence and a valid certificate of insurance covering his, or his nominee's, use of the vehicle. The legislation makes no further provision as to the insurance certificate.</p>
