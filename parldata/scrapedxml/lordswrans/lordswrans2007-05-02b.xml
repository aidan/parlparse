	<p pid="b.206.5/1">The natterjack toad is fully protected in UK law under Schedule 5 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and Schedule 2 to the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994. It is also protected in European law under Appendix 2 of the Bern Convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.5/2">On the north-west coast of England, the natterjack toad's key habitats receive additional protection as special areas of conservation (SACs). For example, Morecambe Bay and the Sefton Coast, Ainsdale Sand Dunes and Cabin Hill National Nature Reserves are specifically owned and managed by Natural England to protect the natterjack toad and its sand dune habitats. The Sefton Coast Partnership is currently developing a new nature conservation strategy and biodiversity delivery plan for the whole Sefton Coast: this also reflects the need to conserve natterjack toad populations. There are strict tests for any development which could have adverse impacts on SAC habitats, and Natural England must be consulted in all cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.5/3">Almost all the natterjack toad populations in Cumbria are found within sites of special scientific interest designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and this affords a further degree of protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.5/4">The Wealth of Wildlife project was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-21">21 April 2007</phrase> as the flagship project of the Cumbria Biodiversity Partnership. Over &pound;860,000 has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Rural Regeneration Cumbria and the landfill tax to deliver over three years a range of conservation objectives for rare and threatened species and habitats, including the natterjack toad. The natterjack toad is one of four biodiversity action plan species included in a joint project between Natural England and the Herpetological Conservation Trust.</p>

	<p pid="b.207.2/1">National Health Service audiometry records are not routinely used in deciding no-fault compensation claims. Depending on individual circumstances they may be helpful in diagnosis or for assessment if they date from around service termination. No-fault compensation is paid for personal injury and illness causally related to service. Claims are governed by the relevant law and case facts and the MoD is committed to evidence-based policy and decision making. Current generally accepted scientific understanding is that permanent hearing loss due to noise exposure does not improve or worsen on removal from the noise. In addition, when hearing loss due to age or other causes is superimposed on an existing noise-induced loss the overall loss is not more than additive. As a result, under the MoD's compensation schemes, only hearing loss measured at or around service release is included when assessing claims. To include later loss, such as hearing loss due to ageing or other sources of noise, would be to compensate for something which was not due to service.</p>

	<p pid="b.208.0/1">As part of the government commitment to good mental health and well-being for Armed Forces personnel and veterans, officials from the MoD, the UK health departments and Combat Stress, advised by national clinical experts, have been working to develop a new community-based model of mental health services for veterans, designed to provide health professionals with access to expert understanding of veterans' mental health problems and appropriate treatment options. Since 1948, successive Governments have held that the NHS should be the main provider of health care for veterans. Based on NHS practice and procedures, the new service would deliver culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions through a network of public, private and charitable providers; an aim of the new model would be to integrate Combat Stress into NHS commissioning arrangements. We are looking to pilot the model at sites across the UK, with the first to be launched shortly. Discussions are well advanced in selection and setting-up of sites which we expect to be located in a range of trusts across the UK. The pilots would run for two years, after which there would be an independent evaluation of effectiveness, including value for money. An important part of the initiative is that the pilots should provide planning data on the likely demands for a nationwide veterans' service.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/2">With regard to public funding of Combat Stress, war pensions funding would continue to be provided to qualifying war pensioners for residential care at the society's homes. Officials are currently in discussion with the society on fee levels for 2007-08 and we expect to announce increases shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.215.2/1">The Department of Trade and Industry has ensured that relevant officials across government, including in the Ministry of Defence, are fully aware of the Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 2. This has been achieved, in particular, through communication through the Office of Government Commerce's regular meetings of procurement representatives from different departments. We have also informed Regional Development Agencies and the Local Government Association about the existence of the programme. We have also directly contacted the National Housing Federation, a representative body for housing associations in England, and the Development Trusts Association, a representative body of community regeneration organisations across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.2/2">The programme manager, BRE, has created a website with relevant information and links, distributed flyers at relevant events, released information to networks of contacts focused on carbon and energy efficiency within local authorities, health services, higher education and the government estate and included information about the programme in relevant publications and press releases. Framework suppliers have also been encouraged to undertake their own promotional work of the programme in the course of their usual business.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.3/1">Yes. A decision not to site the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) in the Crumlin Road gaol was taken in November 2005 for technical and cost reasons. Subsequent to this, in March 2007, a decision was taken by Maria Eagle MP, Minister for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, not to site the new accommodation for PRONI on the Crumlin Road gaol site as it did not meet the critical business needs and urgent timeline for PRONI's accommodation. The Crumlin Road courthouse was not considered on its own as a site for PRONI. In the 1990s it had been considered in combination with the gaol as a possible location for PRONI but this did not proceed beyond preliminary investigations.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.3/1">The potential benefit to Northern Ireland was a factor considered in calculating funding provided to Rally Ireland, the Circuit of Ireland and the North West 200. For Rally Ireland, the potential benefit to Northern Ireland was demonstrated in approved business cases. Prior to 2006, the potential benefit to Northern Ireland from the Circuit of Ireland and the North West 200 was assessed as part of the application process for funding from the Northern Ireland Events Company (NIEC) Major Events Fund. From 2006, the potential benefit to Northern Ireland from the Circuit of Ireland and the North West 200 has been assessed as part of the application process for funding from the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) Business Development Scheme administered by NIEC.</p>

In America, where certain audiences have an appreciation of Ulster-Scots cultural links, the company may use Scottish dancing as part of its promotional activities. In other markets where there is limited knowledge of Ulster-Scots the company uses other themes which are more easily recognised as being part of the culture of the island of Ireland. The goal of any marketing campaign is to reach as wide an audience as possible by using themes which resonate with the potential visitor.</p>
