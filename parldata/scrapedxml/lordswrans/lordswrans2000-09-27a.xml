	<p pid="a.143.2/1">A reduction in the volume of timber produced by Forest Enterprise would not have a significant effect on prices, as the prices obtained by producers of coniferous timber in the United Kingdom are very strongly linked to the prices of imported timber. This is because the United Kingdom imports about 85 per cent of its timber requirements. The end users of timber grown in the United Kingdom would simply switch to using imported timber if UK timber was not available at a competitive price. We therefore have no plans to ask Forest Enterprise to reduce the volume that it produces.</p>

The research work is, however, well supported and progress is being made. Researchers in China are assessing various natural predators which attack the beetle during its larval and pupal stages. One such predator Dastarcus longulus, has been found to kill between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of the larvae and pupae in some areas in China. However, more research is required to discover if the populations of these natural predators can be manipulated to control the beetle effectively. In the USA, work has concentrated on using insect pathogens for controlling the beetle. Results so far indicate that one particular fungus, Beauveria bassiana, may have some potential.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.6/1">The UK signed the Memorandum of Understanding for the industrialisation and production phase of MR TRIGAT in June 1999 in the expectation that we would shortly proceed to contract and maintain the programme to deliver a modern anti-tank guided weapon capability by 2005 (when stocks of the existing MILAN system start to run down).</p>
	<p pid="a.148.6/2">Regrettably, MOU signature by all five participating nations has still not been achieved. Some 12 months after our MOU commitment we are no nearer to contract placement than we were then. This additional delay, to a programme that is already 10 years behind its original schedule, and the additional risk and uncertainty it creates is unacceptable. The UK's priority has to be to deliver the capability and equipment needed by our Armed Forces in an acceptable timescale.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.6/3">We have therefore decided that the UK should withdraw from the MR TRIGAT industrialisation and production programme and will pursue an alternative national procurement of an anti-tank guided weapon system. We plan to issue an invitation to tender in the next few weeks for the supply of commercially available systems to meet the requirements of our infantry light forces by 2005. In parallel, we are reviewing our requirements for an anti-tank capability for mechanised and armoured infantry units prior to determining whether these too could be met by similar commercially available systems. Our initial assessment is that the alternative systems now available will be in many ways more capable than MR TRIGAT and offer significant financial savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.6/4">We recognise that this decision will be a disappointment to our partners and to those areas of UK industry that had expected to benefit from MR TRIGAT. The UK remains committed to the principles of European collaboration provided it is in the UK's best interests. Regrettably it was not possible to proceed on this basis with MR TRIGAT, but there are a range of other programmes on which we remain engaged to good effect with our European partners.</p>

The most usual arrangement is for the secondee to continue to be paid by his or her employer, which in turn seeks reimbursement from the receiving organisation.

	<p pid="a.153.0/14">(3) These reflect a range of promotions and offers which are normal for visitor attraction businesses and are factored into the company's business strategy and planning. For example, NMEC has and will run a number of offers and promotions with its sponsors for customers; and NMEC has and continues to run a special price ticket for entry after 4 pm. A key promotion with Marks and Spencer concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-30">30 June</phrase> and this is likely to be evident in subsequent month's data.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/15">(4) There are several issues in terms of the data integrity regarding the number of Free Sponsor admissions in the attendance months to date. Due to the fact that NMEC ticketing and admission systems are different we are unable to establish non-attendance vs. bookings. This is obviously more likely in the case of free issue tickets, i.e., sponsors and passholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/16">The admission system does not differentiate between free and paying attendance at a sufficiently detailed level to provide accurate analysis, i.e., it will show that an admission is from an Enta booking, but not that it is a sponsor voucher.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/17">The redemption of sponsor vouchers via the ticketing system (Enta) does not differentiate between a free sponsor voucher being redeemed for a specific attendance date and a sponsor voucher purchased via a bulk purchase agreement (e.g. Tesco's 50,000 vouchers at &pound;10 each). Passholders of platinum, gold, silver and bronze passes are able to bring up to five guests. These are invariably not booked in advance via the ticketing system and are not noted in the admission system.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/18">The above and several other issues mean that we are unable to provide any form of reasonably accurate analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/19">The numbers attached are an approximation and as such should ideally be used for review purposes. Clearly, there is insufficient accuracy for them to be regarded as audited or validated information.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.5/1">Tourism expenditure was about &pound;64 billion last year and about 1.8 million people are employed in tourism-related jobs, so the industry is indeed very important for us all. We do not think a change of name for the department would significantly change the status and success of the industry. We are confident that we can sponsor tourism vigorously alongside the arts and sport as part of the Government's broader cultural policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.8/1">The Government's macroeconomic framework is designed to deliver high and stable levels of growth and employment; this platform of economic stability has already delivered an increase in employment of over one million since the election. The new spending plans are set within prudent limits and meet the clear fiscal rules to ensure macroeconomic stability. The Government have adhered to the fiscal spending envelope for the next three years set out in Budget 2000. Within this, current spending is planned to rise by 2.5 per cent a year in real terms, in line with the neutral assessment of trend growth in the economy, and net investment will more than double to 1.8 per cent of GDP by 2003-04.</p>

The service extends to providing suitably qualified persons to chair or sit on governing body disciplinary tribunals and review panels.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.6/1">I believe the European Commission's booklet performs a useful function in dispelling some of the myths about our membership of the EU. The fact is that the Single Market is a success and has brought substantial benefits to British business. Countries in the EU now account for 53 per cent of our exports in goods and services, worth around &pound;120 billion last year; eight of our top ten trading partners are in Europe; and the Treasury estimates that over 3 million jobs are linked to trade with the EU. The UK has the largest number of inward investors in Europe and is seen by US and Japanese investors as a springboard into Europe. Our membership of the Single Market is a key part of the reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/2">Despite this, it is possible that misinformation about the EU might make small businesses wary of seizing the opportunities presented by their access to the world's largest single market. That is why my department has on hand a comprehensive range of support services, available through the Small Business Service, Trade Partners UK and the Action Single Market team, to help businesses find their feet in Europe. My department is also actively targeting, through constructive engagement with colleagues in other member states, the weaknesses which do remain in the Single Market so that British businesses can compete on equal terms with their European colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/3">To underpin the importance of creating a friendly environment for small firms within the EU, this Government played a leading role in securing agreement at the Feira European Council on a Small Firms Charter. The charter commits the EU to a range of actions to allow enterprise and small firms to flourish within the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.0/1">The Government believe that solar electricity, or photovoltaics, has considerable potential in the long-term, but is unlikely to make a significant contribution to UK electricity supplies in the short term. We are working with industry on increasing their competitiveness, and developing the technology, information and skills which will be needed in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/2">The Department of Trade and Industry has had a solar energy R&amp;D programme for a number of years, as part of the new and Renewable Energy Programme. This has supported a wide range of projects including examination of such issues as standards, grid-connection and architectural integration, and the production of studies on design, installation and monitoring. The budget for the Solar Photovolataics Programme has risen from &pound;0.5 milllion to &pound;2 million over the past five years. Budgets for future years have not yet been decided but they are likely to go on increasing.</p>

In addition, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's Renewable and New Energy Technologies Programme of basic research, worth &pound;3.5 million per annum, includes photovoltaics amongst its priorities.</p>

But VI weighs vehicles that are likely to be overloaded and this figure is not representative of the HGV fleet as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.9/2">Through the Continuing Survey of Road Goods Transport (CSRGT), the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions monitors the freight carried by HGVs registered in Great Britain and the proportion of journeys where cargo is limited by weight, as distinct from volume.

	<p pid="a.162.12/1">It is already an offence under Section 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 to drive a motor vehicle on a footpath or bridleway without lawful authority. The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill amends Section 34 to make it an offence to drive on a restricted byway--the new category of highway introduced by the Bill for walkers, cyclists, horse riders and drivers of horse-drawn vehicles. The Bill also provides that, for the purposes of Section 34, a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway shown on a definitive map is deemed to be such a highway unless prima facie evidence to the contrary is produced. Finally, the Bill extends Section 34 to cover not just motor vehicles but the broader category of mechanically propelled vehicles. It is not the intention of the provisions relating to restricted byways, or those relating to Section 34, to extinguish public rights to drive motor vehicles on highways but the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill extends the grounds on which traffic regulation orders may be made to include landscape and nature conservation.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.5/1">The information requested is not held centrally. In the context of Amendment No. 410 to the Transport Bill, DETR officials estimated, after consultation with the industry, that there were at least 100,000 sites in the UK with an annual throughput of 10,000 or more lorries over 7.5 tonnes. This estimate included HGV operating centres, depots, distribution centres, motorway service areas and retail and industrial parks but excluded, for example, construction sites. We have no information other than this. However, in order to give you the fullest response, I have asked DETR officials to again consult with the industry to estimate the number of sites registering the alternative throughputs of vehicles given.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-09-27a.165.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="165"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000927/text/00927w08.htm#00927w08_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.165.8/1">For both roads and bridges the structural damage caused by the average motor car is negligible. The wear on road pavements from lorries is generally considered proportional to the 4th power of the axle load. Thus, lorry axle loads of 11.5 tonnes and 12.5 tonnes cause about 40 per cent and 200 per cent more wear than a 10.5 tonne axle. A simple relationship for bridges does not exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.8/2">Current design standards for main roads reflect all normally permitted lorries with axle weights up to 11.5 tonnes. The presence of abnormal vehicles with heavier axles including 12.5 tonnes is also allowed for in design and permitted on certain routes but represents only a minor percentage of lorries. Vehicle construction and use regulations aim to minimise wear by defining how the total vehicle weight is transferred to the road avoiding unduly heavy individual axles.</p>

In particular, moves toward a more flexible approach to the operation of the immigration control--including the introduction of new IT systems for issuing visas at posts overseas--have frustrated attempts to design a simple and effective scheme for providing a bond facility for visitors, and for recording their entry to and departure from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/3">The planned pilot study in Manila and Casablanca will therefore not proceed.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.11/1">The Department of Health is awarding the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Support Network a grant of some &pound;70,000 per year for three years to fund a &quot;case co-ordination initiative&quot; aimed at facilitating the co-ordination of healthcare for patients affected by all types of CJD. This should help ensure that the healthcare response is tailored to the needs of each patient. The department similarly funds part of the central administrative costs of the Human BSE Foundation that offers support to variant CJD patients, their relatives and health-care providers. This latter funding amounted to some &pound;23,000 in 1999-2000. In addition, a new post has been created this year at the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh to act as a central source of advice and support for healthcare professionals and carers.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.5/1">Early clinical symptoms of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) are non-specific and include psychiatric symptoms such as depression, personality change, irritability, sleep disturbance and personal neglect. In addition, persistent pain and odd sensations may be experienced in the face and limbs. After several weeks or months, more clear-cut neurological symptoms may set in such as unsteadiness in walking, sudden jerky movements and loss of mental function. vCJD is a rare disease. With the vague nature of the early symptoms, general practitioners might initially diagnose a range of much more common psychiatric disorders. However, all healthcare professionals should be aware of the above symptoms and hence the possibility of vCJD through publications in the medical press, the media and the National CJD Surveillance Unit website. Updates on the disease are being sent out to all general practitioners through &quot;CMO's update&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.3/1">The Government are working closely with a number of voluntary and statutory organisations across the country to raise the profile of men's health. For example, the Health Development Agency is examining what measures are most effective in engaging men's interest in health issues. By this type of collaborative work, the Government are aiming to address men's particular health needs and tackle the inequalities that exist across social classes.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/2">The widening inequalities between men are due to a variety of factors including the wider determinants of health, lifestyle and access to/willingness to take up services. We are addressing these problems in a number of ways. For example, a cross-departmental ministerial group is looking at issues affecting all young people, including young men. Also, the new National Plan for the National Health Service--building on the Acheson Report on inequalities in health and the White Paper Saving Lives--Our Healthier Nation--sets out a strategy for dealing with inequalities in health that will benefit men in lower social class groups, both directly and indirectly. We shall examine how best to report on progress and developments in men's health and to disseminate examples of good, innovative work in alleviating gender-related differences in health.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.0/1">We are determined to improve the detection and treatment of prostate cancer as part of our programme of action to improve prevention and treatment of our cancer services across the National Health Service. In April 1999, we introduced a two-week waiting time standard for patients referred urgently by their general practitioners with suspected breast cancer. This high standard of care is being put in place for all other cases of suspected cancer during 2000 with the standard for prostate cancer being introduced in December 2000. We are also introducing &quot;On the spot&quot; style booking systems for cancer treatment, including prostate cancer, through the Cancer Services Collaborative. This &pound;6 million initiative is significantly improving patient care by streamlining and redesigning care from referral through diagnosis and treatment thus reducing delays at every stage and will be rolled out to the NHS from April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/2">The NHS Plan (Cm 4818-I) now sets out our commitment that the National Cancer Plan which we shall publish in the autumn will contain referral to diagnosis to treatment waiting times targets, covering all cancers. These targets will be drawn up in discussion with clinicians and patient groups, taking account of the speed at which the workforce can expand.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/3">A Prostate Cancer Action Plan encompassing research, diagnosis, early detection, treatment and care will also be built into the National Cancer Plan. We have also asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to commission evidence-based guidance on urological cancers, including prostate, as part of the Improving Outcomes series.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.3/1">The NHS Plan (Cm 4818-I) sets out the Government's commitment that if and when screening and treatment techniques have developed sufficiently, a prostate cancer screening programme will be introduced. The evidence to support the introduction of a screening programme will be kept under careful review by the UK National Screening Committee. The UK National Screening Committee and the Health Technology Assessment Programme have been working with researchers to pull together several existing research protocols for a prostate cancer screening trial into a bid for one coherent and integrated trial. This has now been submitted to the Medical Research Council and a decision on whether to pursue the trial is expected towards the end of 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.0/1">Cancer is a top government priority and research is essential to the development of modern and effective cancer services. The estimated figures for annual government expenditure on breast cancer and prostate cancer in 1999-2000 are &pound;9.02 million and &pound;1.52 million respectively. These figures do not include research allocations to universities from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, or Research Councils other than the Medical Research Council, These figures further underestimate the total government research and development expenditure in these areas, as detailed estimates of National Health Service support funding are not collected routinely.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/2">The Department of Health has recently made &pound;1 million extra available this year for prostate cancer research. The NHS Plan states that a further &pound;1 million will be made available for each of the next three years. In addition, a Prostate Cancer Action Plan encompassing research, diagnosis, early detection, treatment and care will be built into the National Cancer Plan to be published this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/3">Part of the additional money mentioned above will be used to fund two research projects into prostate cancer. The first of these examines the effectiveness and acceptability of treatment options for prostate cancer in screen-detected individuals. The second project is a highly innovative study to create and test new less invasive treatment for prostate cancer using magnetic resonance imaging and high intensity focussed ultrasound.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/4">We are working with the Medical Research Council and other members of the Cancer Research Funders Forum to identify priorities for prostate cancer research. An expert review group has been set up and will be finalising its report shortly. We will be considering with our partners how we can help improve research capacity in prostate cancer and develop research on key issues in the light of the Expert Review Group report.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/5">Details of projects directly funded by the department or supported through the NHS research and development budget can be found on the National Research Register. This is available in the Library and most medical libraries on CDROM, and on the Internet: <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/nrr.htm">http://www.doh.gov.uk/nrr.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.3/1">The issue of population growth was carefully considered by West Surrey and West Sussex health authorities before they issued their proposals on the future configuration of acute services at Surrey and Sussex Healthcare National Health Service Trust. The decision, announced on 26th June, was made to ensure that local residents have access to modern, effective, dependable and affordable health services facilities that are fit for the 21st century. Ministers have recognised the importance of providing a clear strategic future of services across the health economy and have instructed the South East Regional Office of the National Health Service Executive to facilitate the establishment of a new working group made up of as many key local stakeholders as possible. This group will be responsible for producing recommendations on the long-term provision of acute, primary and intermediate care services and will consider the effect of long-term population growth in the area.</p>
