	<p pid="d.137.2/1">The Government welcome the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, <i>Need not greed</i>. It is important for Government to strike the right balance between enforcing rules against illegal working to preserve the integrity of the welfare system, while at the same time ensuring that the system provides the right incentives for people to move from welfare into legal forms of work. The Government will therefore consider the findings in this report to inform future policy development. Reforms to the tax and benefit system by this Government have already improved substantially incentives for people to move from welfare and into work. Since 1997, more than 2 million more people are in legal work, and the UK employment rate is among the highest in the G7.</p>

	<p pid="d.138.6/1">In the past, a member of the board&mdash;who was not on the panel for making the release decision in the particular case&mdash;used to interview all offenders before consideration of release. However, independent research showed this to represent little added value and funding was targeted to those cases where there were particular issues that an interview might resolve. The Government believe this to be adequate, but have undertaken to look at any new proposals in respect of interviews that the board may make. In addition, life sentence prisoners who have completed their tariff have a statutory right to have their ongoing detention reviewed by an oral hearing of the Parole Board. The board is funded for such hearings. Overall, there has been a significant increase in resources provided to the board.</p>

	<p pid="d.139.2/2">For carriageways, footways and structures, we are actively seeking better information from local authorities and elsewhere. All local highway authorities have been encouraged to produce asset management plans for their roads.

These asset management plans, together with better information on the most effective remedial work and its costs, will allow more accurate estimates to be made of the funding required.</p>

	<p pid="d.140.2/1">Although animal protein contained in scallop shells does not in itself carry a risk of transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) to animals, under Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001, its feeding to ruminant animals (such as cattle, goats or sheep) is prohibited to address the possibility of its masking the presence of mammalian material which may carry a TSE risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.2/2">Scallop shells (excluding animal protein) are not covered by the TSE regulation but as an animal by-product (ABP), shells from shellfish (including scallops, crabs and lobsters) must be disposed of in accordance with the animal by-products Regulation (EC) No.1774/2002, which lays down the rules on the use, treatment, handling and disposal of ABPs in order to protect public and animal health. Shells which are derived from raw shellfish must be recovered or disposed of in certain ways, for example by incineration, rendering, or processed in an in-vessel composting or biogas plant. Although shells derived from cooked shellfish can go for disposal to landfill, in accordance with the EU landfill directive, this is the least sustainable option. It is a commercial matter for those disposing of such waste to decide which is the most cost effective means.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.2/3">Shells from shellfish can also be used to produce organic fertiliser and soil improvers subject to the rules contained in Commission Regulation 181/2006, which allows certain categories of ABPs, after being processed, to be used as organic fertiliser or soil improvers. This was formulated in consideration of a number of scientific opinions from the relevant EU scientific committee to ensure there was minimal risk to public and animal health. These are available on the following website: <a href="http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/outcome-en.html">www.europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/outcome&ndash;en.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.2/4">Organic fertilisers and soil improvers that are still considered to be waste may be spread to land in accordance with the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 (as amended). Paragraph 7A of Schedule 3 to the 1994 regulations allows shells from shellfish processing to be spread to land for agricultural benefit, or ecological improvement, subject to certain conditions. The Environment Agency needs to be notified of the intention to use the exemption.</p>

	<p pid="d.142.1/2" qnum="HL6298">In the absence of behavioural change, what would be the annual cost to the Exchequer of (a) abolishing lower rates of stamp duty on residential property transactions while retaining stamp duty at 4 per cent on transactions over &pound;500,000; and (b) abolishing the 1 per cent rate of stamp duty on residential property transactions while leaving other rates and thresholds unchanged.</p>

	<p pid="d.142.2/1">If all lower rates of stamp duty on residential transactions were abolished and only the 4 per cent rate for residential transactions over &pound;500,000 was retained, the cost for 2007-08 is estimated at &pound;4.3 billion. If the 1 per cent rate of stamp duty for residential transactions between &pound;125,001 and &pound;250,000 was abolished, the cost for 2007-08 is estimated at &pound;1 billion.</p>
