	<p pid="a.147.5/1">Cranfield University is actively engaged on the cabin air sampling programme, and about 40 per cent of the planned flights have now been tested by a scientist on-board. The timetable is constrained by the five participating airlines and by resources, as the samples are being taken by named individuals who have received special briefing by Cranfield to ensure a consistent methodology and secure chain of custody for delivering the samples to the laboratories for analysis. It is likely that this phase of the research will last until the spring. The findings will then be peer-reviewed before being published as a whole. I hope that this will prove possible as soon as practicable.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.3/1">Claimants to employment and support allowance who are awarded benefit enter a 13-week assessment phase during which the work capability assessment, which determines continued entitlement to benefit, is conducted. We have set the assessment phase at 13 weeks because that is the estimated time taken to complete the assessment process for almost all claimants.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/2">The 13-week period applies to most claimants for reasons of equity. It would be unfair to move some customers onto the higher main phase rate of benefit earlier than others because of circumstances beyond their control. There are exceptions for people who are terminally ill or for people who have previously claimed and returned to the benefit under the linking rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/3">During the assessment phase, the benefit is paid at the same level as jobseeker's allowance, which helps reduce perverse incentives to claim employment and support allowance rather than jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/4">Under employment and support allowance, claimants receive an increased rate of benefit at the 14th week, much sooner than under the incapacity benefits system, where higher rates are typically payable after a year of incapacity.</p>

The target will be achieved through progressive tightening of the building regulations&mdash;by 25 per cent (relative to 2006 regulations) in 2010, 44 per cent in 2013 and then zero carbon in 2016. A consultation paper on the detailed definition of zero carbon new homes is due to be issued shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/2">The 2016 taskforce (jointly chaired by the Minister of Housing and the chief executive of the Home Builders Federation) meets regularly to oversee implementation of the zero carbon new homes policy. The industry has set up a delivery body, the Zero Carbon Hub, which was launched earlier this year to help identify and tackle barriers to delivery and to engage with industry and other organisations which will be responsible for delivery. Further information about the Hub can be found at its website at <a href="http://www.zerocarbonhub.org">www.zerocarbonhub.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/3">In addition to changes to the building regulations, the code for sustainable homes is intended to guide industry in the design and construction of sustainable homes. It sets out standards, which are above the regulatory minimum, for the sustainability of a house as a whole, including, energy, water, materials, waste and ecology. The rating of all new homes against the code became mandatory from <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-01">1 May 2008</phrase>. Homes that are built on English Partnerships' land need to build to at least code level 3 and homes that are designed and built with funding from the National Affordable Housing Programme need to be built to code level 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/4">The Government are encouraging a range of exemplar developments of different sizes and types which demonstrate low-carbon technologies. These include eco-towns, the Thames Gateway and, on a smaller scale, English Partnerships' Carbon Challenge. Our planning policies on climate change, including the new planning policy statement on climate change, expect new development to be planned to limit carbon dioxide emissions and sustainability appraisal to be used to shape planning strategies that help achieve this.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-11-14a.161.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100821" speakername="Lord Young of Norwood Green" colon=":" colnum="161"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81114w0004.htm#81114w0004.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.161.2/1">The national enterprise academy (NEA) is looking to develop its first operational centre (hub) in the south-east, with satellite centres across the other English regions. The south-east hub and a satellite centre in the north-west are both scheduled to open to students in September 2009. In its third year of operation, the academy plans a rapid expansion to the other seven regions in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">It is not for Government to determine the precise location of national skills academies, but all are expected to have a national reach. National skills academies are employer-led organisations and the boards of each academy will decide how best to meet the needs of employers within each region. This will include whether the region should have a physical centre, virtual or mobile facility.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.4/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.4/2" qnum="HL5893">What is the extent of the spread of bleeding canker (Phytopthora cactorum and P. citricola) in horse chestnut trees and other species in the United Kingdom; what is the extent of the threat of that disease to horse chestnut trees and other species; and what action they are taking against that threat.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-11-14a.161.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="161"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81114w0004.htm#81114w0004.htm_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.161.5/1">Infection of horse chestnut trees by both Phytophthora cactorum and P. citricola is relatively uncommon and gives no cause for concern. It has also been recorded on lime. However, in recent years bleeding canker of horse chestnut has been more widely reported throughout the country and this is now known to be caused by a bacterial disease, Pseudomonus syringae pathovar aesculi, not previously recorded in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/2">Bleeding canker can sometimes kill its host, or it can weaken it until it becomes unsafe and needs to be felled. Some trees do show signs of remission, although it is not yet known if this leads to permanent recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/3">The Forestry Commission carried out a survey of 2,629 horse chestnut trees in 2007 to determine the extent and severity of symptoms of the disease. This showed that 49 per cent of all trees assessed displayed symptoms which could be caused by this new disease. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/4">There is currently no known treatment against bleeding canker. The Forestry Commission is now testing whether healthy trees, growing in close proximity to infected specimens, have a degree of genetically inherited resistance which raises the possibility that these trees could form the basis of future generations.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.1/2" qnum="HL5895">Whether they plan to ban the import, sale, growing and introduction into the wild of water primrose (Ludwigia species) in the United Kingdom.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-11-14a.162.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="162"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81114w0004.htm#81114w0004.htm_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.162.2/1">The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it illegal to plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild any plant listed on Schedule 9 to the Act. It also contains the power to ban by order the sale of specified non-native species. In 2007-08 Defra and the Welsh Assembly consulted publicly on proposals which included adding Ludwigia grandiflora and Ludwigia peploides to Schedule 9, and also banning their sale. Consultation responses are currently being considered. There are no powers under the Act to ban importation or growing in a contained environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/2">In Scotland, amendments to Schedule 9 and proposals to ban the sale of certain species are being taken forward separately under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. The Scottish Executive recently consulted on proposals to add Ludwigia species (except Ludwigia palustris) to Schedule 9 and banning their sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/3">In Northern Ireland, proposals to ban the sale of certain species are being taken forward under a review of the Wildlife (NI) Order 1985. The Department of Environment in Northern Ireland recently consulted on proposals to add Ludwigia species to Schedule 9 to the order. The schedule identifies non-native species which, if established, could impose considerable risk to biodiversity. In that respect they are subject to enhanced control and enforcement measures. There are no powers under the 1985 order to ban the importation or growing in a contained environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/4">As stated in the <I>Invasive Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain</I>, we plan to identify what further legislative powers may be needed to tackle the issue of invasive non-native species.</p>
