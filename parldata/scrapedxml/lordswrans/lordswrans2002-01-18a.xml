Furthermore, 21 counties took five years or more to adopt a revised plan from issue of the relevant RPG.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.6/1">The Government have no single definition of a rural area. At present we use different definitions for different policy purposes. For instance, in deciding how to target help to local authorities which were hardest hit by foot and mouth disease we used a definition of &quot;rurality&quot; developed by the Countryside Agency. We recognise that there is a need for a more co-ordinated approach to the use of definitions of urban and rural areas. For that reason DEFRA, the Countryside Agency and the Office for National Statistics are working with the DTLR to better define urban and rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.2/1">Progress on the Pennine Bridleway was slow in 2001 due to the foot and mouth outbreak which prevented access to land for construction work. Activity to date has been on the section, from Middleton Top in Derbyshire to Long Preston in North Yorkshire, funded through the Countryside Agency and Sport England Lottery Fund. The length completed and future targets for this section are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.184.2/4"> <td>Total length</td> <td>Completed by 2001</td> <td>Completed by 2002</td> <td>Completed by 2003</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.184.2/8">In 2002 a key target is to open the Mary Towneley Loop&mdash;a 42-mile circular section in the centre of the Pennine Bridleway. This will be available to horse riders, off-road cyclists and walkers. A map and accommodation and services guide will be published. The accommodation, stabling and other associated businesses are gearing up for this opening. It is hoped that the Pennine Bridleway will be fully open during 2004.</p>
