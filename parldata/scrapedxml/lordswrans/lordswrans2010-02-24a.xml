	<p pid="a.300.2/1">The attached tables show the standard breakdowns of burglary incidents presented in Home Office statistical bulletins.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.2/2">The British Crime Survey (BCS) is the best guide to long-term trends as it has had a consistent methodology over time and includes crimes that are not reported to or recorded by the police. However, incidents as measured by the BCS are estimates based on a survey and cover only domestic burglary. Figures are provided for the number of incidents of burglary between 1999 and the 2008-09 BCS (Table 1) for all available survey years; a 42 per cent fall in the number of incidents over this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.2/3">Police recorded crime incidents of burglary are also provided, for every year between 1999-00 and 2008-09 (tables 2 and 3). Recorded crime figures produce whole counts of crime that are recorded by the police but are affected by changes in levels of reporting to the police, police activity and recording practices. Police recorded crime statistics were affected by the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002; hence it is not possible to directly compare figures prior to 2002-03 with those for later years. Recorded crime figures include burglaries that occur not only in domestic properties, but also in commercial or other properties.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.3/1">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) uses data on deaths collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to estimate the number of excess deaths during the flu (winter) season as a proxy for influenza related deaths. Other factors, for example, hypothermia, are also likely to contribute to the number of excess deaths. These figures are available at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2009/hpr3909.pdf">www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2009/hpr3909.pdf</a>.</p>

Some of these will have had influenza as a contributory factor, but it is not possible to say what proportion. The HPA will estimate whether there have been excess deaths during 2009-10 when the data for this period are released by the ONS later in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.3/3">A short time after the start of the current pandemic, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for England set up a confidential investigation into pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza related deaths in England. From this, we can ascertain with a greater degree of accuracy and with greater speed, when compared to normal measurements of seasonal influenza mortality, the number of pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza related deaths which have occurred. As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-18">18 February 2010</phrase>, there have been 309 pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza related deaths in England. These figures are available in the CMO's bi-weekly bulletin found on the department's website at <a href="http://www">www</a>. dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Flu/Swineflu/DH-112078.</p>
