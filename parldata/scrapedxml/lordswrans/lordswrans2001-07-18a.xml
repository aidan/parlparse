	<p pid="a.123.2/1">Successive governments have carried out campaigns since 1987 to encourage householders who may be at risk from radon to reduce their exposure. By 1998 every home in England with a greater than 5 per cent probability of being above the radon &quot;Action Level&quot; had been offered a government-funded radon test. Approximately 400,000 measurements have been carried out in total, and 40,000 homes found to be above the Action Level. In July 2000 <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1107" name="Michael Meacher">my right honourable friend the Minister for Environment (Mr Michael Meacher)</phrase> announced a new radon programme. The department is working in partnership with 31 local authorities over a two to three-year period to encourage householders to carry out remedial work to reduce radon concentrations where these are found to be above the Action Level. This follows successful pilot studies carried out in conjunction with three local authorities. The National Radiological Protection Board has calculated that around 100,000 homes will be above the Action Level throughout the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.0/56">Consultation on proposals for regulations under Section 68 will take place shortly. Laying of draft regulations before Parliament is planned for the autumn. Consultation on proposals for regulations under Sections 94 and 95 will start in July 2001, with a closing date for responses in October 2001 and a provisional target date of December 2001 for bringing the regulations into force. We have no firm dates for the Section 98 regulations, although we hope to go out to public consultation towards the end of the year, and lay draft regulations early in 2002.

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">The department does not hold information on the proportion of pupils who are taught particular languages in public sector schools. Information which is available on numbers who enter for a foreign language GCSE in England, however, indicates that about 68 per cent take French and around 27 per cent take German.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/2">It is not our policy to promote specific languages, although French and German remain the most popular subjects for study in secondary schools. Pupils have a statutory entitlement to learn at least one foreign language from the age of 11, and we want to support and enhance opportunities for language learning in primary schools. We have already published a scheme of work for primary French and materials for primary German. We have done a great deal to strengthen the position of foreign language teaching in schools, particularly through the Specialist Language Colleges. The expansion of the Specialist Schools programme, with their role as &quot;hubs&quot; of excellence, will provide enhanced opportunities for primary schools to access language expertise.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">24 April</phrase>, my honourable friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Beverley Hughes) announced the activation of the Bellwin scheme to provide emergency financial assistance to local authorities to help them meet some of the costs of responding to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. This scheme is based on Section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which permits only the reimbursement of expenditure incurred by local authorities on, or in connection with, the taking of immediate action to safeguard life or property, or to prevent suffering or severe inconvenience, in their area or among its inhabitants. Funding rate relief for small businesses does not, therefore, fall within the scope of this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Minister for the Environment announced an increase in the central government contribution to local authorities to fund rate relief from 75 per cent to 95 per cent for small businesses which are suffering hardship as a result of foot and mouth disease in 151 rural authorities in England. This applied for an initial period of three months. Details of the arrangements were given in Special Grant Report No. 80, which was laid before the other place and approved by Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-02">2 April 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/3">A new Special Grant Report No. 86 was debated and passed in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 16 July</phrase>. It continues the terms of SGR No. 80 for a further six months, so the grant will be available for the period <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>. It also extends the terms of the scheme to provide more grant to the worst affected authorities. Any eligible authority which grants relief worth in total more than 8 per cent of its net budget requirement will receive central funding of 98 per cent for spend above that level, as opposed to 95 per cent below it (75 per cent through the pool in the usual way plus special grant of either 20 per cent or 23 per cent). Grant will also be available to 37 specified authorities in the worst affected areas for relief given to properties up to &pound;50,000 rateable value, as opposed to &pound;12,000 rateable value in the other 114 rural authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/4">In addition authorities covered by Special Grant Report No. 80 will benefit from a temporary reduction of 50 per cent in contributions to the National Non-Domestic Rate Pool between April and August.</p>
