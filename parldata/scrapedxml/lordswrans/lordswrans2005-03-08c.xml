	<p pid="c.75.8/1">Ofsted's report into literacy and numeracy standards published on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase> found a great deal to celebrate in our primary schools. The report draws attention to the significant improvements in attainment since the introduction of the national literacy and numeracy strategies, and makes clear that last year the quality of teaching and school leadership continued to improve.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.8/2">Her Majesty's Chief Inspector's annual report found that around three quarters of primary teaching in mathematics is excellent or good, which compares to just half in 1997-98. The support offered to teachers through the primary national strategy (formerly the national literacy and numeracy strategies) has been critical in enabling this transformation. Of course we remain absolutely committed to providing every teacher with the knowledge and skills to ensure that their teaching progresses from satisfactory to good and excellent. Next year the national strategies will offer training in core aspects of literacy and numeracy through local authorities to around 12,000 teachers in English and 15,000 teachers in mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.8/3">We also remain committed to supporting schools to implement fully the primary national strategy. We are providing targeted and intensive support to around 850 lower performing schools across the country, and 10 per cent of our most successful headteachers are supporting a further 4,700 schools on leadership and raising standards. The improvements in the past year in standards to the highest ever levels show the success of our approach.</p>

The difference is because Gibraltar is the only overseas territory formally considered part of the United Kingdom in terms of the UK's membership of the European Union (EU), and so entitled to the benefits of EU membership, including home tuition fees for their students.

	<p pid="c.77.2/2">Moreover, UK Sport has endorsed a new investment strategy to reinforce the best performing sports, support those that are developing and provoke change in those that are underperforming. There is a sharpened focus on those sports and individuals who demonstrate the potential to deliver on the biggest stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.77.2/3">Seventy-five per cent of available resources will be allocated on the basis of proven performance at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, and 25 per cent based on a sport's future potential for improved performance. As a result, 14 Olympic sports will receive enhanced funding between 2005 and 2009 from a total summer Olympic investment of &pound;75 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.78.3/1">The Department of Health is not aware of any methods of partial booking in London that are inconsistent with national policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.3/2">Partial booking was introduced as an interim measure, which recognised that, for some specialties, there were long waits that made it impractical for both the National Health Service and the patient to book an appointment at the time of the referral decision. Under partial booking systems, patients are advised of the approximate waiting time at the time of referral and are then contacted approximately four to six weeks in advance to choose a time and date for their appointment or admission.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.3/3">As waiting times continue to fall, we expect more appointments to be booked at the time of the referral decision. With the introduction of the electronic choose and book system, all patients referred by their general practitioner for an outpatient appointment will have the opportunity to make an appointment at the time of referral.</p>

	<p pid="c.78.6/1">Since the Ouse Washes was listed by the UK on the convention's Montreux record a Ramsar advisory mission (RAM) took place in November 2001 resulting in a RAM report being submitted to Defra in January 2003. The report recognised that the complexity of problems means that there is no quick fix solution, and highlighted that long-term integrated solutions will be necessary for the Ouse Washes to be restored to a favourable condition. The report also recognised that impressive efforts had already been made by stakeholders to solve the problems on the Ouse Washes.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.6/2">Defra and its agencies have continued efforts to work with stakeholders to identify and develop lasting solutions to the problems, considering the recommendations of the RAM and taking account of other studies. The Environment Agency has invested considerable sums in new sluices to help control flood water on the washes, and has been leading a working group to consider technical solutions to the problems. It has also been necessary to undertake further studies to establish the hydro-ecological requirements for the site, and to identify the long-term remedies as acknowledged by the RAM.</p>
