	<p pid="a.19.2/1">The British Grand Prix is an important global showcase for the UK motorsport industry which is estimated to contribute approximately &pound;5 billion annually to the national economy. In addition it brings about &pound;30 million to the local economy over the Grand Prix weekend. In light of these factors, the Government felt that the wider national interest would be best served by speeding up road improvements and thereby providing the best available road access for this year's event.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">The Secretary of State has already placed a copy of Stephen Byers's direction to the Highways Agency of <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-28">28 February 2002</phrase> in the Library (Hansard No. 70237, col. 1253W). I am today placing in the Library a copy of the submission from David York, Highways Agency Operations Director, referred to in the direction. This provides more detail on the decision to accelerate the work on the Silverstone Bypass.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.8/1">There have been a number of cases this year in which Roman Catholic clergy have been refused entry to Russia or have had their visas cancelled. After Bishop Jerzy Mazur and Father Stefano Caprio had their visas refused in April, the European Union with our support sought explanations from the Russian authorities. We also regularly raise our concerns about religious freedom in Russia bilaterally with the Russian authorities. We did so most recently during annual human rights talks on <phrase class="date" code="">27 September</phrase>. We shall continue to press for improved access to Russia for Catholic priests in future.</p>

We will continue to stay in close touch with the Indonesian authorities on these issues.</p>

They met a number of ministers and discussed the difficulties involved in implementing the Malino Agreements and ways they could be resolved. The Indonesian Government have since held a series of consultative discussions with signatories of the agreements involved in the Malino process to try to find a solution to the recent difficulties.</p>
