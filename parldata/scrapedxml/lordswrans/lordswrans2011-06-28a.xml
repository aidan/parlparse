Overall, this Government will deliver at least 250,000 more apprenticeship places over the lifetime of this Parliament than the previous Administration planned. The latest statistical first release data show that we have delivered 326,700 apprenticeship starts in the first nine months of the 2010-11 academic year. This is 114,000 more than the previous year, and more than double our ambition.</p>
	<p pid="a.386.0/2">The apprenticeships programme is demand led. We rely on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities to meet local and sectoral demand taking advantage of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the further education system. For example, in the aerospace industry Rolls-Royce is training more apprentices than they need themselves which will deliver more qualified people to work in the supply chain.</p>

	<p pid="a.393.5/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) leads the cross-border fuel fraud enforcement group, which was formed in 2008 to bring together representatives from law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border. This group shares intelligence and co-ordinates activity against the illegal fuel trade, from single offenders to highly organised criminal gangs.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.5/2">As a result, HMRC has developed closer working with partner agencies, and has been increasingly successful in taking effective action against fuel launderers, increasing the numbers of arrests of those running laundering plants or allowing their premises to be used for such activity. In 2010-11, for example, HMRC closed down 21 laundering plants and arrested 18 fraudsters, compared with 20 and 12, respectively, in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.5/3">HMRC aims to continue to develop and refine its testing and detection techniques: for example, research is currently being carried out into improving the markers used in rebated gas oil (&quot;red diesel&quot;) to eliminate the avoidance of tax by using this fuel as road fuel. A number of the existing techniques developed by HMRC have been adopted by other EU enforcement agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.2/1">Healthcare in Gaza is provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees, with the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah holding responsibility for providing drugs and medical disposables to facilities in Gaza. The most recent assessment of healthcare provision by the World Health Organisation is of deterioration in the quality of care as a result of Israeli movement and access restrictions, and political and institutional separation between the West Bank and Gaza. The most serious issue is the shortage of essential drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.2/2">Where treatment is unavailable in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority pays for patient referrals to external providers, including Israeli hospitals. Rates are negotiated bilaterally and reflect the costs of providing treatment in each case.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.5/1">Reports from United Nations (UN) agencies working in the Gaza Strip confirm there are no shortages of cooking oil in Gaza. We are however concerned about the availability of cooking gas, following the breakdown of the pipeline which supplies cooking gas from Kerem Shalom into Gaza five weeks ago. While supplies entering through tunnels from Egypt mean there are currently no shortages on the ground, we are working with the UN to press the Government of Israel on the urgent need to repair the pipeline, in order to maintain a secure and sustainable supply of cooking gas to meet the needs of the Gazan population.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.8/1">We remain gravely concerned by the level of unemployment in Gaza, which continues to be among the highest in the world. While the announcements by the Israeli Government in June 2010 and February 2011 to ease access restrictions were positive steps, recent reports from the United Nations show that economic stagnation and de-development in Gaza remain the norm. We are clear that more needs to be done, including easing restrictions on exports, construction material imports and the movement of people, to enable a return to economic normality and address the high levels of unemployment in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.8/2">The UK regularly raises Gaza with the Israeli Government. We believe that an improved economy and access to work is not only essential for the people of Gaza, but also firmly in Israel's security interests. We are taking practical steps to improve access to Gaza through our support to the UN Access Coordination Unit, our capacity building work with the Palestinian Authority and our work with the Office of the Quartet Representative on confidence building measures to facilitate exports from Gaza. We are also working to promote business regeneration through our facility for new market development, supporting 304 companies in Gaza to generate jobs for over 1,800 unemployed Gazans.</p>

The chemicals regulation directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive has reviewed the paper <I>Roundup and birth defects</I> and noted that the EU assessment considered studies cited in it and found no evidence for such concerns. CRD also considered that some citied studies were unlikely to be relevant to humans. The forthcoming EU review of glyphosate will consider all relevant evidence concerning the substance. The current approval was extended to 2015 in order to allow sufficient time for the review procedure to be properly completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.407.8/1">The situations in Darfur and Libya were referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a result of the international community's concerns that serious crimes were being committed, and that steps needed to be taken to ensure that these allegations were properly investigated and those responsible were held to account. Israel, as with Libya and Sudan, is not an ICC state party and an ICC investigation in to events in that country would require either a United Nations Security Council referral, or for Israel to accept the court's jurisdiction. The Foreign Secretary made clear at the time of the flotilla incident that we deeply deplored the loss of life. The Security Council and the European Union also condemned the violence. Our goal remains ensuring full accountability for the events which occurred. There have been various investigations into this issue. It is now important that the United Nations Secretary-General's panel of inquiry headed by former New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer completes its report into this incident, drawing fully on the evidence available. We will give careful consideration to this report in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.411.5/1">Part 6 of the Banking Act 2009 updated, strengthened and modernised the regulatory regime governing commercial banknote issuance in the UK and passed the responsibility for regulation to the Bank of England. The primary aim was to ensure that holders of commercially issued banknotes received a level of protection similar to that provided to holders of Bank of England banknotes.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.5/2">Since the new legislation came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-23">23 November 2009</phrase>, authorised banks have been required to back their note issue in full and at all times. This would include any notes not returned as part of Northern Bank's 2005 note recall. Reporting under the regime does not, however, require declaration of notes by series.</p>

	<p pid="a.417.5/1">We are extremely concerned about the reports of air and other attacks on civilians in Southern Kordofan and are monitoring the situation closely. We continue to believe that the best solution is a cessation of hostilities, and a negotiated settlement between the two parties. We are calling for this urgently and are supporting the AU-led mediation between the two sides. We are also requesting that the Government of Sudan allow UNMIS to remain in Southern Kordofan and neighbouring Blue Nile State after <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-09">9 July</phrase>. We note that it would be highly challenging militarily, logistically and financially to enforce and sustain a no fly zone, even were the Security Council to authorise it, something we judge extremely unlikely at the moment.</p>

Figures for the 2008-09 academic year have been excluded as they are not directly comparable with those for 2002-03 to 2007-08 and 2009-10, due to a change in the way parental or student occupation information was gathered.
