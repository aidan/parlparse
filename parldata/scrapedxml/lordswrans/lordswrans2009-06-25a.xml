Long-term International Migration (LTIM) is the most comprehensive measure of long-term international migration, and is based mainly on data from the IPS, supplemented with data on flows to and from the Republic of Ireland. Other data sources are used to make adjustments for asylum seekers and their dependants not counted by the IPS and for switchers (people who change their intentions and, therefore, their migratory status). LTIM was previously referred to as Total International Migration or TIM.</p>
