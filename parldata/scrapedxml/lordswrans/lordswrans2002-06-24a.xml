We continue to urge Algeria to comply fully with all its obligations under international human rights law, including the investigation of human rights violations, and to allow visits by Special Rapporteurs. The EU Troika did not specifically raise during its recent visit the request to visit Algeria made by the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions. The EU mission did press the Algerian authorities for a response to the list of the &quot;disappeared&quot; which had been sent by the Presidency in April 2001 and which was also raised by the Presidency in December 2001.</p>

Despite substantial progress in developing ideas for a solution, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were not able to reach agreement. Nevertheless Camp David and Taba may well have established a framework for handling these issues in the future.</p>

A continuous professional development package for primary teachers has been delivered by trained secondary teachers. A self-analysis &quot;toolkit&quot; for schools to be used to identify what they are doing about food throughout the curriculum, school meals, tuck shops and out of school activities is being developed. These complement the National School Fruit Scheme which is now reaching 300,000 children in 2,300 schools. Other aspects of the programme are being developed and will be implemented shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.5/1">We recognise that the National Health Service over many years has suffered from a lack of national standards, outdated barriers preventing the NHS getting the best out of its dedicated staff, no independent inspection system, and&mdash;too often&mdash;by the NHS not putting the needs of patients first. It is not surprising, therefore, that the NHS Clincial Governance Support Team found examples where services were not patient-centered.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/2">However a set of policies, programmes and structures were introduced in 1997 to improve the quality of care and patient safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/3">This programme was first set out in the White Paper The New NHS: modern and dependable. It was developed further in A First Class Service: Quality in the new NHS which identified three main themes for improving quality in the NHS; clear national quality standards, ensuring local delivery and systems for monitoring delivery. The programme was then expanded and strengethed in the NHS Plan which was published in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/4">The NHS Plan takes the quality agenda further, emphasising improving customer service and patient/citizen representation. The NHS Plan is about doing things differently: new ways of working, partnership and inclusivity, placing the patient at the heart of everything that we do. It is, in a very real sense, a chance to prove that a universal public service can deliver what people expect in today's world.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/5">Delivering the NHS Plan&mdash;next steps on investment, next steps on reform (April 2002) sets out how we will ensure that the extra money agreed in the 2002 Budget is spent to best effect in improving the health and well-being of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.5/1">This was a quiet Council with a relatively thin agenda. Bill Stow, the Deputy Permanent Representative to Brussels, represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/2">The Council agreed a general orientation on a proposal to extend the provisions of Regulation 1408/71 to nationals of third countries legally resident in a member state. The European Parliament will now give an opinion. Council also discussed Chapters I and II of a regulation to simplify Regulation 1408/71, which co-ordinates the member states' social security systems in respect of persons moving within the EU. This dossier is subject to a German reserve which the Presidency hopes will be lifted before the Seville European Council, allowing an agreement on a general orientation to be reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/3">The Council also agreed a general orientation on the European Co-operative Statute, which consists of a regulation and a directive on employee involvement. The European Parliament will be re-consulted on this amended Commission proposal, including the change of legal base.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/4">The Council reached political agreement on a directive amending Directive 83/477/EEC on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/5">The Council adopted two Resolutions at this meeting: the first, on a Community strategy on health and safety at work, is broadly similar to the recent Commission Communication; the second follows up the Commission's recent Action Plan on Skills and Mobility.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/6">There was a lunchtime discussion on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which endorsed the Opinions of the Employment Committee and Social Protection Committee, stressing the importance of a balanced approach to economic, employment and social issues. A number of delegations, including the UK, argued that member states should do more to co-ordinate policies at national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/7">The rest of the (shortened) meeting was taken up with reports on Spanish Presidency activities over the past six months, including: a Presidency report on the Barcelona Spring Council; the presentation of a paper on a Study and Guide that the Presidency had drawn up on methods of tackling violence against women; and a Presidency report on gender mainstreaming in different Council formations and the stuctural funds. The Presidency also provided reports on recent conferences, including the UN World Conference on Ageing.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/8">The Social Protection Committee presented its report on social protection in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/9">Under &quot;Any Other Business&quot;, the Commission presented its plans for a directive on agency workers, following the failure of the social partners to reach agreement last year; and a recommendation on the health and safety of self-employed workers. Both of these are likely to appear at the next Employment and Social Policy Council in Luxembourg in October.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.0/2">Some of the poplar trees used were grown in the UK. Two consents were issued to Zeneca (now Syngenta) in April 1995 and December 1996 respectively to grow genetically modified poplar trees in Zeneca's premises in Berkshire. The research work was licensed and subject to the strict regulations controlling the deliberate release of GMOs. The trees were derived from a female clone and incapable of producing pollen, so there was no risk of interaction with other trees. The trees in the trial were also maintained in a juvenile state and therefore not permitted to flower.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/3">Both trials were terminated in July 1999 following an attack by vandals. After felling, the stumps of the trees were treated with a proprietary systemic herbicide and removed in March 2000. The plots have been monitored regularly by Zeneca for poplar volunteers and none has been detected.</p>
