	<p pid="a.143.5/1">The recent developments in climate science and in the analysis of potential impacts referred to in the First Report of the Committee on Climate Change are advances in these fields that have been made since the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommended that the UK should reduce CO2 emissions by 60 per cent by 2050 in its report published in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/2">These advances are summarised in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report (which summarises scientific research in these areas published or in press up until 2006) or, in the case of more recent material, published in peer-reviewed academic journals. The specific developments are outlined on page 9 of the report, and include advances such as:</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/3">work on the carbon cycle has highlighted the danger that global warming will reduce the rate of absorption of atmospheric CO2 by terrestrial carbon sinks, indicating that for any given level of manmade emissions there will be a higher long-term increase in CO2 concentrations and hence temperatures;increasingly, models have estimated the warming caused by all greenhouse gases, including non-CO2 gases;research has shown that atmospheric pollution is likely to have masked about 0.3&deg;C to 0.5&deg;C of the greenhouse gas-induced warming that would otherwise have occurred this century;the reduction in summer Arctic sea ice extent in recent years has been at the high end of model predictions and the summer melt of the Greenland ice sheet has accelerated; and there have been advances in our understanding of the range of potential climate change impacts, their regional variation and the possibility of abrupt or irreversible changes. For example, there is new and stronger evidence of observed impacts of climate change on unique and vulnerable systems, with increasing levels of adverse impacts as temperatures increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">At the 14th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Poznan, Ministers from key developed and developing countries signed a statement outlining their commitment to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and encourage sustainable forest management and conservation. The agreement to these principles is an important step towards reaching agreement on including forests in a future climate change agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/2">The statement covers the following key principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/3">criteria for national strategies, recognising that national ownership and commitment to REDD in developing countries is a precondition for success;the need for a reliable framework for monitoring, reporting and verification which is crucial to the integrity and credibility of REDD efforts;recognition that financial flows to REDD efforts must be substantial, results based and predictable in the long-term; and,the importance of transparency, co-operation and rationalisation between funding agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/4">There is currently a large investment gap in efforts to develop an international REDD demonstration framework. Recognising this, the UK will make a contribution of up to &pound;100 million to support and address the transformational investment needs of countries to make the reforms necessary to reduce deforestation and degradation.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/5">The funding will provide support to countries seeking to initiate change towards low carbon emission and climate resilient sustainable forest management. It will help to demonstrate and implement the measures required for a country to reduce overall emissions from forestry and potentially access payments from a future REDD funding mechanism.</p>

Counselling is one of the modalities of psychological intervention approved by NICE for treating depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">We are increasing the availability of these services in primary care through the improving access to psychological therapies programme (IAPT). IAPT aims to help primary care trusts (PCTs) implement NICE guidelines and improve access to psychological therapies in England for people with depression or anxiety disorders. It is supported by a significant national investment rising to &pound;173 million by 2010-11.

	<p pid="a.146.0/1">There are two reasons for the increase in drinking water inspectors since 2001: additional duties when new regulations came into force in 2004 and the introduction of competition following the Water Act 2003 which has increased the number of licensed operators. Their operational area is England and Wales. Inspectors interact with water company staff and contractors on a daily basis independently assessing, advising and reporting on all the technical aspects of water supply operations and water testing integral to the provision of safe drinking water to the public.</p>

Therefore, bacon cured in Britain with imported pork can legally be labelled as British. Nevertheless, the Food Standards Agency considers that, in some cases, such labelling may not be helpful for consumers. It, therefore, produced voluntary guidance in 2002, recently revised, to help industry comply with the law and adopt best practice. This recommends, for example, that bacon produced in Britain with imported pork should say so on the labelling.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">The report by Zuram Kachlishvili which was published in a Georgian newspaper alleges that a person known as Teona is involved in the preparation of fraudulent applications for UK visas and that her Georgian contacts who work in the visa section at the British Embassy in Tbilisi are being paid to facilitate the issue of visas.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/2">Senior embassy officials have confirmed that they had no prior knowledge of these allegations. They have contacted the newspaper in an attempt to identify the applications concerned, and the matter has been passed to the UK Border Agency's International Group (Operational Integrity Section) for further investigation.</p>
