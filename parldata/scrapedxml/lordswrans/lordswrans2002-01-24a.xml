	<p pid="a.215.5/1">Peer reviewed scientific data comparing the mortality rates of UK Gulf veterans to an era group of service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf was published for the first time in the Lancet on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-01">1 July 2000</phrase>. Updates to these figures were provided by the Ministry of Defence to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-20">20 July 2000</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-22">22 January 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-19">19 July 2001</phrase>.

The figures as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase> are shown in the table.</p>

Slightly fewer Gulf veterans have died from disease-related causes than have those in the control group, whereas the number of Gulf veterans dying of external causes is a little higher than for the control group. These differences are similar to those shown by the figures published in July 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.2/1">We are today publishing a consultation document entitled Consultation on possible changes to the Use Classes Order and temporary uses provisions. This completes the series of consultation papers that together are designed to deliver a radical reform of the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.2/2">Planning permission is required for a material change of use. However certain uses are so similar, for example in terms of noise, traffic, appearance and parking, that there is no obvious reason why planning permission for change of use from one to the other should be required. The use classes order (UCO) excludes from planning control any change of use where both the existing and proposed use fall within the same class. The general permitted development order (GPDO) provides further flexibility by classifying certain moves between the use classes as permitted development, so that a developer does not need to apply for planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.2/3">It is important that the use classes order should be up to date and relevant and reflect current policy priorities. In our view, the order and related GPDO provisions should be constructed in a way which allows the maximum possible freedom from planning control consistent with delivering planning policy and wider objectives, including protecting amenity.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.2/4">The consultation document sets out a range of options for changes to the use class provisions and temporary use provisions. We will consider responses carefully before deciding on the most appropriate way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.5/1">The regional planning guidance for the East Midlands (RPG8) is being published today.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/2">The RPG sets out the spatial development strategy that encompasses proposals for the development of the region's economy, infrastructure, housing and other land uses. The guiding principle is that the main urban areas and previously developed land should be the preferred locations for most development. RPG also sets out proposals for the conservation, management and enhancement of the region's natural and cultural environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/3">I am pleased that much of the format and content of RPG8, including the vision, objectives and core strategy, carries forward much of what was proposed in the original draft RPG prepared by the East Midlands Regional Local Government Association (EMRLGA). RPG8 reflects very effective working between EMRLGA, local authorities and other stakeholders, all of whom have made valuable contributions to refine and enhance the original draft strategy. It builds on the new inclusive process for preparing RPG that the Government have put in place. The RPG was prepared before our planning Green Paper proposals were announced in December. I look to the regional planning body to take the strategy forward and to monitor and review it in line with the regional planning principles set out in the Green Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/2" qnum="HL2355">How many asylum seekers and refugee children are currently without a school place; the local education authority areas in which they are located; the average time they are likely to wait to be provided with formal education; and the implications of any delay for compliance with human rights and race relations legislation.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-01-24a.219.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="219"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020124/text/20124w02.htm#20124w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.219.2/1">The education of children of asylum seekers and refugees is the responsibility of local education authorities (LEAs) and the process of admitting them to school is no different from that which applies to any other child. It is not possible to specify either the number of these children who are without a school place or the LEAs in which they are located. To collect such data would be a very complex exercise and a considerable burden on schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/2">LEAs allocate school places to children of asylum seekers and refugees as quickly as possible. However, we recognise that as the majority of these children arrive during the school year it will often happen that school's places will already have been allocated before they arrive in an LEAs area. Where this happens, an LEA is still required to make arrangements for them to receive suitable education until a school place can be found.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/3">Children of asylum seekers and refugees have the same right as any other child to access the education system in the United Kingdom. The right to education, however, does not give rise to the right to be admitted to any particular school. Provided that the proper steps to remedy any shortfall in school places have been taken and that suitable education is provided until a school place can be found, we believe that LEAs will have complied with their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/4">LEAs must also comply with the provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976. They must ensure, therefore, that the children of asylum seekers and refugees awaiting a school place are not treated any less favourably than any other child on racial grounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.2/1">Currently, courses of study in chiropody (podiatry) offered in the United Kingdom that lead to eligibility for state registration include degree or honours degree level. The minimum qualification required for state registration is one approved by the chiropodists board of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine as conferring sufficient knowledge and skill to practise the profession. There is no minimum requirement for other non-state registered practitioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.5/1">I am advised that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission aims to respond to all correspondence as quickly as is practicable, by acknowledgement initially if a substantive response requires more time. I understand that the commission's normal turn around for correspondence is within a week of receipt, although in some instances it can take longer. The Northern Ireland Office target for answering correspondence is ten working days. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's stated normal response time therefore appears to me to be within acceptable limits.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.8/1">In principle there is no reason why a Peer who has requested it could not be sent a copy of a Written Answer on request. In practice, no formal arrangements have been put in place by the House to enable Peers to make such requests but this should not prevent departments sending a copy of an Answer by e-mail if the Peer lets them know he would like it. If the House would like to formalise this, the Cabinet Office would be happy to liaise on behalf of departments on how this should be done.</p>
