	<p pid="a.31.5/1">I welcome Sir Jeffery Bowman's recommendation. It has been 43 years since the last thorough review of tribunals. The number of tribunals has grown greatly since then. There has also been a fundamental change in the nature of, and pressures on, their work. I have therefore decided that there should be a wide-ranging, independent review of tribunals.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/2">Its terms of reference will be:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/3" class="indent">&quot;To review the delivery of justice through tribunals other than ordinary courts of law, constituted under an Act of Parliament by a Minister of the Crown or for purposes of a Minister's functions; in resolving disputes, whether between citizens and the state, or between other parties, so as to ensure that:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/4" class="indent">There are fair, timely, proportionate and effective arrangements for handling those disputes, within an effective framework for decision-making which encourages the systematic development of the area of law concerned, and which forms a coherent structure, together with the superior courts, for the delivery of administrative justice;</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/5" class="indent">The administrative and practical arrangements for supporting those decision-making procedures meet the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights for independence and impartiality;</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/6" class="indent">There are adequate arrangements for improving people's knowledge and understanding of their rights and responsibilities in relation to such disputes, and that tribunals and other bodies function in a way which makes those rights and responsibilities a reality;</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/7" class="indent">The arrangements for the funding and management of tribunals and other bodies by government departments are efficient, effective and economical; and pay due regard both to judicial independence, and to ministerial responsibility for the administration of public funds;</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/8" class="indent">Performance standards for tribunals are coherent, consistent, and public; and effective measures for monitoring and enforcing those standards are established; and</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/9" class="indent">Tribunals overall constitute a coherent structure for the delivery of administrative justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/10" class="indent">The review may examine, in so far as it considers it necessary, administrative and regulatory bodies which also make judicial decisions as part of their functions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/11">The review will be led by Sir Andrew Leggatt, supported by Dame Valerie Strachan, and a team of expert advisors. It will operate in an open, consultative way, involving and seeking views from as wide a range of interests as possible. I have asked Sir Andrew to report to me by <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.3/1">Of the $100 billion of debt relief promised under the enhanced HIPC initiative, approximately $30 billion will be provided as relief under traditional debt relief mechanisms (Naples terms rescheduling from Paris Club creditors). The remaining $70 billion of debt relief will further reduce the debts of countries that would otherwise have had unsustainable debt burdens remaining, even after traditional debt relief mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/2">In the case of Tanzania, the assistance provided by the HIPC Initiative will amount to $2 billion--more than half of the country's total debt. The assistance provided by the IMF will cover on average 58 per cent of debt-service obligations to the Fund and the World Bank's assistance will cover over 69 per cent of Tanzania's debt service obligations to the Bank. Overall, the assistance provided under the HIPC Initiative will mean that Tanzania's ratio of debt service to exports will fall from 25 per cent to approximately 9.5 per cent in 2000-01 and then to 5 per cent in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-12">12 May</phrase> the Beef Management Committee agreed to a Commission proposal to remove the weight limit on payments for all cattle entering the Over Thirty Months Scheme. This will take effect for all cattle entering the scheme on or after <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-05">5 June</phrase>. This delivers on a key element of the Government's Action Plan for Farming. It is worth &pound;20 million a year in payments to UK farmers and will also increase asset values. It will be of particular benefit to those running suckler herds.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">We estimate that local education authorities undertake around 9,000 prosecutions a year of parents whose children are not attending school regularly. But in 80 per cent of cases, parents do not turn up in court and are fined in their absence. To challenge this culture amongst some parents that education is not important, we are proposing the rise in the level of the offence for non-attendance at school. More detailed information on the numbers found guilty and average fines is, however, not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.3/1">Fresh Start is not a programme but an option for local education authorities to tackle failure. A Fresh Start requires the closure of a &quot;failing&quot; school and the opening of a new school on the same site. It offers a radical approach to securing school improvement for failing schools showing insufficient evidence of recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/2">Fresh Start policy is at its infancy--only 15 schools have undergone a Fresh Start to date, 11 secondary and four primary. Three opened in September 1998, eight in September 1999, two in January 2000, one in April 2000 and one in May 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.3/28">At the end of the spring term 2000, 446 schools were deemed to be &quot;failing&quot; and in need of special measures. A Fresh Start is planned for eight of these schools by the local education authorities concerned in September 2000. The schools are in Sheffield, Bristol, Hackney, Bournemouth, Essex, Stockport and Northamptonshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/29">So far, local education authorites have met the costs associated with the Fresh Start process using a variety of existing funding sources, including the Standards Fund and New Deal for Schools. The costs of Fresh Start will vary and details are not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/30">In line with the Government's ambitious new targets that all schools should achieve 20 per cent five GCSEs at Grades A*-C by 2004 and 25 per cent by 2006, all schools gaining less than 15 per cent 5A*-C at GCSE over three years must consider a Fresh Start. The Government is intending to make &pound;60 million of capital funding available for Fresh Start schools and City Academies this year and an additional &pound;13 million will be made available to cover the transition costs of setting up the new schools and embedding best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/31">Fresh Start has been an option for some of the hardest cases. The schools are new and fragile, and there are no quick fixes. But there are early signs of improvement in the first schools. Exam results are up and truancy down--to a marked degree.</p>
