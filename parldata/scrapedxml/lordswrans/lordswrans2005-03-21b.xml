If the court gives permission to the Secretary of State to make the order, the court will give directions for a hearing in relation to the order as soon as reasonably possible after it has been made. At both the consideration of permission and the substantive hearing, the court will consider the question of whether the control order is necessary for purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.8/1">In relation to Iraq, Professor Christopher Greenwood QC was first instructed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-13">13 March 2003</phrase>. He was retained to assist in relation to legal issues arising from the Iraq conflict, but was not instructed to advise on whether military action would be lawful.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.8/2">It is not possible to give a date when Professor Greenwood ended his assistance in relation to this issue. He has been instructed on a number of occasions by government departments in relation to a variety of different legal issues relating to the conflict and its aftermath and is currently acting in the case of <i>R</i> (on the application of Al-Skeini and others) v <i>the Secretary of State for Defence</i> concerning civilian deaths in Iraq, which has now reached the Court of Appeal.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.8/3">Over the same period, Professor Greenwood was instructed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office and the Cabinet Office in relation to a number of other legal issues not connected to the Iraq conflict. Details of the issues on which Professor Greenwood has been instructed to provide legal advice are withheld on the grounds that this would disclose information related to the formation of government policy. Professor Greenwood has, however, acted for the Government in relation to a number of cases in the domestic and international courts during this period: the Ojdanic case in the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; <i>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</i> v <i>United Kingdom</i> in the International Court of Justice; the General Assembly request to the ICJ for an advisory opinion on the Palestinian wall (UK observations on admissibility); <i>R</i> (on the application of the European Roma Rights Centre and others) v <i>Immigration Officer at Prague Airport and others</i>; and <i>R</i> (on the application of Abbasi and Mubanga) v <i>the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and others</i>. Professor Greenwood also acted in relation to the individual SIAC appeals and the SIAC derogation appeal before the Court of Appeal and House of Lords, although he did not appear in court in these cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.8/4">Information about Professor Greenwood's professional fees is not held centrally as he has been instructed by several different government departments. While every effort has been made to provide full and complete information, records do not exist to verify precisely what fees have been charged on all matters going back to January 2003. The best information that can be obtained is that, as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-21">21 March 2005</phrase>, his professional fees in relation to work connected with the conflict in Iraq amounted to approximately &pound;46,000 (excluding VAT). As at the same date, his fees in relation to other matters amounted to approximately &pound;53,500 (excluding VAT).</p>

	<p pid="b.6.2/1">The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 provides that a country may freely appoint its own nationals as members of the diplomatic staff of its diplomatic mission. However, the consent of the receiving state is required where a person is a national of the country he is appointed to represent and also a national of the receiving country or is a national only of the receiving state. Whether or not a person holds the citizenship of a third country is not relevant to his or her acceptance as a member of a mission. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would not consider British nationality a bar to the appointment of a person to the diplomatic mission of a country of which they are also nationals. As indicated in my reply to the noble Lord on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-10">10 January 2005</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. WA 3&ndash;WA 4), we estimate that fewer than 10 members of diplomatic missions in London hold British citizenship, but that accurate details could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.2/2">The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 also provides that receiving states may reserve the right to consent to the appointment of a third country national, who is not also a national of the sending country, to the diplomatic staff of a mission. Any such request would be considered on its merits. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is not aware of any current appointments that would fall into this category.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.2/3">The appointment of other categories of staff (administrative and technical and service) at diplomatic missions is not subject to any nationality considerations.</p>

The use of standards in the United Kingdom is normally on a voluntary basis so the Ministry of Defence does not specifically &quot;adopt&quot; standards. Instead, it seeks to ensure that its project managers select the most appropriate standard to meet their requirements from the full range of civil, commercial and military standards in accordance with an order of preference or hierarchy. This hierarchy gives preference to a British standards implementation of a European standard.</p>

Hence existing European standards that have been implemented by British standards should be used in preference to UK defence standards, if they meet our requirements. A number of defence standards have already been cancelled as a result of such implementations.

It is able to analyse these data in a variety of ways such as according to habitat type, location or condition, or cross reference it with other data sets. There is, however, no standard definition of a beach or a definitive list of all beaches in England. Therefore, no comprehensive data are currently available on English beaches with which to cross reference the data on SSSIs. Some 362 SSSIs have part of their area between mean high water and mean low water marks. The total area of these 362 sites is 355,000 hectares and will include large muddy inter-tidal areas such as the Wash and Morecambe Bay, as well as sandy or shingle areas known as beaches. Using data from the Environment Agency, 302 of the designated coastal EU bathing waters are found within 210 SSSIs in England.</p>
