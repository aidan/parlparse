	<p pid="a.101.5/2">ContactPoint moved into its first phase of delivery in January 2009 when 19 early adopter organisations, comprising 17 local authorities in the North West of England and two national voluntary sector partners&mdash;Barnardo's and KIDS&mdash;began to train their ContactPoint management teams. In parallel, all local authorities started to shield a small proportion of records on ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/3">Early adopter organisations have now started to train a limited and controlled group of practitioners to use ContactPoint. These practitioners, who must all go through stringent security checks and training before accessing the system, are being carefully monitored in order to evaluate their experience of using the system. From June to August 2009, ContactPoint management teams in the remaining local authorities and national partner organisations will be trained. This will enable them to make local preparations for wider deployment to users.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The process for reappointing a chair and other board members of the Equality and Human Rights Commission differs from the process of making new appointments as there is no requirement to advertise a post should a decision be taken to reappoint a current member. Reappointments are governed by time and performance criteria set out by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. There is no guarantee of any reappointment being favourably considered. To be considered for reappointment members must have performed satisfactorily during their current term. The Government Equalities Office has ensured there is an appropriate performance assessment process in place to provide the necessary evidence for considering any reappointments. The Minister for Women and Equality has the final decision on reappointments based on performance assessments.</p>

If sufficient progress has not been made by 2013 in the voluntary reporting, we will prepare regulations to require reporting of specified information.

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">The Government do not hold data on the size of the UK rat population. However, the latest report on rodent presence in domestic properties as revealed by the English House Condition Survey data for 2002-03 and 2003-04 is available on Defra's website. Key findings are that the occurrences of rats inside and outside properties in these years are not significantly different from those observed in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/2">The former Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food funded an assessment of resistance to rodenticides in 1998. This was published in: Kerins, G.M.; Dennis, N.; Atterby, H.; Gill, J.E. &amp; MacNicoll A.D. (2001) Distribution of resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides in the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus Berk.) in England 1995-98. In: <I>Advances in Vertebrate Pest Management Volume II</I> (Eds. H-J Pelz, D.P Cowan &amp; C.J. Feare) pages 149-159, Filander Verlag, Furth.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/3">The Health and Safety Executive is aware from literature that rats may be becoming increasingly resistant to anticoagulant rodenticides. Although it is aware of the research mentioned above, it is not aware of any new studies and has not itself commissioned any recent work of this nature. The department is currently considering if it is possible to allow more effective rodenticide to be deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/4">Under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949, local authorities have a duty to take such steps, as may be necessary, to secure, so far as is practicable, that their districts are kept free from rats and mice.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.2/1">There are currently three funded programmes with an element of one-to-one literacy support in primary schools. The Every Child a Writer programme and the one-to-one tuition programme (which covers English and mathematics) are delivered solely by qualified tutors. A qualified tutor is:</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/2">someone with qualified teacher status (QTS);an overseas qualified teacher eligible to teach in schools in England;a newly qualified teacher in the summer before he or she attains QTS; andsomeone with teaching and subject-specific qualifications from the higher or further education sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/3">In the third programme, Every Child a Reader, the intensive support reading recovery element is delivered only by a trained teacher. The Fisher Family Trust Wave 3 materials are delivered one-to-one by a teaching assistant.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/4">The total cost of the one-to-one tuition programme and the tuition element of the Every Child a Writer programme is &pound;468 million in this Comprehensive Spending Review period. This figure includes the cost of paying qualified tutors to deliver the tuition. During the school day, tutors are paid according to the pay scale set out in the school teachers' pay and conditions document. Outside the school day, tutors are paid a suggested set rate, which was calculated based on teacher pay scales, research into the private tuition market and experience from the Making Good Progress pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/5">In addition primary schools are able to access help from volunteers to support children's reading, both locally organised programmes, and through national charities such as Volunteer Reading Help, which is supported by a government grant of &pound;150,000 in this year. In 2008-09 some 4,500 children received one-to-one support from VRH-trained volunteers typically in two half-hour sessions twice a week throughout the school year.</p>
