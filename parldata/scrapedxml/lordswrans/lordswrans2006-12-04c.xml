	<p pid="c.90.5/1">The UK Government have consistently provided voluntary financial contributions in support of the clean development mechanism (CDM) in line with the Kyoto scale. For 2006, the UK provided $740,000. With current pledges paid and a levy on credits being taken to cover administrative expenses of the mechanism, it is expected that no further such contributions will be needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.90.5/2">The Government are on track to meet their Kyoto target and are therefore not intending to purchase credits from the CDM for compliance. However, the Government are purchasing credits from CDM projects to offset emissions from air travel undertaken in the course of official business. These will be sourced from small-scale energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The Government are facilitating involvement of businesses in the CDM market by approving the participation of companies not only from the UK but further afield. The list of 183 approved projects up until November 2006, which covers a range of different mitigation activities, is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/internat/kyotomech/documents/cdm-dna-approvals.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/internat/kyotomech/documents/cdm-dna-approvals.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.90.5/3">The CDM market has grown enormously in the past year, with an estimated 1,300 projects and1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the pipeline to 2012. The UK is the major private sector participant in the CDM market, with UK companies participating in some 28 per cent of currently registered CDM projects and with an estimated $2 billion of private funds invested in London.</p>

	<p pid="c.91.2/1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a methodology for calculating the relative climate effects of different greenhouse gases. This provides the relative contribution of a tonne emission of each gas, relative to the effect ofa tonne emission of carbon dioxide integrated over a fixed time period. A 100-year time horizon has been chosen in view of the relatively long time-scale for addressing climate change. This factor is known as the global warming potential (GWP).</p>
	<p pid="c.91.2/2">GWPs are given in the table below for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. These were published by the IPCC in its third assessment report.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.91.2/5"> <td>Gas</td> <td>GWP</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.91.2/6"> <td>Carbon dioxide</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.91.2/7"> <td>Methane</td> <td>23</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.91.2/8"> <td>Nitrous oxide</td> <td>296</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.91.2/11">The GWP values used for calculating national greenhouse gas emissions reported to the United Nations framework convention on climate change are by international agreement taken from IPCC's second assessment report and differ slightly from the values shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.2/12">Taking account of GWPs and the level of emissions of different gases, the UK greenhouse gas inventory shows that in 2004 carbon dioxide accounted for about 84 per cent of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Methane and nitrous oxide contributed about 8 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Research conducted by the Hadley Centre takes account of the detailed effects of these gases on the climate including the interactions between the gases, the oceans and the terrestrial biosphere.</p>

	<p pid="c.104.5/1">The investigation of competition cases, and the approach adopted in doing so, is a matter forthe Office of Fair Trading. I have therefore asked the office to provide a response to the point raised by the noble Lord. This is reproduced below.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.5/2">The Office of Fair Trading receives around 1,200 competition complaints each year. It cannot pursue all of these complaints and thus uses a set of published criteria to assist in prioritising those cases that it should take forward. These criteria are used to help the OFT judge how best to use its limited resources; maximising its impact for the benefit of UK consumers. The most recent set of criteria were published in October 2006, but related criteria have been in use since autumn 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.5/3">Subject to strategic questions around the best mix of cases for the OFT to pursue (including whether the OFT is itself best placed to pursue a particular matter), the OFT's prioritisation criteria for competition cases are set out in the following six steps:</p>
	<p pid="c.104.5/4">an estimate of the direct consumer benefit that would result from intervention&mdash;or, in other words, the consumer harm that would be reduced/removed by taking action;deterrent effect&mdash;including any estimate of the wider consumer detriment reduced/removed as a result of deterrence;any aggravating or mitigating factors;the precedent, policy or profile value of the particular case;an estimate of the OFT resources required to achieve the desired outcome in the case; andan estimate of the likelihood of success.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.5/5">Any predation case, whether involving national or local firms, would be assessed against these criteria and a decision reached on whether OFT action was warranted as a matter of administrative priority. These criteria permit the OFT to take forward all forms of predation cases, whether involving national or local firms. For example, a &quot;local&quot; predation case might not be rated highly on step 1 of the above criteria but might rate higher on some other criteria, in particular deterrence or precedent value. Equally, a &quot;national&quot; case may be rated highly on step 1 (for example, because of the greater number of consumers affected), but then less well on other steps.</p>

	<p pid="c.111.5/1">Under the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) is entitled to a 50 per cent share of revenues from oil production in southern Sudan. State governments in both northern and southern Sudan are also entitled to at least 2 per cent of revenues from oil produced in their state. An independent National Petroleum Commission, comprising representatives of the national Government, GOSS and oil-producing state governments, has been set up to monitor oil revenues sharing arrangements. Oil production and revenue data are also made available to the public on a monthly basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.5/2">Once oil revenues are transferred to GOSS or southern state governments, the funds are spent according to GOSS and state government financial regulations. These are presently being improved and strengthened with support from the international community. The World Bank manages a trust fund for southern Sudan to which a number of donors (including UK) have pledged a total of$103.9 million. The fund is in support of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and programming has been developed through consultation with the Government of Southern Sudan and a national needs assessment exercise. As manager of the fund, the World Bank carries the responsibility for ensuring that donor contributions are safeguarded. All projects approved for funding are subject to World Bank fiduciary regulations and procedures and it is our view that these are applied rigorously.</p>
