The caseload forecasts are driven primarily by changes in the estimated recipient populations for other benefits to which entitlement to housing benefits is related. There are no direct assumptions made for changes in the take-up of housing benefits. If necessary, off-model caseload adjustments are used to reflect the impact on take-up of future policy changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.23.5/1">We are concerned by the lack of political progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). BiH's politicians need to reach agreement on police reform and achieve full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague so that BiH can sign its stabilisation and association agreement with the EU. Constitutional reform will also be necessary if BiH is to deliver effective governance for its citizens and carry out the reforms that the EU accession process will require. Over the past year, we regret that BiH's political leaders have not made more sustained efforts to work together constructively to move BiH closer towards the EU and NATO. We regularly express our concerns about the lack of political progress bilaterally, through the EU and in conjunction with the Office of the High Representative/EU Special Representative (EUSR). We welcome the recent appointment of Miroslav Lajcak as High Representative and EUSR.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.5/2">The security situation in BiH has been stable for some time. Our concern over the current political situation does not give rise to concern over the security situation. Indeed, on the basis of clear military advice from the operation commander we, along with EU partners, decided to reduce the numbers of troops deployed in BiH from around 6,500 to around 2,500 earlier this year. This process is now complete. We continue to provide capacity building assistance on security, policing and rule of law.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.5/1">We are not in a position to comment on another country's nationality laws. Under British nationality law, a British national is able to hold other nationalities concurrently with their British nationality. When an individual provides evidence that they have been recognised as a national of another country, this does not affect their entitlement to British nationality. Therefore, if an individual holds British overseas citizen status and a Nepalese certificate of citizenship, we have to assume that the individual is a dual national until the Nepalese authorities tell us otherwise.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.3/1">This Government do not make forecasts of future electricity supply. However, the most recent projections of energy and carbon emissions<sup>(1)</sup>, including Energy White Paper proposals, suggest that the proportion of gas used in electricity generation in the UK is projected to supply 35 per cent to 38 per cent by 2010 and between 44 per cent to 59 per cent by 2020. This range reflects the uncertainty, expressed in Energy White Paper<sup>(2)</sup>, on policy delivery. With respect to UK households heated by gas, the assumption built into the domestic sector gas demand is approximately 80 per cent of homes in 2010 and 2020. The majority of these homes will have gas central heating and a small proportion will not.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.6/1">The Government are committed to moving towards more sustainable low-carbon non-residential buildings which are more energy efficient, and we will continue to raise building standards to help achieve this. A key element of maximising the energy efficiency of buildings is ensuring that they are suitably insulated. Raising building standards will act as a further driver for improving insulation and green roofs offer one possible solution for delivering better insulated buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.6/2">Green roofs can also be a form of source control for attenuating the run-off of surface water (ie comprising one element of SUDS (sustainable drainage systems)). Defra is promoting the use of all forms of SUDS while at the same time acknowledging that not all forms are appropriate in all circumstances and that there are currently some obstacles to their wider uptake. The most significant obstacle is that of the adoption of some drainage (conveyance) elements of public SUDS systems. Defra is intending to consult on options for the adoption and the long-term funding of maintenance of these systems later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.6/3">Green roofs will generally not fall into this category and will normally be the responsibility of individual building owners. Defra, along with other government departments, has been promoting green roofs and other elements of source control (such as porous paving) as part of wider sustainable construction and will continue their active promotion.</p>

These annual service levels are expressed mainly in terms of units of dental activity, which measure courses of treatment according to their relative complexity. Dental providers who under-deliver by up to 4 per cent may carry this forward and make up the activity in the following year. Where a provider has delivered less than 96 per cent of the agreed annual service level, it is at the PCT's discretion whether the undelivered activity is carried forward to the following year or an appropriate proportion of the annual contract sum is refunded to the PCT. This is a matter for PCTs to decide locally in the light of individual circumstances, and their decisions are not collected or held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="b.29.5/1">In making net financial allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) for National Health Service dental services, it is only possible to make indicative assumptions about the levels of income that will be raised from patient charges in each PCT area.

	<p pid="b.29.5/2">Where the level of patient charge income is below the indicative amount assumed in a PCT's allocation, this does not affect the level of services agreed under existing contracts.

The 2006 reforms established, for the first time, a statutory duty on primary care trusts (PCTs) to provide or commission dental services to reflect local needs. The proposal to move resources for dentistry into PCTs' main health budgets from 2009-10 is designed to reinforce further the importance of developing dental services, based on the same principles that underpin commissioning of other NHS services, including public and patient involvement and professional engagement.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.8/2">The department is supporting a wide-ranging programme to help PCTs develop dental services both now and in the longer term, including supporting PCTs in assessing local needs and developing commissioning strategies, building on additional investment of some &pound;400 million in the last three years and a further &pound;100 million programme of capital investment, spread over 2006-07 and 2007-08, in premises and equipment. To support continued growth in the NHS dental workforce, the department has also invested in a 25 per cent expansion in undergraduate dental education, with the first students from this expanded programme due to graduate and begin their NHS vocational training in 2009.</p>

As part of the Contact Group (France, Germany, Italy, Russia, UK and US), we worked closely with UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari during the 15 months of intensive negotiations he held between Belgrade and Pristina.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.8/2">The UK fully supports the UN Special Envoy. His proposals, which provide for independence for Kosovo, supervised by the international community, hold out the prospect of a better future for all the peoples of Kosovo and for enhanced stability in the region. They are well judged and represent compromises for both sides. They contain generous and far-reaching guarantees protecting the rights of Kosovo's Serb and other non-Albanian communities. These would be monitored and upheld by the international community through its continued presence in Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.8/3">The Special Envoy's proposals would finally give Kosovo clarity over its future, enabling the Balkan region to draw a line under the conflicts of the recent past and look forward to a future with a European and Euro-Atlantic perspective.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.2/1">We continue to be concerned about extra-judicial killings in the Philippines and have raised the issue with the Philippine Government on a number of occasions. We have seen Judge Melo's report and welcome the steps announced by President Arroyo in response to recommendations made in the report and are waiting to see how these measures are implemented. We also welcomed the visit by Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings, to the Philippines in February and will encourage the Philippine Government to follow both his initial recommendations and those in his final report when it is published. President Arroyo has requested technical assistance from the EU to support the Philippine Government's efforts to address extra-judicial killings. The EU sent a needs assessment mission to the Philippines in June to identify what areas of technical assistance might be required. The UK supported the mission by providing a UK expert in witness protection and prosecutorial systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.5/1">Neither our embassy in Manila nor the EU has the resources to make a detailed analysis of these killings. However, we share the view expressed by UN special rapporteur Philip Alston that the number is much too high. As he also made clear, the problem of extra-judicial killings in the Philippines does not just affect left-wing activists. Political violence associated with the recent national elections led to the deaths of politicians from all parties, as well as supporters, innocent bystanders and election officials. Other groups who have been targeted include journalists, lawyers and judges, while in some towns there are allegations of vigilante death squads targeting criminals. Many of the killings are attributed to private actors, with motives allegedly including land and business disputes, political rivalry and the protection of criminal interests.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.2/1">We expect the limit values to be met in the majority of locations within the allotted timescale through existing national measures already in place or planned to come into effect. We are currently updating our national air-quality strategy, which considers additional policy measures that may be needed to help us achieve national and European air-quality standards. The new strategy will be published this summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/2">In the UK, compliance problems are not widespread&mdash;they generally apply at highly localised hotspots (such as street corners, which are greatly influenced by traffic). In 2006, most people (around 99.9 per cent of the population) were already breathing air that complied with the limit values. In those areas where improvements in air quality can be made, local authorities are required to designate air-quality management areas under Section 83 of the Environment Act 1995 where air quality objectives are not being, or are unlikely to be, met. Around 200 local authorities have designated air quality management areas to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.2/3">Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management places a statutory obligation on the Government to produce a plan which explains action that we will take to bring areas of exceedence back into compliance. A copy of the latest plan is available on the Defra website.</p>

	<p pid="b.43.5/1">We have been committed to widening the take-up and accessibility of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) since the Choosing Health White Paper in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.5/2">The department has made sustained efforts to identify and remove barriers to access to nicotine replacement therapies for smokers wishing to quit.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.5/3">To this end, the department has worked with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the pharmaceutical industry and has revised the licensing rules on the use of NRT. This means that young people from 12 to 18 years of age, pregnant women, people with heart, kidney or liver disease and diabetics are now instructed that they can now use NRT and get it free on prescription from the National Health Service in line with the rest of the smoking population.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.5/4">Restrictions on long-term use of NRT or in combination with smoking while trying to quit have also been relaxed.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.5/5">The majority of NRT products are available from non-pharmacy outlets and work is in progress that may increase this number.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.5/6">Although the best option is to quit smoking abruptly, if this is not possible, smokers may use some NRT products to cut down before stopping smoking altogether. In addition, some NRT products are also available to manage cravings in situations where smoking should be avoided such as:</p>
	<p pid="b.43.5/7">where second-hand smoke may damage others, especially children, eg in enclosed spaces such as private vehicles or in the home;before surgery; andon a flight or during hospital stay.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.5/8">We expect the take-up of NRT to rise significantly following <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July</phrase> when the &quot;smoke-free&quot; law took effect in England, as it did in Scotland when &quot;smoke-free&quot; was introduced there last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.5/9">In addition, HM Treasury has reduced the VAT on NRT products from 17.5 per cent to 5 per cent for a period of one year from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase> to encourage great use of this proven aid to successfully stopping smoking.</p>
