However, in the light of the recent High Court judgment in the case of R -v- Legal Services Commission and Lord Chancellor's Department ex parte Jarrett, I intend to amend the criteria used to decide exceptional applications for funding in cases that are outside the scope of the scheme. The Legal Services Commission will shortly publish a new draft for consultation and it will take effect as soon as possible after that. Meanwhile, the commission will use the criteria in the consultation draft in deciding whether to refer applications to me under s.6(8)(b) of the Access to Justice Act 1999.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/19">(2) A fomite is defined as any inanimate object capable of carrying the virus.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/20">Windborne spread has not been a feature of the current epidemic because only 10 pig herds have become affected so far. Pigs are the major source of virus for windborne spread because of the relatively large excretion of virus from their respiratory tracts, as compared to that from cattle, sheep and goats.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/21">Local spread is the attributed source of infection when infected premises are within 3km of another infected premises and there are a number of possible sources such as farm machinery and vehicles, contaminated roads, feed lorries and local aerosol transmission. The last of these is impossible to attribute specifically to individual infected premises as it cannot be distinguished from other means of local spread.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/22">Itinerant contract workers have been identified as the most likely source of infection for a number of infected premises associated with personnel in the above table. Wild animals have not been identified to be the source of infection for any infected premises. No outbreak has been specifically attributed to recreational walkers. Provided they follow the advice and guidance provided, the risk of spread by walkers is very small.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.3/3">The Office of National Statistics (ONS) places great importance on the quality of the information collected through the deaths registration system and constantly seeks to ensure that this remains fit for purpose, reliable and authoritative.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/4">Doctors are required to certify all deaths to the best of their knowledge and belief. They should describe the sequence of diseases or injuries which led to the death, and other conditions which may have contributed to it. The earliest event in the sequence is the underlying cause of death. Guidance notes on completion are contained in every book of death certificates. These follow the recommendations of the World Health Organisation and national legal requirements. These notes were thoroughly updated in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/5">According to ONS statistics, about 6,000 people die with diabetes as the underlying cause of death in England and Wales each year. Since 1993, ONS has also published statistics using all the conditions mentioned on the death certificate. These show that 18,500 have diabetes mentioned on their death certificates but not as the underlying cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/6">Most people dying today have a number of diseases, conditions and complications. It is up to the attending doctor to decide what contribution each disease makes to the death. ONS ''instructions to certifiers'' and training material aim to help them to do this accurately and consistently.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/7">ONS produced a video and other training material for medical students and doctors on how to certify cause of death. These were sent to all medical schools and postgraduate deans in England and Wales, and continue to be distributed. ONS is exploring other ways of providing training and advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">Successive governments have imposed a range of requirements which apply to all motorway service areas (MSAs). These, though, are essentially safety related, day to day management of MSAs being a matter for their private sector operators. It is disappointing that the survey reported in the Sunday Times found that, in these respects, operators here compared poorly with their European counterparts. I do not believe it is for the Government to intervene in the running of private businesses but we are considering what scope exists to increase competition in the MSA sector with the aim of improving standards across the board.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.5/1">No simple comparisons can be made. Most European countries base fares solely on distance travelled. The UK fares structure is much more commercially based. A wide range of fares are offered, ranging from full-fare full-flexible tickets at rates often higher than many European countries through to highly-discounted advance purchase tickets at rates often less than for comparable journeys abroad. A number of European train services are now beginning to follow UK practice in developing more market-based pricing.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.0/2">The e-Envoy has, however, long advocated greater involvement with the private sector in the electronic delivery of government services. There are a number of forms such co-operation can take, but the e-Envoy has focussed particularly on the private sector's role in helping present e-government services to citizens and businesses in a customer focused and joined up way. For example, the Office of the e-Envoy is building on work with the Post Office, Ihavemoved.com and simplymoved.com. on the Change of Address Portal, and the Inland Revenue is working with various organisations which provide alternative ways of completing tax returns.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.3/1">UK online: the broadband future set a new target--for the UK to have the most extensive and competitive market for broadband in the G7 by 2005--and outlined a series of actions to help achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/2">In every country the broadband market is at a very early stage, it is therefore more relevant to measure availability of broadband services as a foundation for market evolution. In the UK, 50 per cent of households are now served by a broadband-enabled exchange, according to the OECD. This places the UK on a par with Italy and Australia and ahead of Japan, France and Holland.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/3">Cable companies in the UK and abroad are rolling out broadband cable modem services and licences for broadband fixed wireless access have been issued for areas covering 60 per cent of the population. Together, this represents a firm foundation for continued rapid growth in adoption of broadband services in the UK. Independent research from Datamonitor &amp; IDC, featured in UK online: the broadband future, anticipates that the UK will have a higher percentage of households connected to broadband than the majority of its G7 and EU competitors by 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/4">Progress has also been made on reducing the cost of broadband services. The last Oftel report showed that business broadband services in the UK are cheaper than France and in some cases Germany. The cable companies, ntl and Telewest, whose networks pass 50 per cent of UK households, offer broadband services at prices which are among the lowest in the OECD.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/5">Prices over xDSL broadband technologies are relatively expensive: however, the Government are increasing competitive pressure through the local loop unbundling process to help drive prices down. The e-Envoy has also suggested that BT and other operators consider offering lower specification, lower cost, entry products of the sort which have encouraged uptake in some other markets.</p>
