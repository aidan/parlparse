	<p pid="a.29.5/1">Under the Immigration Act 1971, immigration officers are able to refer persons seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom, including those seeking asylum, to medical inspectors at ports of entry. Paragraph 36 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395) sets out the circumstances in which immigration officers may refer an individual to a medical inspector for examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/2">Current policy is to refer for medical examination any persons who mention health or medical treatment as a reason for their visit, or who appear not to be in good mental or physical health, or who intend to remain in the United Kingdom for more than six months and come from an area of the world which is high risk for tuberculosis. In addition, the Immigration Rules state that those seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom for more than six months should normally be referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/3">People applying abroad for entry clearance to the United Kingdom are not subject to mandatory medical inspections, but the entry clearance officer has the same discretion as an immigration officer to refer applicants for entry clearance for medical examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/4">In addition, asylum seekers attending the induction centre at Dover are given basic health screening, which includes full medical history and tuberculosis screening and referral (as appropriate).

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">There are published criteria governing the issue of work permits, which are applied to all work permit applications irrespective of the sector in question. These criteria are designed to safeguard the interests of the resident labour force while meeting the need of employers to recruit workers with the skills that they need. All applications are checked to ensure that the requirements of the work permit arrangements are met and Work Permits (UK) may also conduct post-issue checks to establish that the work permit arrangements are complied with. The criteria of the work permit arrangements are kept under regular review by Work Permits (UK).</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/2">However, Work Permits (UK) does seek to ensure that operation of the work permit arrangements, and, in particular, the list of those occupations which should not be subject to a resident labour search requirement, reflects labour market conditions in specific sectors. Work Permits (UK) works closely with IT Industry bodies, trade unions and other government departments, which are represented on its Information Technology Communications and Electronics Sector Panel, to review the availability of suitably qualified IT workers in the resident labour market. On the advice of this panel, IT occupations were removed from Work Permit (UK)'s shortage occupation list in September 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/1">33 Field Hospital was intended to be the first United Kingdom field hospital to deploy to the Gulf, as at the time it was the field hospital held at the highest level of preparedness. Its equipment, however, was prevented from leaving port by Greenpeace protestors. A 25-bed element of 22 Field Hospital, a regular unit, was flown to theatre as a stopgap to offset the delayed arrival of 33 Field Hospital. Once in theatre, 33 Field Hospital deployed and prepared an operational field hospital within the UK concentration area in northern Kuwait. As the UK force built in size, additional medical units were required; 34 Field Hospital, a regular unit but with significant reservist augmentation, followed by 202 Field Hospital (Volunteers), a Territorial Army unit. The latter subsequently took over from 33 Field Hospital in situ. This enabled 33 Field Hospital to act as a flexible reserve, a task for which it was better suited than the other field hospitals.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-11a.33.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="33"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030611/text/30611w02.htm#30611w02_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.33.8/1">In the Written Statements by my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary of <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-11">11 April</phrase> (Official Report, Commons, 38&ndash;39WS) and <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-30">30 April</phrase> (Official Report, Commons, 15&ndash;16WS) in another place he described UK force level adjustments to reflect the evolving strategic situation in Iraq, including the call-out of up to 1,200 reservists. In the subsequent Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May</phrase> (Official Report, Commons, 44&ndash;45WS) in another place, he announced the call-out of a further 1,500 reservists to support continuing operations within Iraq. We continue to assess the requirements for a continued UK presence in Iraq in support of the Iraqi people. This process is dependent on a number of factors, including progress made against our military campaign objectives, and multinational contributions to stabilisation operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/2">Positive discussions continue with a number of nations regarding military deployments to Iraq. We have so far received commitments from seven countries for contingents comprising a total of around 5,500 personnel to contribute in the UK area of operations. A Danish Marine battalion has already arrived, and is making a valuable contribution to Coalition operations in Al Qurnah.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/3">Overall 25,000 UK servicemen and women have returned from operations in the Gulf&mdash;more than half those originally deployed. Some 17,000 UK servicemen and women currently remain in the region. We will maintain a balanced and flexible force to suit the operational situation in Iraq. To this end, we are now in a position to announce a number of further adjustments to our forces in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/4">Since the Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-30">30 April</phrase> in another place, we have continued where possible to scale back our military presence within Iraq and the surrounding region. The maritime presence in the Gulf now comprises two frigates, currently HMS &quot;Richmond&quot; and HMS &quot;Chatham&quot;, and a nuclear-powered submarine, supported by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels &quot;Brambleleaf&quot; and &quot;Diligence&quot;. On current plans, we envisage maintaining a maritime presence at this level for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/5">For land forces, the planned withdrawal of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and of other land personnel which he announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-30">30 April</phrase> in another place is now complete. In addition to the movements set out in that statement, 16 Air Assault Brigade has now been withdrawn including 3 Parachute Regiment and 3 Army Air Corps. We have also withdrawn the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, 1st Battalion The Light Infantry, the Queen's Royal Lancers and 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/6">These adjustments will be followed by the replacement of HQ 1 (UK) Armoured Division with HQ 3 (UK) Armoured Division, which we anticipate will complete by mid-July. As we have previously announced, we envisage that 19 Mechanised Brigade will deploy within the same timescale, and preparations are under way to prepare for and to facilitate this movement. HQ 102 Logistic Brigade completed its hand-over to HQ 101 Logistic Brigade in early May as planned, and the brigades' sub-units are currently engaged in a phased rotation. When fully assembled, these units will represent a total of around 10,000 servicemen and women.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/7">Around 90 fixed-wing aircraft and some 80 helicopters have returned following the highly successful contribution of the Royal Air Force and the Joint Helicopter Command to the Coalition air campaign. The deployment of the 1st Air Control Centre to Tallil to contribute to an overall ground-based radar picture over Iraq has allowed for the withdrawal of our two deployed E3D aircraft. The Royal Air Force now has 8 Tornado GR4s remaining in theatre with a number of supporting aircraft. In addition, the Joint Helicopter Force retains a balanced rotary-wing presence, 18 helicopters comprising Chinook, Sea King, Lynx and Gazelle helicopters.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/8">Since the Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-30">30 April</phrase> in another place, around 850 additional reservists have been accepted into service, and the call-out process continues. Our reservist men and women continue to play a vital role in supporting stabilisation operations in Iraq, in accordance with the aims of the Strategic Defence Review that the reserve forces should be more integrated, relevant and useable. In parallel to the call-out process, we have so far demobilised over 1,700 reservists who have returned from Iraq as a part of the wider programme of withdrawals.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/9">We pay tribute to all of the men and women who have contributed so successfully and professionally to the military campaign in Iraq. We continue to assess the situation as military operations contribute to the gradual return of stability to the country, and to respond in an appropriate manner; our presence will continue to be dictated by the requirements of Iraq and the Iraqi people. The House will be kept informed of any further significant developments.</p>

Neither the regulations nor the rules prescribe detailed requirements as to how identification should be done.

	<p pid="a.37.2/1">It is estimated that biomass production in the UK in 2010 could reach around 3.5 million oven-dried tonnes. Of this total, around 2 million tonnes will be used for the production of heat, with the remaining 1.5 million tonnes for the production of electricity.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the total cost per tonne of carbon saved depend on the type of biomass, the technology used, and the fossil fuel displaced. A general guideline is that one tonne of biomass used for heat or electricity will result in a net saving of one tonne of carbon dioxide. Higher savings are achieved where coal is the displaced fuel or where combined heat and power technology is used. The cost of reduced greenhouse gas emissions from biomass energy is estimated to be about between &pound;128 and &pound;256 per tonne of carbon (&pound;35&ndash;&pound;70 per tonne carbon dioxide). Research costs are excluded from this calculation as the Government's biomass research programme underpins long-term development and it is unrealistic to write-off the cost by a set date.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.5/2">Local authorities have a range of enforcement options which include the rescheduling of payments, attachment of earnings orders, taking a charge on the property or levying distress.

	<p pid="a.37.5/3">The method of enforcement used is at the discretion of each local authority but we would expect them to act sensibly and sensitively with persons who are in financial difficulties. However, local authorities do have a duty to collect council tax and rent. If they do not act diligently it will have serious consequences to their revenue flows which could lead to higher council tax bills and rents, a reduction in services or both. This would not be fair on those who pay their bills regularly and on time.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/2">We are reforming the planning system to make it faster, fairer and more efficient. I need to ensure that the Planning Inspectorate is well placed to respond robustly to the increasing demands for its services and to the changes we are introducing. We have set in hand a business process &quot;end to end&quot; review <sup>1</sup> of the Planning Inspectorate which will be completed by the autumn and there are implications for the Inspectorate in the provisions of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill which is currently before Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/4">In line with the office's PSA6 target, by March 2004, 80 per cent of planning inspectors' reports to the Secretary of State on called-in and recovered appeal cases must be delivered within seven weeks of the close of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/5">The only other change involves the timeliness target for planning appeals going to hearings which, in order to deal with a backlog of cases, is now the same as for planning appeals going to inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/6">These targets are not just about speed: they are about reaching the right decision and providing the community with a quality service. The Planning Inspectorate is responding well to the challenge this presents.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/7">Timeliness</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/11">80 per cent of all planning appeals decided by inquiries to be determined within 30 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/12">(b) Enforcement Appeals</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/13">80 per cent of all enforcement appeals decided by written representation to be determined within 32 weeks;</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/15">80 per cent of all enforcement appeals to be decided by inquiries to be determined within 43 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/16">(c) Called In and Recovered Appeals</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/17">By March 2004, 80 per cent of inspectors' reports to the Secretary of State on called-in and recovered appeal cases to be delivered within seven weeks of the close of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/18">(d) Development Plan inquiries</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/19">To provide an inspector for development plan inquiries in 90 per cent of cases on the date requested by the local authority, provided that the objection period has ended and at least six months' notice has been given.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/20">To deliver 90 per cent of inspectors' reports on development plan inquiries to local authorities according to timescales agreed under service agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/21">Quality</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/22">To satisfy the Advisory Panel on Standards for the Planning Inspectorate, and thus the Secretary of State and the first Minister of the National Assembly for Wales, annually and following rigorous monitoring, that the quality of all the inspectorate's work is being maintained at a high standard, with 99 per cent of its casework free from justified complaint.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/23">Information and Guidance</p>

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">The Government do not maintain a list of the public functions performed by Ministers otherwise than under statute. Given the range of government activity it would not be practicable to compile such a list; nor do the Government maintain a list based on any narrower definition of the prerogative. Such definitions are a matter of generalisation from the analysis of particular legal decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/2">The following are examples of public functions which are performed by Ministers, or by the Sovereign on the advice of Ministers, and which would generally be considered within a narrower definition of the prerogative: appointment and regulation of the Civil Service; commissioning of officers in the Armed Forces; exercise of the prerogative of mercy; issue and revocation of UK passports; granting of honours; making of treaties; declaration of war and peace; deployment of the Armed Forces; recognition of foreign states, and accreditation and reception of diplomats.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/2">In examining this case so long after the events, the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals recognised that it had special features. Although it had been established that the Commander in Chief at the time made a request for a medal there was no conclusive evidence that the case was ever fully considered and a formal decision reached. Nor had the deployment been recognised by the award of any other campaign medal.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/3">The detailed qualification criteria for the medal will be submitted to HM the Queen for approval in due course. Copies of the sub-committee's report are being placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

However, the amount carried forward from 2001&ndash;02 into 2002-03, as detailed in WA 102, was (in accordance with Treasury's end year flexibility (EYF) scheme) based on an estimate of departmental spend in 2001&ndash;02 as determined by provisional outturn information in early summer 2002. Departmental expenditure figures can increase or decrease between provisional outturn and final outturn stages, and any such changes are taken into account in determining the final EYF claim.</p>

It is the Department for Regional Development's policy that Translink should replace buses as they reach their target replacement age of 18 years. Increasing maintenance costs and reliability problems make keeping vehicles over this age in operation uneconomical and unsatisfactory. The allocation of an additional &pound;40 million for bus grants in the Northern Ireland budget, announced in December 2002 will, subject to economic and other appraisal processes, enable Translink to replace older vehicles and reduce its average fleet age.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.5/1">The Government require all health and personal social services bodies to operate no-smoking policies. Current guidance reflects the need for such bodies to adopt a pragmatic approach in formulating policies to deal sensitively with issues such as smoking in long-stay facilities. Other factors to be taken into account include the potential risk to patients and others from smoking in inappropriate areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/2">The Government remain committed to promoting a smoke-free environment in all health and social services facilities. A five-year tobacco action plan for Northern Ireland, which will be published shortly, will provide a framework for achieving this objective.</p>
