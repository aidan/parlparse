	<p pid="b.5.6/1">I believe that the noble Lord is referring to the German presidency's plans to transpose the Pr&uuml;m convention into EU law. The presidency initiated a discussion on this topic at the Informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Dresden on 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-16">16 January</phrase> but has not yet tabled formal proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.6/2">The Pr&uuml;m convention was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-27">27 May 2005</phrase> by France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Belgium. It is designed to intensify cross-border police co-operation, especially in the fight against terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.6/3">The Pr&uuml;m Convention offers the potential to improve the exchange of information on DNA, fingerprints and vehicle registrations, which would have a real impact on our ability to bring serious criminals to justice. The Government support better practical co-operation between the police forces of member states and will carefully consider any formal proposals that the German presidency puts forward to transpose the convention into EU law.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.6/4">The exact process as to how Pr&uuml;m or some of its provisions could be brought into the EU framework has yet to be agreed. Any EU instrument covering the transposition of the Pr&uuml;m convention into EU law would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Ministers have given evidence on the Pr&uuml;m convention to the Select Committee on the European Union, with my right honourable friend the Minister for Europe, Geoff Hoon, appearing before the committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-18">18 December 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.3/1">Defra is developing a holistic approach to tackling the most significant environmental impacts of products across their whole life cycle. This includes, but is not restricted to, addressing the waste impacts of products.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/2">The Market Transformation Programme (MTP) supports government policy on sustainable products.

	<p pid="b.18.3/4">Remanufacture involves re-engineering end-of-life goods into as-new condition. It offers potential for improving business resource efficiency and profitability.

For example, in its Manufacturing Programme, WRAP has committed to deliver three major projects over the next two years which aim to switch significant manufacturing processes from using virgin material to recycled material input. WRAP is also undertaking research and feasibility studies to identify further opportunities for manufacturers to use production based on recycled, rather than virgin, materials.</p>

	<p pid="b.19.2/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question about whether they will take steps to improve traffic flow at peak times at the Knocknagoney roundabout in East Belfast. As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/4">As you will be aware, the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan (BMTP), published in November 2004, takes forward the strategic initiatives of the Regional Transportation Strategy for Northern Ireland, which was accepted by the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2002. The BMTP sets out transport proposals for the Belfast metropolitan area to be implemented or commenced by 2015. It also supports the development proposals contained in the draft Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan, which was published by the Department of the Environment in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/5">The BMTP identified a number of road improvement schemes considered necessary to remove existing bottlenecks and improve traffic flows on the road network. Although none of the improvement schemes directly affects the Tillysburn/Knocknagoney junction, there are proposals to widen the Sydenham bypass that will assist traffic flows in this area. Details of the proposals in the BMTP can be obtained from the BMTP website https://pronet.wsatkins.co.uk/bmtp/.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/6">In the more immediate future, Roads Service has approved road modifications, as part of a planning application submitted by Tesco, which will amend the A2 approach to the junction from the Holywood direction and provide additional capacity at the A2/Knocknagoney Road junction. Subject to the availability of funding, Roads Service is also considering improvements to the road layout at the A55 Outer Ring/Holywood Road junction and the lane configuration between this junction and Tillysburn, as part of our 2007-08 traffic management works programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/7">When completed, it is anticipated that these schemes will contribute to an improvement of traffic conditions in and around the Tillysburn junction and help reduce congestion in the area.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.2/4">The traffic problems encountered in the village of Donemana are relatively minor, when compared with traffic problems generated in the larger towns and cities across Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, it is recognised that problems are occasionally experienced within the village. It is also noted that, although some waiting restrictions are in place in the village, a lack of enforcement has resulted in these being abused.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.2/5">You will be aware that Roads Service has recently taken over responsibility for enforcement of waiting restrictions across Northern Ireland. I am pleased to confirm that, as a result of this, villages such as Donemana will be given increased levels of enforcement. Given the rural nature of the village and the relative lack of traffic problems, future enforcement action will not be on a full-time basis, but it should be sufficient to encourage those currently ignoring the waiting restrictions to use the adjacent car park, where there is clearly adequate capacity to meet the village's needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.23.5/1">The parties have made some progress on implementing the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) but there have been delays and deadlines have been missed. There have also been clear violations of the CPA's security arrangements which have been reported to the well established and effective ceasefire monitoring mechanism. Such violations have mostly related to failures to redeploy troops, integrate non-regular armed groups and form joint integrated units on time. There has also been a serious outbreak of violence in Malakal, southern Sudan, in late November 2006&mdash;representing the most severe violation of the CPA's security arrangements to date. The UK supports the parties in delivering their security commitments under the CPA by chairing the Security Working Group in the Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC).</p>
	<p pid="b.23.5/2">We are deeply concerned at the overall slow progress being made to deliver the CPA. This could lead to future violations and deadlines within the agreement being missed. The Government are pressing the CPA parties, both bilaterally and through the AEC, to implement the agreement in full. We are also providing substantial development assistance through the Department for International Development in support of the CPA.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.6/1">Fly-tipping tends to be casual, occasional dumping by householders but not all councils maintain the necessary data on its prevalence. The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) is seeking councils' agreement to the operation of a database used successfully throughout Great Britain into which all councils and regulatory bodies can input details of fly-tipping incidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.6/2">As regards large-scale, illegal dumping, since EHS took over responsibility for waste management in December 2003, it has received almost 4,000 reports of such incidents. EHS has taken 173 successful prosecutions against illegal operators, generating more than &pound;200,000 in fines to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.6/3">Clean-up costs are not known but it is estimated that 250,000 tonnes of illegally disposed waste from the Republic of Ireland are likely to cost more than &pound;25 million to clean up. Under EC legislation, RoI has primary responsibility for dealing with any of its waste illegally deposited in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.6/4">Officials from Northern Ireland and the Republic have agreed actions designed to strengthen the response in both jurisdictions to any existing or future illegal movements. EHS has set up a dedicated environment crime team, which is working closely with its counterparts in other regulatory bodies such as the PSNI and district councils and in the Republic of Ireland. New legislation will be introduced in spring 2007 and will provide stronger investigative powers and greater financial penalties.</p>
