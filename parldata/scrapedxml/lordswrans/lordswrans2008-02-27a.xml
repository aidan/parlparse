The 28 experts examined the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive, legally binding instrument to stop the irresponsible import, export and transfer of all conventional arms.

	<p pid="a.125.5/5">Figures are provided separately for those aged under 15 and those aged 15-24, because of different definitions of suicide used by ONS for these age groups. Figures for the latter age group also include deaths which are classified by ONS as being due to injury/poisoning of undetermined intent. Details of the definitions used are included in the footnote to the table. There were no deaths in children aged under 13 with a suicide verdict for the years requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.5/6">Before the Suicide Act of 1961 it was not possible for a coroner to return an open verdict and so deaths could not be coded to injury/poisoning of undetermined intent.

	<p pid="a.127.0/1">Domicile and nationality are not necessarily linked: it is possible to be a UK national and to be domiciled elsewhere. Domicile is a general law concept which broadly equates to where a person's permanent home is&mdash;the place where they intend to live and remain permanently. Individuals acquire a domicile of origin at birth&mdash;this may not relate to the place where either they, their parents or their grandparents were born. Individuals may also acquire a domicile of choice which is different from their domicile of origin if they can demonstrate strong and enduring links with another territory.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.3/5">When interpreting this figure, it is important to bear in mind that the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is designed to capture all people in the UK living in a private household or NHS accommodation. Some UK residents are not captured by the LFS including students living in halls of residence who do not have a UK-resident parent, and people living in other types of communal establishment (such as hostels, hotels, boarding houses, or mobile home sites). These factors may contribute to the LFS giving a slight underestimate of the number of foreign born residents in the UK.</p>
