	<p pid="a.103.5/1">The Government are committed to narrowing the funding differential between primary and post-primary schools and have introduced a number of measures to provide additional resources for the primary sector; for example, the &quot;Making a Good Start&quot; initiative, (P1 and P2 classes), assistance to schools to limit class sizes at Key Stage 1 and the budget addition for schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/2">Legislation is being prepared which will provide for the introduction of a single common LMS formula. This will allow progress to be made in narrowing the gap through formula allocations and though this must be gradual because of the need to keep the process manageable.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/3">The nature of post-primary curriculum, its mode of delivery and the extent of support arrangements (staffing, equipment and resource materials) are quite different from that of the primary sector and generally more expensive. Thus while the Government are satisfied that primary schools should receive a greater share of available resources, they do not feel that equal funding would be appropriate. Post-primary pupils will therefore continue to require additional funding and as such a differential will remain.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">This was a very busy Council with business split over two days. My right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Andrew Smith) attended the Employment and Social Policy part, held on <phrase class="date" code="">3 December</phrase>, accompanied by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/998" name="Alan Johnson">my honourable friend the Minister for Employment Relations and the Regions (Alan Johnson)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/2">The agenda covered a wide range of employment and social policy issues. Council agreed an orientation toward political agreement on a regulation to replace Regulation 1408/71 which co-ordinates social security for people moving within the EU. The issues covered at this Council were sickness benefits, benefits for work injury and illness, and death grants. Work will continue on simplification of this regulation under the forthcoming Greek Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/3">Council reached political agreement on a regulation extending provisions of Regulation 1408/71 to nationals of third countries. This regulation will be adopted at a future Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/4">The Council also agreed to minor revisions to the objectives agreed at Nice in 2000 for the next round of national action plans on social inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/5">The Council agreed a number of resolutions: on e-accessibility for disabled people, ahead of the European year for disabled people in 2003; on social inclusion through social dialogue; and on corporate social responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/6">This Council also produced conclusions on gender mainstreaming within the Council and Council Conclusions on a series of indicators concerning violence against women.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/7">There were three substantive discussions at this Council. Council adopted a joint report with ECOFIN on the streamlining of the annual co-ordination of economic and employment policies after some discussion. The report is in line with the UK's desire to see reform of the employment processes to emphasise outcomes and ensure that all work is geared to achieving the Lisbon objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/8">There was also an orientation debate on the Commission's proposed directive on improving working conditions for temporary agency workes. Among other issues, the UK continued to argue for a longr derogation than the six weeks proposed in the Commission paper. The Greek Presidency will continue to seek a compromise on this dossier when it takes over the Presidency next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/9">The Council agreed a decision establishing a tripartite social summit after discussion. This will be forwarded as a report from the ESPHCA to the General Affairs and External Relations Council, and recommends continuing the current informal arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/10">The Council adopted joint conclusions with ECOFIN on the structural indictors for the 2003 synthesis report.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/11">The Commission presented its draft of the Joint Employment Report at this Council. The draft was remitted to the Employment Committee for consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/12">The Presidency announced that it would shortly be bringing forward a revised proposal for a directive protecting workers from the risks of exposure to electromagnetic fields and waves.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/13">No votes were taken on any of these issues.</p>

In some licensed centres a woman needing treatment involving in vitro fertilisation may be offered this at reduced cost in return for sharing the eggs she produces with another woman receiving in vitro fertilisation. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority considered egg sharing in 1998 and has kept it under review since then, issuing guidance in 2000 on the provision of consent and the preparation of formal agreements between the parties involved. The HFEA's Ethics Committee is currently considering the arrangements reported at one clinic where a woman gives all the eggs from one cycle in return for later treatment for herself. The conclusions of the committee, and of the authority as a whole, will be communicated to the House and placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.6/1">The question of the definition of disability is a complex one. The Department of Health does not maintain a definitive list of conditions that it recognises as disabilities. There are two main definitions in current legislation which the department uses. The National Assistance Act 1948 defines disability as &quot;persons who are blind, deaf, or dumb, or who suffer from mental disorder of any description, and other persons aged 18 or over who are substantially and permanently handicapped by illness, injury or congenital deformity . . &quot;. Councils usually rely on this definition when providing services under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. The other definition of disability is within the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which defines a disabled person as someone &quot;with a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out day-to-day activities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/2">Whether or not an individual suffering from acrophobia would be regarded as being disabled under either or both of these legal definitions would depend on the severity of the condition and the way in which it manifested itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/3">Access to other elements of support for disabled people, for example benefits or transport concessions, may rely on different criteria, being specific to those benefits or concessions.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/2">The rationale underlying these decisions, as described in detail in the Chief Medical Officer's strategy for combating infectious diseases, Getting ahead of the Curve, is that the proposed Health Protection Agency is intended to be a specialist body fulfilling a health protection role, as distinct from an operational clinical role. To this end, the laboratories of the PHLS that provide a general clinical diagnostic service are to be transferred to the NHS, while those that provide a specialist or reference function are to transfer to the proposed Health Protection Agency. The public health role of all the laboratories is to be maintained and we intend that the move will strengthen public health microbiology throughout the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.0/1">The report of the strategic review group was presented to the Public Health Laboratory Service board in Autumn 1994. After consultation, the board accepted all the conclusions and recommendations in the report. The board's decisions on its new strategy were endorsed by the Department of Health and the Welsh Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">The report recommended that the service should take steps to enhance all aspects of its scientific, technological and managerial capacity, so that it could respond even more effectively to the challenges posed by new and emerging infections, by technological and scientific development, and by the changes occurring in the National Health Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/3">The steps which were taken by the board at the time have resulted in a service which has proved its effectiveness in responding to many challenges from new and emerging infections since 1994 and which continues to do so. They included a service development programme to strengthen its public health functions; a restructuring of the network of area and regional public health laboratories into groups, to enhance their management and effectiveness and to provide a defined level and quality of services to local populations, hospital/NHS trusts, general practitioners, consultants in communicable disease control, local authority environmental health departments and other customers; and a service-wide drive to make better use of resources and to increase the value for money provided for all its customers.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/1">On the evening of <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 16 December</phrase>, the Department of Health completed its purchase of the largest remaining independent US plasma collector, Life Resources Incorporated. This will secure long-term supplies of non-UK blood plasma for the benefit of NHS patients, and ensure that the current global plasma shortage will not reduce the availability to National Health Service patients of life-saving plasma products. An independent option appraisal conducted by KPMG concluded that this purchase was the most cost-effective way of achieving these objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/2">Plasma is used to manufacture products for the treatment of a wide range of conditions. Every year the NHS uses:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/3" class="indent">5,000 kilos of albumin for the tens of thousands of patients treated for burns, shock and major trauma.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/4" class="indent">2,000 kilos of intravenous immunoglobulin for patients with immune disorders. This includes 1,800 patients with primary immune deficiency who require an injection every two to three weeks throughout their lives to protect them against infection. Thousands more patients are given intravenous immunoglobulin to treat neurological and other conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/5" class="indent">120,000 bottles of Anti-D immunoglobulin to protect unborn children suffering from haemolytic diseases of the newborn. This affects roughly 64,000 pregnancies a year and, in a small number of cases, can cause stillbirth, severe disability or death after birth from anaemia or jaundice.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/6" class="indent">400,000 bottles of Factor VIII to treat around 3,000 haemophilia patients,</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/7">Around 45 per cent of the plasma products needed by the NHS in England and Wales are manufactured by the NHS-owned Bio Products Laboratory. The remainder are purchased by the NHS on the open market from third party commercial suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/8">In 1998, the Government instructed BPL to stop using UK plasma to make these products because of concerns about the theoretical risk from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Since then, BPL has purchased plasma from the United States. The US has no reported cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is the only country able to supply the quality of plasma that BPL needs in sufficient quantity. The US collects 60 per cent of the world's plasma and supplies between 35 and 45 per cent of the plasma products used in Europe alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/9">Up to now these supplies have been dependent on contracts with US plasma collection companies. Over the past two years most of these companies have been purchased by commercial manufacturers wishing to secure their own plasma supplies. This radically reduced the amount of US plasma that BPL could buy under contract and threatened our ability to supply sufficient non-UK plasma products to NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/10">Without continuing, secure supplies of US plasma, BPL faced shutdown by 2004 with a consequent removal of massive volumes of plasma products from the NHS market. Independent market analysis by KPMG demonstrated that commercial suppliers would not be able to provide sufficient, secure supplies of plasma products to the NHS if BPL closed. Immediate action was therefore needed to secure long-term supplies of high quality, US plasma for BPL.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/11">The Department of Health has purchased the trade and assets of Life Resources for an up-front payment of &pound;48.8 million with a further &pound;21 million tied into the performance of the company up until the end of 2006. The department has paid a commercial price for the business assets based on same analysis as a private sector purchaser would have undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/12">Life Resources has supplied BPL with plasma since 1999. It has extremely high quality and safety standards overseen by the US Food and Drugs Administration and the UK Medicines Control Agency. All the company's collection centres are inspected by BPL on a rolling two-year programme. BPL's team also inspected every centre prior to the purchase.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/13">An effective corporate governance regime has been established for the ongoing management of Life Resources. The company will be run by its existing US management team and report to a US parent company, DCI Biologicals Incorporated. DCI Biologicals will report to a UK parent company, Plasma Resources Ltd. The board of Plasma Resources Ltd is chaired by Richard Douglas, the Department of Health's director of finance and investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/14">The Government have appointed Mr Philip Cushing as non-executive chair of DCI Biologicals. Mr Cushing is highly qualified for this role. His previous positions include chief executive of Inchcape (1996&ndash;99) and chief executive of Vitec Group PLC (2000&ndash;01). He is also currently chairman of Paragon Print and Packaging Limited, Spalding, Lincs, and a non-executive director of Ikon Office Solutions Inc, Philadelphia, USA. He was appointed to chair DCI because of his extensive international business experience, including a career involving American operations since 1977. He also has extensive international acquisitions experience built up over 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/15">This deal is a logical extension of the existing relationship between the NHS and an established US plasma supplier, Life Resources, and is a pragmatic solution to the problem of securing supply.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.2/1">The progress on reconstruction in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban has been impressive but there is more to be done. The immediate priority was to meet humanitarian needs (food, water and shelter), including those of returning refugees and internally displaced people. Almost 2 million Afghans have returned home from Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia. Over 3 million children have returned to schooling.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">Most infrastructure projects implemented since September 2001 have been designed for quick impact. The Afghan Government, UN and international community are also planning how to deliver longer-term reconstruction in a secure and co-ordinated way.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/3">The UK is working to ensure the World Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund (ARTF) is a major channel for pooling bilateral funding for Afghanistan. The UK has pledged &pound;200 million over the next five years for both reconstruction and humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan, supporting a mix of technical assistance, projects implemented by NGOs and UN agencies, and through the ARTF. Ultimately, it will be important to ensure that Afghanistan has the administrative capacity to take ownership of the overall reconstruction process.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.6/5">We took all proper measures to ensure that the Indian authorities were meeting Mr Stillman's welfare requirements during his imprisonment. Consular staff monitored his welfare closely through consular visits (generally every 3 months) and by keeping in regular touch with his family. We were instrumental in ensuring improvements to many aspects of his detention. These included helping him to be transferred to a prison with better conditions and facilities, ensuring that he was provided with a wheelchair and had better lighting in his cell. Consular staff arranged for a board of medical consultants to examine him at a hospital in May 2002 and also helped secure permission from the prison authorities for medical and prosthetic specialists to visit him in prison. Recently they helped arrange for a diabetic specialist to visit Mr Stillman on <phrase class="date" code="">4 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.6/6">We are very glad that Mr Stillman's case has been resolved. We hope his early release will result in a significant improvement in his health. The Foreign Secretary met the Indian Foreign Minister, Yashwant Sinha, in London on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase>, and expressed his thanks to Mr Sinha and his colleagues in the Government of India for the compassionate action they had taken in securing Mr Stillman's release.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.0/1">The Government are committed to tackling all hate crime regardless of what form it takes.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/2">The criminal law already contains a wide range of powers to deal with violent behaviour and harassment. This includes, under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the ability for courts to issue higher sentences to perpetrators of crimes motivated by hate.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/3">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), working with the Government, have developed guidance for police forces in dealing with these types of crime. This guidance is entitled Identifying and Combating Hate Crime and was last updated in April 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/4">To solicit or incite another to commit a crime (through, for example, homophobic song lyrics) is indictable under common law, even if the solicitation or incitement has no effect. Therefore a crime would not actually need to be committed to convict people of incitement to violence against homosexual people.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/5">Under broadcasting arrangements, responsibilty for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters and the broadcasting regulatory bodies - the Governors of the BBC, the Independent Television Commission (ITC), the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority (S4C) and the Radio Authority (RAu). They are independent of the Government and accountable for safeguarding the public interests in broadcasting. They also maintain guidelines for programme makers on the standards which should be observed. In respect of song lyrics, the RAu code makes specific reference to song lyrics and the need for considered judgments to be made by licencees with regard to scheduling certain tracks. The code rules involving the portrayal of violence, in that it must never be glorified or applauded, apply to programming generally as does the 1990 Act requirement that nothing shall be included that is likely to encourage or incite to crime or lead to disorder.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.8/1">No such grants were issued in 2002 by government departments in England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland's Department of Environment, Environmental Heritage Service set aside &pound;1 million and, in conjunction with InvestNI, launched a Waste Industry Fund. This has been set up to help establish waste infrastructure in Northern Ireland. Two projects in the biodiesel sector have been awarded funding in principle: &pound;120,000 in principle to Capital Oils Ltd for the manufacture of biodiesel using waste from cooking oils and fats; &pound;11,000 in principle to Grease Trap Services for the manufacture of biodiesel from waste food/fat, oil and grease collected from catering drainage systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.8/2">Funding may be available from regional or local funding bodies, such as the regional development agencies in England, depending on the priorities they identify for the use of their resources. Central records are not kept of the grants issued.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.0/1">Waste Strategy 2000 states that developers of proposed waste incinerators should consider the potential for incorporating combined heat and power technology, which would provide heating to the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/2">Any electricity produced by such plants feeds into the National Grid and since the opening up of the electricity supply market householders in a specific community could potentially be receiving their electricity from any number of suppliers. It is not government policy to determine what those suppliers should be charging their customers.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.3/1">I am pleased to report to the House that the Government launched a Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food on Thursday 12th December. My right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs met farmers and leaders of the food industry, rural, environmental and consumer bodies to discuss the new strategy and hear examples of good practice from across the food chain after the launch.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/2">The strategy is further evidence of this Government's commitment to help to deliver innovative and practical solutions to the challenges faced by those involved in the food chain. We do not underestimate the scale of these challenges: farm incomes remain under pressure and the foot and mouth disease outbreak also added to the momentum for change.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/3">This strategy builds on the invaluable work conducted by the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food to chart a way through these challenges. It sets out how industry, government and consumers can work together to secure a profitable and internationally competitive future for our industries, whilst contributing to a better environment, improving nutrition and public health and prosperous communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/4">The strategy is backed by &pound;500 million from government over the next three years. Subject to clearance under the usual EU procedures, this will provide:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/5" class="indent">a new entry-level agri-environment scheme: developing a simple scheme, suitable for all farmers which will pay them to farm in a more sustainable way, a core Curry Commission recommendation. Subject to successful piloting, this would be rolled out nationally in 2005;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/6" class="indent">continued expansion of premium rural and environmental schemes like Countryside Stewardship: further work to improve the targeting of these schemes and make them simpler to applicants;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/7" class="indent">a new &quot;whole farm&quot; approach to management and regulation: helping farmers to plan their business as a whole to meet commercial and regulatory needs. The Government also plan to develop an audit-based approach to identify a farm's strengths and weaknesses as a basis for cutting red tape and the number of inspections required;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/8" class="indent">the new agricultural development scheme: to improve competitiveness and marketing, including the priority areas of co-operation, farm assurance and spreading best practice;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/9" class="indent">new funding to assist small regional food producers: extra money chanelled through Food from Britain will enable it to work with regional development agencies and the regional food groups to expand this sector;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/10" class="indent">more money for skills and training: knowing how to make a profit is fundamental, but respecting the environment and marketing require different skills and knowledge. We are reviewing training and advice services to help farmers develop and to exploit new opportunities;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/11" class="indent">a Food and Health Action Plan: led by the Department of Health, to build on existing work to improve diet and nutrition, working with industry and consumers. The plan will address food production and access as well as consumer information.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/12">A network of demonstration farms: in early 2003 a pilot network of farms will open their doors to share best practice and experiences.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/13">Improving animal health and combating diseases: government is drawing up a new animal health and welfare strategy, has strengthened our emergency preparations and efforts to combat illegal meat imports.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/14">In addition, the Government will ask the Institute of Grocery Distribution, in conjunction with the Food Chain Centre, to undertake analysis of the impact of nutrition initiatives such as the National School Fruit Scheme and the five-a-day programme, on the food chain. This will highlight the commercial opportunities for English farmers and growers and other sectors of the food industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/15">The strategy, which builds on the work of the Curry commission, also underlines the need for farming to reconnect with its markets, better co-operation with the food chain, investment in people and technology and the adoption of environmental best practice. There are many examples of good practice to build upon:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/16" class="indent">more than 25,000 farm holdings in existing government environmental schemes;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/17" class="indent">more than 400 farmers' markets offering producers the opportunity to sell direct to their markets;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/18" class="indent">over 78,000 farmers and growers are already members of farm assurance schemes with their produce branded under logos such as the &quot;red tractor&quot; and a number of industry initiatives being taken forward as part of the strategy:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/19">The Food Chain Centre is working to improve the efficiency of the food chain through the provision of information, analysis and training and promotion of benchmarking and best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/20">The Red Meat Industry Forum is working to improve efficiency and information flow in the red meat supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/21">English Farming and Food Partnerships, established by the industry with Defra support, will promote co-operation between farmers and between farmers and the rest of the food chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/22">Assured Food Standards is working to broaden support for farm assurance within the food chain and to consolidate and develop assurance standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/23">The Government have already announced that an independent implementation group, led by Sir Don Curry, will oversee the delivery of the strategy by both government and industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/24">Across England, regional delivery plans will be drawn up between government offices, regional development agencies, local farmers, rural affairs forums, regional chambers and a range of stakeholders, assisted by Sir Don Curry's implementation group.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/25">The strategy was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase> and copies of this and the strategy-related documents are available in the Vote Office and the Libraries of the House.</p>
