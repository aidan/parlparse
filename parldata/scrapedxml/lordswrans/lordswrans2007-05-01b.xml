	<p pid="b.198.5/1">Provisional estimates suggest that between the 1996-98 average and 2005, there was a 6 per cent increase in the number of people killed in reported personal-injury drink-drive accidents. Over the same period, the estimated number of people killed in non-drink-drive accidents fell by 12 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.5/2">Personal injury road accident data in Great Britain are collected by the police and reported to the department using the STATS19 accident report format. Results are published in detail in <I>Road Casualties Great Britain</I><I>: </I><I>Annual </I><I>r</I><I>eport</I>. The report for 2005 was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-28">28 September 2006</phrase> and can be found at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/accidents/casualtiesgbar/roadcasualtiesgreatbritain2005">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/accidents/casualtiesgbar/roadcasualtiesgreatbritain2005</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.5/3">Two sources of data are used to assess the extent and characteristics of drink-drive accidents in Great Britain. These sources are:</p>
	<p pid="b.198.5/4"><I>Coroners' data</I>&mdash;Information about the level of alcohol in the blood of road accident fatalities aged 16 or over who die within 12 hours of a road accident is provided by coroners in England and Wales and by procurators fiscal in Scotland; and <I>STATS19 breath-</I><I>test data</I><I>&mdash;</I>The personal injury road accident reporting system (STATS19) provides data on injury accidents in which the driver or rider survived and was also breath-tested at the roadside. If the driver or rider refused to provide a breath-test specimen then they are considered to have failed the test unless they are deemed unable to take the test for medical reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.5/5">The maximum permitted level of blood alcohol content (BAC) for drivers, the annual average number of fatalities and vehicle population for 1996-98, the number of fatalities and vehicle population in 2005, the percentage change in the number of people killed in all reported personal injury road accidents, and the percentage change in the vehicle population in each European Union member state, can be seen in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.5/6">A road safety performance index, published by the European Transport Safety Council, contains information on the percentage change in drink-driving deaths relative to other road deaths between 1996-98 and 2005 in European Union member states.
