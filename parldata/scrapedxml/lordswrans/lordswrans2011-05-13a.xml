	<p pid="a.256.0/1">The protocol, which was agreed between the Government and the Law Commission in March 2010, aims to ensure that government departments are fully signed up to projects that the Law Commission undertakes and that there are prompt and open communications between departments and the commission during the course of the project. The intention behind this was to ensure full departmental commitment to Law Commission projects, thereby increasing the rate of implementation of Law Commission reports and ensuring a more productive relationship. While we are confident that the protocol will increase the rate of implementation of future Law Commission work, its full impact has not yet been felt because it applies only to projects which the Law Commission takes on after March 2010. There is only one project-European contract law-which formally falls under the terms of the protocol. The Government and the commission have, however, agreed to take the protocol into account in respect of ongoing projects in so far as it is practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/2">The Law Commission is currently in the process of developing its next programme of work and aims to put this to the Lord Chancellor (as prescribed by the Law Commissions Act 1965) for approval shortly. This will be the first programme agreed in light of the protocol and we expect that increased rates of implementation will become more apparent towards the end of this programme of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/3">Five of the Law Commission's reports were implemented or the relevant legislation achieved Royal Assent during the period to which the report to Parliament relates. We also expect to take forward a further two Law Commission reports when parliamentary time allows-namely the reports on consumer insurance law; pre-contract disclosure and misrepresentation and capital and income in trusts; classification and apportionment.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/4">In terms of the impact of the reductions in public expenditure on the Law Commission, the Government have informed the Law Commission that it must reduce its budget by 33 per cent by the end of this Parliament. While we accept that this will be difficult for the Law Commission, we are having to take very difficult decisions across the board in order to deal effectively with the budget deficit and this figure is consistent with what is being applied to administrative budgets generally. We are also of the view that this reduction can be mitigated by financial contributions from departments for projects carried out in their policy areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/5">As for when the Government intend to respond to the Law Commission on a number of their reports:</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/6">The Government have considered the Law Commission's reports on the termination of tenancies and the illegality defence and are currently in discussion with the Law Commission with respect to these reports. We hope to communicate our position on both reports shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/7">The Government are still considering the implementation of the Law Commission's report, <I>Cohabitation: The Financial Consequences of Relationship Breakdown</I>. We hope to be able to respond to the Law Commission shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/8">The Lord Chancellor wrote to the chairman of the Law Commission in February to communicate the Government's decisions in respect of the reports on intoxication and criminal liability and on conspiracy and attempts.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/9">The Government are minded not to implement the proposals contained in the Law Commission's report on intoxication and criminal liability, as we are not persuaded that implementation of the report would deliver improvements to the administration of justice. Whilst the reforms recommended by the Law Commission may resolve some uncertainty in the law they may also increase its complexity.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/10">We have also decided not to implement the Law Commission's report on conspiracy and attempts. The Government accept the proposals contained within this report and think that it is a worthwhile project for the future. However we regret that implementation is not a priority in the shorter term given the pressure on departmental resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.2/1">We remain concerned about the continuing political impasse in Yemen, the use of violence to disperse peaceful protestors, and the increasingly destabilising effect that events are having on a very fragile economy. Over 120 protestors have been killed and hundreds injured since demonstrations began in January and further violence risks escalating the situation beyond the control of the Government. The President still has the opportunity to follow a peaceful route to political transition. We, along with our EU and US partners, firmly believe that the political transition plan brokered by the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) represents the best route to a peaceful solution. The current GCC plan incorporates a road map for the formation of a national unity Government, resignation of the President in favour of the Vice-President, constitutional change and presidential elections. I urge all parties to work closely with the GCC and to pursue negotiations to reach a settlement without further delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.0/1">We recognise that robust civilian oversight of the armed forces, and indeed that the whole security and justice sector is an important component of a well functioning democracy. We also recognise that any international assistance must be requested and owned by the Zimbabwean Government. We stand ready to consider any requests for such assistance.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.0/1">We are deeply concerned by the arrests and treatment of a range of individuals in Zimbabwe, including civil society activists. Officials in Harare regularly attend and monitor court cases. They also have close contact with non-government organisations and civil society organisations throughout Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/2">We call regularly, both bilaterally and with EU member states, for an end to all such abuses and the restoration of internationally accepted human rights standards in Zimbabwe. Our ambassador issued a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-25">25 March 2011</phrase> calling for the culture of impunity and state-sponsored abuses to be addressed.</p>
