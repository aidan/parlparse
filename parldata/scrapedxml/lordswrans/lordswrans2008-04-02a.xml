This is followed by &quot;on the job&quot; training to develop skills in customer contact and call-handling techniques. Once proficient in these areas, new entrants are then permitted to handle calls from customers, with support and guidance from a manager.

This is a significant step towards the implementation of CORE, as it facilitates the standardisation of the format in which electoral registration officers hold electoral registration information, preparing the ground for the information held by them to be assembled into a single database. We will shortly be conducting a requirements-gathering exercise with a view to setting detailed user requirements before the end of 2008.

	<p pid="a.174.0/1">We support the work of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Electoral Commission in producing updated guidance for police forces in England and Wales on preventing and detecting electoral malpractice for the elections on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-01">1 May 2008</phrase>. The guidance recommends that local police forces work closely with returning officers to minimise the potential for possible malpractice in the electoral process. The guidance encourages police forces to undertake a risk assessment for the elections being held in their area, and highlights factors to take into consideration when carrying out a risk assessment. This will include identifying locations that have historically had incidents or currently show potential for being at risk in May 2008. The guidance sets out the requirements for electors wishing to apply to vote by post and that it is an offence to make a false postal vote application. We welcome the guidance and would encourage local police forces and returning officers to be vigilant in identifying any suspicious or fraudulent activity at the May elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.6/1">Local employment partnerships are agreements between individual employers and Jobcentre Plus. Once an employer and Jobcentre Plus have agreed in principle to work together through a local employment partnership, the next steps are to plan what that will mean in practice and to begin the process of implementation. Each employer works with Jobcentre Plus to decide which job opportunities in which workplaces will be handled through the LEP initiative, and what action will be taken to help jobless people to compete effectively for those jobs. Possible actions include work trials, pre-employment training and guidance for jobless people on recruitment processes and employers' recruitment criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.6/2">We aim to help 250,000 jobless people into work through local employment partnerships by the end of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.6/3">By the end of March 2008, more than 600 employers (including some small and medium-sized enterprises) had made organisational-level commitments to work through local employment partnerships. Some 260 of those employers were already working with Jobcentre Plus to implement their initial delivery plans, and a list of those employers has been placed in the Library. Jobcentre Plus is working through LEPs at a local level with many other smaller and medium-sized employers, and with some sites of larger employers who have not so far made a central commitment to work through LEPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.6/4">Employers are often unable to make firm recruitment plans months and years in advance, and for that reason it is not possible to say how many job opportunities individual committed employers will make available through LEPs. We are however confident, given the high level of recruitment undertaken by employers committed to LEPs, that the number of job opportunities made available through LEPs will enable the initiative to succeed.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.2/1">Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (the Act) requires local authorities to decide planning applications in accordance with the development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. This means that where applications involve issues of flood risk, they have to be decided in line with the policies on flood risk set out in the local authority's local development documents (LDDs) or other development plans. LDDs should be consistent with national planning policy, including Planning Policy Statement 25 Development and Flood Risk (PPS25). Section 20(5) of the Act requires LDDs to be tested for their soundness at independent examination. Local authorities are also required to carry out a sustainability appraisal of their LDDs as part of their plan preparation, in order to inform decisions about site allocations. Where flooding is an issue the local authority should prepare a strategic flood risk assessment as required by PPS25 to inform the sustainability appraisal. The policy in PPS25 would be a material consideration in determining the soundness of the LDD.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/2">Key elements of the planning system are the early active involvement of stakeholders, including the Environment Agency which is a specific consultation body, and the development of a robust evidence base, in order to inform the contents of the LDDs. At the planning application level, applicants are encouraged to discuss their proposals with the local authority as early as possible, to check their compliance with the local authorities' policies. There is a statutory requirement on the local authority to consult the Environment Agency on planning applications in flood risk areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.5/1">The electricity consumed on the parliamentary estate in all but one of the buildings is purchased on contract through OGC Buying Solutions. All the electricity is renewable and comes from accredited generation technologies under the climate change levy exemption scheme. The percentage contribution from various generation technologies to the renewable electricity supplied during 2006 by the OGC Buying Solutions supplier is given below:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/2">5 per cent energy from waste;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/3">6 per cent sewage gas;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/4">7 per cent biomass;</p>

	<p pid="a.179.5/9">The one building not included in the OGC Buying Solutions contract receives electricity generated by a combined heat and power plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/10">Since the renewable electricity is generated far away from the parliamentary estate, it is supplied to the electricity network and is mixed with electricity generated from other non-renewable sources. The only way to ensure that the renewable electricity is consumed on the parliamentary estate would be for cables to be fitted between the generators of the renewable electricity and the estate to carry the renewable electricity exclusively to the estate. The possibility of running the Whitehall standby distribution system and the Whitehall combined heat and power plant to generate electricity to replace mains electricity in the future and to deliver it directly to government offices in Whitehall and to Parliament is currently being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/11">The OGC Buying Solutions electricity supplier and its affiliates have made a commitment to invest in approximately 1,000 MW of new UK renewable energy production over the next five years.</p>

A monetary estimate of the damages associated with any change in carbon emissions caused by interventions must also be produced using a value produced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>

Data on traffic flow and speed by vehicle type is used to predict fuel consumption under &quot;with intervention&quot; and &quot;without intervention&quot; scenarios for every year in the appraisal period, and the resulting information is used to calculate carbon emissions based on the carbon content and density of fuel burnt. The department is also consulting on future improvements to NATA and investigating ways to make the estimation of carbon impacts more comprehensive by taking account of non-fuel-consumption related carbon effects of transport schemes.</p>
