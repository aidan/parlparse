	<p pid="a.195.5/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) issues higher-level disclosures (both standard and enhanced) for employment and licensing purposes, as provided for in Part V of the Police Act 1997. Higher-level disclosures (standard and enhanced) can be asked for only in relation to positions that are included in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (ROA) (Exceptions) Order 1975. These are positions/licensing requirements for which an employer/regulatory authority may ask to see spent as well as unspent conviction information.</p>

The CJCSA defines a child as someone who is under 18 (under 16 if the child is employed). If they are working (whether paid or unpaid) in a position whose normal duties include regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of a person under 18, they would qualify for an enhanced disclosure. However, under Part V of the Police Act 1997 a disclosure would not be mandatory for any member of the host family.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.5/3">It is for an employer or organisation, bearing in mind their legal and other responsibilities, to determine whether or not they should ask members of a host family to apply for a disclosure. If not using the disclosure service, organisations with responsibility for employing people in positions of trust should have their own vetting requirements and procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/1">Over the past two and a half years, responsibility for security in the 18 provinces of Iraq has been gradually transferred from the coalition to the Government of Iraq. The transfer of a province was based on a joint assessment, by the coalition and the Government of Iraq, of the security situation in each province and the capability of the Iraqi security forces based there. In the period May 2006 to October 2008, responsibility for the security of 13 of Iraq's 18 provinces was transferred to the Government of Iraq. Following the expiry of UNSCR 1790 on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>, the Government of Iraq now lead in maintaining security throughout Iraq with multinational forces focused on training and supporting the Iraqi security forces in delivering this mission.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/3">Responsibility for sustaining and building on the significant reductions in violence in Iraq since 2007 now rests, therefore, with the sovereign Iraqi Government. The UK will continue to provide active and wide-ranging support to the Government of Iraq's efforts, not only through direct military assistance as outlined above, but also through support in fields such as governance, regional diplomacy, economic development, and security and justice sector reform, all of which have a bearing on Iraq's future stability and security.</p>
