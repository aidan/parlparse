	<p pid="b.214.3/1">The Government have always supported fully the aim of the REACH regulation to improve protection of human health and the environment and to maintain the competitiveness and innovation of the EU chemicals industry. We sought to consult widely with the UK chemicals industry and other sectors that will be affected by REACH to ensure that their views were taken into account and that they were kept informed of developments throughout the legislative process.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.3/2">In October 2006, I announced that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) would act as the UK competent authority for the implementation of REACH. The HSE has set up a helpdesk to provide assistance and advice to all industrial sectors on the requirements of REACH. Various industry bodies are also taking active steps to make sure that companies understand about REACH and have access to advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.3/3">The Government are confident that there is a widespread understanding of REACH and its requirements among the major industrial players. However, we are less confident that there is such an understanding among the significant numbers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and among companies not in the chemical industry but which nevertheless use chemicals. With the formal adoption of the REACH regulation in December 2006, we are developing a communications strategy to ensure that SMEs in particular are fully aware of REACH requirements as they progressively come into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.215.3/1">Defra has overall policy responsibility for coastal erosion risk in England and grant-aids local authority improvement projects and related studies to manage this risk. The department does not build defences or direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake. Management of coastal erosion risk and associated monitoring is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in each area.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.3/2">Erosion risk will vary around the coastline depending on local conditions and defences in place. Defra has encouraged the relevant authorities to produce shoreline management plans (SMPs), which provide large-scale assessments of the risks associated with coastal processes and present long-term policy frameworks to manage these risks in a sustainable manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.3/3">In 2001, Defra funded a national study of information on long-term coastal processes and evolution over the next century (Futurecoast). This is designed to be used by coastal authorities to inform their current revisions of SMPs. The Department of Trade and Industry's <I>Foresight: Future Flooding</I> report, published in 2004, also considered possible coastal erosion scenarios over the following 80 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.3/4">Work under the cross-government Making Space for Water programme is focusing on methods for mapping erosion probabilities with the aim of producing national maps of coastal erosion probability in 2009, similar to those currently available for flood risk. Further work within this programme is looking at the national scale of the problems, with a view to considering future options for adaptation policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.3/5">Funding for flood and coastal erosion risk management has increased significantly in recent years. New approaches to management of the risk in a broad sense are being considered under Making Space for Water. They include proposals for new outcome measures, on which we are currently out to public consultation, and for the Environment Agency to have a strategic overview of all coastal flood and erosion risk management.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.2/2">It is standard RMP practice for statements taken in operational theatres to be recorded in the local language.

In line with civil police guidelines, witness interviews are audio recorded. On rare occasions where this is not possible, comprehensive notes are maintained. During major incident investigations, it is standard practice for key witness interviews to be video recorded.</p>

The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) already has discretion to disclose information about awards made for injuries inflicted by the same offender, provided that the authority is satisfied that any disclosure is unlikely to enable a particular victim, or the award made to a particular victim, to be identified. For example, CICA has disclosed more general information about awards made to victims of the late Harold Shipman and to victims of the 7/7 London bombings. It follows that CICA cannot release information relating to the second Question, including whether any applications for criminal injuries compensation have in fact been made in the Leslie Warren and Warren Blackwell cases.</p>

There has been a small increase in the price of solar thermal installations, which is believed to be part of the natural development of the market.

	<p pid="b.227.0/1">The Government, through Invest NI, promotes Northern Ireland as an attractive and viable location for foreign direct investment. It also works to stimulate the development and growth of local businesses and entrepreneurial activity. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) works to secure investment in tourism. Invest NI works closely with local stakeholders to encourage them to develop regional propositions to maximise the attractiveness of their area for potential investors.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/2">This strategy has resulted in just under &pound;5 million of assistance being offered towards total planned inward investment of &pound;19.2 million in the Strabane District Council area in the four years to March 2006.

	<p pid="b.227.0/3">The NITB has prepared a strategic framework for action 2004-07 to focus on attracting visitors to NI, to increase the competitiveness of tourism businesses and to stimulate effective communication with the industry. Four regional tourism partnerships (RTPs) were set up under the framework to assist the promotion of tourism at local level. The Western RTP, which includes North Tyrone, has to date been allocated &pound;125,000, representing 25 per cent of the &pound;500,000 funding from the NITB towards this initiative. Projects from North Tyrone have also been eligible to compete for funding under the tourism development programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.229.8/1">The chief executive of Roads Service (Dr Malcolm McKibbin) has written to the noble Lord in response to this Question.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/2"><I>Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird</I></p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question regarding what proposals they have to improve the safety of the road from Sprucefield to the Irish border.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/4">I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/5">I am pleased to be able to advise that Roads Service has a substantial programme of work aimed at improving both the reliability of journey times and safety on the A1 Sprucefield to the border key strategic route. This programme, which is contained in the <I>Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan 2015</I>, published in March 2005, and in proposals for <I>Expanding the Strategic Road Improvement Programme 2015</I>, published for consultation in July 2006, includes plans to upgrade the whole route to dual carriageway standard; undertake improvements at selected junctions; and provide a safety barrier in the central reservation.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/6">You will be aware that a nine kilometre stretch of dual carriageway between Loughbrickland and Beech Hill, costing &pound;25 million, was opened to traffic in November last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/7">Construction work is currently under way to upgrade a five kilometre portion of the road between Cloghogue and the border. This is part of the A1/N1 Newry to Dundalk link road cross-border project costing an estimated &pound;33 million which is expected to be completed later this year. This will be a high-standard dual carriageway with a continuous safety barrier and one grade-separated junction.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/8">Plans to provide a 12 kilometre high-standard dual carriageway from Beech Hill to Cloghogue, estimated to cost &pound;109 million, are well advanced. These will incorporate a continuous safety barrier along the length of the scheme with access being provided at five strategically located flyover-type junctions. Construction work is expected to begin in the spring, with completion in 2009. When provided, this scheme will complete the dualling of the route from Sprucefield to the border.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/9">Two junction improvement schemes have recently been completed on the A1. A new underpass was opened in June 2005, at a cost of &pound;3.5 million, at Hillsborough Road at the northern end of the Dromore bypass, and a new flyover was opened in March 2004, at a cost of &pound;4.5 million, at Rathfriland Road on the Banbridge bypass.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/10">Plans for the construction of four further junction improvement schemes over the next three years, at a cost of &pound;16 million, are also well advanced. A new flyover is planned for Dromore Road at the southern end of the Hillsborough bypass, while a new underpass is planned for Banbridge Road at the southern end of the Dromore bypass. A second new flyover is planned for Dromore Road at the northern end of the Banbridge bypass and a second new underpass is planned for Dublin Road at the southern end of the Loughbrickland bypass. I can also advise that the developer of the Bridgewater Outlet Centre at Banbridge is providing a new flyover at Newry Road, at Yellow Hill, at the southern end of the Banbridge bypass.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/11">In our <I>Expanding the Strategic Road Improvement Programme 2015</I> consultation document, we have included two further proposals for the A1. A four kilometre high-standard dual carriageway, estimated to cost &pound;45 million, is proposed to link the M1 motorway to the A1 at Hillsborough. This will bypass the Sprucefield Retail Centre and will include a flyover at Hillsborough roundabout. Four more flyover junctions, estimated to cost &pound;22 million, are also proposed between Hillsborough and Banbridge, which, together with the provision of a continuous central safety barrier between Hillsborough and Loughbrickland, will upgrade this section of the route to a higher-standard dual carriageway with no at-grade crossings.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.8/12">These proposals represent a substantial investment of more than &pound;250 million, of which &pound;33 million has already been completed; &pound;33 million is under construction; &pound;125 million is expected to be constructed over the next three years; and a further &pound;67 million is proposed in the <I>Expanding the Strategic Road Improvement Programme 2015</I> consultation document.</p>

	<p pid="b.231.2/1">The Rural Payments Agency had already begun a major procurement of information technology systems when proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy were negotiated within the EU. The original specification was intended to replace the software supporting the CAP schemes at that time and new elements such as a rural land register and integrated customer register. After an open tender, Accenture was contracted by RPA to deliver against this specification.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.2/2">When it became clear that a mid-term reform of the CAP was likely to progress, RPA established a CAP reform implementation project which included representatives of the Defra policy team negotiating the regulatory changes. This led to major changes to the specification for the information technology work that was already under way. The changes involved additional tenders to extract data from legacy systems so that they could be used to inform customers of their historical claims and support the migration of these data into the Accenture-built systems (RITA). The second set of changes were to either enhance existing functionality or introduce new elements into the IT system (RITA), in order to implement the newly agreed single payment scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.2/3">The original specification for the Accenture contract and the amendments to adapt RITA to the single payment scheme are in the public domain and have been provided to the Efra Select Committee. The tender for the database to extract data from the legacy systems is also in the public domain.</p>
