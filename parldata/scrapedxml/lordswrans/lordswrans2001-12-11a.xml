	<p pid="a.185.5/1">No new schemes to assist the shipbuilding and ship repair industries have been introduced since 1997. However, considerable improvements have been made within existing schemes to assist those industries to improve their competitive performance. In addition to those through department's innovation budget (see the answer to PQ 2001/1602), we have made substantial enhancements to the two sector-specific schemes&mdash;the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund (SIF) and the Home Shipbuilding Credit Guarantee Scheme (HSCGS).</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/2">SIF ceased at the end of last year, as did all other forms of shipbuilding operating aid across the EU, but during the final phase of the scheme we extended its scope and made other changes to make it more attractive to the shipyards. We permitted an element of profit in the calculations of grant levels and broadened eligibility, both geographically and by class of ship.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/3">As regards the HSCGS under which the DTI provides soft credit facilities to ship owners in the form of loan guarantees, we have made the scheme more flexible by providing support for loans in US dollars and euros and by providing guarantees at floating rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.2/1">Applications under the Jean Monnet programme are made directly to the institutions offering the courses, and there is no UK intermediary or agency involved in the process. The British Council actively encourages students in the accession countries to take up all opportunities of attending UK universities, including those offered under the Jean Monnet programme. The Government and the British Council have also introduced a package of changes to support the Prime Minister's initiative to attract international students to the UK. This includes increasing the number of places on the Chevening Scholarship Programme, which enables international students world-wide to study in the UK, easing restrictions on international students taking paid employment and simplifying visa arrangements. The Government also support and encourage student mobility through the Erasmus action of Socrates, which is open to the accession countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.5/1">There are no costs falling on local authorities, the police and the fire authorities, as public entertainment licensing fees allow the local authority concerned to recover the costs of administration, inspection and enforcement associated with the licensing regime. The magistrates' courts and the Court of Appeal become involved in public entertainment licensing only if a decision of the licensing authority is appealed, and the courts have the discretion to recover their costs if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/2">Existing legislation does not provide for any single fee structure. Public entertainment licence fees are set by local authorities and vary enormously. Generally, most fees vary between &pound;40 and &pound;20,000, depending on the venue or scale of the event. There are some higher exceptions. For example, rarer large-scale events involving an audience of more than 5,000 can incur fees between &pound;25,000 and &pound;50,000. For permanent premises, renewal is required annually. The main cost falling on the licensee are the fee, the cost of legal representation, if needed, and the indirect costs of meeting the terms, conditions or restrictions attached to a licence. We estimate that the fee and legal costs to a licensee running permanent premises commonly range between &pound;200 and &pound;25,000 per year. However, no information is available centrally on the indirect costs to licensees of compliance with the terms, conditions and restrictions which may be attached to any licence.</p>

Although rheumatoid arthritis can lead to serious heart disease, the underlying processes differ from those that commonly cause CHD, whereas the weight of clinical opinion is that diabetes is such an important risk factor that it merits specific inclusion in the NSF.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.5/1">Yes. The Modernising Hearing Aid Services Project is being evaluated by the Institute of Hearing Research to provide information on the most effective hearing aids for National Health Service patients, the best ways to supply hearing aids and how a modern hearing aid service can best be delivered to NHS patients. The Department of Health has received interim reports based on data collected from a relatively small sample of patients. The evaluation is still ongoing and the final full evaluation report will be available next year. Decisions on how best to spread the modernised services throughout the NHS will be made as the results of the evaluation emerge. In the meantime, we have earmarked funds to begin roll-out of a modernised service and have said that up to &pound;25 million will be invested by 2003&ndash;04.</p>

As was announced by my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton during Third Reading of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill, which is before this Parliament, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-19">19 November 2001</phrase>, (Official Report, col 927), the Crown authorities have now confirmed that this also applies to those Acts as amended by the current Bill.

	<p pid="a.196.0/3">The full terms of the agreement made by the Crown are as follows: (1) the Crown as landlord will, subject to the conditions described below, agree to the enfranchisement or extension of residential long leases or the grant of new residential long leases, under the same qualifications and terms which will apply by virtue of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 to lessees who hold from other landlords; (2) enfranchisement will be refused where property stands on land which is held inalienably; (3) enfranchisement will also be refused where certain circumstances, which only apply to the Crown, obtain. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/4" class="indent">(i) where there are particular security considerations (on the advice of the Royal and Diplomatic Protection Group of the Metropolitan Police or other security agencies);</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/5" class="indent">(ii) where properties are in, or intimately connected with, the curtilage of historic Royal Parks and Palaces;</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/6" class="indent">(iii) where properties, or the areas in which they are situated, have a long historic or particular association with the Crown. (4) the areas referred to in paragraph (3) (iii) include the Off Islands within the Isles of Scilly (St Agnes, Bryher, St Martins and Tresco), the Garrison on St Mary's, the village of Newton St Loe and parts of central Dartmoor. The properties referred to in that paragraph include old land revenue and reverter properties and grace and favour properties; (5) where enfranchisement is refused on the grounds set out in paragraphs (2) and (3) but the tenant would otherwise qualify for enfranchisement, lease extension or the grant of a new lease by analogy with the statutes, the Crown will be prepared to negotiate new leases; (6) the Crown will follow the valuation bases set out in the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993; (7) the Crown will agree to be bound by arbitration where there is dispute over valuation or other terms, except in cases under paragraphs (2) and (3). The Leasehold Valuation Tribunal will be empowered to act as the arbitration body, and will hear such disputes on voluntary reference; (8) the Crown will be entitled to apply to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal for approval of a scheme of estate management in the same way as other landlords.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.8/2">For this reason, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland decided it would be appropriate to make a decision about whether or not to reappoint the existing commissioners in advance of the end of their initial term in order to provide some certainty for the commissioners themselves and for the wider public in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/1">Appointments to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission are made in accordance with the code of practice for public appointments issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, Dame Rennie Fritchie. The Commissioner for Public Appointments' role is not to approve appointments but rather to regulate, monitor and report on ministerial appointments to public bodies, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.2/1">The Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Xas far as practicable [to] secure that the Commissioners, as a group, are representative of the community in Northern Ireland&quot;. The Secretary of State is also obliged to make appointments in keeping with the guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, including the principle of appointment on merit. The process is necessarily constrained both by the number of people interested in being appointed and by the extent of their qualifications for appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/2">However, it is clear that the commission includes, for example, both unionists and nationalists, men and women, Catholics and Protestants and people from a range of professional and geographical backgrounds within Northern Ireland. In addition, following the recent appointments, it includes a disabled commissioner and a commissioner with strong links to Northern Ireland minority ethnic communities. It is therefore representative on many grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/3">On that basis, the Government remain satisfied that the Secretary of State has fulfilled both the statutory requirement and the obligation to appointment on merit. These factors will continue to govern the way in which the Secretary of State will make future appointments.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.5/2">The role of the Chief Commissioner was set out in the original advertisement, which appeared in the press on <phrase class="date" code="1998-11-24">24 November 1998</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="a.201.2/3">The second form, the pink monitoring form, did not form part of the assessment process and was processed separately.
