	<p pid="a.33.6/1">Approximately 22 million litres of unleaded petrol were consumed in 2002&ndash;03 at which time the duty rate on unleaded petrol was 48.82 pence per litre. This raised &pound;10.7 million for the Exchequer in 2002&ndash;03. Over the same period 5 million litres of biodiesel were consumed on which a duty rate of 25.82 pence per litre was levied. This raised &pound;1.3 million for the Exchequer in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.6/2">The Government introduced a separate rate of duty for biodiesel, at 20 pence per litre below the rate for ultra-low-sulphur petrol, in July 2002. Biodiesel duty receipts for 2002&ndash;03 represent sales from August 2002 to March 2003. Subsequent sales of biodiesel have increased substantially with current sales averaging around 2 million litres per month.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.6/3">The Hydrocarbon Oils Bulletin referred to by Lord Davies of Oldham in his earlier Answer shows that the total duty receipts from all fuels, including ultra-low-sulphur petrol, were &pound;22 billion in 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/1">The department's strategy for avoiding the need for wide-scale disposal of unused pesticides centred on putting over the message last year to use up any of the relevant products before the end of 2003. Last month we reminded gardeners that they should carefully dispose of any remaining withdrawn products. To these ends the Pesticides Safety Directorate has undertaken the following media campaign and related publicity activities:</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/2" class="indent">advertised in Amateur Gardening and similar magazines in March 2003;</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/3" class="indent">issued press releases in July and August 2003, and February 2004;</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/4" class="indent">worked with key organisations such as the Crop Protection Association, Horticultural Trades Association and Garden Centre Association to get over the message on using up stocks; and</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/5" class="indent">provided information via its website and a telephone information line from October 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/6">The Crop Protection Association has also taken steps to brief the media, including the Garden Writers' Guild, on the withdrawals.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/7">The withdrawal timetable for these 81 garden pesticide products is:</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/8" class="indent"><phrase class="date" code="2003-07-24">24 July 2003</phrase>&mdash;last day for sale;</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/9" class="indent"><phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">31 December 2003</phrase>&mdash;last day of use; and</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/10" class="indent"><phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>&mdash;last day for storage (for the purposes of disposal only).</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/11">Should members of the public have inadvertently stored any of these withdrawn products they should contact their local authority for advice. Local waste disposal authorities should make special arrangements for safe disposal of hazardous household waste, such as garden pesticides, including providing some facilities (usually known as civic amenity sites) to which this waste can be brought free of charge.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.2/1">Many laboratory and field research studies have been conducted using imidacloprid and the results have been discussed at various international fora, including the International Commission for Plant-Bee Relationships. None of these studies has raised concerns regarding the risk to honeybees from UK uses.</p>
