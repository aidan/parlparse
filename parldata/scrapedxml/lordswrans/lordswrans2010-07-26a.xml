	<p pid="a.256.8/1">The Rural Land Register Mapping Update project was rolled out progressively across England from June 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.8/2">Around 113,000 maps were produced, of which 5,750 related to single payment scheme claims selected for inspection. To make it easier for farmers, these maps were sent out after the inspection results were incorporated and therefore have not been counted within the mapping update project.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.8/3">Within the mapping update project, around 107,250 farmers were issued with maps which were sent out over a number of weeks. Farmers were asked to check their maps and respond within 28 days. Of these, just under 102,000 completed the process, either agreeing their maps or requesting changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.8/4">RPA received around 80 per cent of farmer responses within the requested time period. RPA repeatedly tried to contact any farmers who did not respond within this time period and all but 5,250 farmers responded. RPA assumed that these remaining farmers agreed their maps.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.8/5">This comparatively high return rate was generated as a result of specific RPA activity to generate awareness of the mapping update project and to highlight the importance of farmers responding. Industry representatives supported this and carried the messages through to their members while a variety of response methods including fax, text, and automated phone line mechanisms were added to the traditional postal responses. Face to face meetings with members of RPA's specialist mapping team provided an additional route in cases where particular circumstances existed.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.8/6">The detail of response mechanisms, methods of communication channels used, and views of farmers and stakeholders would be considered as part of the planning of any future mapping exercise.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.9/1">Since 1998, a wide-ranging programme of research into both cattle and badger vaccines has been in place, with over &#163;29.9 million invested up to the end of the 2009-10 financial year. Results of completed research projects have been peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals and on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.9/2">The cattle vaccines research programme has successfully identified lead BCG-based candidate vaccines for bTB and work is under way to support the licence application for an injectable BCG vaccine for use in cattle. However, vaccination of cattle against TB is currently prohibited under EU legislation. BCG interferes with the primary TB diagnostic test, the tuberculin skin test, so vaccinated cattle would react as if infected and herds could not be declared officially TB free (OTF). Therefore, as part of the UK research programme we are carrying out work to develop and validate a diagnostic test to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals (a so-called DIVA test). Changes will be required to the EU legislation to allow this test to be used in place of, or alongside, the tuberculin skin test to confer OTF status. Because we are still at this early stage of developing a useable cattle vaccine, we have not yet been able to assess the costs of vaccinating cattle.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.9/3">Badger vaccines are further progressed. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) issued a licence for the injectable BCG badger vaccine in March 2010, the first tuberculosis vaccine authorised for use in badgers in the UK. A separate strand of research to develop an oral BCG vaccine bait formulation and delivery protocol is being conducted in collaboration with researchers in the Republic of Ireland and New Zealand, as this will be the most practical application of a vaccine to a wild population.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.5/1">In the present financial year my department is supporting Faiths in Action, a small grants scheme through which grants of up to &#163;6,000 are made to support innovative local inter faith projects. Information about the programme may be found on the website of the Community Development Foundation. My department will also be making financial support available for activities in Inter Faith Week this November.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.5/2">We have made these spending commitments, which total over &#163;2 million, because we recognise that inter faith dialogue and action do much to increase community cohesion. Future financial support for cohesion and other programmes is a matter for the spending review which will conclude in the autumn. Meanwhile, the Government are working closely with the Christian churches and other faith communities to ensure that they are involved in building the big society, in which individuals and groups take responsibility for improving their communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.3/2">The Government recognise that increasing exports is key to rebalancing the economy and that open markets within which UK companies can trade is essential to export success. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), and UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI-a joint FCO-BIS Department) will continue to work closely together in order to strengthen the UK's relations with the fastest-growing areas of the world economy, and remove barriers to trade globally.

	<p pid="a.273.3/3">Government support services for exporters are delivered primarily through UKTI, in partnership with the trade promotion organisations in the devolved Administrations. This support has provided significant and demonstrable benefits for exporters, both those new to export and for experienced exporters seeking to expand into new and more challenging markets. In 2009-10 UKTI helped 23,600 companies. Independent evaluation of the impact of this support, based on companies' own estimates, shows that UKTI's support added an additional &#163;5 billion to bottom line profits: that is &#163;19 of profits these companies would not otherwise have made for every &#163;1 of UKTI spend on trade services.</p>

Few, if any, member states support the status quo, though views vary as to the changes needed. A draft legislative proposal will be published in 2011 and the UK is fully engaged in dialogue with other member states, the European Commission, industry, environmental NGOs and scientists to establish common ground for reform.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.5/1">From 2010, the NHS bowel cancer screening programme is being extended to men and women aged 70 to 75, which will result in around one million more people being screened. In addition, those over the age of 75 will be able to self-refer every two years. The 2010-11 NHS operating framework confirmed that all local bowel screening units should begin the age extension during 2010-11 or on completion of the original two year screening round.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.5/2">The results of a study published by Imperial College London in April have shown that a one-off flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening test for bowel cancer at age 55 can reduce mortality by 43 per cent and reduce the incidence of bowel cancer in people attending screening by 33 per cent.

A person may be refused permission to stay on the basis of his character, conduct or associations or if he represents a threat to national security.

At the same time, she recognised that many of the concerns she had about the way a number of the investigations into complaints had been handled in the past had been addressed already by the UK Border Agency following a decision to transfer responsibility for complaints handling from Detention Services to its Professional Standards Unit in February 2008. She none the less made a number of recommendations, accepted by the UK Border Agency, to strengthen the supervision of staff and improve our complaints handling further. The UK Border Agency committed to implement all those recommendations by the end of this financial year.</p>

There are also issues, such as the security and transport of the Pope and his delegation, for which the Government will take responsibility throughout the visit.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.3/1">The Government have not had any discussions about canal closures due to water shortages and their impact on tourism with British Waterways (BW). This is an operational matter for British Waterways.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.3/2">British Waterways has advised the Government of planned closures of parts of the Leeds and Liverpool canal due to severe drought. British Waterways is doing all it can to conserve water levels and will reopen the canal as soon as sufficient water supplies become available. In the mean time, it is contacting all affected customers and will do all it can to minimise the impact on them.</p>
