Once awarded, entitlement to the benefit continues for as long as the claimant continues to be responsible for the child or young person for whom they are claiming. However, additional conditions of entitlement apply once a young person attains age 16: the young person must be following a course of full-time, non-advanced education or approved training. Entitlement normally ceases before a young person attains age 19, but payment may continue in order to allow a young person to complete a course of non-advanced education or approved training that they started before reaching age 19. Entitlement to child benefit ceases in all cases when a young person attains age 20.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.5/4">The eligibility criteria for EMA were that a young person must:</p>

	<p pid="a.313.3/1">The Department for Transport receives the National Passenger Survey (NPS), which includes specific questions about the quality of train services from Passenger Focus twice a year. In addition, Passenger Focus conducts franchise-specific passenger surveys, which are used to inform the development of new specifications for rail franchises. The department does not currently use passenger satisfaction metrics from former or existing franchises when considering bidders' proposals for future franchises.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.3/2">The NPS along with other research undertaken by Passenger Focus is available on the Passenger Focus website at <a href="http://www.passengerfocus.org.uk">www.passengerfocus.org.uk</a>.</p>
