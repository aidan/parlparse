	<p pid="a.175.0/1">The latest available information on the number of persons detained under Immigration Act powers relates to <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-29">29 December 2001</phrase>. As at that date, 135 Zimbabweans (to the nearest five) were being detained who are recorded as having claimed asylum at some stage, which excludes persons detained in police cells. Forty-five of these were being held at Oakington Reception Centre as part of the fast-track asylum process.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.0/3">We have continued, where appropriate, to detain Zimbabwean asylum seekers at Oakington Reception Centre as part of the fast-track asylum process. Aside from such individuals, there will be a small number of people who are detained at present pending removal while persons concerned will normally be granted bail or temporary admission as appropriate while the suspension of removals remains in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-15">15 January 2001</phrase>, we announced a temporary suspension of returns of unsuccessful asylum applicants to Zimbabwe. We will resume these only when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so, and not before. We are monitoring events in the aftermath of the Zimbabwe presidential election in close liaison with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). There is no set time-scale, but it would be unrealistic to be able to make any decision on a resumption of removals until the immediate post-election situation has calmed down and we have had time to assess properly the risks to returnees and gather and consider the views of FCO and others. bern</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">In answer to Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-12">12 March</phrase>, my right honourable Friend the Foreign Secretary said that weapons inspectors were unable to account for 4,000 tonnes of so-called precursor chemicals used in the production of weapons; 610 tonnes of precursor chemicals used in the production of nerve gas; and 31,000 chemical weapons munitions (Official Report, Commons, 12/3/02; col. 744).</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">This information was the best available at the time, and was based on Iraqi declarations to UNSCOM inspectors between 1991&ndash;98 and data contained in an UNSCOM report published in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/3">Since he gave this answer, Her Majesty's Government have carried out a more detailed study. This latest assessment of the quantities of material unaccounted for by UNSCOM inspectors which has potential applications in Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programes is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/4" class="indent">up to 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, approximately 300 tonnes of which, in the Iraqi CW programme, were unique to the production of VX nerve agent;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/5" class="indent">up to 360 tonnes of bulk CW agent including 1.5 tonnes of VX;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/6" class="indent">and over 30,000 special munitions for delivery of chemical and biological agents;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/7" class="indent">large quantities of growth media acquired for use in the production of biological weapons&mdash;enough to produce over three times the amount of anthrax Iraq admits to having manufactured.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/8">These figures represent our latest assessment. This assessment is subject to continual review in the light of any updates from UNMOVIC or incoming intelligence reports. Some of the estimates are unchanged. The changes we have made do not alter our view on the scale of the Iraqi WMD threat. Indeed, they reinforce our judgment that Iraq's chemical and biological capabilities are substantial and a very real danger to the region and the wider world. We shall be releasing further material about this threat in due course.</p>

The JCVI sub-group also recommended that using a different strain of vaccine from that used in the United States offered the greatest safeguard if difficulties arose with the production of either strain ensuring that the alternative strain could act as a fall-back.</p>

Standard BD 53 includes the following mandatory schedule of inspections:</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/2">Superficial Inspections: carried out on an ongoing basis to identify any obvious deficiencies that could lead to accidents;</p>
	<p pid="a.181.6/3">General Inspection: every two years for the tunnel structure and annually for the mechanical and eletrical functions;</p>

	<p pid="a.184.2/1">We have been advised by the board of London Regional Transport that London Underground Limited has today signed public/private partnership contracts to modernise and maintain London Underground's infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/2">There are three contracts, which will each run for 30 years. Those for two of the infrastructure companies will go to Metronet, and the third to the Tube Lines Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/3">In a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February</phrase> we set out why the Government supported London Transport's decision that it was minded to proceed with the Tube modernisation plans. The Government have consistently set out three key tests that the plans must pass if they are to proceed: that they are not a privatisation; that they should offer value for money; and that they should be safe for both passengers and staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/4">We are satisfied that the modernisation plans are not a privatisation. The ownership of the assets, and the operation of the public service, stay in the public sector. It is also likely that the assets will continue to be scored on London Underground's balance sheet, in the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/5">We are also satisfied that the arrangements offer value for money, when judged against alternative proposals. At our request, Ernst &amp; Young reviewed London Underground's original value for money assessment and confirmed that, overall, London Underground's methodology for assessing value for money was robust, and that London Underground's recommendation that the PPP proposals deliver value for money, while subjective, was supported by its analysis. Since then, Ernst &amp; Young has reviewed the work done by London Underground to update the value for money assessment in respect of material changes to the contracts. It confirmed that London Underground's approach was consistent with that used for the previous report. We have placed a copy of its update in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/6">The Health and Safety Executive has still to reach a final judgment on London Underground's revised railway safety case. The position therefore remains that the Tube modernisation plans will only proceed if the independent regulator accepts the safety arrangements for both passengers and staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/7">Subject to approval of the safety case, we share London Regional Transport's belief that the modernisation plans are the right solution and offer significant benefits for Londoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/8">Fares will continue to be set by the Mayor of London. The modernisation plans do not require fares to rise faster than inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/9">The three contracts are intended to take effect by the summer. We notified Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase> that we were considering issuing a comfort letter in support of each of the contracts. Our intention is that such comfort letters should be issued shortly before the transactions are completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/10">London Regional Transport's decision has been taken in the light of an extensive consultation with Transport for London. London Regional Transport has accepted some of the points Transport for London has made, and made changes to the contracts accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/11">We fully support the decision taken today by the board of London Regional Transport and look forward to the modernisation plans coming into operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/12">It remains my intention that the ownership of London Underground will be transferred to Transport for London as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.2/1">The new access rights granted by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act will apply only on &quot;access land&quot; and generally not on improved or semi-improved grass land which is more intensively grazed and where the public is more likely to come into contact with animals and their faeces. The overall risk to the individual user of the countryside from zoonoses and to farmers' livestock from humans carrying such infections is therefore not expected to change significantly.</p>
