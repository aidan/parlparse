	<p pid="a.147.2/1">One of the UK's key objectives for renegotiation of the generalised system of preferences (GSP) scheme is to increase the development gains to beneficiary countries of increased trade with the EU, within the context of trade liberalisation through the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>

The special incentive arrangement will provide duty free access to &quot;vulnerable&quot; countries which have satisfied a range of criteria, including the ratification of 23 international conventions.

	<p pid="a.147.5/1">Her Majesty's Government, specifically the Department for International Development (DfID), is not funding or promoting the introduction of genetically modified crops in Andhra Pradesh or elsewhere in India. DfID does not collaborate with Syngenta to develop genetically modified crops in Andhra Pradesh. DfID does support work to develop traditional crop varieties and farming practices in drought prone areas of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/2">DfID's policy on GM technologies is that they have the potential to provide significant benefits for poor farmers, if applied safely and responsibly to the crops they rely on. Developing countries need to make their own informed choices about adoption of GM technologies, and build the capacity to manage their safe development and use.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.3/1">The UK has provided &pound;2 million to support capacity building in and modernisation of the Afghan Ministry of Justice under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Justice Sector Reform Programme. We have helped establish policy and communication units to make key decisions on justice issues and to co-ordinate activities between the Ministry of Justice and provincial authorities. The construction and refurbishment of provincial and district court buildings is well under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/2">As part of the UK's long-term support for the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, we are providing &pound;1.1 million over two years to a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) project to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system quickly to deal with counter-narcotics cases. We are co-ordinating closely with Italy, which has the international lead on criminal justice reform in Afghanistan, the US, Norway and other international partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/3">This work includes the training and mentoring of a criminal justice task force of up to 77 investigators, prosecutors and judges, which will work towards convictions of medium value traffickers by the end of the year. While working with the Afghans and the US on an interim detention facility, the UNODC project will result in a secure court and prison facility, on which an Her Majesty's Prison Service adviser has made recommendations. We are also doing additional work with Italy and other partners to strengthen the counter-narcotics law and the criminal procedural code.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/4">Afghanistan is a party to the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Therefore the court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed there after <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-01">1 May 2003</phrase> when the statute entered into force for Afghanistan or after <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase> if Afghanistan were to make an appropriate declaration.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/5">We are helping the Iraqi Government to rebuild their legal infrastructure by providing training in a number of areas. The Department for International Development is providing over &pound;2 million to train judges, prosecutors and lawyers to increase independence, professionalism and respect for human rights and to support the strengthening of the Iraqi Bar Association. We are also providing training for the judges and prosecutors in the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) which is part of the Iraqi criminal justice system. The IST was established to try members of the former regime accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and certain other serious crimes under existing Iraqi law including: the manipulation of the judiciary; squandering public resources; and the threat or use of force against other Arab States. The UK has also been providing support to improve prison standards in the south of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/6">Iraq is not a party to the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Therefore the court can only exercise jurisdiction with respect to such crimes committed there if they were committed by a national of a state party, if Iraq were to make an appropriate declaration or if there were a referral by the Security Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.2/1">Working with other United Nations (UN) member states to reduce illicit movements of small arms and light weapons (SALW) is a high priority for the Government. We have allocated &pound;13.25 million between 2004&ndash;07 to support programmes aimed at achieving this. The UK is an active participant in the open-ended working group on marking and tracing of SALW, and, along with European Union member states, we continue to push for a legally binding instrument that includes SALW ammunition. We recognise that brokering is another area where tighter controls are needed and fully support the establishment, no later than 2007, of a UN group of government experts to consider this important issue in depth.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/2">One of our SALW priorities is promoting the Transfer Control Initiative, which aims at agreement on common international standards governing small arms transfers at the UN Programme of Action Review Conference on Small Arms in 2006. The UK is supporting this initiative by organising sub-regional workshops and bilateral meetings, which we hope will lead to common agreement on responsibility in SALW transfers.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.2/1">The United Kingdom has supported the operation and development of the United Nations Register on Conventional Arms since its establishment in 1992. The Government have reported every year on all seven categories of major equipment covered by the register and have provided additional background information.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2">The UK encourages member states to participate in the register. We have supported the work of the United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs (UN DDA) by participating and funding regional workshops which explain the register's operation. Through the formal periodic reviews of the register, we have been at the forefront of efforts to expand the register's scope, and have proposed recommendations to encourage reporting and participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/3">Member states are themselves responsible for the accuracy and timeliness of their reports. We have supported the UN DDA in its ability to verify the accuracy of information provided, but we recognise that participation in the register is voluntary and the scope of information provided is a national prerogative.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4">The UK also co-sponsors the annual UN General Assembly resolution that underpins the register's operation by inviting all states to participate.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.5/1">The Government give firm support to United Nations (UN) conflict resolution and peacebuilding. In doing so, we encourage the UN to engage with a broad range of actors.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/2">We have prompted and supported UN co-operation with regional organisations, particularly in Africa. In Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire, Economic Community of West African States peacekeeping troops have deployed in support of UN efforts. The UN and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development worked closely together in the Naivasha peace process which culminated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-09">9 January 2005</phrase>. We are supporting the UN in the development of its relations with the African Union (AU) and welcome the latter's co-operation with the UN's special political mission in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/3">We have used the joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office/Department for International Development (DfID)/Ministry of Defence Global Conflict Prevention Pool to support a range of projects that strengthen the UN's capacity to anticipate, analyse and address the causes of conflict. Many of these projects have been taken forward in collaboration with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as the International Centre for Transitional Justice, the International Peace Academy and the Conflict Prevention and Peace Forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/4">We have been active in encouraging the UN to ensure that it takes account of gender and other human rights aspects in its conflict work. The UK has promoted the expansion of mandates for all current UN peace support operations to authorise the deployment of specialist staff or advisers to deal with all issues of conflict resolution including gender, the special needs of children and human rights. DfID has provided &pound;96,000 to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop a training manual on gender related issues in most aspects of peacekeeping, such as political and civil affairs and strategies in effective gender mainstreaming.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/5">The Global Conflict Prevention Pool has financed several initiatives in support of implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security. These include, for example, supporting the UN's Development Fund for Women in its efforts to gather information on women's peace-building and gender justice initiatives, and also work with the Urgent Action Fund for Women's Human Rights, an NGO that supports grass-roots activities in countries where there are multinational peacekeeping operations. More detail of how the UK has supported implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 is contained in our response to the UN Security Council in May 2004, which can be found on the following website: <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/responsesl1325/UK-E.pdf">www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/responsesl1325/UK&ndash;E.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/6">Looking forward, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has welcomed the report of the UN Secretary-General's high-level panel, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, which makes a wide range of recommendations aimed at improving the international response to threats to global peace and security. The Government will be giving the UN Secretary-General firm support in taking this agenda forward, in particular the establishment of a UN Peacebuilding Commission to ensure proper co-ordination and sequencing of peacebuilding activities, including issues of local consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.6/1">The UK shares with other governments the objective of concluding a comprehensive convention on terrorism. We have been working to secure such a convention for many years. The draft convention is well developed with very few articles still outstanding. The first opportunity to move forward will come at the March meeting of the committee charged with developing these drafts. In preparation for this, we are engaging informally with partners to discuss how we can use the added momentum provided by the panel to break the deadlock.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.0/1">Records are not held centrally regarding the numbers of British service personnel hospitalised as a consequence of hostile action, accidents or other incidents since the start of conflict in Iraq in March 2003. As a result, we are also unable to detail how long such personnel were hospitalised for. However, our records do show that as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-29">29 January</phrase>, the United Kingdom has conducted 2,915 medical evacuations from Iraq since February 2003. This includes a small number of entitled civilians and Iraqis.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/2">Figures are also available for personnel who have been admitted to Selly Oak hospital in Birmingham, which treats the majority of those who are medically evacuated and hospitalised in the UK. As of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-20">20 January 2005</phrase>, 875 service personnel deployed in Iraq have been hospitalised at Selly Oak. These admissions were for reasons of illness and injury, of which the majority were not combat related.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.9/1">Provision of leave and minor allowances towards sport and adventurous training is seen as one of the best and most cost-effective means of boosting morale, improving retention in the services and providing continued professional and personal development.

	<p pid="a.168.9/2">The regulations for recreational travel and subsistence expenses laid down in Joint Service's Defence Council Instructions permit participants and essential officials at overseas events such as Single Service Winter Sports Championships to claim a contribution towards their attendance. Travel must be by the cheapest means and subject to the local budget holder's approval and a maximum value; strict criteria apply. They can also claim an allowance for meals in lieu of the provision of service meals.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.3/2">The Type 45's main weapon system is the principal anti-air missile system (PAAMS), which will enable the Type 45 to fulfil its primary role of anti-air warfare (AAW). PAAMS equipment carried by each ship will include a 48-cell sylver vertical launching system (VLS), Aster 15 and 30 missiles, the highly capable SAMPSON multi-function radar (MFR) for surveillance and fire control, the S1850 long-range radar (LRR) for air/surface search, and the command and control system.

	<p pid="a.171.5/1">The 1998 St Malo text declares the intentions of the UK and French heads of state to unite in their efforts to enable the European Union to play a full role on the international stage. It concentrates particularly on what is now known as European Security and Defence Policy, while recognising the need to respect countries different situations in relation to NATO.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/2">Since 1998 ESDP has developed considerably. It has enabled the EU to launch three peacekeeping operations: in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2003); Macedonia (2003); and Bosnia (launched in December 2004). The current Bosnia operation took over from NATO's SFOR and is proving the efficacy of the Berlin Plus arrangements agreed in 2003 for EU access to NATO assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/3">Other successes include the establishment of the European Defence Agency in 2004 to drive forward capability development and improve defence/industrial co-operation; the continuing development of a capacity for military and joint civil/military planning, based on agreed consultation arrangements with NATO; and the establishment of initial operating capability for the rapid-response Battlegroups initiative, with full operating capability expected in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/4">The UK and France have collaborated closely throughout. For example, the UK and France jointly proposed the Battlegroups initiative, and the December 2004 council agreement on planning capabilities was based on a UK-France-Germany proposal.</p>

A good, well organised homework programme helps children and young people to develop the skills and attitudes they will need for successful, independent life-long learning. While it is for individual schools to determine their own policy on homework, the Government have issued non-statutory guidelines to help primary and secondary schools to draw up and implement effective homework policies.</p>

Intelligent design theory is not part of the National Curriculum.

Intelligent design theory could be discussed in schools, but only in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution that students might consider and evaluate against the evidence.</p>

The current account deficit was 1.7 per cent of GDP in the same period, less than half the peak of 5.1 per cent of GDP in 1989.

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">The UK Government are confident that their legislation on sex discrimination and wider provisions on gender equality broadly cover the rights and freedoms within the United Nations Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The UK's fifth periodic CEDAW report (June 2003) illustrates the various measures the UK Government have taken to implement CEDAW. Following this, the UK Government do not expect a significant amount of public expenditure to be incurred during the next two years as a result of their acceptance of the individual right of petition under the United Nations Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.11/1">In the financial year 2003 to 2004 aggregates levy receipts for the UK were &pound;339 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/2">In the same financial year Defra's Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund spent &pound;19.5 million in England on the following objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/3" class="indent">Minimising the demand for primary aggregates;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/4" class="indent">Promoting environmentally friendly extraction and transport; and</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/5" class="indent">Reducing the local effects of aggregate extraction.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/6">In Wales &pound;1.35 million was spent on the following objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/7" class="indent">Providing limited compensation to help mineral planning authorities revoke or amend existing minerals permissions; and</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/8" class="indent">Promoting the use of alternative materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/9">In Scotland, the Scottish Executive administering its aggregates levy funding through the Sustainable Action Fund, spent &pound;3.2 million. The aggregates levy funding which Scotland receives was used to support a range of sustainable development projects and community environmental renewal projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/10">Northern Ireland was allocated &pound;972,000 and this allocation forms part of the totality of public expenditure moneys available for public services in Northern Ireland. It has not been ring-fenced for similar uses to the fund as in the other parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/11">In recognition of the adverse economic effects of the tax peculiar to Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland quarry industry was granted a partial derogation from the aggregates levy. Since then, the Department of Environment has developed and implemented the Aggregates Levy Credit Scheme (ALCS) for the Northern Ireland aggregates industry acting as agents for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.11/12">The ALCS enables operators to obtain tax relief at a rate of 80 per cent of the full rate of the levy in return for compliance with a code of practice which addresses 15 areas of environmental risk. Many of the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund's objectives will be met through the operation of the ALCS. Policy development on the use of Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund resources will concentrate on objectives of the fund not addressed through the ALCS.</p>
