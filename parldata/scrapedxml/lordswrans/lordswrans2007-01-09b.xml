	<p pid="b.61.3/1">For farmers in Afghanistan a livelihood is normally composed of a combination of activities. These may include agriculture (crops, livestock); employment (migrant labour); remittances (from family members working away from home); or welfare (for vulnerable groups not able to work). The way in which an Afghan earns a living may also change throughout the year. DfID's Livelihoods Programme, worth nearly &pound;150 million from 2006 to 2009, recognises this and is a balance of shorter and longer-term initiatives, designed to address immediate needs as well as promoting longer-term rural economic development and sustainable alternatives to opium.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/2">DfID has established a &pound;3 million Research in Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF) in Afghanistan for applied research into natural resource-based livelihoods. The programme is looking at improved forage and milk production and the introduction of legumes and vegetable crops, saffron and the medicinal properties of mint as viable alternatives to poppy production.

	<p pid="b.62.2/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) puts around 70 per cent of its budget for Afghanistan through the national budget and national priority programmes. This helps the Afghan Government lead the reconstruction effort, co-ordinate development assistance and to be accountable to the Afghan people.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.2/2">DfID is a major contributor to three national priority programmes of the Government of Afghanistan. These are the National Solidarity Programme (NSP), the National Rural Access Programme (NRAP), and the Micro-finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA). In total DfID has committed &pound;55 million to these programmes through the investment window of the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund. In addition DfID is contributing &pound;30 million over three years to the reconstruction of Helmand province, through the expansion of Afghan national programmes in the province.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.2/3">DfID has a significant interest in the management and implementation of these national programmes. Formal representations are made through the ARTF management board. In addition there is regular dialogue with the line ministry responsible and the national co-ordinators for each programme on issues such as funding, progress, expansion and impact and financial management.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.2/1">Military personnel deployed to Afghanistan are eligible for the operational allowance and separation allowances. The operational allowance, announced by the Secretary of State for Defence on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-10">10 October</phrase>, is paid to all personnel who have deployed to or are still serving in Afghanistan, Iraq or the Balkans. It is to recognise the significantly increased and enduring nature of the danger in these operational locations. It is a tax-free lump sum payment worth around &pound;2,240 for a six-month deployment and is paid at the end of a service person's qualifying tour as a one-off payment via salary once they return to their permanent unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/2">Personnel are also entitled to separation allowances, either longer separated allowance (LSA&mdash;Royal Navy/Royal Marines and Royal Air Force) or longer separated service allowance (LSSA&mdash;Army only).</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/3">LSA is a daily payment for each day a service person is separated from their home base and family, for more than 10 days. It is paid at one of 14 rates that range from &pound;6.02 to &pound;25.42 per day. The rate payable depends upon the accumulated separated service of the service person; the more separated service that has been undertaken, the higher the rate of allowance paid. LSA is taxable and paid on a monthly basis via the service person's salary.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/4">LSSA is paid to eligible Army personnel on the same criteria as LSA. This allowance has three rates that are identical to levels 1 to 3 of LSA and range from &pound;6.02 to &pound;12.82 per day. Once again, the rate payable depends upon the accumulated separated service of the service person, and the more separated service that has been undertaken, the higher the rate of allowance. LSSA is taxable and paid on a monthly basis via the service person's salary. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, Army personnel will cease their eligibility for LSSA and instead become eligible for LSA, with its 14 rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/5">Depending on the nature of their duties, some personnel deployed to Afghanistan might also be eligible for unpleasant work allowance. This is paid at one of three rates ranging from &pound;2.25 to &pound;16.34 per day. This allowance is paid to compensate those personnel who must undertake particularly unpleasant duties, possibly in arduous conditions. It is taxable and paid on a monthly basis via the service person's salary.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/6">In addition, while serving on operations in Afghanistan, all personnel are exempt from the payment of charges for food or accommodation occupied in the operational theatre.</p>

In addition, there are approximately 2,000 sets held in operational reserve in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although stock levels change according to replenishment and issues, the operational reserve generally equates to an additional 10 to15 per cent of stock above that required for personal issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.3/3">In protecting access to justice, through the department's current system of fees concessions, in the past financial year (2005-06) the taxpayer in effect paid subsidies in 322,465 instances with a value of just over &pound;29 million for exemptions and remissions. And that does not count the fees subsidised by the taxpayer through legal aid.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.6/1">The Treasury has agreed that the over-recovery of &pound;34 million can be phased out over the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 period. Therefore, Her Majesty's Courts Service proposes to use the increased income generated to fund: progressive reductions in the civil over-recovery; the additional cost of the proposed reforms in the remission and exemption policy; and any planned increases in resource spending on IT modernisation. Within civil proceedings, we are proposing to introduce hearing fees in the High Court and county court and other changes so that fees better match cost drivers.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.6/2">We are also proposing to make the appropriate reductions to offset extra income from hearing fees and to eliminate the over-recovery. This would be targeted on issue fees and weighted towards the fees for using e-channels (County Court Bulk Centre, Money Claim OnLine and Possession Claim OnLine), reflecting the lower cost compared with paper issue and the objective of promoting their greater use as part of the Her Majesty's Courts Service's business strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.2/1">The estimated average time from date of verdict to completion in magistrates' courts for indictable/triable-either-way cases decreased from seven days in 1997 to six days in 2005. These figures are based on all completions in the magistrates' courts and will include cases committed to the Crown Court, and cases dismissed or discharged as well as those where a sentence was passed in the magistrates' court. This is because timeliness data broken down by case completion type have been available only since February 1999. Therefore estimates covering all completion types have been provided to enable valid comparisons between 1997 and 2005. Recent data suggest that sentenced cases account for around two-thirds of all completions in the magistrates' courts.</p>

Approved regulators such as the Law Society will be required to separate their regulatory and representative functions. This is to ensure that consumers have confidence in the new framework. Under Clause 29 of the Bill, the board is required to set rules on the regulatory arrangements of approved regulators, including how the separation of the regulatory and representative functions should be achieved.</p>

A &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach would not be appropriate, given the difference in nature of the approved regulators and the activities they regulate. The LSB will have the right to authorise and to de-authorise approved regulators like the Law Society and the Bar Council; and will have a range of other powers (for example, setting regulatory targets, censuring approved regulators, imposing financial penalties and directing the approved regulators to take specific action) where a regulator is failing.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.5/1">Detailed below are the payments envisaged in the original franchise agreement, the actual sums paid (including those of the substituted &quot;letter agreement&quot;) and the subsidies expected to be paid under the reinstated franchise agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.5/2">In 2002 a &quot;letter agreement&quot; was put in place to reflect Railtrack's failure to deliver the agreed terms of the west coast modernisation programme. The recently announced agreement puts the Virgin West Coast franchise back on a secure contractual footing and enables the department to secure additional public value by incentivising the operator to reduce costs. Bracketed figures are premia planned to be received by the department.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.5/3">It is to be noted that the sums paid include actual incentive payments and receipts. The sums paid also include the impact of the ORR regulatory review of track access charges, as do those planned for the reinstated franchise agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.5/4">The reinstated franchise agreement, unlike the original, includes a revenue share/support arrangement in the eventuality that a target revenue is exceeded/fails to be achieved. This is in accordance with other recent franchises. The Department for Transport will receive 50 per cent of revenues achieved between 102 per cent and 106 per cent of an agreed target revenue and 80 per cent of revenues greater than 106 per cent of target revenue.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.5/5">Revenue support arrangements are a mirror image of these; that is, should the franchisee fail to achieve between 98 per cent and 100 per cent of target revenues the franchisee will receive no support. Should 94 per cent to 98 per cent of target revenue not be achieved the department pays 50 per cent of that revenue not achieved; it pays 80 per cent should revenues received be less than 94 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.84.5/1">To date, three national skills academies (NSAs) have been approved. These are in the areas of manufacturing, financial services and construction. A fourth NSA in food and drink processing is at an advanced stage in developing its business plan and should be ready for approval shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.5/2">A further four national skills academies have been selected from a second round of expressions of interest and are currently in the business planning stage prior to approval. These are in the areas of hospitality, creative and cultural, nuclear, and chemical process engineering. National skills academies will offer sector specific skills development and relevant vocational training at a range of levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.5/3">All academies will be expected to have a national reach but each NSA will have its own model for achieving this. The financial services NSA will develop regional centres of excellence in London, Leeds, Manchester and Norwich initially, but aims to expand this network into further regions from 2007 onwards with the support of significant employer investment. The construction NSA will establish on-site training centres supported by a fleet of regionally based mobile centres at a range of significant construction projects across all nine English regions. The manufacturing NSA will be working through the existing provider network, particularly centres of vocational excellence (CoVES), initially launching in the north-east and West Midlands, where it will have its main hub.</p>

	<p pid="b.84.8/1">National skills academies (NSA) will provide training for people of working age. However, a number plan to establish links with schools in order to facilitate pre-work vocational training and work experience in their sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.8/2">There is no set curriculum for national skills academies. Each academy will work closely with the employers in its sector to determine the key areas for skills development. These could include craft, technical and managerial areas. Employers, working with sector skills councils (SSCs), will shape all aspects of the design of academies and delivery of the training including suitable courses, normally leading to recognised qualifications. Academies plan to offer a wide range of learning opportunities, including new entry routes to employment, apprenticeships, pre-employment training for adults aimed at broadening the recruitment pool, full-time and work-based routes to qualifications, including flexible and &quot;bite-sized&quot; learning, designed specifically by and for employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.8/3">The National Skills Academy for Manufacturing aims to support the learning needs of around 40,000 learners per year by 2012. The NSA for construction expects to have facilitated 10,000 apprenticeships and trained 100,000 adults to enable them to gain national vocational qualifications at levels 2 and 3 by 2010. The financial services NSA expects to have 15,000 learners by 2008-09.</p>

The removal of the temporary police recruitment provisions are as outlined in annexe B of the St Andrews agreement of 2006.
