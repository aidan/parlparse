	<p pid="a.130.0/2">It would be impossible in many cases for non-Iraqi agencies to make a reliable assessment either of casualties resulting from particular attacks, or of the overall number of casualties since March 2003. The UK Armed Forces do not maintain records which would enable us to make a definitive estimate of the total number of civilian casualties arising during this time. An independent inquiry is highly unlikely to be able to gain better access and provide more accurate information on casualties than the Iraqi Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.0/1">The latest report by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) is based on two audit reports conducted by KPMG, covering Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) management of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) from <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May 2003</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-28">28 June 2004</phrase>. Both audit reports conclude that, with the exception of smuggling, &quot;the DFI Statement of Cash Receipts and Payment presents fairly, in all material respects, the receipts and payments of the DFI&quot;. The IAMB report recognises that &quot;all known oil proceeds, reported frozen assets, and transfers from the Oil for Food Programme have been properly and transparently accounted for in the DFI&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/2">Nevertheless, we acknowledge the concerns raised by the IAMB and its auditors. These concerns arose in large part due to the difficult operating conditions in Iraq after military action in April 2003. To address these difficulties the CPA took a number of steps to improve financial management and control over oil resources. These included:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/3" class="indent">measures to tackle smuggling, including seizing ships and persuading leading clerics to condemn smuggling;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/4" class="indent">a new framework for budgets in the Financial Management Law which enshrined transparency as one of the fundamental principles; and</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/5" class="indent">improved financial reporting and record keeping.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/6">The UK continues to help the Iraqi Government to ensure efficient and transparent financial management through a Department for International Development funded team seconded to advise the Ministry of Finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/7">Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 of <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May 2003</phrase>, the occupying powers shared joint responsibility for the actions of the CPA, including management of the DFI. The UK supported the establishment of the IAMB, an independent international board to oversee the auditing of Iraq's oil revenues and their management, so that the coalition was seen to discharge its financial responsibilities as occupying power properly.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.8/1">These questions relate to one aspect of the reforms to pension tax simplification, which sweeps away the eight existing complex tax regimes and replaces them with a single universal regime for tax-privileged pension savings. This new regime will provide greater flexibility to some 15 million pension savers.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.8/2">Currently most pension funds are permitted to invest in residential property, including property overseas, and many do. The new simplified regime will also allow small self-administered schemes (SSASs) and self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) to invest in residential property from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>. These are specialist pension vehicles, typically taken out by wealthier individuals and are held by only around 200,000 people compared to over 15 million contributing to pensions. Creating a single set of allowable investments across all pension schemes fits the requirement to create a single regime for tax privileged pension saving and corrects an existing distortion by giving investors greater choice rather than creating a new one in favour of property.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.8/3">Any additional cost to the Exchequer will depend on uncertain behavioural responses to these reforms&mdash;whether or not individuals who will be able to invest in a wider range of assets choose to invest more than they do now.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.2/1">The display of out-of-date grading signs by hotels, or other establishments, is both confusing for consumers and an abuse of the voluntary accommodation grading schemes. However, where the sign is owned by the business itself, the matter is one of trading standards, and addressing it is the responsibility of the appropriate local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/2">The Government and the grading organisations are working to minimise consumer confusion caused by out-of-date signage. It is VisitBritain's policy to report abuses to local trading standards offices and, for some time, VisitBritain has retained ownership of grading signs so they may be reclaimed where businesses leave its grading scheme or have their gradings changed. VisitBritain and the other four grading organisations&mdash;VisitScotland, the Welsh Tourist Board, the Automobile Association and the Royal Automobile Club&mdash;also agreed to the adoption of common grading standards in May 2004. When fully implemented, this should further improve consumer confidence in the schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.2/1">The Department of Health is not funding research into the effects of jet lag.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/2">The research sub-group of the Department of Transport's Aviation Health Working Group has established research priorities and is supporting a research programme in relation to air travel and health. The sub-group has considered the possible inclusion of research into jet lag in the programme, but has decided against on the grounds that other topics, including deep vein thrombosis and aircraft cabin air quality, have a higher priority.</p>
