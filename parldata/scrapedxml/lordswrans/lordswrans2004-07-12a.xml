	<p pid="a.116.6/1">The numbers enrolled at schools are kept under review with the relevant school authorities and amalgamation or closure is agreed for schools that are no longer considered viable. There are no set enrolments below which funding is automatically withheld: viability is considered on a case-by-case basis. To receive government support schools must also satisfy the following requirements:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/2" class="indent">School management&mdash;the school must have a scheme of management under Article 123 of Education Reform (NI) Order 1989 and a board of governors constituted under Article 11 of the Education and Libraries (NI) Order 1986.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/3" class="indent">Teachers&mdash;teachers must be properly qualified under Article 70(i) of the Education and Libraries (NI) Order 1986 and must observe days of operation under the teacher's regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/4" class="indent">Curriculum&mdash;there is a specific statutory requirement under the Education Reform (NI) Order 1989 that to qualify for grant a school must teach the Northern Ireland school curriculum as specified in the order.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/5">The department is also required to ensure that the establishment of a new school will not result in unreasonable public expenditure and will be viable in the long-term.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/6">The current enrolment criteria for all new schools to qualify for funding are:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/7" class="italic">Primary schools:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/8" class="indent">Rural areas Minimum P1 intake of 12 pupils</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/9" class="indent">Urban areas Minimum P1 intake of 15 pupils</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/10"><i>Secondary schools:</i> Minimum intake of 50 pupils</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/11">The criteria for primary schools have been in place since 2000 and for post-primary schools since 2001. In recent years, new schools have generally been in either the integrated or Irish-medium sector. The criteria that applied to integrated schools prior to the introduction of the current requirements are below. These covered the Irish-medium sector since 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.6/23">Two new schools received funding without strictly meeting the relevant intake criteria, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/24" class="indent">(i) In 1996, Meanscoil Feirste, the only Irish-medium post-primary school in Northern Ireland, was awarded grant-aided status, although it did not achieve the required intake. There was, however, firm evidence from the school's previous intakes and the growth in the Irish-medium primary school sector that the school would shortly achieve the level of enrolments and that these would be sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.6/25" class="indent">(ii) In 2002, Bunscoil Bheanna Boirche, an existing independent Irish-medium primary school in Castlewellan, was approved for funding with a year 1 intake of 10 instead of 12. The decision was taken on the basis that the school had just fallen short of the minimum but had 12 pre-school children in the attached pre-school unit. The school at the time also had a total of 32 children of compulsory school age already attending.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.8/1">There is no need to do so. The Ministry of Defence uses the procedure under Department of the Environment Circular 18/84 Part 4 paragraph 21, whereby the Secretary of State for Defence reviews objections made during the planning process and considers whether it is appropriate to refer these to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. This procedure has been followed in the case of the proposed laser facility. The Secretary of State for Defence believes that objections on planning policy issues have been taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.5/1">The regional chambers&mdash;often referred to as assemblies&mdash;are voluntary, independent bodies, designated by the Government under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998.

	<p pid="a.127.0/1">It is not possible to guarantee that young people searching the Internet for information on teenage pregnancy or sexual health will not inadvertently access an inappropriate site, in particular if they are using home-based PCs.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/2">We do, however, provide clear guidance to schools, in order to minimise the risk of young people accessing inappropriate material from a school-based computer. Recent guidance issued by DfES to schools: <i>Superhighway Safety: Safe use of the Internet</i> raises awareness of both the benefits and risks of the Internet and related technologies, providing an understanding of their appropriate and effective use both in and outside the classroom. Through the National Grid for Learning (NGfL), we provide access to high-quality educational resources within a safe area of the Internet. All sites linked to the NGfL conform to published standards and a code of conduct, one of the principles of which is that sites should &quot;provide no direct access to undesirable materials&quot;. A copy of the code of conduct can be accessed from <a href="http://www.ngfl.gov.uk">www.ngfl.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/3">While schools are relatively protected areas, where pupils are able to access different technologies under human and technological supervision and monitoring, this level of protection will not necessarily be the case where young people access information from home. Guidance therefore makes clear that schools should aim to bridge the gap between home and school, sharing policies and approaches to Internet safety with parents so that the same messages can be extended into the home environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/4">The Government have created a youth portal&mdash;<a href="http://www.need2know.co.uk">www.need2know.co.uk</a>&mdash;to provide a first-stop shop to responsible and authoritative sources of information for young people on a wide range of issues that they have identified as being important to them, including sexual health. The website that supports the teenage pregnancy strategy's national awareness campaign (RUThinking.co.uk) purposely does not have the word &quot;sex&quot; in its name, to minimise the risk of young people accessing inappropriate sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.2/2">The WTO does not allow restrictions on imports purely on the basis of production or processing method. In the light of this, the EU has been pressing in the WTO for recognition of the right of member countries to choose for themselves the level of consumer information about production and processing methods that can be included with imported products. But this has met with little support from elsewhere. I have asked my officials to keep the British Egg Industry Council informed on developments.</p>
