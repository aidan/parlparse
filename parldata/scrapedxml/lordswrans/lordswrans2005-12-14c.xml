	<p pid="c.162.6/1">The victim is not on trial for an offence so the question of a right to a fair trial for victims does not arise. However, victims must be treated fairly in the trial process and in this sense are entitled to a fair trial as much as the defendant. This position is consistent with ECHR jurisprudence, where it has been held that the defendant's right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention must be balanced against rights enjoyed by victims under other articles, such as Article 8 right to respect for private and family life. As a Government we wish to place victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. The Code of Practice for Victims of Crime was published in October 2005 and will come into force in April 2006. This statutory code sets out the minimum level of service that victims should receive from the criminal justice system. From April 2006, there will also be a Commissioner for Victims and Witnesses to provide a voice for victims at the heart of government. Additionally, the Victims' Advisory Panel was established in March 2003 and enables victims of crime and those representing independent victims' organisations to comment on current and planned government policy affecting victims of crime, including the criminal justice system.</p>

However, since 1998 three people have been prosecuted for making fraudulent claims against the Ministry of Defence: two in 1998 and one in 2002. These prosecutions were as a result of a large-scale police investigation, Operation SADDLE, in the South Armagh area.</p>

	<p pid="c.166.3/4">The publication <i>Smoking, drinking and drug use among young people in England in 2004</i> (Health and Social Care Information Centre) reports that the prevalence of 11 to 15 year-old smokers was 9 per cent in 2004.</p>

Weighting to compensate for under-reporting was introduced in the 2000 General Household Survey. In order to gauge the effects of weighting the data, estimates for smoking prevalence were re-estimated weighting the 1998 datasets, which led to a slight increase in the overall smoking prevalence of around one percentage point.</p>

	<p pid="c.168.8/1">The prosecution of Denis Donaldson, Ciaran Kearney and William Mackessy was neither initiated nor withdrawn by the Government. In Northern Ireland prosecutions are initiated or continued by the Director of Public Prosecutions where he is satisfied that the evidence which can be presented in court is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute. Prosecution decisions are kept under continuous review.</p>
	<p pid="c.168.8/2">These were serious charges and the prosecution was properly vigorous in pursuing the interests of justice. All proper steps were taken during the course of the criminal process to bring this matter to trial.</p>

	<p pid="c.168.8/4">The duty to weigh the public interest is placed on the prosecutor. It is not an easy consideration and the prosecutor may be required to balance competing interests in reaching a decision. Having weighed only those factors it was proper for him to consider and having regard to his duties under the Human Rights Act, the director concluded that the test for prosecution in respect of the three accused was no longer met as the prosecution was no longer in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="c.168.8/5">It is not open to the director, or me, to make the reasoning for this decision public. To do so would be liable to give rise to the very damage the decision to stop the prosecution was taken to avoid.</p>
	<p pid="c.168.8/6">The director kept the law officers fully informed from the commencement of this case. At all times, the director took proper decisions about this prosecution. Political considerations did not form any part of, or in any way affect, the decision that continuing the prosecution was no longer in the public interest. There were no discussions with Sinn Fein.</p>
