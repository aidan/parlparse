	<p pid="a.57.5/1">The net yield raised by the bank payroll tax is estimated to be &#163;2.3 billion, while gross receipts were &#163;3.45 billion. An explanation of the methodology underlying the estimate of net yield can be found in the previous Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November 2010</phrase> (<I>WA 337</I>). In line with guidance from the Office for National Statistics, the yield from the bank payroll tax was allocated to the 2010-11 tax year, as this is the point at which the tax was passed into legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.5/2">The bank levy, a permanent tax effective from the beginning of this year, ensures that banks make a contribution in respect of the risks they pose to the UK financial system and wider economy. The levy is set at a full rate of 0.05 per cent for 2011, and at a full rate of 0.075 per cent thereafter. The levy is forecast to yield &#163;1.3 billion in 2010-11 and &#163;2.3 billion in 2011-12. Once fully effective the levy is estimated to yield around &#163;2.5 billion of revenues each year.</p>

Therefore the impact on solvency of linking payment of bonuses to levels of lending is difficult to assess, and may not be easy to isolate from other factors affecting solvency.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.0/1">Illegal trapping of songbirds occurs elsewhere in Cyprus and is not confined to the sovereign base areas (SBAs). Combating it is one of the key priorities for the SBA police who have a dedicated team specifically tasked with policing this activity. They conduct daily patrols through the recognised season targeting both known offenders and concentrating on known areas for this activity. Their objective is to prevent this criminal activity by both arresting the perpetrators and disrupting their operations by seizing and removing their equipment. They work in partnership with the Game Fund of the Republic of Cyprus (RoC), the Republic of Cyprus police and non-government organisations, such as Birdlife Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/2">With a view to longer term prevention, the SBA police, in association with the RoC Game Fund and Birdlife Cyprus, also invest significant time on wider educational programmes designed to change attitudes so as to reduce demand for songbirds in restaurants and educate communities about the effects of illegal bird trapping and wildlife trapping in general. The police deliver lectures to local schools and interest groups and distribute thousands of leaflets and banners to local communities, hunting clubs, schools and community councils to reduce the commercial attractiveness and social acceptance of this criminal activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.9/1">As the Government set out in the impact assessment for the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill, we forecast the cost of police and crime commissioners elections to around &#163;50 million in 2012 across England and Wales. Estimates have been done on a national basis and figures are not available for each force area.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.12/1">Persons working regularly with children and young people in either a paid or volunteer capacity are normally required to undertake a criminal records check conducted by the Criminal Records Bureau. It is normally a matter for employers, or organisations using volunteers, to decide when to obtain such checks. A police force organising youth activities would be entitled to obtain checks on volunteers working in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">The methodology used in the report allocates all of public spending, which we do not believe it is appropriate to do. Any analysis of this kind will not present the full picture because the analysis of public service spending has significant analytical limitations. It values services at input costs and does not consider the value the end user places on the service, or how effective those services are. It cannot account for efficiencies and reforms that allow the same service to be delivered for less money. It presents a static picture of spend and cannot factor in changes to people's circumstances over time. And it captures which services and income groups receive money, but not the long term impact of those services on people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/2">It therefore does not fully reflect Spending Review measures that shift the focus of support away from welfare and towards supporting greater social mobility. Indeed, the Women's Budget Group itself welcomes the emphasis that the coalition Government have given in the Spending Review to fairness and social mobility.</p>
