	<p pid="a.185.0/1">Information in relation to Catholic and Protestant unemployment rates is available from the Labour Force Survey. The earliest period held for such figures by religion is 1990 and these are set out in the table below. The table shows the most recent annual data available. The unemployment differential was 1.8 in 1990 and 1.9 in 2002. In respect of males the ratio was 2.0 in 1990 and 1.9 in 2002, comparative figures for females were 1.5 and 1.9.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/2">For both sexes aged 16 to 39 the differential was 1.6 in 1990 and 1.5 in 2002, comparative figures for those aged 40 years and over were 2.3 and 2.7.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/3">The unemployment differential expressed as a ratio describes the relative size of one community's attribute (in this case unemployment) to the other community. By definition, it is a simple reflection of relative positions. It therefore fails to reflect the size of the absolute position. However, used in conjunction with other measures it represents one of a range of labour market indicators.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.2/1">A susbtantial body of research has been conducted on the unemployment rates for Catholics and for Protestants. The research indicates that a range of factors may underpin the difference in unemployment rates (and therefore the unemployment ratio) including characteristics such as age, marital status, number of children, family experience of unemployment, housing tenure and educational qualifications; regional factors such as area of residence, sectoral performance and demographic factors such as labour force growth and migration and the &quot;chill&quot; factor. The role of discrimination in contributing to the differential remains an area of continued debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/2">Recently published views by academics on the ratio suggest that economic inactivity, rather than unemployment should be given greater attention. There is ongoing research in this area commissioned by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister which is due to report in early 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.2/1">The invitation to submit proposals set out the functional requirements for a national wide-area radio system that meets the operational needs of the fire and rescue service and secures interoperability with the other emergency services. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is conducting an open competition under EU procurement procedures. Companies were invited to put forward their own technical solutions to meet those requirements and the contract is still under negotiation. No technology has been ruled out. A more restrictive procurement process would in the Government's view have been less likely to deliver best value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.5/1">The type of weapons refresher training provided on mobilisation is dependent on the reservist's specialisation and whether there is a requirement to carry personal weapons where the reservist is to serve. For example, for Op TELIC those who were mobilised to fill key positions in headquarters in the UK, key enablers who manned ports or airheads in the UK or welfare officers mobilised to support reservists' families in the UK were not required to undertake such training. The carriage of a personal weapon would not have been necessary for the tasks they were to perform.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/2">Due to these factors, ascertaining what proportion of mobilised reservists have undertaken weapons refresher training since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> would involve consulting individual unit and personnel records. This would be a considerable task which could only be undertaken at disproportionate effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/3">Where weapons training is required, the programme of small arms refresher training for mobilised reservists is the same as that provided to regular servicemen before they are deployed on operations. The training consists of weapon handling tests to satisfy weapon safety procedures and corrective individual weapon firing. This training is usually completed as part of a wider pre-deployment training programme the length of which is determined by the role of the reservist and the operation they are to support. Remedial training is provided for those who fail to reach the required standards. All reservists who are required to carry personal weapons receive the appropriate training before deployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/4">Evidence given at the recent court martial of Lance Corporal Blaymire and Lance Corporal Sherratt suggests that, during the mobilisation for earlier deployments to Iraq, a decision was taken at the Army's Reserve Training and Mobilisation Centre (RTMC) that for two elements of the weapons handling tests (loading a magazine and wind tables, neither of which is related to safety) performance at &quot;average&quot; instead of &quot;skilled&quot; would be sufficient for the then operational requirement. While this did not accord strictly with the stated standards required, this decision reflected professional military judgment at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/5">Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-04">4 October 2004</phrase>, RTMC has directed that stated policy be followed. We are identifying those deployed in Iraq who passed the two modules at &quot;average&quot; and will judge the need, if any, for additional in-theatre training, but I should stress that safety has not been compromised and acceptance of the &quot;average&quot; standard was viewed by those who were professionally responsible for training at the time as appropriate. This is borne out by our Operation Telic &quot;Lessons Identified&quot; records, which contain no comments from operational commanders about safety deficiency with regard to personal weapon handling among deployed TA personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.2/1">The main side effects of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) may include: nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. PB acts by temporarily and incompletely blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Thus, any side effects are temporary. The acute effects of organophosphate (OP) pesticides, in sufficient dose, may include giddiness, anxiety, restlessness, headache, confusion, failure to concentrate, respiratory depression, excesive salivation, sweating, miosis, loss of bladder control, bradycardia, hypertension, tachycardia, tremor and paralysis. The severity and magnitude of these effects depends on the particular organosphosphate chemical involved and the route and extent of exposure.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.2/2">Although the precise mechanisms are different, both PB and OP pesticides in sufficiently high dose are inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The effects of combinations of the substances in humans are unknown and are diffficult to study.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.2/3">The Health and Safety Executive guidance note MS17 cautions that OP pesticide-induced symptoms associated with the central nervous system (giddiness, anxiety, retlessness, headache, confusion, failure to concentrate, respiratory depression) may not be easily detected. The primary risk from exposure to OP pesticides used in the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict would have been to environmental health personnel applying the pesticides. The Armed Forces and service medical personnel on deployment would be likely to be more atttuned to symptoms of ill health, and any possible link to handling of pesticides than might be the case in other situations.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">Provision for reinstatement committees is established under the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985, with the relevant regulations governing their operation being the Reinstatement in Civil Employment (Procedure) Regulations 1944 (SI 1944/880). The reinstatement committee system is closely aligned with that in place for the consideration of unfair dismissal claims in employment tribunals, and is administered by the Employment Tribunal Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/2">Reinstatement committees can order that an applicant should be reinstated and/or compensated. Reinstatement means a return to the applicant's old job on no less favourable terms and conditions than would have applied had he not entered service or, if this is not reasonable and practicable, to the most favourable job on the most favourable terms and conditions that are reasonable and practicable. Compensation is for loss suffered and cannot exceed the amount of pay the applicant would have been entitled to receive had the employer discharged his obligations towards him under the Act. Failure to reinstate further to an order renders an employer liable to summary conviction and the payment of further compensation. Such compensation is for loss suffered and cannot exceed the amount of pay the applicant would have been entitled to receive from the employer had the employer discharged his obligations towards him under the order.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/3">The regulations provide that an applicant may be represented at the sitting of the Reinstatement committee by counsel or solicitor, but there is no requirement for individuals to be so represented. The reinstatement committees are designed to be informal, and individuals may represent themselves, as several have successfully done. There is no provision for costs to be awarded against either party under the Act or the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/4">An employment tribunal may order reinstatement or re-engagement and/or the payment of compensation in unfair dismissal claims. Reinstatement in the case of an employment tribunal means a return to the applicant's old job on no less favourable terms and conditions than would have applied had he not been dismissed. Re-engagement means re-employment in employment comparable to that from which he was dismissed or other suitable employment on terms which are, so far as is reasonably practicable, as favourable as an order for reinstatement would confer. Compensation is awarded for the actual financial loss suffered as the result of the unfair dismissal in such amount as the tribunal considers just and equitable in all the circumstances (subject to a statutory maximum of &pound;55,000) and for loss of job security. If a reinstatement or re-engagement order is not complied with, the ultimate remedy is additional compensation which need not be directly related to the employee's loss but may be penal.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.6/1">In accordance with government policy, there is no compulsory testing for HIV or hepatitis B in the UK Armed Forces either at the time of recruiting or during service. It is open to recruits and service personnel to attend civilian or military genito-urinary (GU) clinics without going through their GP, if they choose to do this, and legislation to protect the privacy of patients attending GU clinics prohibits any feedback into the military system. It is therefore not possible to provide comprehensive figures on the number of recruits who have tested positive to HIV or hepatitis B over the last four years. I can however advise that between September 2001 and September 2004, 19 military personnel have been confirmed as having hepatitis B and C or HIV, and of these four were recruits.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.5/1">Since the report concerning the alleged activities of a British businessman with regard to the sale of arms to Sudan came to light, inquiries have been under way to see if there is sufficient information for UK authorities to commence a criminal investigation. For legal reasons, I am unable to comment further on the nature and extent of these inquiries. I am therefore withholding this information under Exemption 4 (b) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. It is worth noting that the report related to alleged negotiations. While such activity might itself be licensable and provided no evidence that any military goods have in fact been supplied.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.5/2">The UK enforces rigorously the EU arms embargo against Sudan. This is done by the scrupulous consideration of export licence applications, the investigation of alleged breaches and through dialogue with other states. Furthermore, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-03">3 March 2004</phrase> the controls on trade to embargoed destinations came into force under the Export Control Act 2002. Since then any person in the UK or any UK person overseas wishing to seek to trade in controlled goods to Sudan would first need to apply for a trade control licence from the UK. These controls have full extraterritorial reach. Seeking to trade in controlled goods to Sudan without first obtaining a licence would constitute an offence and the broker would be liable to prosecution. The Government would only issue licences for supply of or trade in controlled goods to Sudan in line with exemptions to the embargo.</p>

These contacts, designed to ensure that the Government's policy proposals are sound and take full account of all relevant benefits, cost and risks, have involved both Ministers and officials.

Rather they are something which people wish to keep as souvenirs to mark a special occasion. However, the coins are given legal tender status by Royal Proclamation and some shops accept them, although they are not obliged to do so. Thus as there are no plans to issue a &pound;5 coin for general circulation, no consideration has been given to change its current specification.</p>

These attitudes towards leadership in general are not unusual for any organisation undergoing major change. Overall, the majority of DTI staff (65 per cent) recorded in that survey that they were satisfied to be working for the DTI and felt valued for what they could offer the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">The Medical Research Council-funded PACE trial is designed to test treatments for patients who have CFS/ME. Patients with fibromyalgia alone would be excluded unless they also have CFS/ME. The treatments being tested are not primarily psychiatric treatments, with the arguable exception of cognitive behaviour therapy, which is a form of rehabilitative psychotherapy. None of the treatments being tested is likely to cause &quot;a foreseeable deterioration in their medical condition&quot;, and were designed with the opposite effect in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">In common with all clinical trials, all patients recruited to the PACE trial will receive detailed patient information literature and will sign a consent form to confirm that they understand the full details and implications involved in taking part in the trial. Because the trial participants will have provided informed consent, they will receive no compensation if they become more ill (whether or not as a result of the particular treatment). However, they would retain the right to sue for negligent damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">As with any trial, it is accepted that some people may not respond to the treatment(s), or may indeed become iller (whether or not as a consequence of the treatment). If patients do get worse, they will be reassessed earlier than planned in collaboration with their own specialist and general practitioner. A decision will be made by the patient and the doctor as to whether they should stay on their study treatment (or not), and what further help should be given.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">An independent data monitoring and ethics committee will closely monitor progress of the study, including any adverse events that may occur and have the power to advise the independent trial steering committee to change or stop the study if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">The new specialist centres will offer patients a multi-disciplinary based approach to the treatment of their illness. It will be for the clinicians involved to decide what treatment to offer patients referred to them. Their decision will be taken in consultation with the patient, will be informed by the patient's medical history, and will take account of a range of factors, including the ability of the patient to benefit from the treatment proposed.</p>

Based upon the rate of occurrences of side effects in past vaccination programmes, estimates of the numbers of people who might suffer adverse reactions in a mass smallpox vaccination programme of the United Kingdom population indicate that around 7,000 could require VIG for treatment of serious side effects and a further 3,000 could require prophylactic use with the vaccine.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.2/1">The Department of Health has provided funding to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) to update its evidence-based guideline on abortion which was published in 2000. As such, the RCOG has undertaken a thorough literature review of all recently published evidence on abortion. The conclusion remains that abortion, both medical and surgical, is a very safe procedure and complications are uncommon. The updated guideline was published at the end of September 2004 and is available at <a href="http://www.rcog.org.uk">www.rcog.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.2/3">We are unable to provide 30-day and one-year mortality rates following a maternal death. However, between 1991 (the earliest data available) and 2002, six deaths were reported to the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths on young women aged under 16. None of these was after an abortion. Four were from causes unrelated to pregnancy, one from an ectopic pregnancy and one from eclampsia after a concealed pregnancy. Maternal deaths in the United Kingdom for women of all ages are at a rate of 53 per million maternities, compared with five per million abortions.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.8/1">There is a free trade in agricultural products across the European Union and under European legislation it is illegal for one member state to ban the import of agricultural produce from another without good reason. This would not be the case with eggs contaminated with salmonella since they are a raw product and the importer could reasonably expect the eggs to be properly cooked and thus the salmonella destroyed. There is much precedence for unilateral bans on food products being overturned in the courts and one such example is the French ban on UK beef.</p>

Despite evidence of contaminated eggs coming into the UK from Spain, we cannot apply a blanket ban on imports because it would constitute a barrier to internal EU trade that would place the UK in contravention of the European treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.2/1">Defra is working closely with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Health Protection Agency (HPA) to reduce the risk of illness to consumers caused by eating contaminated eggs. The Health Protection Agency has implicated eggs, particularly from Spain, as one of the likely sources of salmonella in outbreaks of food-borne illness. Two courses of action have been taken to reduce the risk of salmonella food poisoning from eggs imported from Spain.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/2">First, it is working with the Spanish authorities to try to reduce the number of contaminated eggs entering the UK to a minimum.

	<p pid="a.223.2/4">Proper heat treatment of any raw foodstuffs contaminated with salmonella should kill it completely thus rendering the product safe to eat. All the current circumstantial evidence suggests that many caterers that are using Spanish eggs are not cooking the eggs properly. The FSA is developing an information campaign targeting those sections of the catering industry where poor hygiene practices seem to be most common.</p>

The Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea does, however, on behalf of the Marine and Coastguard Agency, publish an annual survey of reported discharges attributed to vessels and offshore oil and gas installations operating in the United Kingdom pollution control zone. Annual surveys for 2000 to 2003 contain the following figures for oil pollution incidents affecting beaches which are attributed to these sources. The figures for 2004 are not yet available.

	<p pid="a.228.0/1">The costs and benefits of the directive are currently being reassessed by my department in preparation for transposition. The previous regulatory impact assessment, of 2002, suggested total costs of the directive in the UK across all sectors, including enforcement, of between &pound;18 million and &pound;52 million. This was based on the number of incidents in a given year which would have fallen within the scope of the proposal. Current indications are that the costs for the directive could be lower. It is not possible at this stage to be certain of the effect of the directive on small and medium-sized businesses, but in the light of the likely overall impact, this is expected to be low. Businesses will bear costs under the directive only if they take precautionary measures to reduce their risks of causing significant damage or, where damage does occur from their operation, the cost of remediation measures. This is entirely in accordance with the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle, which is the cornerstone of the directive.</p>
