Section 75(1)(a) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires the Secretary of State to &quot;have due regard to need to promote equality of opportunity between persons of different religious belief, political opinion, racial group, age, marital status or sexual orientation&quot;. In making appointments to the Equality Commission, Section 68(3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires him to &quot;as far as practicable secure that the Commissioners, as a group, are representative of the community in Northern Ireland&quot;. The Secretary of State took both of these duties into account when making appointments to the Equality Commission. It is important to note that this does not compel the Secretary of State to appoint people on the basis of any category to which they may belong.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.6/3">Again in line with the current Armed Forces pension scheme attributable benefits paid to dependants under the new compensation scheme, including those for widows, will be taxable where provided in the form of regular payments. This is because the benefits when paid to the service person are regarded as compensation for injury, but when paid to a dependant are considered as income. The taxable nature of the widow(er)'s guaranteed income stream (WGIS) has been taken into account in setting the level of benefits in the new compensation arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/1">Buildings are listed because they are of special architectural or historic interest. Listed building legislation provides that listed building consent must be obtained before carrying out work to a listed building which will affect its character as a building of architectural or historic interest. This will entitle local authorities to &quot;determine the interior layout of a private dwelling house&quot; only where the layout of the interior is part of the character of a listed building.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/2">This legislation is compatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 8 gives people the right to respect for their private and family life, their home and their correspondence. The Government consider that the restrictions on carrying out works to listed buildings do not interfere with this right to any significant degree and so do not engage Article 8.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/3">If, however, Article 8 is engaged by the listing system, it is justified on the grounds that the system protects our historic buildings, and protects the rights of the general public and of future generations to enjoy the nation's heritage. The system which requires listed building consent before alterations affecting the character of a listed building is proportionate to achieve these aims.</p>

The 10-Year Plan allocates some &pound;18.8 billion for London transport between 2004&ndash;05 and 2010&ndash;11.

	<p pid="a.122.2/2">Many skin cancers, including malignant melanomas, take many years to develop and show clinically, in some cases up to 20 years. Therefore, the current incidence reflected many years ago, and incidence in the immediate years, will be reflected in years to come. The new SunSmart campaign, along with other Department of Health initiatives, aims to reduce unsafe exposure to the sun over the coming years. Examples are the continued funding of the National Radiological Protection Board, which has expertise on ultra-violet radiation issues relevant to the public health aspects of the prevention of skin cancer and also funding of the ultra-violet index in the media (TV, radio, Meteorological Office website). The successful campaign in Australia on which SunSmart is based produced demonstrable health benefits some 20 years after the campaign began.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.5/1">Current European Union food labelling rules do not require pre-packaged foods containing salt to carry health warnings and there are no proposals to introduce such a requirement. Information on sodium (not salt) content is only required when certain nutrition claims are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/2">The Food Standards Agency encourages voluntary provision of salt content information, and is pressing for European Union rules to require compulsory nutrition labelling, including the declaration of salt content, on all pre-packaged foods, in a format that is consumer friendly. This would enable consumers to make informed choices about the foods they buy. The agency is also considering the case for front of pack signposting to help consumers identify healthier options; any such scheme would be likely to take account of fat, sugar and salt content.</p>
