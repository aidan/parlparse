	<p pid="a.171.8/1">All medical discharges from the Armed Forces are considered on a case by case basis. The Armed Forces have always looked for opportunities to retain injured personnel where they can continue to be usefully employed in areas that they find fulfilling and this continues to be the case. Where this is not possible, the driving imperative is to deliver the best appropriate care and information to ensure that injured personnel make the transition to civilian life smoothly.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.8/2">The following table presents the number of UK regular naval service, Army and RAF personnel medically discharged who have been identified as having been deployed to either Afghanistan and/or Iraq, although the reason for discharge is not necessarily due to injury in either of those theatres.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.8/3">Medical boards recommend medical discharges but do not attribute the principal disability leading to the board to service or deployment. A medical board could take place many months or even years after an event or injury and it is not clinically possible in some cases to link an earlier injury to a later problem which may lead to a discharge. Decisions on attributability to service are made by the Service Personnel and Veterans' Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.8/4">The processes for administering a medical discharge differ between the three services and as a consequence the numbers have been presented by service rather than annual tri-service totals.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.8/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the Charity Commission. I have asked the commission to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/2">Letter from Sam Younger, Chief Executive, Charity Commission, to Lord Myners dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-13">13 October 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/3">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Question on whether the Charity Commission is investigating the activities of the Atlantic Bridge and its compliance with charity legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/4">The Atlantic Bridge Education and Research Scheme (&quot;the Charity&quot;) is a registered charity (number 1099513). Last year the Charity Commission, as the independent regulator of charities, received a complaint from a member of the public that the Charity appeared to be a party political organisation and that consequently its objects are not charitable as defined by law. We opened a regulatory compliance case in August 2009 and concluded our substantive investigations in July 2010. Having regard to the principles of best regulatory practice, we decided to publish a Regulatory Case Report on our investigation, and this was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-26">26 July 2010</phrase>. The report remains publicly available on our website (at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk">www.charitycommission.gov.uk</a>), and I will arrange for a copy to be placed in the House of Lords Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/5">For ease of reference, our conclusions as set out in the report were that:</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/6">the Atlantic Bridge Education and Research Scheme is established as a charity with exclusively charitable purposes and is capable of operating for the public benefit;the educational objects of the Charity have not been advanced by its activities because these activities promote a particular point of view which is not uncontroversial, and are consequently not educational. In addition the results and findings of the work of the Charity have not been sufficiently disseminated to the public. The activities of the Charity have not furthered any of its other charitable purposes in any way; andthe activities of the Charity may lead members of the public to call into question its independence from party politics. The promotion of the Special Relationship is not the purpose of this Charity, nor can it be. The Commission has made clear to the trustees their legal and regulatory responsibilities and that the Charity's current activities must cease immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/7">As a result of the Commission's intervention the trustees of the Charity have committed to undertake a review over the next twelve months to include:</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/8">the activities of the Charity to ensure that they are compatible with and capable of furthering its charitable objects-as written in its governing document-for the public benefit;ensuring that decisions to undertake activities are made from the starting point of considering how best to further one or more of the Charity's objects for the public benefit as set out in its trust deed;the content of the Charity's website-in particular how the Charity explains its aims and purpose, whether its content is politically neutral and giving greater clarity between the Charity's website and that of Atlantic Bridge Inc;the maintenance of proper records regarding trustee decision-making; andregular risk assessments in relation to the Charity's activities and records steps taken to mitigate these.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/9">We have requested that the trustees report on the outcome of the review within two months of its completion.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.8/10">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">The Government recognise that there is a challenge in ensuring that the UK has enough skilled workers to maintain and decommission existing nuclear power stations as well as building new ones. Officials work closely with Skills Bodies (including Cogent) and industry to ensure that the skills gap is addressed. Government endorsed the recommendations from the &quot;Next Generation: Skills for New Build Nuclear&quot; report and officials sit on the Nuclear Energy Skills Alliance (along with other key skills stakeholders) that acted as the Steering Group for the report. The department also provides the Secretariat for the Nuclear Energy Skills Alliance which continues to meet on a quarterly basis to ensure that the recommendations are acted on and are updated as we move forwards. The National Skills Academy for Nuclear leads the work of the skills alliance and is playing a critical role in driving up employer investment in skills in the sector, and approving training providers to plug any emerging skills gaps.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">The National Skills Academy for Nuclear is an employer-led organisation and works to ensure that the UK nuclear industry and its supply chain has the skilled, competent and safe workforce it needs to deal with the current and future UK nuclear programme. It has a central position in raising quality standards via both its high quality provider network and the nuclear skills passport system, which is to be rolled out across the nuclear industry later this year. The skills academy has developed a number of skills initiatives including the award for nuclear industry awareness and a foundation degree in engineering (nuclear). They will be shortly be launching the triple bar standard, which is a set of three industry-wide standards to provide people who are embarking on a career in the nuclear sector with a foundation level of understanding of the industry and its specific requirements. At the higher skills level, the skills academy is currently launching a pilot of the certificate of nuclear professionalism which is a postgraduate qualification supporting continued professional development of existing and new members of the UK nuclear industry workforce.</p>

The House of Commons resolved on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-15">15 June</phrase> that the Government should bring forward proposals for a sitting in September, following the recommendation of the Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons that the House should be asked to decide on the issue of September sittings early in the new Parliament. The Government brought forward a Motion to provide for a September sitting, which the House of Commons agreed to on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-15">15 July</phrase>. Expenditure associated with the September sitting of the House of Commons was overseen by the House of Commons Commission, which will have incurred such expenditure on behalf of the House.</p>
