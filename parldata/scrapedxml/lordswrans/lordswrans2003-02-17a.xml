As a consequence some hearings have been deferred and some sentences have been passed without a report, although information is not collected centrally on the number of cases involved. The reasons for the difficulties vary from area to area. Chief officers of probation have been given clear guidance on the prioritisation of reports to court and encouraged to work closely with sentencers locally to agree criteria for the provision of reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.0/1">Anti-money-laundering controls comprise a mixture of legal requirements and regulatory arrangements. The main primary and secondary legislation currently in force are the Drug Trafficking Act 1994, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the Money Laundering Regulations (1993 and 2001). The anti-money laundering regime will be strengthened when Part 7 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 comes into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-24">24 February</phrase>. This Act will require employees in the regulated financial sector to report transactions where they know, suspect or have reasonable grounds to know or suspect that a person is engaged in money laundering.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/2">In addition, the Terrorism Act 2000 provides that it is an offence for a person who in the course of a trade, profession, business or employment believes or suspects that a person has committed a terrorist fund-raising offence and does not disclose it to a constable. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 strengthened this provision so that it made it an offence for a regulated financial institution not to report a transaction where an employee &quot;had reasonable grounds to suspect&quot; it was the proceeds of, or intended for use in, a terrorist crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/3">None of this legislation discriminates between countries or individuals on religious, ethnic or cultural grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/4">The only countries which are treated any differently in the above arrangements are the 15 identified by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (the international standard setting organisation) as failing to comply with the international fight against money laundering. Financial institutions have a duty to pay attention to the list of these countries when considering whether a transaction is suspicious. The countries in question are: Burma, the Cook Islands, Egypt, Grenada, Guatemala, Indonesia, Nauru, Nigeria, Philippines, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/5">Under the Proceeds of Crime Act, constables, customs officers and financial investigators accredited under the Act will also be able to apply for court orders to obtain information on bank accounts and to monitor transaction details. Such powers are already in place in respect of terrorist funding. Police and Customs officers may also use powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to obtain financial information in their investigation of acquisitive offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.3/1">Rape is an extremely serious offence, and it is right that the police should be prepared to investigate any complaint made to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.3/2">The Home Office has conducted limited research into the reasons that rape allegations were withdrawn (Home Office Research Study 196), but this study did not attempt to quantify the impact of cases where it was felt that the allegations were false.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.3/3">There is a clear difficulty in obtaining information about false allegations because of the need to make a subjective judgment about whether or not complaints that are withdrawn or found to be ungrounded are also false. There may be clear evidence in certain instances that false allegations were made, but this is likely to apply in a minority of cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.3/4">There is a range of offences to deal with those who might seek to pursue false allegations, including the offences of perverting the course of justice, wasting police time and perjury.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.2/1">The Sexual Offences Bill follows a major review of the criminal law on sexual offences, which looked at a wide range of the very numerous authorities on sex offences and sex offenders, as listed in Annex K of volume 2 of Setting the Boundaries. The review process involved consideration of a significant number of reports and research studies and included a comparison with the laws of a number of other countries, including Australia and New Zealand. Carol Sarler's work was not considered as part of the review process, but we are satisfied that the review was comprehensive and thorough and the question of whether there should be a separate offence of date rape is one that was considered in detail and properly rejected by the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/2">We believe that the offence of rape cannot be divided into more or less serious offences. It can be just as traumatic to be raped by someone you know, especially in view of the breach of trust that is involved, as to be raped by a stranger who sexually assaults the first man or woman who passes by. The crime of rape is so serious that it needs to be considered in its totality rather than being constrained by any relationship between the parties. The issue of severity of the offence should be left to the judges on sentencing, rather than attempting to deal with it by creating a separate offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/3">This view is supported by the Sentencing Advisory Panel in its recently published guidelines on sentencing in cases of rape.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.3/1">The proposals announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-22">22 January</phrase> form a complex package of measures. A significant part of the package is the proposal to decouple the majority of the subsidy payments from production and to create a &quot;single farm payment&quot;. This decoupling will permit farm businesses to restructure in order to achieve business profitability exclusive of the new income payment. In addition, the proposals allow for the recycling of a share of the modulated funds to producers for rural development.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.3/2">The specific nature of farm business restructuring as a result of decoupling will depend on producers' preferences and their responses to market signals. Furthermore the modulation rates of 12.5 and 19 per cent will not be reached until 2012, around a decade hence. For these reasons it is not feasible to give reliable estimates of the effect on farm profits.</p>

The first phase of this new surveillance system, on methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus blood stream infections, was introduced in April 2001. All acute trusts now collect this information and it is the first time that baseline data have been available. The results for the first year of this scheme (April 2001 to March 2002) for every National Health Service acute trust in England were published in the Communicable Disease Report (CDR) Weekly on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-20">20 June 2002</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.157.2/1">Regardless of the condition someone has, the National Health Service makes payments to care homes as a contribution for the registered nursing care that they provide to eligible residents. The NHS either provides itself or pays others to provide them on its behalf. Many providers have adjusted the fee payable by the resident to take account of the additional state funding. A model contract, issued by the Department of Health in March 2002, requires that these be accounted for separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/2">Following a separate consultation in June 2002 on amending the Care Homes Regulations, a revised draft was included as part of a wider consultation on NHS funded nursing care on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-20">20 December 2002</phrase>, the closing date for which was <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>. The comments on this are being considered at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/3">The findings of the National Care Standards Commission's monitoring of National Minimum Standard 2 since April 2002, which requires care homes to provide service users with a contract and statement of terms and conditions, will be available at the end of this financial year. The commission will, of course, be responsible for monitoring service providers' compliance with any amendments to the Care Home Regulations.</p>
