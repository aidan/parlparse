	<p pid="a.2.3/1">The issue of bail is for the courts to decide following clearly set out procedures. The statutory structure is provided primarily by the Bail Act 1976 which creates a presumption to bail for all defendants involved in criminal proceedings. The Government believe that bail should be withheld in all appropriate cases, but are equally concerned that no one is remanded in custody unless the circumstances demand it.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/2">The Criminal Justice Bill creates a presumption that an adult defendant who is charged with an imprisonable offence will not be granted bail in certain circumstances. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/3" class="indent">i. where he has failed without reasonable excuse to surrender to custody in answer to bail for that offence, or</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/4" class="indent">ii. where the offence appears to have been committed while the defendant was already on bail, or</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/5" class="indent">iii. where (having tested for a specified class A drug) he refuses to undergo an assessment as to his dependency or propensity to misuse such drugs, or, following an assessment, refused any relevant follow-up action recommended, or</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/6" class="indent">iv. unless the court is satisfied that there is no significant risk that if released he would fail to surrender, or (as the case may be) commit an offence. The Government consider that any increase in remands in custody as a result of these provisions will be justified in order to improve the effectiveness of the criminal justice system and to protect the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/7">For young offenders we are working at reducing the number of unnecessary secure remands. We have introduced bail supervision and support schemes, made the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme for juveniles on bail and brought in electronic tagging of 12 to 16 year-olds who may be granted court bail or remanded to local authority accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">The Government are firmly committed to maintaining effective immigration controls while at the same time ensuring that genuine passengers are able to pass through our ports with the least possible incovenience.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">The number of people arriving at UK airports who are found to be inadmissible is unacceptably high. Certain nationals, who are required to hold a valid visa to enter the UK, may transit this country for up to 24 hours without a visa. This provides a relatively easy and inexpensive way for those who are intent on circumventing our immigration controls to do so. We have identified nationals of 16 countries&mdash;Albania, Belarus, Burma, Burundi, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Liberia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Nepal, the Palestinian Territories, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Vietnam&mdash;as posing a particular problem in this respect. Therefore from 00.01 hours on <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 24 June</phrase> all nationals of those 16 countries/territories wishing to transit the UK will require a visa to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/3">To avoid undue hardship for those who had already made their travel plans, we have agreed to operate a grace period. Until 23.59 hours on <phrase class="date" code="">28 June</phrase> any transit passenger who bought their ticket on or before <phrase class="date" code="">23 June</phrase> will not be refused entry solely on the basis of not holding a valid transit visa. Also, any person on the return leg of a journey they commenced before <phrase class="date" code="">23 June</phrase> and who passed through the UK on the outward leg of their journey will be allowed to transit the UK without the visa.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">Where failure to pay service charges is concerned, regardless of the amount, forefeiture cannot take place until the amount of service charge is agreed or admitted by the tenant, or has been the subject of a determination by a court, leasehold valuation tribunal or arbitral tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/2">In practice forfeiture rarely occurs. Through the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is strengthening the existing legislative powers so that leaseholders will have to receive written demands for ground rent, service charges and administration charges from the landlord before exorbitant amounts can accrue and forfeiture proceedings commence. It is also intended that service and administration charges will remain outstanding for three years and be over the prescribed sum of &pound;350 before the landlord is allowed to serve a Section 146 notice and thus commence forfeiture proceedings.</p>
