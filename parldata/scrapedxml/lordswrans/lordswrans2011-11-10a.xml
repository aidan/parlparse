	<p pid="a.75.2/1">The increase in Afghanistan's Human Development Index rating over the past decade reflects the significant progress the Government of Afghanistan, helped by the international community including the UK, have made in delivering a better quality of life for the Afghan people. 5.7 million children are now regularly attending school. 37 per cent of them are girls, up from virtually none under the Taliban. 85 per cent of the population now has access to basic healthcare services compared with 9 per cent in 2002. The economy has grown by an average of 8 per cent a year since 2002. However, the UK Government recognise that this progress comes from a very low base, and there is still some way to go-Afghanistan is ranked 172 out of 187 countries. The Department for International Development is committed to providing long-term support for the Afghan people to promote peace and security, stimulate the economy, and help the state deliver basic services.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.9/1">The Government are of the view that a suitably drafted European directive in this area could deliver significant benefits. Appropriate standards could assist UK nationals who become subject to the criminal justice systems of other member states. Such a directive could also build greater trust and confidence among the competent authorities of all EU member states who may be expected to accept and act upon decisions or judgments made in other member states. However, a number of provisions in the proposal, as published by the European Commission, go beyond the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights and would have an adverse impact on the ability of the police and prosecution services to investigate and prosecute offences effectively and fairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.9/2">As drafted, the Commission's proposal would give suspects the right to have a lawyer present before even immediate questions which have an impact on the reliability of evidence could be asked. It would also potentially require the presence of a lawyer at a police search of a property or when fingerprints are taken. The proposal would unacceptably fetter the ability of judges to make decisions on the admissibility of evidence. Furthermore, the Commission's proposal provides that a suspect or accused person must have the right to meet their lawyer face to face in all circumstances. In the United Kingdom, telephone access to a lawyer is provided in some circumstances. This offers speedier access to legal advice in most cases, which is often the suspect's priority, and provides value for money to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.9/3">Given the extent of the concerns on the detail of this directive, the Government cannot at this stage be confident that all of them will be addressed in the process of negotiations. However, we intend to work closely with our European partners to improve the directive sufficiently to enable the Government to consider opting in once the instrument has been adopted. The Government will consult Parliament about any such decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.2/1">Cautions, reprimands and warnings, together with convictions, are entered onto the police national computer (PNC) and it is this set of information on the PNC that we would normally construe as an individual's criminal record. All these disposals involve the establishment or formal admission of guilt. Recordable offences, in relation to which these disposals should always go onto the PNC, are defined as those offences which are imprisonable, plus a number of non-imprisonable offences which have been made recordable by regulations. Disposals for non-recordable offences are normally kept as part of local police records.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/2">Penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) may be recorded on the PNC, but do not involve an admission of guilt. Cannabis warnings form part of local police records. Community resolutions are informal responses to low-level crime and anti-social behaviour. None of these forms part of an individual's criminal record.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">The British Government are very grateful for the important contribution that Irish soldiers made in the Second World War. The Government have no plans to make representations at the present time in respect of the pardoning of former Irish soldiers who were court-martialled because they fought on the side of the allies. This is a matter for the Irish Government and one which is actively being considered by them. The details and sensitivities of the case are well known and the British Government will continue to monitor developments.</p>

Other factors, including some United Nations resolutions, may also be relevant.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.2/1">We remain very concerned by the situation in Southern Kordofan, Abyei and Blue Nile. We continue to work closely with international partners to seek peaceful resolutions to the conflicts in all those regions and to achieve humanitarian access for those affected. As an International Criminal Court (ICC) indictee, the Governor of Southern Kordofan, Ahmed Haroun, is already unable to travel to any ICC member countries without risk of arrest. We judge that further targeted travel sanctions would not help at this stage in achieving our objectives, but will keep this under review in consultation with European Union and United Nations partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-17">Monday 17 October 2011</phrase>, two men stole a solid bronze statue from the grounds of the Royal British Legion, Pennings Road, Tidworth. The statue is a one-off commissioned sculpture valued at &#163;10,000. Subsequent police inquiries have led to a 22 year-old man of no fixed abode being arrested on suspicion of theft. He has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. The statue has not yet been found, but Wiltshire Police continue to work with the Metropolitan Police Art and Antiques Unit to trace the item. This case is subject to a continuing police investigation.</p>
