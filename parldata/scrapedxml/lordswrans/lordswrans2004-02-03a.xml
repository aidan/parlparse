	<p pid="a.91.5/2">The timing of any action to redesignate smoking rooms and the wider promotion of smoke-free public places are not interdependent. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety launched a five-year tobacco action plan in July 2003. It was prepared by an inter-sectoral working group and includes a series of actions designed to promote the provision of smoke-free policies. An implementation group, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, has been established to take forward the agreed actions. A copy of the plan has been placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">The Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland departments and the Police Service of Northern Ireland are taking a range of actions. These include measures aimed at curbing and mitigating the impact of racist incidents through education, housing, health and social policy, as well as through law enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">For example, the Community Safety Strategy, being implemented through the Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office, identified Key Issue 6: Offences Motivated by Prejudice and Hatred as a central theme in making Northern Ireland a safer place for all its citizens. Specifically, it seeks to reduce the levels of crime motivated by sectarianism, and to promote and enhance the safety of minority ethnic residents. Currently, it is facilitating a working group of relevant Northern Ireland departments, voluntary and statutory organisations which aims to establish a clear framework for the recording and monitoring of racial incidents. It is hoped to bring forward such an agreed framework by the spring 2004. Also, within its community safety grant programme, the Challenge Competition, it has provided funding towards four projects which have a central theme of countering prejudice and hatred, at a total value of &pound;273,255.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">In addition to these initiatives, the Government will publish shortly for consultation, draft proposed legislation for Northern Ireland aimed at tackling racially motivated offences. The proposed draft order will require sentencers, where offences are aggravated by such hostility, to treat racial and religious hostility as an aggravating factor when sentencing. (The legislation will also cover offences motivated by hatred of sexual orientation.) The proposal will also increase maximum sentences available for certain specified, mainly violent, offences including where hostility based on racial, religious or sexual aggravation is proven.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">Direct comparisons of the prevalence of racist attacks across different jurisdictions can be difficult to make, but it would appear that racist attacks are more prevalent in Northern Ireland. Any attacks are unacceptable. The Government are committed to creating a safer and more tolerant Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/19">(2) The Prison Service in England and Wales employs the term &quot;self-inflicted death&quot; rather than &quot;suicide&quot;. This includes all those deaths where it appears the person may have acted specifically to take his/her own life.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/20">(3) There is no definition of what constitutes &quot;attempted suicide&quot;, therefore data recording incidents of &quot;attempted suicide&quot; are effectively subsumed within those for self-harm, which covers all acts of self-injury, however serious. The figures provided are number of incidents of self-harm, not number of individuals. Data on self-harm were not available in this format before 1998.</p>

In December 2002 new procedures for reporting self-injury were introduced in prisons in England and Wales, therefore much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from the change in reporting procedures rather than reflect an actual increase in incidence of self-harm</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/24">Reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths and instances of self-harm in prison establishments is a priority for Ministers and for the Prison Services of both England and Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/25">A proactive three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons in England and Wales began in April 2001. The programme has included the training and appointment of suicide prevention co-ordinators in the majority of prisons, the increased provision of prisoner peer support through schemes such as &quot;Insiders&quot; and Samaritan-led &quot;Listeners&quot;, an investment of &pound;21 million in six &quot;Safer Local&quot; prisons (Feltham, Leeds, Wandsworth, Winchester, Eastwood Park and Birmingham), and projects to develop safer prison design, including safer cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/26">Over recent months a wide-ranging review of this programme has taken place in consultation with partner agencies such as the Youth Justice Board and outside organisations such as Samaritans and the Howard League, taking into account the evaluations of pilot projects and emerging research findings. This review will inform future suicide prevention strategy beyond April 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/27">A number of intervention strategies have also been introduced into establishments for people who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice, and guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been circulated to establishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/28">In Northern Ireland, a review of policy and practices for dealing with prisoners at risk has recently been completed. This takes a holistic approach to providing the necessary support and care to prevent the individual harming him or herself. It includes an initial assessment on reception to prison, Samaritan services, Listener schemes, an anti-bullying policy and improved structures, systems and procedures.

The last meeting of the review steering group considered proposals for change to the council tax banding arrangements including the option of bands being set regionally. The papers considered by the review are available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website. The review is due to report in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">The reforms of the planning system seek to address the issues of access and inclusion throughout the entire planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/2">Clause 38 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill puts a duty on those responsible for preparing development plans to address the issue of sustainable development. This will be defined in planning policy statement 1 (PPS1), which will make it crystal clear that development plans should contain clear and comprehensive inclusive access policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/3">Local authorities must seek to involve the whole community in the preparation, alteration and review of all local development documents and significant development control decisions. PPGs 11 and 12 also make clear the importance of access to documents and processes. This includes not only the accessibility of material in terms of clarity, but also in terms of different formats, and&mdash;in the case of examinations-in-public&mdash;in terms of access both by public transport and to the venue itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/4">The draft regulations to be made under Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill make clear that, among others, regional planning bodies and local planning authorities will be required to consult formally with bodies representing disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/5">The Bill also contains measures to enable planning aid to become more proactive and develop a greater role in targeting communities which traditionally do not get involved in the planning system&mdash;including disabled people and disability groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/6">Clause 42 of the Bill introduces new powers to introduce a standard application form. Depending on the views of stakeholders we would expect that a document which demonstrates how the project will meet certain provisions of legislation and related codes of practice to ensure that the needs of the disabled are addressed could be required to accompany the form in appropriate cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/7">Those applying for planning permission would therefore be required to demonstrate how their proposals contribute to an inclusive environment, and local planning authorities would have to consider this alongside other requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/8">The current review of the operation of outline planning permission will address the provision of additional information, and while this would need to cover the key design principles, it would also be expected to address access issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/9">Outside the Bill the programme of culture change is examining issues such as the diversity of the planning profession, and the issues addressed in education and training.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.2/10">In 2003, 32 of the top FTSE 100 companies had no female directors, there were seven finance directors and 39 female directorships were held by non UK citizens. In 2003, the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry commissioned Derek Higgs to report on how the quality, independence, and effectiveness of non-executive directors might be strengthened. Following the recommendations of this review the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry asked Dean Tyson from the London Business School to examine how companies might recruit directors from more diverse backgrounds in order to improve board effectiveness. Both these reports made a number of proposals which boards must consider how to apply in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/11">The Tyson report also made recommendations about director training and the measurement of board diversity. These are being pursued by government and business organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/12">In addition, since November, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Jacqui Smith, Minister for Industry and the Regions and Deputy Minister for Women and Equality have, in partnership with several leading companies, been holding roundtables with chairs, chief executives and senior figures from business to raise awareness about the business case for greater diversity on UK boards and to gather examples of good practice already in place. Our aim is to disseminate these best practice examples widely when the roundtable programme is finalised.</p>
