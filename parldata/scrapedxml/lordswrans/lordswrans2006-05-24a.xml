	<p pid="a.105.2/1">The badger benefits from legal protection introduced to outlaw cruelty towards animals; for example, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which among other things made the baiting of animals illegal, and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996, which made certain specified acts of cruelty illegal.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/2">In addition, there are legal restrictions on the range of methods that can be used to kill or take badgers. This protection was introduced to outlaw inhumane and/or indiscriminate methods of control. The key legislation in this respect is the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Some of these restrictions apply to all animals, while others apply only to animals, such as the badger, listed in Schedule 6 to the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/3">There have also been specific laws to protect badgers. These were introduced as a welfare measure to combat illegal badger baiting and also as a conservation measure in response to declines in badger numbers in the 1970s and 1980s. Badgers and their setts are fully protected under the provisions of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, which consolidated previous statutes. However, the 1992 Act does provide for the department to issue licences to interfere with badgers or their setts to prevent, among other things, serious damage to land, crops or property.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/4">Although this protection may be unique for a non-endangered animal, it reflects the concern the Government have about the gratuitous acts of cruelty that badgers have been subjected to in the past.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.0/1">The Blue Badge Scheme of parking concessions for disabled people has never applied to the Cities of London and Westminster, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and part of the London Borough of Camden due to concerns about the particularly severe problems with traffic flow and pressure on parking space in these parts of London. This exemption, however, came under scrutiny during the most recent review of the scheme and the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC, the department's statutory advisers on the transport needs of disabled people) recommended that it be removed. Consequently, research is being undertaken to look at the grounds for the exemption to see if it can still be justified. The research is due to be completed later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">Information on the number of taxpayers by number of employments is not readily available except at a disproportionate cost. However, the table below provides the number of employees (by number of jobs) whose total gross weekly earnings exceeded their weekly personal allowance in autumn 2005.</p>
	<table>
		<caption>Autumn (September-November) 2005</caption>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.112.2/5"> <td>Employees whose total weekly earnings is above<br/>    their weekly personal allowance</td> <td>Number (thousands)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.112.2/6"> <td>Employees with one job</td> <td>21,830</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.112.2/7"> <td>Employees with more than one job</td> <td>580</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.112.2/10">Income tax liabilities are based on total annual income. Therefore these figures should be used as a guide only since all employees with gross weekly earnings above their weekly personal allowance at a given point in time are not necessarily taxpayers for the year as a whole, and similarly, all employees with gross weekly earnings below their weekly personal allowance at a given point in time are not necessarily non-taxpayers for the year as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/11">The estimates have been provided by the Office for National Statistics and are based on the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS). The figures represent a snapshot, are seasonal unadjusted and are based on gross weekly earnings as reported in the survey.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.0/1">Estimates of the cost of reduced national insurance contributions for the self employed&mdash;not attributable to their reduced benefit eligibility&mdash;were published in April and were &pound;1.7 billion for 2004-05 and &pound;1.9 billion for 2005&ndash;06. These figures are shown in the table at the following link at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/taxexpenditures/1-5-apr06.xls">www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/taxexpenditures/1&ndash;5&ndash;apr06.xls</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2">These estimates are particularly uncertain due to their complex nature and so the following further estimates that are underpinned by them should be treated with caution.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/3">In order to make self employed national insurance contributions (class 2 and class 4 contributions) the same as class 1 national insurance contributions paid by employees and employers after reflecting reduced benefit eligibility, taking the above figure and simply varying existing NIC rates, the main class 4 rate would need to be increased by 6.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/4">In order to maintain revenue neutrality while matching contribution rates of the self employed to those paid in respect of employees after reflecting reduced benefit eligibility (again taking the above figure and simply varying existing NIC rates) the main employee's (primary) class 1 contribution rate would need to lowered by 0.3 per cent. and the main class 4 contribution rate raised by 3.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/5">These figures are for UK contributions in respect of 2005-06 and are consistent with Budget 2006 projections.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/6">These estimates exclude any behavioural response to the changes, which could be significant given the magnitude of the change.</p>

They may offer cross-boundary concessionary bus travel to older people and disabled people, or some other form of enhancement to the statutory free off-peak local bus travel scheme, at their discretion. To determine the range of schemes provided, the department carries out occasional surveys of local authority concessionary travel provision. The most recent survey reported in 2003. The department will also carry out a new, comprehensive survey of local authority schemes later this year. The results are due to be published in the autumn.</p>
