	<p pid="c.43.2/1">In the context of Section 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981, to which I assume the Question relates, we make no distinction between whether the &quot;action or inaction&quot; causing the loss of the other citizenship was that of the applicant or of some other person acting on his behalf. The legislation does not appear to us to direct the Secretary of State to make any such distinction. Depending on the particular circumstances of the case, a different approach might be required in cases under Section 1 of the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997, where the applicant's having given up &quot;of his own volition&quot; another nationality or citizenship on or after the relevant date would serve to disqualify him from registration under that Act.</p>

	<p pid="c.48.3/1">All major private finance initiative (PFI) schemes in procurement are subject to a revalidation exercise we announced in January. Revalidation will involve comparing the schemes against a number of tests, to ensure that they properly take account of the new financial mechanisms operating in the National Health Service (such as choice or payment by results), and are properly taking account of activity of the shift away from the acute sector envisaged in the recent White Paper <i>Our health, our care, our say</i>.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.3/2">The first three schemes reviewed were Barts and London, Birmingham and St Helens and St Knowsley, a total capital investment of almost &pound;2 billion. All proved generally compliant and recently got the go-ahead to sign contracts, subject to some small reductions in scope.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.3/3">Following the review of its proposed &pound;167 million PFI scheme, the board at Essex Rivers NHS Trust announced on <phrase class="date" code="">14 June</phrase> that it is withdrawing from the project. The trust decided that plans for a new treatment and primary care centre, as well as those for a new Harwich Hospital, meant that the project was no longer affordable and did not offer the best way to improve services for local NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.3/4">Prior to the revalidation exercise the value of the future PFI programme was &pound;12 billion. We are now forecasting an overall reduced post-review value of between &pound;7 billion and &pound;9 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.3/5">The announcement of further decisions following the PFI reviews will be in two waves. It is anticipated that the announcement for schemes which are most advanced&mdash;generally, those that have already appointed their preferred bidder&mdash;will be in late July. The remainder will be announced later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.49.0/1">The Department for Transport does not have statistics detailing its rail travel destinations prior to financial year 2005&ndash;06, and the figures for that year do not distinguish between Paris and Brussels. In 2005&ndash;06 the department recorded 105 journeys by air (84 to Brussels, and 21 to Paris), and 1,945 journeys by rail. This gives a proportion of 5.1 per cent air travel, and 94.9 per cent rail travel.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.0/2">None of the department's agencies record travel destination data, except the Government Car Despatch Agency, which reports three journeys to Brussels in the past three years, all undertaken by rail. Further information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.49.3/1">A number of forces have their own data warehouses that support their local requirements, and there are some examples of forces that are able to share information stored in their warehouses. There are also a number of national systems covering specific business areas or needs such as the police national computer and the violent and sex offenders register. However, there is no capability that enables consistent access to information in a common format across other business areas and covering all forces in England and Wales. The cross-regional information sharing project will deliver such a capability.</p>

	<p pid="c.49.6/1">Parole Board decisions on whether or not to award parole focus on the risk to the public of an offence being committed at a time when the offender would otherwise be in prison. In assessing whether the safety of the public will be placed unacceptably at risk, the board is directed to take into account that the risk of violent or sexual offending is more serious than a risk of other types of offending. This must be balanced against the benefit, both to the public and the offender, of early release back into the community under a degree of supervision which might help rehabilitation and so lessen the risk of reoffending in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.6/2">In assessing suitability for release on parole, the Parole Board considers many factors including the nature and circumstances of the offence of which the offender was convicted, any previous convictions, the offender's attitude and response in prison, what, if any, offence-related work has been completed, reports from the Prison and Probation Service and any representations from the offender himself.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.6/3">On the strength of the available information it makes a judgment on the likely benefit both to the offender and society in allowing the offender to serve part of the sentence in the community. There is no requirement for an offender to admit guilt prior to making an application for parole, nor is denial of guilt a bar to release on parole licence. Whether an offender denies the offence or not, the Parole Board must always satisfy itself from the evidence available that the risk of reoffending is sufficiently reduced so as not to jeopardise the safety of the public before it directs early release on parole.</p>

	<p pid="c.50.2/1">No assessments are being made by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The Lyons inquiry is considering a wide range of issues about local government's role and funding, including the potential for local taxes and charges, and I am aware that a number of tourism industry bodies, at national, regional and local level, have made submissions to Sir Michael Lyons on the potential impact of an accommodation tax. The Government will not take any decisions on changes to local government finance, until they have had the chance to consider and reflect on Sir Michael's report and recommendations. We will fully assess the potential impact of Sir Michael's recommendations once he has made them, as is appropriate in the case of an independent review, and respond accordingly. Sir Michael's final report is scheduled for the end of 2006.</p>
