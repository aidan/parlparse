	<p pid="a.178.2/4">The General Register Office (GRO), part of Office for National Statistics (ONS) is presently leading the project development stage of the Citizen Information Project (CIP). The intention is to explore the possibility of developing a high-quality central population register which would hold core contact details for members of the public and which could be accessed by other government departments who currently maintain their own separate databases. Access would be subject to rigorous conditions of confidentiality and data protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.2/5">Our research so far has indicated that the following central government departments and agencies currently maintain large-scale databases containing details about individual citizens:</p>

	<p pid="a.178.2/7" class="indent">UK Passport Service</p>

	<p pid="a.178.2/14">Research so far has not been exhaustive and has focused on the government bodies that maintain large-scale citizen databases. There are likely to be many other government organisations that maintain databases of citizen information, although many of these databases will be smaller and will relate to more specialised government services. Some organisations may hold more than one database. It is anticipated that more information about the scale and scope of other government databases will emerge during the development stage of the CIP. However, a comprehensive list of all databases of citizen information in government is not available and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

The costs of bidding to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London in 2012 will be met by DCMS from exchequer funds, by the London Development Agency, and through financial support or value in kind from commercial or other organisations. In the event of a successful bid, the lottery contribution to the costs of staging the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012 will be up to &pound;1.5 billion. This will consist of &pound;750 million from new Olympic lottery games, &pound;340 million from sport lottery distributors, and up to &pound;410 million, if required, from changing percentage shares after 2009. New Olympic lottery games would not begin until after a decision has been taken in July 2005 on who will host the Olympics, and then only in the event of London being awarded the games.</p>
