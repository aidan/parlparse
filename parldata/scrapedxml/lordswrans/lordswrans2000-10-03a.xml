	<p pid="a.207.2/1">Under the rules of procedure for boards of inquiry, the higher authority is responsible for convening the inquiry and reviewing its findings. In the case of the Chinook accident on the Mull of Kintyre, the Convening Officer and his Air Officer Commanding in Chief (the reviewing officers) reluctantly concluded that the pilots had continued to fly their aircraft towards the Mull below safety altitude in unsuitable weather and in direct contravention of both visual and instrument flight rules. In allowing their aircraft to do this, the pilots had not exercised the skill, care or judgment they were known to possess. Consequently, the conclusion was that the pilots were grossly negligent.</p>

This figure excludes the cost of engines, which were provided by the Ministry of Defence from existing stock holdings.

	<p pid="a.209.5/2">The Government are committed to a wide-ranging strategy aimed at finding a science-based solution to TB in cattle. The badger culling trial is an important element of that strategy, designed to establish what role, if any, badgers play in the spread of TB in cattle; and whether localised culling of badgers helps to reduce TB in cattle herds. The trial is subject to strict welfare safeguards, including independent audit, and will not endanger badger populations. The ISG expect results to be available by the end of 2004, possibly earlier depending on the strength of any association between TB in cattle and badgers.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.0/1">The Rockall fisheries zone (RFZ) was relinquished in 1997 when the UK acceded to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Article 121(3) of UNCLOS prevents &quot;rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own&quot; being used to generate exclusive economic zones. Maintenance of the RFZ would not therefore have been compatible with UNCLOS and so would have been open to legal challenge.</p>

We were supported by a number of other member states, The European Commission has undertaken to pursue the necessary action in NEAFC.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.3/1">The prices of branded medicines are controlled indirectly by the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS), which limits the profits which companies can make from the sale of these products to the National Health Service. Within this ceiling on overall profits, companies have freedom of pricing with a high price on one product being balanced by a lower price on others. A new scheme was introduced in October 1999 under which the prices of medicines covered by the PPRS were reduced by 4.5 per cent. overall, representing savings to the NHS of around &pound;200 million per year. The new scheme incorporates an inquiry into the extent of competition in the supply of branded medicines to the NHS, which will inform the mid-term review of the PPRS, which will be undertaken after April 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.3/2">Pharmaceutical companies often concentrate their research in particular therapeutic areas in which there may well be few suppliers. New products benefit from intellectual property protection which rewards and encourages research. In this particular area there has been a tendency for products to be launched at a common European price. Although their relative prices in different countries may be affected by currency fluctuations and controls of the kind exercised by the PPRS, they are at a similar level in other European countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.8/1">The Government recognises that the security situation of ethnic minorities such as Roma, Ashkalia and Serbs in Kosovo remains precarious. All asylum applications are considered on their individual merits and returns would not be enforced or encouraged unless it was considered safe to do so. This approach is consistent with United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) advice and is followed by most other European governments. Information about the situation for these groups in Kosovo is widely available from a range of sources, but clear advice would be given to any individuals applying for the Home Office voluntary returns programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.8/2">Returns to Kosovo from this country will be on a phased and managed basis and we encourage other host countries to adopt a similar approach. Every assistance has been provided to those people who wish to return to Kosovo permanently, in the form of two voluntary assisted return programmes. If necessary, we enforce the return of those who, following any appeal, are judged to have no humanitarian or protection reasons for needing to remain longer in the United Kingdom. Such returns will take account of all the circumstances at the time, including the weather conditions in Kosovo. Arrangements have been set up to inform the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in advance of Kosovans being forcibly returned to Kosovo.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.2/1">I should emphasise that Roma within the United Kingdom already receive the protection that current legislation provides. The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it unlawful for anyone to discriminate against another on racial grounds. A Bill currently before Parliament will amend the 1976 Act by extending it to the functions of public authorities not currently covered by the Act, including the police service, and will put a statutory duty on public authorities to promote racial equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/2">It is also an offence to incite racial hatred against the Roma community by virtue of Part III of the Public Order Act 1986. And racist violence and harassment towards members of the Roma community falls under the new racially aggravated offences in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/3">The Government are investing &pound;14 million each year through the Standards Fund to promote the access, regular attendance and higher levels of achievement of Roma pupils. And legal requirements have been placed on schools with regard to the admission procedures for Roma children. There has also been investment in the production of books and learning materials which portray the Roma as a positive and rich culture that has a legitimate place in United Kingdom and European society. Intensive programmes of in-service training for teachers are provided by the Traveller Education Services, which most Local Education Authorities have had in place for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/4">The Government also announced that they would be making available over the next three years &pound;17 million to help local authorities to improve and refurbish a limited number of existing Gypsy and Traveller sites. Details of the scheme will be published later this Autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/5">The United Nations and Council of Europe have become increasingly concerned at the problem of discrimination against the Roma community in Central and Eastern Europe. We are committed to ensuring that this issue is properly addressed at the World Conference on Racism in South Africa next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/6">There is also a substantial programme of work run by the Council of Europe to address this problem, which the United Kingdom Government has actively supported. We have provided funding for projects in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Department for International Development is involved in a number of programmes aimed at encouraging central and local governments to address the needs of Roma communities, and the Home Office is in the process of arranging a major programme of race awareness training for police in the Czech Republic.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.2/1">The Home Detention Curfew (HDC) scheme was introduced on January 28 1999. Prisoners serving sentences of more than three months, and less than four years, are eligible to apply for HDC.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/2">In order to be released under the HDC scheme, the prisoner must have a suitable address to return to and in which the electronic monitoring device can be installed. In addition, prisoners are subject to a rigorous risk assessment which looks at their suitability for release on HDC, including the risk of reoffending. Only about 30 per cent of eligible offenders have been placed on HDC to date.</p>
