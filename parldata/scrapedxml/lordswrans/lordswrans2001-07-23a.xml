This is set out in Regulation A18(2) of the Police Pensions Regulations 1987.</p>

The approach taken in these negotiations is consistent with this approach.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-07-23a.161.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="161"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo010723/text/10723w02.htm#10723w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.161.5/1">The Prime Minister and other leaders of the G8 met in Genoa from 20 to <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-22">22 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/2">Television and newspaper coverage of the summit was dominated by the violence, vandalism and a tragic loss of life in Genoa's streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/3">In their concluding statement, the Prime Minister and his G8 colleagues deplored the violence and vandalism the people of Genoa had to endure during the summit.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/4">They made clear they would defend the right of peaceful protesters to have their voices heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/5">But, equally, as democratically elected leaders they made clear they could not and would not accept that a small unrepresentative minority should be allowed to disrupt their discussions through violence on the key issues affecting the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/6">Leaders discussed the prospects for the global economy. They expressed cautious optimism that, despite the current slowdown, sound economic fundamentals would bring a resumption of stronger growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/7">They expressed strong support for Prime Minister Koizumi's reform programme in Japan, and agreed on the importance of launching a new round of negotiations in the World Trade Organisation later this year at the ministerial meeting in Doha. They each pledged their personal engagement to make sure this was successfully achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/8">The Government believe a new trade round would provide a significant boost to confidence in the world economy. It has been estimated that a truly liberalising round could boost global income by some $400 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/9">Of this, between $100 billion and $150 billion could go to developing countries. G8 leaders agreed that increased trade, and particularly access to markets in the developed world, was the single biggest thing we could do to help their economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/10">G8 leaders met in Genoa with leaders of five African countries, as well as representatives of Latin America and Asia. With the Prime Minister's strong personal encouragement, the G8 welcomed the new readiness among African leaders to take responsibility for resolving the problems of their own continent.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/11">They agreed to appoint senior personal representatives to meet with the leaders of the New African Initiative and to work up a concrete plan of action between now and next year's summit in Canada.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/12">G8 leaders pledged to press ahead with the implementation of the debt relief initiative agreed at their Cologne summit in 1999, which has slowly brought debt relief of some $53 billion to some of the world's poorest countries. They agreed to make particular efforts to help those countries affected by conflict to come forward for relief under this programme and to ensure the sustainability of the reduced debt burdens of those countries which have already benefited from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/13">The G8 announced that they would together be making an initial contribution of $1.3 billion to the new Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis and welcomed a further $500 million pledged by other partners. The Government have pledged $200 million to this effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/14">G8 leaders expressed their determination to press forward, in consultation with the United Nations and other interested stakeholders, to ensure this fund is operational by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/15">They also welcomed recent steps by the pharmaceutical industry to make drugs more affordable in the poorest countries. The Government have themselves established a dialogue with industry here in Britain to see what more can be done and how the Government could help.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/16">G8 leaders had an open and constructive discussion on the environment, in particular on climate change. They recognised that this is a pressing issue requiring a global solution. They firmly agreed on the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And they made clear each of their governments would participate constructively in the current negotiations in Bonn on the Kyoto Protocol, helping to pave the way for the successful conclusion of those negotiations earlier today.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/17">Leaders welcomed the work that was set in hand at last year's summit in Okinawa on ways to promote greater use of renewable energy and to promote the use of information and communications technology in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/18">They pledged to continue efforts to promote a clear understanding by the public of food safety benefits and risks. They agreed on the need to provide consumers with relevant information on the safety of food products, based on independent scientific advice, sound risk analysis and the latest research developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/19">The G8 welcomed the outcome of the recent conference the Government organised in Bangkok on new biotechnology food and crops and agreed to ask relevant international bodies to pursue its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/20">They discussed the situation in the Middle East, where they called for immediate action to end violence and terrorism. They also discussed Macedonia and urged all parties there to display maximum responsibility so as to achieve rapid success in the current political dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/21">At the conclusion of the summit on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-22">22 July</phrase>, the Prime Minister and his G8 colleagues accepted the invitation of the Canadian Prime Minister to meet next year on 26 to <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-28">28 June</phrase> in Alberta.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/22">But G8 leaders unanimously agreed that the work of the G8 must and will go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/23">I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of the G7 and G8 communiques, the reports from the task forces on renewable energy and the digital divide, the statements made concerning the Middle East and Macedonia and the Genoa Plan for Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">The Government attach great importance to supporting efforts to reduce the uncontrolled spread and use of small and light weapons. The UK and its European partners have consistently maintained that the current UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects should adopt a politically binding programme of action containing concrete measures to deal with both the supply and demand side of the trade. The UK has made substantial contributions to proposals put forward by the EU and which reflect the noble Lord's concerns. These include export control and export licensing crtieria--this would include the issue of diversion to end-users of concern; work towards a legally binding instrument on the marking, tracing and brokering of small arms; management of stockpiles and surpluses, and destruction; disarmament; demobilisation and reintegration (DD&amp;R) of ex-combatants; and assistance for implementation of concrete measures, through, for example, weapons collection and destruction, capacity-building for border control, customs and law enforcement etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2">FCO officials have been in frequent and close consultation with EU partners, both bilaterally and through the regular EU working groups which discuss these issues. We also have many formal and informal contacts with, for example, the US and others in various arms control regimes and working groups, through which officials are able to discuss the subject of small arms and light weapons and other related issues. We also had contact with the US during the meetings in the preparatory process for the conference itself. In February this year, the UK hosted a small arms and light weapons policy brainstorming seminar to which a wide selection of countries was invited. The then Foreign Secretary addressed that meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/3">The Government also acknowledge the important role which NGOs and civil society can play in this field. We are working to see their interests reflected in the conference's programme of action and in its follow-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/4">The Government have developed a forward looking small arms strategy as part of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool mechanism. Ministers have agreed to support joint FCO, MoD and DfID proposals to address the proliferation and misuse of small arms and light weapons to the tune of &pound;19.5 million over the next three years. These funds will support the outcome of the UN conference as well as addressing concrete supply and demand issues, research and support for NGOs, including IANSA, and civil society groups.</p>

Russian and US nuclear disarmament programmes initiated prior to this, such as START I and the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives on tactical nuclear weapons, have continued throughout this period.

These assessments are based in part on lessons gained from an extensive programme of practice challenge inspections and visits. The Government will continue to press for a successful outcome to the negotiations on a Protocol to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.</p>

An independent expert committee advised the European Commission in 1986 that Triclosan could be used safely in all types of cosmetic products at levels up to 0.3 per cent. It has low toxicity and does not give rise to concern with regard to mutagenic or carcinogenic properties, nor with regard to effects on the reproductive system or development of offspring.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.0/1">Parents local authorities and other interested parties with the leave of the court as required may apply for a determination by the court of issues concerning a child's welfare under the court's inherent jurisdiction and the Children Act 1989. Normally, a child's parents would decide on that child's behalf (where the child is competent with his or her agreement) between a range of treatment options. The jurisdiction of the court would generally be invoked in connection with medical treatment where those with parental responsibility disagreed as to the appropriate treatment or where the competent child was opposed to treatment which his or her parents sought. Such proceedings would only be initiated by medical professionals or a referral made in these circumstances to a local authority where the medical professionals involved had genuine concerns that the healthcare decisions being made by those with parental responsibility for a child (or by a competent child himself or herself) were not in the child's best interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">If somebody believes that a child may be suffering, or may be at risk of suffering significant harm, they should always refer their concerns to the local authority social services department. While professionals should seek, in general, to discuss any concerns with the family and, where possible, seek their agreement to making referrals to social services, this should only be done where such discussion and agreement seeking will not place a child at increased risk of significant harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/3">Local authorities have a statutory duty, under Section 47 of the Children Act 1989, to make enquiries if they have reasonable cause to suspect that a child in their area is suffering, or is likely to suffer significant harm, to enable them to decide whether they should take any action to safeguard or promote the child's welfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/4">The Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families is equally relevant in these circumstances as a structured framework for collecting, drawing together and analysing available information about a child and family. It will help to provide sound evidence on which to base often difficult professional judgments about whether to intervene to safeguard a child and promote his or her welfare and, if so, how best to do so and with what intended outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/5">It is inevitable that each child protection referral will turn on its own facts but it is vital that all such referrals, whatever their origin, are taken seriously. Following appropriate assessment, and where appropriate police investigation, the local authority should take whatever action it considers necessary to safeguard the child and promote his or her welfare. This may include taking emergency action to protect the child or initiating proceedings in the family court.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/6">Local education authorities must make arrangements for the provision of suitable education for children who cannot attend school for reasons of illness or injury, It is for each local education authority to decide in individual cases what is suitable provision and this might include, for example, home tuition. In making their decision, local education authorities would of course need to take account of advice provided by medical professionals. There should be close liaison between hospital consultants, general practitioners, schools and the appropriate local education authority, so that educational support can be provided quickly and effectively for sick children. The Department for Education and Skills will be publishing revised guidance on the education of sick children in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.8/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has recently received an application for research from the Centre for Genome Research in Edinburgh. I understand that this centre has an established research team which has already held licences for embryo and stem cell research.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.8/2">The application proposes to establish stem cell lines from spare embryos, with a view to depositing the resulting cells in the Medical Research Council stem cell bank, to improve understanding of the growth and survival of pre-implantation human embryos, thereby benefiting in-vitro fertilisation treatment programmes. The proposed programme will also examine the potential for cell replacement and tissue repair therapies for a range of serious diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.8/3">Embryo research in the United Kingdom is subject to the most comprehensive regulation. As with all applications for research involving embryos, this application will be subject to detailed consideration by the HFEA to ensure that it meets the strict requirements of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Before deciding on the application, the HFEA requires full details of the project and Research Ethics Committee approval. The application must also explain the project's objectives, protocols and why the use of embryos is necessary for the research.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.8/4">This application will require specific justification for the extraction of stem cells and will be subject to peer review on its merits. It will also require details of patient information and consent forms specifying the purpose of the research and all possible uses of the cells lines derived from it. If approved, the project will be closely monitored by the HFEA to ensure that it continues to meet the conditions laid down by the 1990 Act and any conditions imposed by the authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.3/2">As a result of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, visits to farms by FBAS advisers were put on hold in February. As the outbreak is being brought under control, visits to farms have resumed. This follows an assessment of the risks involved by the State Veterinary Service and the adoption of strict biosecurity measures by the advisers when they make a farm visit. This will inevitably mean that farmers in some regions will have to wait longer for the service to be delivered than in others. It is too early to tell how quickly we will be able to clear the backlog of farmers awaiting delivery of the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.3/1">Definitive maps were first required to be produced under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. They are the responsibility of the local highway authority, which (under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) has a duty to keep the definitive map and statement under continuous review and to make such modifications as it deems necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/2">The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides for a cut-off date in 25 years' time for recording of certain rights of way on definitive maps and the extinguishment of those not so recorded by that date. In order to ensure that the definitive maps are as complete as possible by this date, the Government have asked the Countryside Agency to consider ways of co-ordinating the efforts of user groups in researching any as yet undiscovered rights of way.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/3">The Countryside Agency invited tenders for work associated with completing these local highway authority definitive maps, following OJEC contractual procedures, in February 2001. Interviews were held at the end of March. The agency invited consultants to advise on the most effective way of involving voluntary groups in research on unrecorded rights of way. They were specifically asked to: estimate the extent of unrecorded rights of way; report on the issues affecting the ability of highway authorities to complete their definitive map; recommend ways of improving the quantity and quality of research on unrecorded rights of way--this might include provision of information and training; prepare research standards to encourage high quality applications to modify each definitive map; recommend other ways to improve the process of recording historic rights on definitive maps--this might, for example, include ways on making archive material more easily available to researchers; consult with and ensure that any proposals are likely to be acceptable to the bodies involved in the programme of historical research, such as local highway authorities, voluntary groups; landowning groups, the planning inspectorate and archive offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/4">The contract was offered on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-12">12 July</phrase> and, if accepted, we expect work to begin in August with a view to having a scheme to support voluntary work in place by spring 2002.</p>
