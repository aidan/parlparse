	<p pid="a.256.9/1">DfID does not produce independent global estimates of annual variations in the global poverty rate. According to the most recent World Bank estimates since June 2010, an additional 44 million people fell below the $1.25 poverty line as a result of higher food prices. Global food prices in July 2011 remained significantly higher than in July 2010 and close to the 2008 peak levels. Prices for the period April to July 2011 have declined slightly from their peak in February but there remains significant volatility. This information highlights the urgent need to strengthen the emergency and long-term response to food insecurity.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.9/2">The Government are working with international partners to address issues of food security. In June, G20 Agriculture Ministers agreed an action plan on food price volatility and agriculture to take forward some concrete actions in this area. On the basis of the action plan and through work of international organisations, DfID has taken specific actions including; (1) strengthening research, innovation and dissemination mobilising the G20 agriculture research networks (2) promoting efforts to scale up responsible investments and activities related to agricultural production and food security in co-operation with the multilateral development banks and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.9/3">DfID also recognizes the importance of timely, accurate and transparent information in helping to address food price volatility. We have supported the launch of the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) in order to encourage major players on the agri-food markets to share data, to enhance existing information systems, to promote greater shared understanding of food price developments, and further policy dialogue and co-operation. The AMIS will involve G20 countries in the early stage and invite other main grain and oilseeds producing, exporting and importing countries, representatives from major commodity exchange markets and the private sector to participate.</p>
