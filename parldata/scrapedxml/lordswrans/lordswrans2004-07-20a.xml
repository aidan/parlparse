	<p pid="a.23.1/2" qnum="HL3490">What assessment they have made of the relationship between the millennium development target to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds and similar targets for halving the proportion of people without safe water or basic sanitation.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-07-20a.23.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="23"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040720/text/40720w01.htm#40720w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.23.2/1">The millennium targets to reduce under-five mortality and to reduce the proportion of people without safe water and basic sanitation are very closely linked. Unsafe water and poor sanitation causes high rates of diarrhoeal disease. Use of powdered milk and unsafe water instead of breastfeeding contributes to diarrhoeal disease in infants.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/2">Diarrhoeal disease is a major contributor to child mortality globally and also to high levels of under-nutrition. Provision of effective healthcare, whether in the home, the community or through formal health institutions (adequate rehydration and specific drug treatment where indicated) can treat the problem and prevent death from diarrhoea. However, it does not address the direct cause of diarrhoea. Significant progress in reducing the burden of diarrhoeal disease will only be achieved through the integrated provision of safe water, in or as near to the house as possible, sanitation and hygiene promotion.</p>

Local authorities have been given specific responsibility to ensure that parents are consulted about the services they need, and for their delivery through children's centres. The Sure Start Unit is working closely with local authorities and will continue to promote the need for children's centres to consult regularly with parents, and review service provision as their needs change.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.5/1">The department does not gather statistics on the percentage of families that are given their first choice primary school for their children. Individual local education authorities may have information. Collecting reliable data is difficult because many parents apply for places at more than one school and it is not clear which is their first preference. However, co-ordinated admission arrangements, which will affect primary school intakes from September 2006, will provide LEAs with more easily accessible information on how well parental preferences are met in maintained primary schools.</p>

This consideration is carried out on a case-by-case basis; IND does not adopt a blanket approach to the assessment of further representations or material from the nationals of any country.

	<p pid="a.35.8/1">The Segway human transporter is an electrically powered device, which operates on rechargeable batteries. It emits no harmful exhaust gases when it is being ridden, but its total environmental impact will depend, among other things, on how the electricity used to recharge the batteries has been generated (whether from coal, gas, nuclear or renewable sources), and how its batteries are disposed of at the end of its working life.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.1/2" qnum="HL3736">How many digital hearing aids have been distributed nationwide from National Health Service hearing aids services since the digital scheme was announced in February; and</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/3" qnum="HL3738">What is the estimated number of National Health Service patients with hearing loss who would benefit from a switch from analogue to digital hearing aids; and what percentage of these have been supplied and fitted so far; and</p>

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">From the beginning of the modernising hearing aid services project in May 2000 until the end of May 2004, audiology departments fitted 267,000 hearing aids for 195,000 people as part of the project. Of these, 188,000 were fitted for 136,000 people since February 2003. We have made no estimate of the number of people who might benefit from a switch from analogue to digital hearing aids.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/2">It has proved necessary to set up a prioritisation system for the issue of digital hearing aids, which will mean that some people with analogue aids will not be fitted with new digital aids within the two-year roll out.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/3">To increase capacity, a national framework agreement was developed with private dispensers to fit National Health Service hearing aids to NHS patients, free of charge to the patient. So far 41 NHS sites have already signed up to use the scheme in 2004 with another 39 joining shortly. By the end of May 2004, private dispensers had fitted 987 NHS patients with NHS digital hearing aids. The national framework agreement runs initially for a two-year period beginning in October 2003 with an optional extension for a further three years. NHS trusts will be able to make use of the agreement as long as it is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/4">Money for digital hearing aids will still be available to primary care trusts after April 2005. It will be for PCTs to decide how best to provide audiology services.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is responsible for promoting sport but Defra funds a wide range of initiatives to increase opportunities for outdoor recreation. Many of the programmes are delivered by other bodies that Defra grant-aids, in particular the Countryside Agency, the seven English National Park Authorities, the Broads Authority and the Environment Agency. Programmes include implementation of the new right of access to open country and registered common land, and improving access to water.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">The actual and projected expenditure for these activities by Defra-sponsored non-departmental public bodies and National Park Authorities is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/13">In addition, Defra provides annual sums of between &pound;12 million and &pound;19 million to local highway authorities to meet their new rights of way obligations under Part II of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act.

	<p pid="a.42.8/1">The Government gave a commitment to increase access to water in <i>Working for the Essentials of Life,</i> published in 2002. We also commissioned a study from Brighton University study to establish what recreational opportunities are currently available. The report of that study, <i>Water-based sport and recreation: the Facts</i> was published in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/2">The Brighton study found that supply and demand for water-based recreation is broadly in balance but it identified some unmet demand for white water and long distance routes for canoeists in some parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/3">In light of these findings, my right honourable friend the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality asked the Countryside Agency to undertake a feasibility study into improving access for canoeists by voluntary agreement. The study focused on four pilot areas and the findings indicate that voluntary agreements can be made to work in certain circumstances. My right honourable friend is now considering the report's recommendations that agreements be completed in the pilot areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/4">In addition, the Environment Agency has embarked on a programme of developing regional strategies for water-based sport and recreation and its annual conservation, access and recreation reports made under the Environment Act 1995 provide information on the range of work undertaken by the agency to increase recreational opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.8/5">The Environment Agency is also leading on the development of strategic partnerships and alliances which include public, commercial and voluntary sectors to upgrade facilities on the agencies' navigable rivers which are backed by marketing and promotion initiatives.</p>
