	<p pid="a.136.5/1">The past 10 years has seen strong progress towards a globalised gas market, particularly in the LNG spot market, as the result of sharply increased arbitrage in LNG trade across the Atlantic, as well as between the Atlantic and Pacific Basins. Increasing LNG export and import capacity around the world, together with increased production of unconventional gas in some major consumer countries, will help to continue this trend. However, gas is inherently more expensive to transport than oil, and at present it seems unlikely that the gas market will ever globalise to quite the same extent as the oil market.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/4">The UK has long called for Gilad Shalit's immediate and unconditional release and we reiterate that call today. It is also vital that Hamas allows the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit Gilad immediately and ensure that he is in good health.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/5">His continued captivity without any ICRC access and with only very occasional, minimal contact with his family is utterly unacceptable.

	<p pid="a.148.2/2">Reductions to council spending reflect the urgent need for the public sector to help put the country's finances back in order, keep interest rates down and prevent national debt escalating to &#163;1.4 trillion of taxpayers' money.</p>

More money is being channelled at those areas of the country that have the highest levels of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/4">Ministers have also sought to deliver a fair deal to local taxpayers and all councils by limiting the average spending power reduction across all councils to 4.4 per cent in 2011-12 and ensuring that no council faces a reduction of more than 8.9 per cent in spending power in 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.0/1">Around seven million people are currently not saving enough to meet their retirement aspirations. Automatic enrolment of individuals into a workplace pension is the right way to encourage savings habits, and the workplace pension reforms enable this.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/2">Under these reforms, from 2012, employers will be staged in over a four year period. They will be required to automatically enrol all eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/3">Employers will initially be required to contribute a minimum of one per cent of a band of earnings, rising to 2 per cent from October 2016 and 3 per cent from October 2017. We expect 5 million to 8 million people to start newly saving, or saving more, in all forms of workplace pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/4">The Pensions Bill introduces a higher earnings threshold than previously set out under the reforms which means that employers will no longer need to automatically enrol lower earners. It also enables employers to use a waiting period of up to three months before automatically enrolling eligible individuals. We estimate that these changes will save employers &#163;170 million in annual contribution costs and &#163;6 million in annual administration costs, than originally set out in the workplace pension reform legislation.</p>

This means that it will no longer be possible for an employee to be forced to retire simply because he or she has reached the age of 65. About two-thirds of employers already operate without fixed retirement ages, but for those that still use them, the Government recognise that they may need help and support in order to adapt to the change. Acas has therefore produced guidance on managing without the default retirement age: <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/(CHttpHandller.ashx?'id=2976&amp;p=0">www.acas.org.uk/(CHttpHandller.ashx?'id=2976&amp;p=0</a>. It is not compulsory for employers to have a performance management procedure, although they may find such a procedure helpful in addressing underperformance, not just for older workers but, as a matter of good practice, for all their employees regardless of their age. Where appropriate, dismissal will still be possible under ordinary fair dismissal rules, and the majority of employers already manage this effectively without recourse to fixed retirement ages.</p>
