	<p pid="a.47.5/1">The reduction to seven refers to a change in the way Standards Fund grants are allocated in 2000-2001 from a bidding process, which can be burdensome on local authorities and schools, to a simpler and quicker formula method of allocation. The number of grants in the programme are not affected. From 2001-2002 we plan further to reduce the number of grants subject to a bidding process so that virtually all allocations will be by formula. In addition, more radical changes are planned that will significantly reduce the number of ring-fenced grants by grouping them under around half a dozen broad headings, so schools are free to decide the detailed pattern of expenditure. We also plan to allow schools to carry over their unused Standards Fund to the end of the schools year, rather than having to spend it by <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-31">31 March</phrase> or lose it.</p>
