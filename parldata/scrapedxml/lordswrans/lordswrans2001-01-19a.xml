	<p pid="a.147.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/2" qnum="HL190">Whether, in the light of Equitable Life's marketing strategy, including its sponsorship of the television comedy series &quot;Frasier&quot;, in the period subsequent to the House of Lords' ruling on guaranteed annuity rates, the Financial Services Authority's regulation and supervision of the company has been adequate to protect the interests of policyholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.2/1">As my honourable friend the Economic Secretary said in a Written Answer in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase> (Official Report, col. 161W), the Government have noted the statements from the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and Equitable Life on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase> that Equitable Life would close to new business with immediate effect. We welcome the fact that the FSA and the society are working closely together to protect the interests of policyholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">The FSA intends to prepare a report on the events leading to the closure of Equitable Life to new business. The report will cover both the FSA's role as prudential regulator and its exercise of its functions under the Financial Services Act 1986. The report is likely to take some months to complete and will be published.</p>
