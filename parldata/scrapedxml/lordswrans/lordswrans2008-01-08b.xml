	<p pid="b.187.1/2" qnum="HL1030">What safeguards are in place to ensure that claimants whose only income is from contribution-based employment and support allowance (ESA) do not find themselves disadvantaged compared to those on income-based ESA because they will not have entitlement to local authority concessionary schemes and the Social Fund and will need to make separate claims for help with prescription charges and legal aid.</p>

	<p pid="b.187.2/2">We are working with colleagues in the Department of Health to make access to its low-income scheme easier for those who are not eligible for automatic passporting. This includes the potential for simplifying the claim form and making the process less complex. We are also considering options for those elements of Social Fund unavailable to customers not in receipt of qualifying benefits.</p>

The Bali action plan is an historic agreement in which for the first time all the countries of the world agreed to negotiate a new climate deal after the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period ends in 2012. These negotiations will begin early next year and will be concluded in Copenhagen in 2009.</p>

The UK has a liberalised energy market in which the private sector makes investment decisions. The Government's role is to ensure an effective energy and carbon market and that support mechanisms such as the renewables obligation incentivise low-carbon technologies. We are also supporting the construction of one of the world's first commercial-scale carbon capture and storage power plants in the UK because we recognise that fossil fuels, including coal, will continue to have an important role to play in the energy mix both here and across the world. We support innovation and the development and deployment of new technologies to reduce the carbon emissions from energy.</p>

This figure has since increased to &pound;63 million for payments made after <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June 2006</phrase> in regard to SPS 2005.

The Commission has yet to make any proposals regarding disallowance relating to the single payment scheme. Defra continues to review its potential liabilities on an ongoing basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.2/1">The renewables obligation is the Government's main mechanism for supporting renewables generation.

	<p pid="b.197.8/1">The agreement for National Health Service Supply Chain to provide procurement and logistics services for the use of the NHS commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase> and runs for 10 years. There is an option to extend for a further five years, subject to the agreement of both parties. In addition to the remit to provide procurement and logistics services, NHS Supply Chain will grow sales and expand the range available to the NHS over the 10-year term.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.8/2">NHS Supply Chain expects to make savings for the NHS in excess of &pound;1 billion over the 10-year contract period. These savings grow exponentially over the period as more contract renewals take place and sales grow. At the end of the first year, savings to the NHS are &pound;9 million compared to the year 1 target of &pound;1 million.</p>
