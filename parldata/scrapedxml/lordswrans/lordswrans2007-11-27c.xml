In 2007-08, 102 appeals were submitted but 19 have since been withdrawn. Of the appeals now under consideration, 41 were submitted in March, 27 in April, three in June, one in July, two in August, one in September, seven in October and one in November.

	<p pid="c.111.0/1">Under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), which will come into effect in April 2008, all transport fuel suppliers will be required to report on the carbon savings offered by, and wider environmental and social impacts associated with, any biofuels in respect of which they wish to claim renewable transport fuel certificates. The precise reporting requirements will be a matter for the Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA). The Government consulted over the summer on its detailed draft recommendations to the RFA in this area, and is due to publish a summary of responses very shortly. The information provided in these reports is likely to become publicly available, which should create a real incentive on transport fuel suppliers to source only those biofuels that can be proved to come from sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/2">Further, the Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June 2007</phrase> that from 2011 they aim to reward biofuels under the RTFO only if the feedstocks from which they are produced meet appropriate sustainability standards. The Government will be able to do this, however, only if that is consistent with the mandatory EU-wide sustainability framework for biofuels which is currently being developed by the European Commission. The Government are actively lobbying the European Commission to ensure that this framework is sufficiently robust. The Government will also need to ensure that any such requirements are compatible with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and European Union technical standards requirements.
