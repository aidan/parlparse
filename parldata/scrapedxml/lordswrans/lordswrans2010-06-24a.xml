The UK is projected to meet particulate matter or PM10 limits, including in the very few locations in London that are over the limit value, and move to full compliance by 2011 (in time for the Olympics). Much of the UK, outside major urban areas, already meets the EU air quality limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), but, along with many other European countries, faces a challenge on achieving this in large urban areas such as London.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/2">The UK Government intend to apply for additional time to meet the NO2 limit value by 2015 and will be putting forward plans for this in 2011. The Mayor of London is responsible for air quality in the capital and we are working with him and the Greater London Authority to ensure London has effective measures to meet the NO2 limits in the shortest time possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/1">HM Government will not be commissioning independent accountants to calculate the cost of Refugee and Migrant Justice (RMJ) going into administration. Any costs associated with RMJ will be absorbed within existing budgets. Where any provider ceases to have a legal aid contract for whatever reason, the LSC will make an assessment of any potential financial issues in the individual circumstances. This will include payments on account made, claims to be billed and whether for example the provider will be continuing to conclude cases for existing clients.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/2">Whether RMJ will be concluding cases on behalf of its clients is a decision for the administrators. The LSC is working closely with the administrators and others to ensure that urgent arrangements are made so that clients continue to receive a good quality service and that where necessary other providers can undertake the work.</p>
