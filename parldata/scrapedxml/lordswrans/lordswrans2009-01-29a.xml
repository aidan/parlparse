	<p pid="a.73.6/1">Local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children within their area. They are also required to establish local safeguarding children boards; these are the key statutory mechanism for agreeing how the relevant organisations in each local area will co-operate to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in that locality, and for ensuring the effectiveness of what they do. DoE Circular 18/94 makes clear that when local authorities decide to proceed with an eviction, they should liaise with the relevant statutory agencies, particularly where newly-born children are involved, to ensure those agencies can fulfil their obligations towards those persons. We have issued clear guidance to local authorities which recognises enforcement action can be traumatic, and should therefore be proportionate and considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.2/1">Islands off the coast of England which will qualify as being accessible under the definition in Clause 290(3) of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill are those where it is possible to walk to the island across the foreshore, or by means of a bridge, tunnel or causeway, either from the mainland of England or from another accessible island. This applies even where an island is accessible on foot only at certain times such as at low tide, or only during certain periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/2">Natural England's initial advice is that the following islands are likely to qualify as accessible for this purpose:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/3">Burgh Island (Devon);Canvey Island (Essex);Foulness Island (Essex);Great Stonar (Kent);Hayling Island (Hampshire);Hilbre Island (Merseyside);Holy Island (Lindisfarne&mdash;Northumberland);Isle of Sheppey (Kent);Mersea Island (Essex);Northey Island (Essex);Portsea Island (Hampshire);Potton Island (Essex);St Michael's Mount (Cornwall);Thorney Island (West Sussex);Wallasea Island (Essex);Walney Island (Cumbria); andWhale Island (Hampshire).</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/4">The Secretary of State will also have power by order to specify any other island as accessible for this purpose under Clause 290(2) and (5) of the Bill, if that island is suitable for the establishment of one or more long-distance routes along its coast. It is envisaged that the Isle of Wight will be specified by order in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/5">Where an island is treated as accessible for either reason, it will be possible for Natural England, in fulfilling its coastal access duty under Clause 286, to propose that the route for the whole coast referred to by Clause 286(2) of the Bill should pass over the island. Land within the island may also form part of the margin for public enjoyment referred to by Clause 286(3) of the Bill subject to any of the land falling within the category of excepted land or any restrictions on access that may be in place on that land. The Secretary of State will take the final decision on whether land within accessible islands should be affected by the new access arrangements in either of these ways.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.5/1">The Government remain committed to supporting the effective provision of private pensions. The legal framework within which they operate has been the subject of a significant level of external scrutiny, from the report of the Pension Law Review Committee in 1993 under the chairmanship of Professor Goode and including the reports of the Pensions Commission under Lord Turner. Building on this, successive Governments have established a comprehensive regulatory framework for occupational pensions and the Government have introduced an effective safety net to help individuals if their scheme fails. The Government are currently working to implement an ambitious pension reform programme, including taking forward its rolling deregulatory review to ensure the right balance between encouraging private pension provision and protecting the rights of pension scheme members. The Government do not, therefore, believe a further review of the issues referred to in the question is called for at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.5/1">Electronic tagging of offenders and defendants has been operating throughout England and Wales since 1999, and is used as a means to monitor curfews which are available as an option in community sentencing, as a bail condition and as a condition of release from prison, with the person remaining in the community. The monitoring service is provided by two private sector companies under contracts with the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/2">Electronic tagging in Northern Ireland is due to commence in April 2009 and the procedures underpinning its implementation are still under development. In Northern Ireland, it is intended that electronic monitoring will be available to monitor curfews as a condition of bail; as a licence condition or as a requirement of a community sentence. The technology will be the same as that used in England and Wales and the monitoring service will be provided by a private sector organisation under contract with the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/3">Before a court or prison governor in England and Wales issues an offender with a curfew requirement with electronic tagging it should, as far as is practicable, avoid any conflict with religious beliefs and observances. This is specified in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 for those subject to a community sentence, and in Prison Service Order 6700 for those released early on home detention curfew (HDC). This may. for example, take the form of a pre-notified schedule of variations to curfew times to allow attendance at religious services without violating the terms of their court order or licence.</p>
