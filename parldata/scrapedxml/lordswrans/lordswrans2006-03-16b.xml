Regulation 24 includes a power of entry to premises by authorised officers so that they can exercise their statutory powers of inspection, sampling of animal feed and examination of records. The exercise of these powers by authorised officers is not dependent on the existence of grounds for suspecting that an offence may have been committed, and is therefore not governed by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code of Practice B by virtue of paragraph 2.5, which states that the code does not apply to powers of this type.</p>

	<p pid="b.251.0/1">The Government have stated their commitment to a national bowel cancer screening programme. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>, the new health White Paper <i>Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services</i> reaffirmed that the programme will be rolled out from April 2006. Further details will be provided as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/2">NHS cancer screening programmes are taking all the action necessary to ensure the successful roll-out of the programme, including the procurement of testing kits. Following a formal tendering exercise, a preferred provider of the testing kits has been selected. An order will be placed for the delivery of kits in time for the commencement of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/3">The NHS bowel cancer screening pilot showed that screen-detected cancers had no detrimental effect on routine bowel cancer services.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/4">Training in endoscopy (bowel scoping) is vital to the diagnosis of bowel cancer. To prepare for the bowel cancer screening programme, we have built on the training established as part of the NHS Cancer Plan. A national training programme has been established, with three national and seven regional centres, to train medical staff, general practitioners, nurses and other health professionals to carry out vital procedures for diagnosing bowel cancer. By increasing the pool of staff able to undertake endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures, waiting times will be reduced and services made more convenient.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/5">Based on current trends and definitions the training programme is projected to deliver 217 newly trained non-medical endoscopists and 1,353 medical endoscopists by 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/6">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) produced updated guidance, <i>Improving Outcomes in Colorectal Cancers</i>, in May 2004. This guidance is aimed at helping those involved in planning, commissioning, organising and providing bowel cancer services to ensure that services are configured to ensure appropriate high quality services. Implementation of NICE guidance is a developmental standard as set out in <i>National Standards, Local Action</i>, published in July 2004. The Healthcare Commission is responsible for assessing progress of healthcare organisations towards achieving developmental standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/7">A Bowel Cancer Communications Group was set up in 2005 to discuss communications with the public when the bowel cancer screening programme begins. The voluntary sector, patient groups, researchers, NHS cancer screening programmes and the NHS cancer screening programmes press office are all represented on the group. The group is considering all aspects of communications, including reaching ethnic minorities, people from deprived areas and hard-to-reach groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.253.8/1">Mozambique is an increasingly successful and stable post-conflict country. But it remains at the lower end of human development indices, and is prone to flooding and other natural disasters. Our aim is to assist Mozambique to complete its democratic transition, while helping to lift its people out of poverty and supporting its efforts to become more resilient, through economic development and growth, to natural disasters. In support of this, Britain has become the leading bilateral donor&mdash;approximately &pound;60 million per year&mdash;and the largest contributor of direct support to Mozambique's budget. We are also working with Mozambique and other partners in southern Africa and the Africa Union to address governance issues, for example in Zimbabwe; to secure peace, for example in the Great Lakes region; and to tackle conflict, for example in Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="b.254.5/1">We do not accept such criticisms. The UK considers the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to be the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the framework for nuclear disarmament. We are fulfilling all our obligations under the NPT, including those on disarmament under Article VI of the treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.5/2">The UK has significantly reduced its nuclear arsenal since the end of the Cold War. We have reduced the total explosive power of our nuclear forces by over 70 per cent. and have fewer than 200 nuclear warheads operationally available at any one time. We have reduced our deterrent capacity to a single nuclear weapons system, Trident, after withdrawing and dismantling the RAF's freefall bomb in 1998. Only one Trident submarine is on deterrent patrol at any one time and that submarine is normally on several days' &quot;notice to fire&quot;. Its missiles are de-targeted. The UK has observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since 1991 and, in 1998, we ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In addition, we announced in 1995 that we had stopped the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and we continually press for negotiations to begin on a fissile material cut-off treaty at the conference on disarmament in Geneva.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.2/1">The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has not made any individual requests to member states, but UNSC Resolutions 1556, 1564 and 1574 have all urged,</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Member States to provide the required equipment, logistical, financial, material, and other necessary resources,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/3">to the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). The UN Secretary-General has also requested the United Kingdom to provide additional financial support to AMIS. The UK is one of the main contributors to AMIS: last year it made available some &pound;19 million in bilateral aid, as well as providing a significant amount of financial support and technical assistance through the EU. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-21">21 February</phrase> that a further &pound;20 million would be made available to AMIS in the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/4">There are ongoing discussions among member states and within the Security Council on various measures, which can be taken to encourage all relevant parties within Sudan to comply with obligations set out in previous Security Council resolutions. The Government continue to support the Darfur peace talks in Abuja. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary visited the talks on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase>. He met African Union (AU) chief mediator, Dr Salim Ahmed Salim, to express the UK's continued strong support for the AU mediation team. At the AU's request he also addressed representatives of the parties in a plenary and announced a package of &pound;1.25 million in support of the talks. We maintain an observer presence at the talks in support of the mediation.</p>
