	<p pid="a.80.5/1">The immediate humanitarian situation in Iraq is improving, although many challenges lie ahead. DfID's contribution to this effort is significant. We have already committed &pound;115 million to support the work of humanitarian agencies in the current crisis; &pound;99 million of this has been allocated to specific activities through United Nations agencies (&pound;63.8 million), the Red Cross and Red Crescent (&pound;32 million) and NGOs (&pound;3.4 million). These are the organisations best placed to deliver humanitarian assistance where it is most needed. We have also set aside a further &pound;95 million to meet additional needs as they emerge. DfID teams on the ground in Baghdad and Basra are working with the coalition provisional authority and UK military, and helping to co-ordinate the humanitarian effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/2">Progess is being made. Basra now has as much water as it did before the conflict; all 12 main hospitals in Baghdad are functioning; rubbish is being removed from the streets of Baghdad and Basra; the food distribution system is working again and has sufficient pipeline stocks of the main commodities; electricity supply sytems are being repaired; public sector salaries are being paid; and Iraqi policemen are returning to duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/3">Much remains to be done however. One of the most critical challenges is ensuring law and order, and managing the security sector to ensure that the Iraqi police and armed forces are reformed effectively, and that demobilised soldiers are reintegrated properly into civilian life. More needs to be done to improve Iraq's capacity to provide its people with basic services such as health, education, clean water and sanitation. It will also be important to maintain the effort to clear Iraq of mines and unexploded ordnance, some of which go back to Saddam Hussein's war with Iran in the 1980s; and to make possible the orderly return of Iraqi refugees from neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/4">It will also be important to ensure as far as possible the full involvement of women in political and economic affairs, to rebuild Iraqi civil society, to develop independent news media, and to create a favourable environment for Iraqi private sector development.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/5">The Development Fund for Iraq will be the central means for financing Iraq's public services, as well as meeting the costs of reconstruction and development, during the process of political transformation. It will be essential that the fund's priority setting and resource allocation processes work as transparently as possible for the clear benefit of the Iraqi people, as envisaged in UN Security Council Resolution 1483 of <phrase class="date" code="">22 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/6">The United Nations is preparing an update of its Flash Appeal for Iraq. It will be discussed at an official level meeting in New York on <phrase class="date" code="">23 June</phrase>, which will be followed by an informal meeting of donors. Any further DfID contribution towards emergency humanitarian assistance will be considered in view of the needs identified in the revised appeal and the outcome of the discussions in New York. Consideration of the allocation of DfID funding for longer-term reconstruction and development will be undertaken in light of the social and economic needs assessments currently being carried out by the World Bank, IMF and United Nations.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-16a.82.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="82"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030616/text/30616w02.htm#30616w02_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.82.2/1">Last November we consulted on options for safeguarding tenancy moneys to address concerns that an appreciable number of tenants were losing out and the image of the private rented sector as a whole was suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/2">The consultation paper followed two years of government funding of a pilot tenancy deposit scheme. It reflected the evidence that a voluntary scheme was not an effective option. Take-up of the pilot had been poor and so were the prospects of a self-financing voluntary national scheme. So, we sought views on the case for compulsory measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/3">The consultation paper indicated that there is not a robust basis for legislating to compel the protection of tenancy moneys in third party schemes. It showed that with costs of &pound;19 million per annum and benefits of &pound;20 million per annum, the case for so legislating was finely balanced. I have to say that the responses to the consultation were equally inconclusive.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/4">Nevertheless, the Government are committed to addressing the case for legislation alongside consideration of proposals that the Law Commission plans to publish by this autumn, particularly with regard to written tenancy agreements. That seems an appropriate context in which to address the safeguarding of tenancy money.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/5">We have learnt some useful lessons from government funding of the voluntary pilot tenancy deposit scheme&mdash;not least that there was no prospect of it becoming a self-financing voluntary scheme with a substantial membership. Therefore, so far as government funding is concerned it will have to be wound up. Nevertheless the Government would be more than happy to endorse self-financing voluntary schemes in advance of legislative proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/6">We will publish detailed proposals and a full response to the consultation later in the year, in the light of what the Law Commission publishes.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">The Byers review is the North West Science and Daresbury Development Group. Of the projects recommended in March 2001 by the NWSDDG:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2" class="indent">1. The North West Science Council has been established, bringing advice from local business leaders to regional science projects. In November 2002, the council produced a regional science strategy for the North West&mdash;the first in UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3" class="indent">2. The proposed public/private partnership to act as a bridge between the Daresbury laboratory and companies has been suspended by the creation of CLIK. This is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Central Laboratories for the Research Councils (CCLRC). CLIK will manage Daresbury's exploitation activities and is supported by a grant of &pound;4 million. In April, the North West Development Agency announced &pound;25.7 million of funding to develop Daresbury Science Park in partnership with CCLRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4" class="indent">3. The proposed Centre for Accelerator Science and Imaging and Medicine (CASIM) led to two projects:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5" class="indent">The SIRIUS proposal for a proton cyclotron was discussed with a number of potential funding agencies. In April 2002, the Research Council's UK Strategy Group reviewed the proposal. Although the nuclear physics element of the proposal was rated highly their advice was that the capital and operating cost of the facility could not be justified on the basis of nuclear science alone. A final decision was withheld until the outcome of the National Cancer Research Institute's review of the UK's requirement in radiobiology and radiotherapy was known. This review has concluded that although there is a case for the evaluation of protons, and light and heavy ions as a treatment option, it is not perceived as a priority by the majority of stakeholders. In view of these conclusions the prospective partners in the project (the Department of Health, the Medical Research Council and the Office of Science and Technology) have decided not to take the project forward. The project will thus receive no funding from the science budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="">2 April</phrase>, we announced funding of &pound;11.5 million for Daresbury for an exploratory phase for the other project, the 4th Generation Light Source (4GLS). These funds will be used in a three-year study to establish the technical know-how and build a prototype test facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-12">12 March</phrase>, we announced the go-ahead for a new &pound;30 million flagship manufacturing centre for biosciences, which could bring 1,000 new jobs to Liverpool. The National Biomanufacturing Centre in Speke will consist of three laboratories and a production plant. A &pound;9.74 million grant has been agreed from Merseyside's Objective 1 programme for the National Biomanufacturing Centre and &pound;3 million has already been invested by DTI. The majority of the remaining funding will come from the NWDA. Up to 1,000 new jobs could be created by the facility, which will cement Merseyside's position as the national hub of biomanufacturing.</p>
