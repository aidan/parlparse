	<p pid="a.64.2/1">The Government deplore the war crimes committed during the Balkans conflict in the early 1990s, including the rape of women and girls in Bosnia.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/2">We are sympathetic to any proposal to improve the situation of the victims of these crimes, but it is not clear that awarding civilian war victim status would be the most effective means of ensuring support for these women. What is required is recognition of their suffering as victims of rape, conviction of the perpetrators and provision of appropriate support for these women and their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/3">Through the work of the Department for International Development, and support for UNICEF and local NGOs, the Government support projects to raise awareness of rape as a war crime. We strongly support the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, which is tasked with bringing to trial those suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Balkans conflict, including rape. It has convicted a number of individuals of this crime. With our partners in the EU, we apply concerted pressure to all governments in the region for greater co-operation with ICTY, particularly in the handover and prosecution of indictees.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/4">The best way to secure financial support for these women and their children is through successful convictions in the Bosnian courts, which can award compensation to the victims of rape. Together with our EU partners, we are working hard to strengthen the capacity of the Bosnian judicial system, so that it can prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes more effectively and efficiently, and provide sustainable support to the victims.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.3/1">The UK has done much to support the development of democracy and civil society in the south Caucasus. We have funded a number of initiatives both on a regional level and on a national level with each of the three countries. On a regional level:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/2">We have provided funding for the South Caucasus Parliamentary Initiative (SCPI), through the UK Global Conflict Prevention Pool. The SCPI is a framework for dialogue, contacts, exchange of views and joint analysis between parliamentarians from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The next meeting of the SCPI will take place in December in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/3">We will be funding a &pound;2 million three-year project aiming to improve the prospects for a permanent settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. The purpose of the project will be to improve understanding of the conflict among all stakeholders, to improve the conflict sensitivity of national and international actors in the region and to implement a number of activities which will contribute to the development of constituencies for peace in the region. A significant part of this project will focus on the development of civil society.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/4">We have provided the OSCE with 10 per cent of the election observers in all rounds of the recent elections in each of the three countries. On a national level:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/5">We have supported a number of projects. In Azerbaijan:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/6">We sponsored the training of election officials in conjunction with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). We also sponsored the publication of an IFES guide to help observers to monitor the elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/7">We co-funded an OSCE long-term observer to monitor the implementation of the unified election code in advance of the recent presidential elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/8">Together with the Dutch Government, we funded the provision of transparent mobile ballot boxes.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/9">We have sponsored a number of NGO resource centres aimed at strengthening civil society, particularly in the regions. The centres provide a focal point for NGOs and individuals to meet and discuss common problems and as a form of citizens' advice bureau for poorer citizens. In Georgia:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/10">Our approach to civic society building in Georgia has largely been concentrated on encouraging dialogue across the various conflict divides (e.g. study visits by Georgian/Abkhaz officials and politicians to Northern Ireland) and on developing the capacity of NGOs, journalists and other key groups to better address conflict-related issues so as to take responsibility for resolving them.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/11">We also funded a Georgian NGO (The International Society for Fair Elections) to conduct a media campaign raising awareness of the democratic process. In Armenia:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/12">We contributed to a project to update the voters lists in key population areas for both the presidential and the parliamentary elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/13">We contributed to the provision of transparent ballot boxes for the parliamentary elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/14">We supported the opening and running of an NGO training centre to promote human rights protection and the development of civil society in a region of Armenia where the NGO sector is poorly developed and which was a key problem area during the elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/15">We are supporting the promotion of grass roots democracy at community level through a local NGO.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/16">Finally we are promoting good environmental practice and supporting anti-corruption research and public awareness through television adverts with the local branch of Transparency International.</p>

UNSCR 1493 also authorised MONUC to assist the Government of National Unity and Transition in disarming and demobilising those Congolese combatants who may voluntarily decide to enter the DDR process within the framework of the Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme, pending the establishment of a national DDR programme in co-ordination with the United Nations Development Programme and other agencies concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">The Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1138" name="Mike O'Brien">my honourable friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mike O'Brien)</phrase> is to visit Pakistan imminently. Pakistan is an important ally and partner of the UK. We work closely with Pakistan in a number of fields and our bilateral relationship is warm and close. Our mutual commitment to developing this relationship is shown by the successful visits to the United Kingdom by President Musharraf and Foreign Minister Kasuri during the course of 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/2">Pakistan is a key partner for the UK in the campaign against terrorism. With US, UK and other international support, Pakistan has arrested over 500 terrorist suspects since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, including leaders like Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, who is suspected of planning the attacks in New York. We also welcome and encourage measures taken by the Government of Pakistan against organisations which pose a threat to Pakistan's security and to regional and international stability, including efforts to root out the Al' Qaeda and Taliban elements which continue to destabilise Afghanistan in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/3">In the political sphere we value Pakistan's membership of the UN Security Council and have welcomed their constructive contribution in that forum over the past year. We hope to continue and intensify our co-operation in the year ahead. We are also engaging with Pakistan on a whole range of regional and global issues, both bilaterally and in other international fora.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/4">We welcome recent progress in normalising relations between Pakistan and India, including the latest agreements on a ceasefire and resumption of air links. It has taken statesmanship by President Musharraf and Prime Minister Vajpayee to achieve the progress so far. This is an encouraging start to a process which we hope, with sustained efforts of both sides to address each other's legitimate concerns, will lead to the resolution of all the outstanding issues between them, including on Kashmir.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/5">Our defence relationship is deepening following the re-establishment of the UK-Pakistan Defence Co-operation Forum in early 2002. We greatly value our important and historic links with the Pakistan armed forces. We will maintain and build on this progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/6">We have an important trade relationship. The UK is the biggest foreign investor in Pakistan and the UK is the country's fifth largest export market. All this is in the context of an increasingly stable and strong macro-economic environment in Pakistan, and a government committed to liberalising reform, including privatisation. We appreciate the good work being done in this field by the Pakistan-Britain Trade and Investment Forum (PBTIF), and the Pakistan-Britain Business Advisory Group (PBBAG). The UK was also a strong supporter of the establishment of the EU/Pakistan trade agreement in later 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/7">We are also working together in the field of judicial co-operation through the Joint Judicial Co-operation Working Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/8">The UK remains committed to supporting Pakistan's long-term development. We are giving approximately &pound;70 million of development assistance this year&mdash;four times more than previously&mdash;and last week agreed to the release of an additional tranche of &pound;22.5 million in budget support for the Government of Pakistan's long-term poverty reduction strategy and the health and population welfare facility. This bilateral programme is focused on social sector development, particularly in education and health, to make a difference to the lives of those millions of Pakistanis who live in poverty. UK development assistance for Pakistan will amount to over &pound;200 million over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/9">Finally, there are of course strong community links between the UK and Pakistan. Some 800,000 people of Pakistani heritage are estimated to live in the UK. Over 85,000 Pakistanis visited the UK in 2003, including 6,000 students, and we expect this to rise to over 100,000 next year. Under normal circumstances our visa operation in Pakistan is one of the busiest in the world, and we are working hard to restore a full service following the disruption caused by terrorist threats to High Commission personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.8/1">The Department of Health has received new advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) about the use of selective Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children under the age of 18 for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).</p>
	<p pid="a.71.8/2">An expert working group of the CSM was established earlier this year to look at the safety of the whole class of SSRIs. The group has already advised on paroxetine and the related anti-depressant venlafaxine. It has now concluded that the balance of risks and benefits for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in under-18s is unfavourable for the SSRIs sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram and unassessable for fluvoxamine.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.8/3">This new advice follows announcements in June and September that paroxetine and venlafaxine should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years to treat depressive illness. Like paroxetine and venlafaxine, none of these drugs has ever been licensed for use in under-18s, but we know they are used in this age group outside licensed indications, where prescribers make a judgment on their own responsibility that it is the right treatment for a particular patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.8/4">Only fluoxetine (Prozac) was shown in clinical trials to have a positive balance of risks and benefits in the treatment of MDD in under-18s. There is no evidence to date to suggest that the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits in adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.8/5">The CSM expert group has delivered comprehensive advice on the use of SSRIs in children and young people following a thorough review of all the evidence available. This represents the most detailed review to be completed so far and gives parents, young people and those who treat these serious illnesses the information they need to make informed decisions about treatment. The expert group will now focus its attention on finishing a complete review of the safety of the entire class of medicines in adults and young adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.8/6">Communications to patients and prescribers are taking place today and copies of these materials have been placed in the Library. The benefits of taking these drugs are well established, but we know that some patients suffer significant side effects. Patients over 18 and patients who are benefiting from SSRIs should not be frightened into stopping their medication abruptly. Patients who are experiencing any side effects or are concerned about their treatment should discuss these with their doctor.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.8/7">The Government are committed to ensuring that the wider aspects of suicide prevention remain at the top of the agenda and the National Institute for Mental Health in England has made suicide prevention one of its core policy programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/2">This draft Bill sets out the Government's thinking on the terms on which any referendum on the European single currency would be held, subject to the five economic tests being met. This shows the Government's commitment to openness and transparency. Both the question and who would be able to vote in any referendum, if the five economic tests had been met, are set out in the draft Bill.</p>
