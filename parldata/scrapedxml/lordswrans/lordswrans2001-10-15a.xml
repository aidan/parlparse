	<p pid="a.72.6/1">Most parents take seriously their responsibilities towards their children. We brought in home-school agreements through the 1998 School Standards and Framework Act to ensure that all parents understood and accepted their responsibilities in relation to their children's education. All schools are required to set up home school agreements, in consultation with parents, which should make clear in non-legal terms what home and school's role and responsibilities in the education of children should be. An agreement can cover aspects like ensuring a child attends school and supporting the school in maintaining good behaviour and discipline. A school should encourage all parents (including non-resident parents) to sign this once it is agreed so they know where they stand.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.6/2">Reinforcing parental responsibility is something we have also taken action on, through introducing parenting orders. The parenting order (Section 8 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998) forms part of the drive to provide parents with increased support and to assist them in developing better parenting skills. It is not intended to punish parents but to reinforce parental responsibility. It aims to help and support parents in controlling the behaviour of their children. Parents attending counselling sessions receive assistance in improving their parenting skills and learn how to enforce consistent standards of behaviour or respond more effectively to challenging adolescent demands. They can also be required to ensure, for example, that their child goes to school every day or is home by a certain time at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.6/3">Parents have a legal duty to secure suitable full-time education for their children of compulsory school age, either by registering them at a school or by making other arrangements. If a child fails to attend their school regularly, their parents are guilty of an offence and could be liable to a fine. The courts may also impose a parenting order.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.3/1">The average waiting time information for England, as set out in the Sunday Times article, reflects the position in 1999-2000. This is the latest available information. Accurate information on waiting times for specific procedures in other countries is not available at present. A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in which we will be participating will look at this very issue. As part of the NHS Plan, by the end of 2005 no one in England will wait more than six months for admission to hospital once it has been decided that treatment is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/2">The Sunday Times article made no specific reference to gross domestic products. We are however committed to increasing health spending towards the average of the European Union and by 2003-04 health spending in this country as a proportion of GDP will increase to around 7.7 per cent. The article made no comparisons of hospital bed numbers either. However, in England last year we saw the first increase in the number of general and acute hospital beds in this country since 1971 and the largest increase since records began in 1960. This takes us a third of the way towards the NHS Plan target of 2,100 extra general and acute beds by April 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.2/1">The report's main conclusion and recommendation was that responsibility for the Royal Parks should remain with central Government and that the Royal Parks Agency (RPA) should continue to manage them, although the department should work towards establishing the Royal Parks as a non-departmental public body (NDPB). The Government accept this recommendation and would like to see early progress to the change of status to NDPB. It is the Government's intention, therefore, to establish the Royal Parks as a NDPB from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will retain responsibility for the management of the Royal Parks but will be seeking Parliament's approval of an order under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to delegate her day-to-day responsibilities to the new body. The Government have accepted all the recommendations in the report for improving the efficiency of the Royal Parks Agency. The Chief Executive has already achieved much in implementing these. This work will continue as part of the preparations for NDPB status. The Government accept the recommendation that the Royal Parks should be policed by a uniformed force. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Home Office are discussing the future relationship between the Royal Parks Constabulary and the Metropolitan Police Service so as to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective policing of the Royal Parks.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/2">The Government believe that NDPB status, with the management of the Royal Parks guided by an expert and experienced board, will provide the Royal Parks with greater freedom and focus to continue to build on the high standard of presentation of the Royal Parks which has improved even further in recent years.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">In July this year, the Government made a statement on the consultation exercise on the review of the Public Sector Ombudsmen in England. In this statement the Government reaffirmed their commitment to the renaissance of public services, improving access and delivery and driving up standards. The effective handling of complaints is an important element of this programme of renewal. But there will be times where, having pursued a complaint about a particular public service, a complainant remains dissatisfied. Such cases need to be considered independently and that role is fulfilled by, among others, the public sector ombudsmen in England that were the subject of this review. These ombudsmen comprise the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the Health Service Commissioner and the Commission for Local Administration (which comprises the three Local Government Ombudsmen and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration ex officio).</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2">In 1999, following representations from the ombudsmen, the Government announced a review to determine whether the present arrangements are in the best interest of complainants and others, against the background of moves towards more integrated public services and an increasing focus on the needs of the consumers of such services. The review team consulted widely and their report was published in April 2000. A consultation paper seeking views on the review's main recommendations and its other conclusions was published in June 2000. In all we received 174 responses to the consultation paper and copies have been placed in the Library of the House together with a statement of the Government's conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/3">Briefly, these are that, in light of the responses received to the consultation paper, the Government are satisfied that there is broad support for the review's main recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/4">We therefore intend to replace the existing arrangements by a unified and flexible ombudsman body for central and local government and the National Health Service (excluding NHS Pensions, which will continue to fall under the jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman, established by Part X of the Pensions Schemes Act 1993 (as amended). In line with the review's recommendations, there will be direct access to this new body irrespective of whether the complaint is concerned wholly or in part with a central government body. Furthermore, and again in line with the review's recommendations, the new body will have a collegiate structure within which the individual ombudsmen are identified with a particular group of the bodies under jurisdiction but free to carry out crosscutting investigations. Proposals for the precise powers and accountability of the new body, and on whether its jurisdiction should be extended beyond the bodies subject to the jurisdiction of the existing ombudsmen, will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">We have no plans to revise the targets: i) that all government services should be available electronically by 2005; and ii) for the UK to have the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/2">On broadband, we have asked the stakeholder group to advise us on the quantifiable measures by which we should measure progress towards our broadband target. We have received a progress report from the stakeholder group which recommends setting up indices to compare price, competition, coverage, addressable market and take-up.
