Our ambassador in Bahrain raised our concerns when he met the Bahraini Minister for Justice on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-04">4 May</phrase>. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also issued a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April</phrase> condemning the original sentencing of four protestors. We support Bahrain's right to bring to justice those responsible for the death of two policemen. However it is our long-standing policy to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances. It undermines human dignity, there is no conclusive evidence of its deterrent value, and any miscarriage of justice leading to its imposition is irreversible and irreparable. We will continue to oppose its use in Bahrain.</p>

We subsequently invited MSI to represent independent sector abortion providers and they have accepted. At the same time, we took the opportunity to review the membership of the forum and agreed to invite LIFE and the Association of Directors of Social Services to join.</p>
