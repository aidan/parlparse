	Armed Forces: DDA Exemption
</minor-heading>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-05-12a.179.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100844" speakername="Baroness Taylor of Bolton" colon=":" colnum="179"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90512w0001.htm#09051245000003">
	<p pid="a.179.2/1">The Armed Forces have an exemption from the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) because all service personnel need to be combat effective in order to meet a worldwide liability to deploy. This means that everyone who joins the Armed Forces undergoes a rigorous selection and initial training process to ensure that they can withstand the hardship and challenges of military service.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">The Armed Forces do not allow units to have a protected role or reduced commitment, which means that everyone is liable to deploy and to fight anywhere in the world, even if only in self-defence. Accordingly, the MoD has concluded that it is essential that exemptions from domestic and international disability legislation are retained. For this reason the Armed Forces' exemption from the DDA has been replicated in the Equality Bill. This is required to ensure the continued combat effectiveness of the Armed Forces, as decisions on operational effectiveness must be taken by MoD Ministers, accountable to Parliament and based on military advice, not by the courts. The Armed Forces must be able to determine and set their own standards, based on the tasks to be performed. The Government do not expect the rationale for the exemption from the DDA to change, hence there are no plans to remove this exemption.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/3">The Armed Forces perform a role which is fundamentally different from those of other organisations, such as the police and the fire services. All service personnel are weapons-trained and need to be able to respond to the uniquely harsh realities and complexities of warfare. This involves deployment overseas and prolonged working in stressful situations and arduous environments. Service in the police and the fire services is intrinsically different, not least because there is no requirement for everyone to be weapons-trained, or to serve overseas for prolonged periods. The Government do not consider that a direct comparison can be drawn between service in such disparate organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.3/1">All foster carers receive an allowance from their fostering service provider to meet the costs of caring for children placed with them. The Government introduced a national minimum allowance in 2007. A Fostering Network survey conducted in October 2008 showed that all but nine fostering service providers are paying their carers at least the national minimum allowance. A further six providers have subsequently confirmed that they would pay their carers at least the national minimum allowance from April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.3/2">Over and above this minimum, it is for fostering service providers to determine their payments in light of their particular circumstances. We will be expecting providers to publish details of the way in which their payment systems are structured so that this is transparent to carers.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.6/1">The school and college achievement and attainment tables provide a reliable source of comparative information to help focus the debate on standards and strengthen the accountability of schools and colleges. It follows that the indicators of performance at the end of key stage 4 must be based on performance in comparable examinations. This means that for inclusion in the tables qualifications must first be accredited by Ofqual as meeting certain standards and be subject to regulation to ensure those standards are maintained. International GCSEs (iGCSEs) have not been submitted to Ofqual for accreditation by the awarding bodies concerned and so cannot be considered for inclusion in the tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/2">Once accredited, qualifications for use in maintained schools must also be approved for funding under Section 96 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. The achievement and attainment tables only recognise qualifications which have been approved under Section 96 because it is unlawful for maintained schools to offer other qualifications. While independent schools can legally offer qualifications which are not approved under Section 96, these are not recognised in the tables because to do so would mean that the tables would not be comparing performance across a common set of qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/3">In the key performance indicator showing the number of pupils achieving five A*-C GCSEs or equivalent, including GCSEs in English and mathematics, we specify GCSEs in these core subjects because they have been accredited by Ofqual as meeting the statutory requirements of the national curriculum. Ofqual has not determined whether iGCSEs meet these requirements because they have not been submitted for accreditation. However, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) conducted a comparability study into the extent to which iGCSEs met GCSE criteria and corresponding programmes of study required for use in England, the results of which are available on Ofqual's website at <a href="http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/309.aspx">www.ofqual.gov.uk/309.aspx</a>. This found that, for example, the iGCSE in English literature includes no prescribed reading to meet the requirement to study Shakespeare.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/4">The QCA is responsible for the methodology for establishing the relative value of qualifications reported in the achievement and attainment tables and the points awarded to those qualifications. Their system was designed as a measure of a school's effort and effectiveness in teaching these qualifications. UCAS's system, on the other hand, was designed as a measure of students' preparedness for higher education.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">As the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, stated on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-28">28 April 2009</phrase>, the Constitutional Renewal Bill is scheduled for introduction before the Summer Recess. The Bill will include provisions to place the present arrangements for parliamentary scrutiny of treaties on a statutory footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/2">The development and operation of mechanisms outside the proposed legislation to enhance Parliament's ability to scrutinise treaties is ultimately a matter for Parliament itself. The Government will endeavour to respond positively to whichever additional methods Parliament wishes to pursue.</p>
