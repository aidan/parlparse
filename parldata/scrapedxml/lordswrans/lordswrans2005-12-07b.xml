	<p pid="b.100.3/1">The ability of a commanding officer to dismiss a charge is separate from the power to deal summarily with the charge. Dismissal of a charge will occur without any hearing taking place, and the effect of a dismissal is not an acquittal. It does, however, prevent any further action against the person charged within the military system. But, as there has been no hearing of the evidence and no acquittal, it does not prevent the exercise of a civilian jurisdiction, if that applies to the offence in question.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.5/1">At the world summit in September, UN member states committed themselves to achieving universal access to reproductive health by 2015, as set out in the programme for action agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994. It is DfID's view that we cannot achieve the millenium development goals (MDGs) and improve poor people's lives without also pursuing the key ICPD goal of reproductive health. DfID is working to ensure that reproductive health is better reflected in the MDG framework of targets and monitoring indicators.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.5/2">The UK Government believe that sexual and reproductive health is a fundamental human right and therefore UK assistance aims to support countries to provide choice and improve people's access to good quality information and services. We believe that men and women should be able to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.5/3">The UN estimates that over 130 million women globally have an unmet need for contraception but do not have adequate access to good quality reproductive health and family planning services. Many millions lack access to barrier methods such as condoms which also offer protection from HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. DfID remains firmly committed to achieving the target of universal access to reproductive health by 2015, and indeed the UK worked hard to ensure that this target was clearly reflected in the September summit outcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.5/4">DfID provides support to the work of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the International Planned Parenthood Foundation (IPPF), as well as to other organisations in the population and sexual and reproductive health field promoting choice. Both the UNFPA and the IPFF work to promote reproductive health and family planning, including HIV prevention services, and we currently provide &pound;80 million over four years to the UNFPA and &pound;19.5 million to the IPFF for 2004&ndash;06. At country level, DfID is funding projects such as Promoting Sexual and Reproductive Health for HIV/AIDS Reduction in Nigeria (&pound;52.8 million), promoting the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Poor People in Malawi (&pound;23.3 million) and provision of reproductive health contraceptive supplies as part of a wider Reproductive Health Programme in Nepal (&pound;1 million).</p>
	<p pid="b.106.5/5">DfID also provides significant support for reproductive health commodities including condoms, through its country programmes focusing on HIV prevention, and for wider reproductive health services through our support for health system strengthening. For the past 10 years, DfID has been the fourth largest provider of condoms, supporting the distribution of about 150 million condoms annually in countries such as Bolivia, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa. We are currently looking at a sustainable long-term response to reproductive health commodity shortages with other donors, in order to provide a more predictable basis for the funding and availability of these essential supplies.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.5/6">DfID also supports an extensive portfolio of research and research partnerships encompassing the development of new contraception, microbicides and HIV vaccines, policy and operations research into the links between sexual and reproductive health and HIV programmes, population issues, maternal and neonatal health issues, preventing mother to child transmission of HIV and the promotion of reproductive rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.2/1">Following publication of the analysis of responses to the public consultation on the smoke-free elements of the Health Bill on <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>, the Department of Health was approached by Smokefree Liverpool which was concerned that no specific mention of its campaign had been made in the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/2">Immediately on receiving this message, the department gave a commitment that it would check all the responses received and check that responses from Smokefree Liverpool had been fully taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/3">As soon as that check is complete, I will write to the noble Lord with a full Answer to his Questions, and <a href="/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/51207wa1.pdf">/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/51207wa1.pdf</a> will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.0/1">The Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 allows waste cooking oil to be recovered in biodiesel, biogas, composting and rendering plants. It can also be burned in suitably approved power stations to generate electricity and may also go for use by the oleochemical industry. The legislation also allows cooking oil to be used in pet food. Used cooking oils from manufacturing premises, and fresh or unused cooking oil, can continue to be used in animal feed.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/2">There is a duty of care under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to dispose of waste responsibly. Waste cooking oil must not be poured down drains or sewers as this leads to blockages and odour or vermin problems and may also pollute watercourses leading to problems for wildlife. Nor should waste cooking oil be disposed of with catering or kitchen waste.</p>
