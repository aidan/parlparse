	<p pid="a.59.5/1">The Supreme Court (Offices) Act 1997 repealed the provision in the Supreme Court Act 1981, which set out the qualification for appointment as, and tenure of office of, Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor and Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. The 1997 Act also contained a saving provision to preserve the tenure of the then holder of the offices. He retired in 1998. Having effected the repeal, and now that the saving provision is spent, the 1997 Act has achieved its purpose and it is unnecessary for it to remain in the statute book. The repeal of the 1997 Act by the Statute Law (Repeals) Bill has no effect on the current holder of the offices.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">The National Centre for Policing Excellence (NCPE) is part of Centrex, the Central Police Training and Development Authority. The chief executive of Centrex has advised us that the net expenditure of NCPE in 2003&ndash;04 will be approximately &pound;12.1 million. The Centrex budget for 2004&ndash;05 is not yet finalised. NCPE currently operates from several Centrex sites:</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/2" class="indent">Bramshill: operational support to the police service, and serious crime analysis. Wyboston: training in specialist law enforcement techniques. Cambourne: doctrine development.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/3">From April 2004, reorganisation within Centrex will incorporate within NCPE training in scientific support, which is based near Durham, and training in the use of the police national computer, currently based in Leicester.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/4">The Centrex board decided in 2003 that co-location of the work on doctrine development, operational support and specialist law enforcement training would be important for the long-term effectiveness of NCPE. The available accommodation at Bramshill is not suitable or adequate to house all NCPE functions. A relocation project has been considering whether all or part of the work currently carried out at Bramshill should be moved to the same location as the work on doctrine development. The various options are currently under review. No final decisions have yet been taken about the number of staff who might be relocated.</p>

The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 is likely to provide a remedy for late payment if the contract is a commercial contract for the supply of services.</p>

Many United Kingdom consumers wish to have this information to support their food choices and the Government believe that such labelling would also benefit UK meat producers.

	<p pid="a.63.6/1">(a) The total moneys paid into the scheme and interest earned thereon; Total moneys &pound;53,150,000 interest &pound;847,309.66 (b) The expenses to date of running the scheme; &pound;4,764,983.70 (including legal fees and trustees' fees) (c) The total paid to claimants; Total &pound;26,598,248.06 (d) The total committed to be paid to claimants; The compensation scheme provides for payments to be made in respect of 250 cases, up to a maximum of &pound;55 million. This sum includes all the costs of running the scheme. On top of the &pound;55 million trust fund, the Government made provision for payments of an additional &pound;50,000 to each victim or their family in the first 250 cases. (e) The amounts expected to be paid to claimants by the end of 2004, and at the termination of the scheme in total and under each of paragraphs 3.1, 5.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 of the scheme and otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/2">It is difficult for the trustees to predict the amounts to be paid to claimants by the end of 2004 as they do not know how many new claims will be presented.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/3">Paragraph 3.1 of the trust deed refers to the basic sum payments of &pound;120,000 or &pound;125,000 (depending on when the diagnosis was first suspected). Paragraph 4.1 of the trust deed refers to the &pound;5,000 or &pound;10,000 payments for the experience of the family. As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-16">16 December 2003</phrase> (the most recent meeting of the trustees), there were 143 victims. Main applications have been received in relation to about 133 cases. By the end of the trustees' last meeting, the trustees had considered a total of 129 claims in full (excluding payments from the discretionary trust other than for care). Payments have been made in the vast majority of those 129 claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/4">Paragraph 5.5 of the trust deed refers to the victim's loss of earnings which cause particular hardship. The trustees do not know at this stage how many claims will be put forward under this category.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/5">Paragraph 4.2 of the trust deed refers to non-qualifying carers. Only a small number of claims for care have been paid to non-qualifying carers, such as boyfriends or girlfriends of young victims who have been involved in care. Carers qualify usually under a separate category, such as spouse.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/6">Paragraph 4.3 of the trust deed refers to an award of &pound;5,000 for psychiatric injury and further amounts for particular financial or emotional hardship. Information provided to the trustees from the families' legal representatives indicates that:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/7" class="indent">The total number of claimants to date is 183 in relation to 73 victims. All of these claimants are claiming (or have claimed) the &pound;5,000 award.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/8" class="indent">Of these, 103 claims have been approved for &pound;5,000 payments and therefore 80 of the &pound;5,000 claims are outstanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/9" class="indent">Of the 183 claimants, 55 are claiming financial hardship, 10 are claiming emotional hardship, and a further 13 are claiming both.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/10" class="indent">The trustees are waiting clarification from 55 claimants (via their legal representatives) as to whether they will be pursuing hardship claims.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.0/1">The ECGD has opened negotiations with the Cuban authorities regarding ECGD support for a line of credit to finance the export of UK capital goods and associated services to Cuba under the department's &quot;good projects in difficult markets&quot; (GPDM) scheme. ECGD has recently indicated an approximate premium rate to the Cubans following a preliminary appraisal of all of the risks, which was carried out in accordance with ECGD's standard risk assessment methodology for GPDM transactions. This appraisal included an examination of the inherent project and country risks, the proposed security structure and the arrangements for purchase of the project deliverables. For any specific exports under the lines of credit, ECGD will carry out its normal business principles due diligence on the impacts of both the exports and the associated project.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/2">ECGD's policy is to match premium to risk and not to seek to match the rates of other export credit agencies (ECAs).</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/3">Discussions with the Cubans are continuing.</p>
