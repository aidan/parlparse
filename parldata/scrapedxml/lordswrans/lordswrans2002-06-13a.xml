	<p pid="a.43.2/1">Inter-agency guidance on the strategic management of complex child abuse investigations is published today in response to Recommendation 22 of Lost in Care, the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the abuse of children in care in the former county council areas of Gwynedd and Clwyd since 1974.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/2">This new guidance builds on the key principles for investigating organised or multiple abuse set out in the Government's child protection guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children, published in 1999. It has been developed by an inter-agency working group, chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers, which drew together the experience of a number of police forces, local authorities and voluntary organisations which have been closely involved in undertaking complex child abuse investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/3">The guidance is aimed primarily at the police and social services. It focuses on the specific issues highlighted in Recommendation 22 of access to records and information-sharing, and it also provides practical advice on key inter-agency issues such as setting up and closing an investigation, victim and witness support and media handling. The guidance also addresses concerns raised by those who have questioned the investigative methods used in inquiries, including the methods used to contact potential witnesses and the treatment of alleged offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/4">Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.8/1">The Government have held a number of meetings with Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man to discuss the EU tax package.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.8/2">The authorities in Jersey and Guernsey have recently announced that they intend to recommend to their respective Parliaments that they should move to exchange of information on savings income.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.8/3">In announcing the decision in Jersey, the President of Jersey's Policy and Resources Committee, Senator Pierre Horsfall, said, ''We believe that the impact of this change on our economy is likely to be negligible and that our customers will welcome the certainty this will provide looking forward''.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.8/4">In announcing the decision in Guernsey, the States Supervisor said, ''It is also in the Island's best long-term economic interests since it protects both our finance industry's competitiveness and the Island's reputation as a responsible and co-operative jurisdiction''.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.8/5">The Government do not believe that further analysis would add anything useful, but are always willing to discuss issues with the Islands.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.8/6">The effect on the economies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man of adopting the principles of the Code of Conduct on Business Taxation would depend on the nature of the tax changes introduced to replace the current harmful features. The purpose of the Code of Conduct on Business Taxation is to remove practices that distort competition, and in particular those that discriminate against residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.8/7">Regarding the City of London, the Government's support for the draft Directive on Savings followed extensive discussions with interests in the City, which indicated clearly that an approach based on exchange of information rather than a withholding tax was the right way to proceed. The Government introduced legislation in 2000 requiring details of UK savings income of EU residents to be collected and reported to the Inland Revenue. And the UK has no tax measures considered to have harmful features by the report of <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-29">29 November 1999</phrase> of the Code of Conduct Group on Business Taxation.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.0/1">Following the delay to the voluntary immunisation programme against anthrax that was caused by difficulties at the Centre for Applied Microbiological Research which was supplying the vaccine, the programme was re-launched for personnel deployed to the Gulf in May 2001. But continuing uncertainty over the licensing of future supplies meant that it was not extended further to other members of the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/2">The problems over the licensing of future supplies have now been resolved and the Ministry of Defence took delivery of the rest of the supplies that are required at the end of March this year. We are confident that there will be no difficulties with the future, large-scale production of the vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/3">It takes six months for immunisation against anthrax to become fully effective. But we may not have nearly so much warning of a change in the threat, nor of the requirement for British Armed Forces to deploy to a high threat area. Given that we cannot expect to predict exactly where or when a threat might arise, or which units of the Armed Forces might be called upon to respond, we have decided to expand the immunisation programme so that all service personnel, including reserves, and those essential civilians who are likely to deploy on operations are routinely offered immunisation against anthrax. We plan to expand the programme gradually over the next few years, beginning with those units that are held at the highest readiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/4">Immunisation against anthrax is safe and effective. As before, and in keeping with long-standing medical practice, it will be offered to personnel on the basis of voluntary informed consent. By accepting it alongside their other defensive measures, this will ensure that they have the very best protection against anthrax used as a biological weapon.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.3/1">At our Meeting in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase>, NATO defence Ministers approved a series of changes to SFOR and KFOR following the Joint Operational Area (JOA) Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/2">The Review advocates a regional approach to NATO's peacekeeping operations in the Balkans, whereby both Bosnia and Kosovo will be treated for military planning purposes as a single theatre. The security situation in the Balkans has changed since the initial deployment of SFOR and KFOR. NATO's operations will be restructured accordingly to provide a smaller, lighter and more flexible force that will be better able to meet current challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/3">Implementation of the JAO Review will take place over the next 12 months. It is planned that by the end of 2002 SFOR will reduce from some 18,000 to some 12,000 personnel and KFOR from some 38,000 to some 32,000. By June 2003, it is envisaged that KFOR will reduce further to some 29,000 troops. Responsibilities for support of civil implementation will be transferred to local authorities and other international organisations, as appropriate. The United Kingdom welcomes the outcome of this review.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/4">This reduction in troop numbers does not signal any reduction in NATO's commitment to the Balkans. Rather, these changes are a sign of the alliance's achievements to date in bringing security and stabililty to the Balkans.

	<p pid="a.48.5/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has decided to merge the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA), to take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>. The regulation of medicines and of medical devices are separate fields, working to different legislation, but as technology develops there are likely to be growing numbers of products that cross the borderline between medicines and devices. Most other European countries have gone down the path of managing these responsibilities in a single organisation, as has the United States. We want to build on the excellence of both organisations in the protection of public health and ensure that the new agency is well placed to respond to change and retain the UK's leading position.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.5/2">The post of chief executive will be filled through open competition. The new organisation will also have improved governance arrangements, with non-executive members on the board and a new post of chairman, whom we expect to be an authoritative figure able not only to chair the board and oversee its work but also to represent the organisation and its decisions in public.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/1">Government procurement policy is to obtain value for money having due regard to propriety and regularity. Value for money is defined as &quot;the optimum combination of whole life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to meet the customer's requirement&quot;. Sustainable development objectives, including policies aimed at reducing adverse environmental impacts, are pursued within the framework of this procurement policy and the EC procurement rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/2">Government departments have been required since 1990 to operate procurement strategies that take into account the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions. This means drafting contract specifications (including for production processes) that reflect government objectives; selecting suppliers that have the technical capacity to meet the environmental criteria specified; and awarding contracts to the bids that offer the best combination of quality and whole life costs for the contracting authority. Whole life costs will include, for example, energy consumed over the life of the product or service and disposal costs. Incorporating environmental criteria into procurement is explained in a note published jointly by HM Treasury and the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions in 1998 and may be viewed on the Office of Government Commerce website. Detailed guidance on government policy and specific environmental criteria may be found in the Green Guide for Buyers&mdash;URL: <a href="http://defraweb/environment/greening/greenpro/greenpro.htm">http://defraweb/environment/greening/greenpro/greenpro.htm</a>.</p>
