This is because applications can also request consent to dispose of a number of individual plots within a remaining site. One of the criteria for consent is that adequate alternative provision will be made for displaced plot holders, or that such provision is not necessary or is impracticable.</p>

These beds are part of a total of 120 hostel beds for patients whose condition (trauma or less serious musculoskeletal problem) allows them to be independent of nursing.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.6/6">Our contingency plans for Headley Court include greater use of the 15 non-ward bed spaces mentioned above, for those patients whose clinical condition allows.

The guidance will demonstrate how these issues can be addressed in relevant aspects of the curriculum.

	<p pid="a.226.9/1">A review of the public information programme was undertaken during the early adopter phase of the summary care record (SCR) programme so that the lessons from that phase could be learnt, and the programme updated, ahead of national rollout of the SCR. Research and interviews conducted provided the basis for an updated SCR public information programme toolkit, which was published in June 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.9/2">As a result of the review the process to opt out of having a SCR was made easier. Information to inform patients' choices is accessible and is available in a wide range of languages and formats, including large print, easy read, audio and Braille. Patients can also telephone a dedicated National Health Service care records service information line for advice, where translation services are available for patients for whom English is not their first language.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.6/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what is the distribution of benefits by income decile to married couples with children under three. (HL2843).</p>
	<p pid="a.232.6/4">Table 1 shows the average cash benefits received by two adult households with children, by equivalised disposable income decile groups in 2007-08, the latest period for which data are available. Figures for married couples and for households with children aged less than three are unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.6/5">These estimates are based on data collected through the Expenditure and Food Survey, which has a sample size of approximately 6,100 households. When taking a sub-sample and then breaking down into decile groups, the new sub-samples become quite small. Therefore, caution should be exercised when drawing any conclusions from these estimates.</p>
