	<p pid="a.401.3/1">The Government are deeply concerned by the reported breakdown of a ceasefire agreement between the Burmese army and the Shan State Army North which has led to renewed conflict in Shan State. Reports indicate that the fighting is taking place in the north-central area of Shan State, about 110 miles from the nearest Chinese border town and around 200 miles from the border with Thailand. Access to this area is tightly controlled by the Burmese Government and an assessment of the situation is therefore difficult. At this time, we have received no reports of associated refugee flows in border areas. However, reports suggest that fighting has resulted in around 3,000 people being internally displaced.

	<p pid="a.407.0/1">Nexia Solutions was a subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL), which focused on research and development. In 2008, it was transferred out of BNFL under the Energy Act Transfer Scheme to form the National Nuclear Laboratory, which is an independent company, owned wholly by Her Majesty's Government and is operated as a commercial entity under the management of a consortium led by Serco. The assessment referred to in (<I>WA 157</I>) was a position paper produced entirely by the NNL at its own initiative. While it is assumed that the technical expertise retained by the NNL from Nexia has underpinned the opinions in the paper, no assessment of the paper has been undertaken by my department.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/2">As noted in the Answer to your Question of <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-26">26 April 2011</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has asked the NNL to conduct further analysis of the wider benefits of next generation reactor designs and to compare the use of thorium and uranium fuels in them. This study includes assessments of safety, radio-toxicological hazard, scale, economics, and outstanding technical barriers. Molten salt reactors, within which category liquid thorium fluoride reactors fall, are one of the reactor designs being considered. We are expecting the findings of this study to be available by the end of the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/3">The Government support relevant R&amp;D into nuclear technologies through a range of mechanisms and organisations, including universities and research councils, the National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and others. Any future R&amp;D on liquid thorium fluoride reactors would be done through these organisations. Findings of the NNL's forthcoming study and the position of potential international partners on this technology would be expected to inform any decision to support any new R&amp;D.</p>

The FGM Act 2003 replaced the 1985 Act in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and made it an offence for the first time for UK nationals or permanent UK residents to carry out FGM abroad, or to aid, abet, counsel or procure the carrying out of FGM abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.408.8/5">Prevention is at the heart of the Government's approach. In February 2011 we launched multi-agency practice guidelines for front-line professionals such as teachers, GPs and nurses.

Central to the report's recommendation is that future research should compare the effects of fluoridation in an intervention area with a control area. This can best be achieved where a new area is to be fluoridated. South Central Strategic Health Authority has decided to fluoridate Southampton and part of south west Hampshire and we will consider, if the scheme goes ahead, whether it would be a suitable model for this research. We would need to ensure that the setting of the research criteria took account of research studies published since the York report, including the United States National Research Council report.</p>

	<p pid="a.416.3/1">We are aware that in March 2011 the Israeli district court agreed that work on the western part of the wall surrounding Al-Walaja should stop until June 2011 while archaeological work was completed. Since then, the lawyer representing the village council has submitted a petition to the administrative committee responsible asking for objections to be heard about the expropriation order confiscating land in Al Walaja. This is still pending.</p>

The villagers' lawyer succeeded in securing a court decision to prevent the demolitions being carried out within 72 hours against all seven houses. The court deferred the orders for seven days pending a response from the Ministry of Interior to the points raised by the lawyer.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.3/4">The court will decide either to uphold or overturn the appeal on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>. This remains an issue of concern and we will continue to watch developments closely.

	<p pid="a.417.0/1">Liberia has made important progress in recent years as it strives to recover from the effects of the civil war. Investment is increasing and the Government have expressed their commitment to continued reform to encourage private sector-led economic revitalisation. In 2009 Liberia improved 10 places (149 out of 183) in the International Finance Corporation's &quot;Doing Business&quot; survey. As a sign of this improvement a UK-Liberia investment forum will be taking place in London in June. Elections later this year will be a critical milestone for Liberia on its path to stability. A key recent challenge for Liberia has been dealing with the influx of over 180,000 refugees from the Cote d'Ivoire. The British Government have given &#163;9 million to humanitarian agencies in Liberia to provide refugees with food, shelter and basic services.</p>

NATO vessels are fully aware of their responsibilities with regard to the International Maritime Law regarding Safety Of Life At Sea. Indeed, in two incidents in late March 2011, NATO vessels successfully rescued over 500 refugees and handed them over to the Italian authorities. NATO is working with the commercial shipping industry and with regional authorities to ensure that these do their part in rendering assistance to refugees at sea. In addition to monitoring maritime radio distress frequencies, ships maintain a constant lookout for vessels and if they see a vessel in trouble will do what they can to render assistance. NATO ships have procedures for these types of incidents, ranging from a co-ordinating rescue function to emergency medical treatment and provision of food and water.</p>

	<p pid="a.426.0/1">(a) This information about the number of ships that travelled through British waters is not collated. (b) Statistics for 2010 are not yet available. However in 2009, a total of 8,045 different ships of over 100 gross tonnes called at UK ports. These accounted for a total of 139,365 individual port calls. (c) In 2010 there were 1699 port state control (PSC) inspections of foreign flagged-ships calling at UK ports.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/2">As part of the PSC inspection, state issued certificates attesting that adequate compulsory insurance is in force for civil liability for oil pollution damage and civil liability for bunker oil pollution damage are checked for validity. In 2010 there were 12 instances where a deficiency was recorded against these certificates. However, no enforcement action was taken as these deficiencies were subsequently rectified to the satisfaction of the inspectors.</p>

We recognise the urgency with which a settlement in Yemen must be reached to avoid further violence and a deepening economic and humanitarian crisis. To this end we have actively engaged our international partners, including the EU and the United States of America, to encourage unified and strong messaging to the Government of Yemen and the parliamentary opposition.</p>
