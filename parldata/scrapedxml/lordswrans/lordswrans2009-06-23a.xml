	<p pid="a.267.6/2">The FSA has published a code of practice on remuneration, which it intends to add to the FSA handbook; the code is currently being consulted on and the FSA aims to have it in place for firms' 2009 remuneration review processes.

Neither the FSA's work nor the Walker review are intended to dictate the quantum of remuneration, either for individuals or at the level of groups or institutions. This remains a matter for the boards and management, accountable to the institution's shareholders. Institutional shareholders are expected to take an active interest in the design and effectiveness of remuneration practices as part of fulfilling their stewardship responsibility to their clients.</p>

There are approximately 9,300 overbridges owned and maintained by Network Rail, not all of which carry primary route network (PRN) roads.</p>

For older bridges there has been a large programme of structural assessment followed by strengthening of bridges where necessary. Total costs are estimated to be about &pound;777 million overall, including an allowance for future costs. Expenditure to the end of 2007 was about &pound;651 million from this total estimate.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.3/4">The management of the local road network in England, including maintenance of its bridges, is the responsibility of local highway authorities.
