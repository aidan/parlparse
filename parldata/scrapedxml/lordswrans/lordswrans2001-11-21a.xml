We are leading the way in ensuring that the public sector sets the pace in promoting race equality and diversity both within its own workforce and in the delivery of its services. The provisions contained in the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, in particular the duty placed on public bodies to promote race equality, represent a key component of the Government's work to encourage greater equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/2">The second annual report (published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-14">14 November</phrase>) on progress towards meeting the Home Secretary's employment targets for the recruitment, retention and career progression of minority ethnic staff within the Home Office and its service areas confirmed that representation of minority ethnic staff has increased since the previous report last October.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/3">The Government have also published (in February 2001) their second set of race equality indicators in public services and the third edition is likely to be published in February/March 2002. These indicators are designed to provide a robust performance management system for public bodies to use in monitoring their progress towards race equality.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.5/1">Making Punishments Work, the report of a review of the sentencing framework undertaken by John Halliday, and known as the Halliday Report, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-05">5 July</phrase> and responses were invited by <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-31">31 October</phrase>. The report was sent to a large number of individuals and organisations and a series of meetings was held with members of the public and representatives of the judiciary and other bodies to encourage consideration of the report and obtain views.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/2">In order to encourage wider public involvement in the debate, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary launched the Fairer Sentencing website which contained a quiz, a facility to e-mail views and an on-line debating provision. In addition, debate was stimulated in local, regional and national media and honourable Members were encouraged to initiate discussion in their constituencies. A number of conferences have also been convened.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/3">The level of interest and response has been considerable. Over 120 detailed responses have been received from individuals or organisations with connections to the criminal justice system and even more from members of the public by letter or e-mail or through the debating channel. In addition, the website received 33,482 page hits, the home page was visited 5,831 times, 2,839 copies of the layman's summary of the Halliday Review were downloaded, 1,171 copies of the Home Secretary's speech on sentencing reform were downloaded and 1,226 people completed the quiz on the website. This has been a unique opportunity to hold a public consultation on the point of sentencing and many members of the public have offered their own suggestions and alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/4">There has been almost unanimous support for the need for change to the present sentencing framework, accompanied by a strong message that the change should be done well, properly resourced and then allowed to stand the test of time. There has also been broad support for the general thrust of the proposals, in particular the need for radical changes in the approach to short prison sentences. There is widespread recognition that it is unacceptable to have no supervision for an individual leaving a short prison sentence and that there are many opportunities for improving the effectiveness of both a prison sentence and a community sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/5">There has also been considerable support for greater transparency in sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/6">There has been mixed support for the greater involvement of the courts in the management of sentences through review hearings. Many commentators have seen the strength of the arguments in terms of principle but have expressed doubts about whether the enormous practical difficulties could be overcome sufficiently well to justify that intervention in every case.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/7">Officials are now analysing the responses in greater detail and a summary of the responses will be published, with copies in the Library, towards the end of January 2002. We then anticipate publishing a White Paper in spring 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.5/1">The Clansman family of radios and ancillaries remains the main tactical radio communications system operated by the UK Armed Forces and continues to meet the requirement it was delivered against in the 1970s. Clansman was originally due to go out of service in 1995 but will now remain fully supported until Bowman's in-service date (ISD) of 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/2">The limitations of Clansman are well recognised, which is why Bowman will replace it. Obsolescence is an acknowledged problem with equipment of this age and work continues to predict and address such issues. There are contracts in place with all of the equipment design authorities in support of this activity. Procedures are in place to ensure agreed levels of availability.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/3">The procurement of up to 45,000 personal role radios (PRR) was separated from the main Bowman requirement in October 1999 to ensure delivery of these radios to the front line earlier than would otherwise have been the case. PRR is a new capability consisting of a short-range radio designed to facilitate communications within sections and other small military teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/4">Deliveries of PRR began on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-23">23 July 2001</phrase>, ahead of schedule. The system was accepted into service on <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-16">16 August 2001</phrase> and deployed with the Royal Marines on Exercise Saif Sareea. On current plans we expect to achieve formal ISD by the end of the year, some three months earlier than the declared ISD of March 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">The Royal Air Force calendar has been produced jointly by the Directorate of Recruiting and Selection (RAF) and the Directorate of Corporate Communication (RAF) for a number of years as a tool to assist in recruiting and as a means of highlighting the work of the Royal Air Force. Distribution of the calendar is carefully targeted at selected individuals and organisations and the popularity of the product is such that demand always considerably exceeds supply. The RAF calendar has been made available to both the House of Commons and House of Lords for a number of years, with a bulk delivery being distributed internally by staff in Parliament. This method of distribution has now been changed to an individual basis to ensure more effective delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/2">For 2002, the Royal Air Force produced 50,000 calendars at a total cost of &pound;62,633; a unit cost of &pound;1.25p. The quality of the Royal Air Force calendar has been maintained at a high level while production costs have been reduced; for example the 1996 calendar carried a unit cost of &pound;1.65. Postal distribution for the calendar is undertaken by the Defence Storage and Distribution Centre at Llangennech, utilising the Royal Mail at a second-class rate of 43p. The total cost of distribution to the Members of both Houses is &pound;2,256.24.</p>

Thus commitments made at the time of contract let (on which workshare will be based) will be binding for the production phase also. A partner nation could subsequently reduce its offtake but it would then have to compensate the remaining partners so that there is no increase in cost to them. In addition, where the partners are members of OCCAR (the joint armaments agency that is to manage the A400M programme), the principle of global balance will offer the possibility for re-balancing workshare between the relevant member nations over the range of OCCAR managed programmes.

	<p pid="a.145.7/1">Assessment work on the new carrier project began in November 1999 when contracts were awarded to two competing consortia headed by BAE Systems and Thales Naval Ltd. The first stage of the assessment was completed in June this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.7/2">Since then officials have been working to determine the most efficient and cost-effective way forward for the remainder of the Assessment Phase, taking into account the views of both consortia about the amount of work required to minimise the level of risk in the CVF programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.7/3">On the basis of that work, contracts have been signed today for both BAE Systems and Thales Naval Ltd to proceed to Stage 2 of the CVF assessment phase.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.7/4">For the next 12 months, until November 2002, the competing consortia will concentrate on refining their designs and on taking key trade-off decisions. During this period, there will be a continuous assessment of the two consortia's work, leading to an announcement of a single preferred prime contractor in early 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.7/5">The preferred consortia will then continue assessment work through the summer of 2003 in order to provide the robust cost, time and performance information needed to make the main investment decision. This will allow us to make a decision to place a formal build contract in early 2004. The selected prime contractor will be expected to maintain the time, cost and performance proposals agreed at the end of the assessment phase. Following the announcement of a preferred contractor, there will be maximum competition at the sub-contractor level to ensure that robust prices are achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.7/6">This approach reflects a sensible revision to the original procurement approach envisaged for the future carrier project. By applying smart procurement principles, it will help to ensure the maximum potential for competition throughout the remainder of the assessment phase. It will ensure that we achieve best value for money for the taxpayer. As part of the new approach, we will make around a further &pound;20 million available to the contractors during the assessment phase.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.7/7">The in-service dates of the two new carriers remain unchanged at 2012 and 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.7/8">Both BAE Systems and Thales have welcomed this new approach which demonstrates innovative thinking to deliver value for money. It re-affirms in the strongest possible terms this Government's commitment to ensuring that our Armed Forces are equipped with battle-winning equipment. Combined with the future joint combat aircraft, the carriers will provide the UK with a formidable force projection capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.5/1">The Government maintain close links with the insurance industry to help ensure continued availability of affordable flood cover. There is an agreement among Association of British Insurers (ABI) member companies that they will continue to provide flood cover, except in exceptional circumstances, for domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure during 2001 and 2002. Cases where there is an alleged breach of this agreement have been referred by DEFRA to the ABI for investigation. However, it must be recognised that insurance companies need to take a commercial decision as to what risk they will cover and on what terms. Also, the insurance industry is a competitive one and customers may need to shop around to obtain the best deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/2">My honourable friends the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Commons) and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury met the ABI on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-05">5 September</phrase> to discuss our mutual aim of ensuring that affordable flood insurance cover continues to be generally available after December 2002. Further discussions between officials have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/3">Together with the flood defence operating authorities, we are reducing the risk of flooding and are communicating this to the insurance industry. We are reducing the risk through substantial increases in investment in flood and coastal defences (which now totals over &pound;400 million a year). Flood defences are being repaired, renewed, maintained and improved. Flood warning arrangements are continually being improved. The Government have issued strengthened guidance to local planning authorities on control of development in flood risk areas and are reviewing the financial and institutional arrangements under which the flood defence service is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/4">The additional funding is being used in particular to accelerate a number of river flood defence schemes and to provide for whole catchment studies to proceed. However, as taxpayers' money is at stake, it is necessary to ensure that schemes are properly appraised, that a range of options are considered and the potential impact of defences elsewhere on the coastline or in the catchment is considered. Such problems are rarely amenable to standard solutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.2/1">The Vehicle Inspectorate records the number of vehicles checked at the roadside and at fleet inspections but it does not record whether the vehicle is fitted with a speed limiter. The examination of speed limiters requires the use of sophisticated electronic equipment by trained examiners and the check takes some time to complete. Speed limiter checks are carried out on vehicles where the examination of the tachograph charts leads the examiner to suspect that the speed limiter may be defective. A functional check of the speed limiter is not currently part of the annual test but will form part of the test from October 2002 to comply with the EU directive that requires the component to be checked at annual test from February 2003.
