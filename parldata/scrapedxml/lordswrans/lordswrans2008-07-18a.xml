	<p pid="a.193.1/2" qnum="HL4862">Further to the Statement by Lord Rooker on 7 July (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 568&mdash;70), how the Independent Scientific Group calculated the cost of a prolonged badger cull over an area of 250 to 350 square kilometres; and what was the total at which it arrived.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.2/1">The Independent Scientific Group (ISG) derived costs for a culling programme carried over a 100km<sup>2</sup> area for five years from a cost-benefit analysis study carried out by Defra in 2005, which is available on the Defra website. These are presented in the ISG final report as follows:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.193.2/9"> <td colspan="3">* Assumes 75 per cent access to overall land area.</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.193.2/12">Cost estimates for cage trapping, gassing and snaring are based on culling operations being undertaken by skilled and specialist field staff, as carried out in the RBCT. The cost estimate is based on farmers undertaking the culling operations themselves under licence. The ISG acknowledges that these costs are only estimates and do not take into account additional costs which would be associated with the implementation of a badger-culling control policy, such as the need for security and police involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/13">The report does not explicitly state the calculated costs for a prolonged badger cull over an area of 250km<sup>2</sup> to 350km<sup>2</sup>, but based on the above estimates and, once again, assuming 75 per cent access to overall land area, a government-led cull using cage trapping over an area of 350km<sup>2</sup> for five years would cost an estimated &pound;4,987 500. The ISG's final report is available on the Defra website.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/3">Plasma TV stock is projected to be around 7,250,000 in 2011 and is expected to represent 11 per cent of all TVs. It is projected that 85 per cent (around 6,200,000) of plasma TVs will have an integrated digital tuner.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.6/1">Paragraphs 2.10 to 2.25 of the nuclear White Paper published in January 2008 set out the reasoning behind our conclusion that throughout their lifecycle the carbon emissions from nuclear power stations are low and that new nuclear power stations could therefore make a material contribution to tackling climate change, as part of a wider strategy to cut emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.6/2">The department also published a cost-benefit analysis for nuclear power alongside the energy White Paper in May 2007. This compared nuclear power with gas-fired generation and alternative low carbon generation options.
