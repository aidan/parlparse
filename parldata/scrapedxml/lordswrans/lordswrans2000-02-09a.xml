In accordance with Section 145 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, a Direction has been made which will ensure that immigration officers exercising these powers, and their existing powers of arrest under Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971, must have regard to the relevant provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 codes of practice.

This pilot scheme will enable the powers to be tested in the operational arena before more widespread use of the powers is considered.</p>

However, in the current CSR period, starting this financial year, the council is receiving an uplift (in real terms) of some 2 per cent over the 1998-99 figure in line with the FCO settlement. The British Council determines how it spends the grant-in-aid allocated to it by the FCO. The allocation by the council for Italy over this period has declined by 55 per cent--a reduction resulting from the redirection of resources to other areas, mainly East Asia and Pacific, the expansion of various human rights and governance programmes and the development of IT infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.3/1">Applicants for subsidy under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) have recently been notified about guidance from the European Commission concerning the width of field margins. Where a field is fully utilised according to normal practice and field margins do not exceed two metres in width, measured from the recognised Ordnance Survey (OS) boundary (for example, a fence, or the mid-point of a hedge) to the edge of the cropped area, an applicant will, as in previous years, be able to claim under AAPS for the total OS area of the field. Should a field margin exceed the two metre threshold, the applicant will instead need to claim on the actual cropped area (i.e. the OS measured area minus the total uncropped area around the field margin). We are concerned that this clarification of the AAPS rules might be detrimental to wildlife, and we are currently analysing what effect it might have and evaluating the options for minimising any problems which may arise. Moreover, MAFF's guidance urges farmers that, if they need to adjust the width of a field margin, they should seek advice on minimising the environmental impact of any such change.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">While there were no further specific actions timed for completion by the end December 1999, the Environment Agency has nevertheless kept the Ministry informed of progress up to that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">For flood forecasting, all the Environment Agency's regions are working on delivering the first phase of their hydrometric monitoring network improvement programmes by April 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">The work relating to flood warning is progressing well. The National Flood Warning Centre is established and the necessary relationships with other national bodies are being actively developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/4">Flood risk maps have been produced and were disseminated to local planning authorities and emergency planners in September 1999. The agency is using the maps to identify high-risk properties on a consistent basis to aid targeting of direct warnings and public awareness material. Local authorities are using the maps for both development control and emergency planning purposes. The information in the maps will be made publicly available so that people can make informed decisions about flood risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/5">The agency has further improved liaison arrangements with local authorities and emergency services at both local and national level to ensure effective response to flooding incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/6">A flood warning public awareness campaign commenced in October. Plans are being developed for revised flood warning codes to be introduced in September 2000, with appropriate publicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/7">Visual inspection of all flood defences continues against a deadline of April 2000. The agency has set up meetings to resolve isolated problems where local authorities have not always been able to identify the location of defences on ordinary watercourses.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/8">The agency continues its work in implementing the recommendations in the independent report on its management and skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/9">We are pleased to note the agency's continuing progress in implementing the Easter Floods report, contributing to achievement of the ministerial priority of a seamless and integrated service of flood forecasting, warning and response.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/10">We shall ensure that the House is updated on progress in implementing the final phases of the action plan, including the introduction of new flood warning codes in September 2000.</p>
