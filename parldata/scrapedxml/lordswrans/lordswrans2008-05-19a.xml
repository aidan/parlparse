	<p pid="a.157.2/1">Pollination contributes to propagation of biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems and it is recognised as a key ecosystem service that is threatened globally. Although there are other pollinators, many flowers have evolved completely dependent on pollination by bees. There are also complex interactions between managed honey bees and wild pollinators; there have been concerns about removing managed bees from nature reserves because of their impact on wild pollinators. A European Union 6th Framework Project, &quot;Alarm&quot;, which includes several UK participants, has been running since 2004 and is due to complete in 2009. It focuses on ecosystem services and the relationship between society, economy and biodiversity; it will include an assessment of risks associated with loss of pollinators.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.5/1">There is no published evidence which suggests that any insemination of an animal with human sperm, whether as part of a scientific study or not, has resulted in a pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/2">There are biological mechanisms in place that prevent cross-species fertilisation. For a sperm to fertilise an egg there has to be compatibility between proteins present on the sperm and on either the zona pellucida (the shell surrounding the egg) or on the membrane of the egg itself, or both. It is for this reason that the hamster egg fertility test requires the zona to be removed first, before human sperm are added, otherwise the sperm will never penetrate the zona. Humans also have a different number of chromosomes to any other species of animal and are significantly more advanced as a species, making the chances of successful embryonic development low.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/3">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill provides for the creation of true hybrids for research to allow scope for potential developments in embryological research techniques which require the use of animal eggs or sperm, thereby future-proofing in this fast-moving field. The Bill provides consistency with the creation of true hybrids being permitted under the 1990 Act for the testing of human sperm fertility or normality using hamster eggs.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/4">Any licence application to create a &quot;true hybrid&quot; for research will need to prove that its use is necessary. No true hybrid embryo created may be implanted into a woman or an animal, and may not be cultured for more than 14 days or after the appearance of the primitive streak.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.5/1">Since 1997, the department has issued a number of documents relating to the elimination of mixed-sex accommodation and these are set out below. While these do not relate solely to new build, they do make our expectations clear with regard to segregation.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/2">Specific guidance relating to new build has focused on the provision of single rooms. Since 2001, the department's guidance is that the proportion of single rooms in new hospital developments should aim to be 50 per cent but should not fall below 20 per cent and must be higher than the facilities they are replacing. Each trust makes an informed choice regarding the appropriate percentage of single room provision based on practical considerations such as site restrictions and affordability as well as clinical and operational limitations.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/3">While information about the number of hospitals that have single-sex wards is not collected centrally, progress in respect of privacy and dignity is measured through a range of indicators as follows. This includes some information about mixed-sex accommodation:</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/4">the Healthcare Commission monitors two relevant national standards via the annual health check assessments. The standards are: healthcare organisations have systems in place to ensure that staff treat patients, their relatives and carers with dignity and respect; and healthcare services are provided in environments which promote effective care and optimise health outcomes by being supportive of patient privacy and confidentiality; under arrangements of the National Patient Safety Agency, Patient Environment Teams (PEAT) undertake assessment of aspects of privacy and dignity; and the annual national in-patient survey, undertaken by the Healthcare Commission, contains a question on whether patients shared their sleeping area with members of the opposite sex.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.5/1">Immigration detention is authorised under the statutory powers contained in Schedules 2 and 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, and Section 62 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.5/2">In line with the Government's stated policy on the use of these powers, persons may be detained in the following circumstances: initially, while their identity and basis of claim are being established; where there is reason to believe that a person will fail to comply with the conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release; as part of a fast-track asylum process; or to effect removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.5/3">Detention is not arbitrary. Each case is considered on its individual merits and all factors arguing for and against detention are weighed carefully before a decision to detain is made. The decision to detain is authorised at specified levels within the UK Border Agency depending on the nature of the case concerned and is kept under review on a regular basis at successively higher levels within the agency to ensure that persons only remain in detention where this continues to be justified.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.5/1">We are unaware of any official reports having been made on the operability of Baghdad's sewage plants as a result of the Baghdad security plan. However, we are aware that a spokesman for the Government of Iraq has stated that, as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-03">3 February</phrase> this year, none of the city's three sewage plants was operating at capacity. These problems were directly attributed to the neglect with which Saddam Hussein's regime treated the maintenance of Iraq's infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.5/2">The Joint Reconstruction Operation Centre, responsible for co-ordinating and synchronising reconstruction efforts in Baghdad, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-02">2 March</phrase> that in the past year 80 per cent of the city's water distribution system and 60 per cent of the sewerage system had undergone reconstruction, as a result of co-operation between the Government of Iraq and coalition forces. Work is also continuing on extending the capacity of these systems. The US Army Corps of Engineers reports that a $2.3 million upgrade to sewer lines and water pumping stations in one of Baghdad's suburbs, which will help prevent health hazards to more than 115,000 area residents, is due to be completed in June, and that it is undertaking many other projects to improve Baghdad's infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.5/3">The UK Government are not currently involved in any work to improve Baghdad's sewage system. However, by May of this year the Department for International Development will have improved access to water for more than 1 million people in southern Iraq, by: undertaking infrastructure repair projects; providing training facilities for Iraqi engineers; and by providing technical advice for a major sewage installation in al-Amarah, replacing open sewage channels and providing up to half of the city's population with access to a piped sewage system.</p>

The council already directly supports Europe-wide scientific collaboration, for example by participating in European Union (EU) Framework Programme schemes, and European Space Agency missions. This helps to ensure that the UK research and training community has a European outlook and European connections in most aspects of environmental science.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/2">NERC's centres already work closely with European researchers, and NERC enables researchers it funds, including students, to spend time in European research organisations.

	<p pid="a.170.5/1">The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) in partnership with local authorities is currently testing a secure, video-conference system to ensure it meets both customer and business requirement. The initial phase of customer experience testing was conducted at the beginning of the 2008 and was positively received with minor recommendations informing the final service design. Owing to the small volumes of customers eligible for the service and so as to generate significant volumes against which to verify the solution, testing is likely to continue until the end of July 2008. Thereafter, it is anticipated the Remote Communities Service will be rolled out to 26 video interview offices during the summer of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.5/2">Consultations with local authorities and other government departments are ongoing in an effort to further improve the service through provision of additional office locations.</p>
