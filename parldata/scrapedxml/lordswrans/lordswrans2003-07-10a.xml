	<p pid="a.52.0/1">While the building of a separation wall for security reasons does not necessarily contravene international law, we do consider some aspects related to the construction of the &quot;security fence&quot; in the West Bank to be illegal. We do not believe that the route of the fence is determined by security requirements. We therefore conclude that much of the demolition and confiscation of Palestinian property associated with its construction violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits such measures unless absolutely necessary. We are concerned that the lack of access for Palestinian owners to land on the west of the security fence results in the de facto appropriation of this territory by Israel.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/2">As the Minister for Science and Innovation made clear on <phrase class="date" code="">8 July</phrase> (Official Report, col. 128), even if the VAT position were changed, there would nevertheless still be a very substantial saving for Royal Mail from their decision to withdraw from rail transport. The VAT cost will therefore have been only one of many factors likely to have been taken into account in coming to that decision. However, while the loss of business for rail freight is always regrettable, the Government remain committed to allowing Royal Mail the freedom it needs to take operational decisions in its best commercial interests.</p>

Conventional plant and animal breeding harnesses the natural variation in organisms by crossing sexually compatible relatives. The varieties produced will contain a random mixture of genes from the two parents from which offspring with the desired characteristic are selected. Genetic modification differs in that gene manipulation can be achieved across species boundaries in a specific and targeted approach and as a result can introduce new traits into a plant or animal which in some cases could not be achieved through conventional breeding.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.8/2">Both genetic modification and conventional breeding can result in varieties which exhibit beneficial and/or non-beneficial effects. Therefore, all products undergo extensive testing at the early stages of development to select those which have desirable traits and reject those that do not. It is recognised that genetic modification presents a novel method of introducing new genes and traits into plants and animals which has the potential to introduce valuable traits but may conversely present new risks. It is for this reason that legislation is in place to ensure that all GM plants and animals must undergo a thorough risk assessment for human health and the environment before any approval for use is given.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">I understand there is evidence that some varieties of maize genetically modified for insect resistance may contain more lignin in their stems than non-GM counterparts. Similarly studies carried out in America have identified an increase in deformed and lost cotton bolls in herbicide-tolerant cotton when grown under certain environmental conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/2">Potential effects of lignin content and cotton boll formation in GM maize and cotton are taken into account in consideration of the risk assessment carried out by advisory committees and regulatory authorities in the approval of genetically modified plants. Variations in lignin content and cotton bolls may not necessarily present a safety issue but may affect the agronomic performance of the plant and consequently have an affect on crop yield.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.5/2">A soil bacterium (agrobacterium) is, in some instances, used as part of the process of producing genetically modified plants, but the bacteria are removed at the very earliest stage of the process. This means that genetically modified, herbicide-tolerant plants are not likely to contain any additional bacteria. All plants, including crops, naturally contain large and diverse bacterial populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.5/3">Regarding the genetic material that is inserted into crops to make them more tolerant to particular herbicides, some of these sequences are obtained from bacteria and viruses. Genes conferring herbicide tolerance are sometimes obtained from bacteria, while sequences from plant viruses are used to ensure that these genes function correctly within the plant.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.8/1">The Government do not plan to amend the regulations relating to coal-fired electricity generation. The relevant system is that of integrated pollution control (&quot;IPC&quot;), established through the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the regulations made under that Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.8/2">IPC requires that operators apply the best available techniques not entailing excessive cost (BATNEEC) for pollution control to their processes. The Environment Agency has carried out a review of the IPC authorisations issued to operators of coal-fired power stations that did not have flue gas desulphurisation equipment fitted. If the operator was unable to present a good BATNEEC justification for not using the abatement, they were limited to a 40 per cent load factor in 2001 and 2002. The next principal review of these authorisations is likely to be carried out in 2003&ndash;04 to secure further reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide in 2004&ndash;05. This review will consider how to avoid commercially disadvantaged power stations that are equipped to burn coal cleanly, and to avoid benfiting power stations that are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.8/3">The system of IPC is being superseded on a sector by sector basis by that of integrated pollution prevention and control established by a European directive of the same name. This requires operators to apply best available techniques (BAT) for pollution prevention and control. Large power stations will transfer to it in 2006.</p>
