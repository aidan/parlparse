	<p pid="b.111.2/1">The Government are not proposing to alter the membership of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. The board is currently constituted under Part II of Schedule 1 to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000&mdash;&quot;membership during suspension of devolved government&quot;. In October 2002, following the suspension of the devolved institutions the then Secretary of State, John Reid, appointed the current members of the board for a three-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.2/2">At any other time, ie after restoration of devolved government, Part III of the schedule takes effect. Part III would require the reconstitution of the board, with 10 members of the Assembly nominated as political members under the d'Hondt formula. In appointing the nine independent members the Secretary of State would be statutorily required to exercise his powers of appointment to secure as far as is practicable that the membership of the board is representative of the community in Northern Ireland. In line with guidance from the Commissioner for Public Appointments, the Secretary of State might consider it appropriate to run a supplementary competition to identify further potentially appointable candidates as independent members.</p>

The terms of reference specifically address the impact on small and medium enterprises and the retail sector. The study will involve both quantitative and qualitative research and is due to be published in spring 2004. The findings from this study will give policy makers a better understanding of this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.112.8/1">The paper on Breaking the Cycle of Child Poverty is a discussion paper, published in May 2002, which sets out a range of options for tackling child poverty that could be taken forward by the development community. As part of our rights-based approach to development we are concerned that all groups, including children, are fully included in our work. DfID is currently reviewing its work that directly involves children to see how we may better integrate children's issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.8/2">The Government are fully committed to working with others to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs), the internationally agreed targets for eradicating poverty. Almost all the MDGs have direct relevance to child poverty. We are particularly active in the areas of reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other major diseases and promoting gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.8/3">Our development assistance is provided in response to our partner countries' needs as driven by their poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs). We are working actively with partner governments to support production of PRSPs and we encourage them to ensure that as wide a range as possible of stakeholders participate in the consultation process, including groups representing children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.8/4">We support the United Nations (UN) Children's Fund (UNICEF) through our core contribution of &pound;19 million, together with our support for specific projects, which in 2003 totalled around &pound;68 million. Much of what UNICEF does is about giving children a greater voice in their future. For example, children from around the world went to the UN Special Session on Children in 2002. UNICEF also has a global website &quot;Voices of Youth&quot; where young people can discuss, explore and take action on issues that affect them. We also support the Commonwealth Youth Programme, which promotes youth participation in development. Before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last December my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development consulted civil society, including youth representatives, about what issues they considered were important for the meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.8/5">A number of DfID-funded programmes and projects have involved participation of children and research into children's participation. The following are some examples from DfID country programmes. Last year DfID supported a discussion between the Government of Brazil and representatives of the UK Youth Parliament (UKYP) on increasing the participation of young people in decisions on sustainable development in the Amazon region. The outcome was a proposal by the Government of Brazil and State Government of Amapa to set up their own Youth Parliament and we are supporting this through the European Youth Exchange Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.8/6">In Pakistan, DfID provided a secondee to work with the United Nations (UN) Children's Fund (UNICEF) office on integrating children's participation into particular initiatives, such as changing the approach to juvenile justice and developing new areas of research, and on ensuring that participation of the poorest and excluded children and women is fully integrated into the activities of UNICEF and local partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.8/7">In Malawi children are participating in the design and implementation of the Malawi Government's free primary education policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.8/8">The Government are committed to designing policies and services around the needs of children and young people. DfID is in the process of developing an action plan, expected to be ready by late April, which will show how we are adopting these principles.</p>

The focus of the review was on taking early action and managing change, on a timescale which did not impact negatively on support for Olympic and Paralympic preparation. As such, the review informed a number of UK Sport decisions before its formal conclusion. A number of subsidiary reports covering UK Sport's functions in supporting world class athletes, and the revised staffing structure of the performance directorate, were received and agreed by UK Sport's council in March and July of 2003, and the implementation of the review has now been completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.5/3">The subsidiary reports concerned internal discussion and advice, under the terms of exemption 2 of part II of Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. However, the minutes of the council's meetings are available on request.</p>

The main GB network with the Channel Tunnel is fully open to applications (not limited to rolling stock owners) from continental Europe seeking access to operate services, subject to safety certification.
