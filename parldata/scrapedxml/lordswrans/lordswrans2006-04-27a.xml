The Nepalese citizenship of the person who does not choose that citizenship shall be lapsed after the expiry of that time limit. Consequently, minors who are dual nationals are considered to be Nepalese citizens until the age of 21. There has been no further correspondence from the Nepalese authorities clarifying the position of British/Nepalese dual nationals by birth/descent that would alter the advice offered on the website of our consulate-general in Hong Kong.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) routinely provides information on the number of incidents of domestic violence, but not on the numbers of incidents that were linked to alcohol or drug abuse. Figures for percentages of incidents of domestic violence, where the offender was thought to be under the influence of alcohol and drugs, are available for BCS 2004&ndash;05. The 2004&ndash;05 British Crime Survey estimated that in just over half the incidents of domestic violence the offender was thought to be under the influence of alcohol (53 per cent), and in just over one in 10 incidents under the influence of drugs (11 per cent).</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">The BCS figures are estimates only. As they are derived from a sample, they are subject to sampling error. Also, the context of the face-to-face BCS interview means the estimates are certain to be underestimates of the true extent due to the fact that some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. To address this, self-completion components for those aged 16&ndash;59 on domestic violence have been included in the 1996, 2001, 2004&ndash;05, and 2005&ndash;06 BCS. Results from the 2001 BCS self-completion module on domestic violence were published in Home Office Research Study No. 276. According to this more confidential approach to measurement prevalence (per cent of population victim at least once) rates for past year domestic assault were approximately five times higher than in the main face-to-face BCS. The BCS covers only England and Wales, so the figures exclude Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.6/1">Primary care trusts are currently recommissioning dental services in cases where dentists have chosen not to take up a new NHS dental contract from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Based on provisional management information, we estimate that these rejected contracts represent around 4 per cent. of NHS services. Based on levels of patient registrations prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase>, this means that primary care trusts are now recommissioning services for 900,000 patients using the extra resources the Government have put into NHS dentistry.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.6/2">The reforms introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> are designed to promote wider improvements in access to services, in particular through ensuring for the first time that primary care trusts have the resources to recommission services for their local population where a dentist ceases to provide NHS services, and through promoting compliance with expert clinical guidelines on patient recall intervals. We will need to allow time for the reforms to bed down before reassessing levels of access to NHS dental services.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.6/3">The Department of Health has previously estimated that 2 million people in England would like to access National Health Service dental services but are unable to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.2/1">HM Inspector of Prisons recently raised some concerns about the misreporting of activity hours and hours out of cell in some establishments. It is not clear what the reasons are for this misreporting in individual establishments. However, the Prison Service is taking steps to ensure that recording and reporting of data are as accurate as possible. These steps include tightening centrally issued guidance, improving the use of IT to collate data and evaluating establishment data on an individual basis. These actions are in addition to the line management checks and validations already in place in establishment. Performance data already go through line management approval to ensure data are consistent with guidelines. The Prison Service management information system, which is used by establishments to report data, contains a requirement for data in each establishment to be checked and approved by a senior manager. In addition, area managers quality-assure data ahead of discussions on performance with the director of operations. A system of independent audit ensures that managers are aware of their responsibilities and have this recorded in personal performance plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.0/1">The Offender Assessment System, OASys, has been implemented in all public sector prisons and all 42 areas of the National Probation Service, enabling initial OASys assessments to routinely follow offenders electronically into custody and for these and subsequent reviews to transfer with them between prisons and, when released, into the community on licence. Full connectivity between the Prison Service and National Probation Service OASys IT systems was achieved in March 2006. Full access to OASys has also recently been given to the contracted-out prisons, although not all have started using it yet.</p>
