<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-05-13a.9.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="9"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020513/text/20513w03.htm#20513w03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.9.5/1">First, I would like to reassure the noble Lord that the answer to the ''Are you a Freemason?'' question has no impact on this selection process. The decision on appointment as a lay member to an employment tribunal will be based on how far applicants meet the published criteria. Whether or not candidates are freemasons has no bearing on their suitability for these posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/2">The Home Affairs Select Committee's third report Freemasonry in the Police and the Judiciary, published in March 1997, recommended that a register should be established in order to promote greater openness about membership of the freemasons in the criminal justice system. Although the Select Committee's report had found no clear evidence of freemasonry exerting any improper influence within the criminal justice system, it concluded that suspicions about the influence of freemasonry were damaging to the credibility of the criminal justice system, and that the greatest cause of the suspicions was the secrecy surrounding freemasons. On <phrase class="date" code="1998-02-17">17 February 1998</phrase> the Home Secretary announced that the Government accepted the committee's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/3">Consistent with the Government's response, the Lord Chancellor decided that new appointees to judicial office for which he was responsible in both the civil and criminal justice system should be required to declare whether or not they are freemasons. Employment tribunal lay members act in a judicial capacity and it is the policy of my department to adopt the same approach to these appointments. Equally we are committed to transparency in public appointments.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/4">The Government believe that the requirement to disclose membership of the freemasons as a condition of appointment of the application form for these appointments is not incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and does not represent unfair discrimination. Rebo</p>

	<p pid="a.17.8/1">It is the Government's policy to promote the equal rights of disabled people. Equality, fair treatment and social inclusion lie at the heart of the Government's plans to modernise public services. The NHS Plan recognises that we live in a diverse society and sets out as core principles that the NHS will shape its services around the needs of the patient; be responsive to the needs of different groups and individuals within society; and challenge discrimination on the grounds of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability and sexuality.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/2">Shifting the Balance of Power within the NHS entails supporting front-line staff to better respond to the needs of all sections of the community and delivering more responsive high quality services to all. Rebo</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/3">The Human Rights Act 1998 brings the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic legislation. Article 2 of that convention protects the right to life and makes no distinction between people who do or do not have disabilities. The Government consider that the 1967 Abortion Act, as amended, to be in compliance with Article 2 and the Human Rights Act. Under English law a foetus is not recognised as being a separate person from its mother, and does not have legal rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/4">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' guideline Termination of Pregnancy for fetal abnormality (1996) indicates the importance of offering parents information about all of the options available to them. This should include the implications of continuing the pregnancy as well as the implications of termination. The guideline states that if an abnormality has been detected and two medical practitioners are of the opinion that there are grounds for a termination under the Abortion Act, the woman should be advised that she has this option. The guideline also states that the woman needs to be given enough information and time to help her understand the nature of the foetal abnormality and the probable outcome of the pregnancy in order that she can make an informed decision as to whether or not to proceed with the pregnancy.</p>

These are cases where the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated or where the termination is immediately necessary to save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant women.

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">The Office for National Statistics collects information on live born babies and stillbirths with congenital anomalies through the National Congenital Anomaly System (NCAS). Reporting to NCAS is voluntary and notifications are sent by regions where there are local registers or by National Health Service trusts. NCAS does not collect information on drug usage in pregnancy. The Department of Health will consider evidence which suggests a causal factor for birth defects.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is aware of concerns regarding consumption of plant-based foods containing naturally occurring estrogen-like chemicals, known as phytoestrogens. A study published in 2000 suggested the incidence of hypospadias (an abnormality of the male genitals) was higher in babies of mothers who follow a vegetarian diet. The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) reviewed the study but concluded there was insufficient evidence to support this hypothesis.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/3">The FSA is currently funding a large programme of research to investigate the pubic health implications of phytoestrogens. Additionally, at the request of the FSA, an expert group of the COT is reviewing the health implications of phytoestrogens.
