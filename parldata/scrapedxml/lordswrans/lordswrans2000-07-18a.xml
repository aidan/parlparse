The RMT 2000 project team work closely with Royal Parks, Westminster City Council and the Metropolitan Police to ensure that health and safety regulations are adhered to, and that inconvenience to the public is kept to a minimum. The Royal Parks have granted the Ministry of Defence (MoD) permission to use Horse Guards Parade and allotted areas of St James's Park in return for a licence fee. In addition, MoD is responsible for fair and reasonable reinstatement costs in respect of any damage which can be attributed to RMT 2000's use of those areas.</p>

It has reached that conclusion having taken into account the available evidence and the likely result of any argument that may be put forward by Miss McAliskey that to prosecute her now would be an abuse of process.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.6/4">The Law Officers have been consulted and we agree with the conclusion reached by the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.6/5">It is not usual for the Law Officers to make announcements concerning consideration of individual cases. In this instance, the Home Secretary in a written reply (Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="1998-03-20">20 March 1998</phrase>, col. 742) said that this matter would be considered for prosecution in the United Kingdom.

	<p pid="a.79.0/1">Under the Registered Homes Act, the Lord President of the Council appoints the panel of expert members who can act as members on a Registered Homes Tribunal. The Act requires that panel members must have experience in social work, medicine, nursing or midwifery or such experience as the Lord President of the Council considers suitable. The Privy Council makes appointments to individual tribunal hearings on the basis of members' relevant experience in the type case which is the subject of the appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/2">For tribunals established under the Protection of Children Act, lay members will be appointed by the Lord Chancellor.

	<p pid="a.81.8/1">All hospitals are unique, reflecting local service requirements and circumstances. We are therefore unable to give a meaningful approximate cost for running a 1,000 bed hospital. Costs are dependent on many factors, such as location, with the premises and transport costs in particular varying considerably. Costs will also vary to reflect the type of services being delivered by the hospital, with some specialities making a much greater demand on running costs and maintenance than others.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.0/1">In the course of the Spending Review, the Government have had close regard to the relative costs and effectiveness of a range of measures for reducing or preventing crime. A wide range of solutions is needed satisfactorily to tackle crime reduction, and in practice many of these are interdependent. For example, re-offending is reduced not solely as a result of imprisonment but also requires that offenders are apprehended through effective policing and that prisoners complete programmes designed to prevent re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/2">Different measures also have varying impacts over time and between locations, and according to the group of offenders targeted. The Government's evidence-led approach to crime reduction is based on establishing a full understanding of these inter-linkages and not on a simple correlation between spending and crime for individual measures in isolation.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/3">With these qualifications, our central estimates on the available evidence suggest that the impact of spending on individual measures in isolation are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/4" class="indent">&pound;1 million invested in building and running more prisons would result in approximately 180 recorded offences being prevented annually; and</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/5" class="indent">&pound;1 million invested in running drug treatment programmes within prison would result in approximately 500 recorded offences being prevented annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/6">However, these estimates are uncertain and subject to error margins. Research is currently being undertaken by the Home Office to improve them and to expand their coverage as new evidence becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/7">The impact of recruiting more police officers, installing closed circuit television systems, and early interventions with children at risk, is highly dependent upon the circumstances and on the mix of approaches and tactics chosen. They cannot therefore be meaningfully reduced to a single impact per-spend measure.</p>

As an earned privilege, it can be a powerful incentive to good behaviour and regime participation, and can help with order and control, reducing tension on the landings. It helps prisoners keep in touch with the outside world to which all but a few must eventually return. It can also be used as a means of providing information and educational programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/1">The Research Development and Statistics Directorate of the Home Office provided revised projections of the prison population in England and Wales in May, and a summary of the projection is included in the April 2000 Prison Population Brief, which is available on the Internet at http://www/homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/index.htm.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">Projections are provided according to various alternative scenarios. The middle variant projection assumes some growth in the use of custody in the courts, but no change in sentence lengths. The higher variant projection assumes that sentence lengths continue to increase. These scenarios both assume that the amount of courts' business remains constant over the period. A lower variant projection assumes sentence lengths and custody rates do not increase further and continue at the levels prevailing in March 2000, leading to a prison population of 66,700 in 2005. Projections take into account known legislative and policy changes. Table 1 gives the results for the middle and higher variants.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/3">The available projections on recorded crime cover property crime trends and were published in autumn 1999 as Home Office Research Study 198, Modelling and predicting property crime trends in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/4">Property crime (burglary and theft) comprises around 60 per cent of all recorded crime. The models provide projections of burglary and theft based on expected movements in the number of young males, the stock of goods and consumer spending. These are not forecasts, which would incorporate a range of other information and judgments about how other social, economic and policy changes might effect the level of crime. The projections are given in Table 2.</p>
