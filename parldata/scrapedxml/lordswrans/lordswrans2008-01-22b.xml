	<p pid="b.31.2/1">There is no overarching plan for reducing the risk of cerebral palsy. While improvements in the management of pregnancy and childbirth have reduced the incidence of cerebral palsy in babies born after 37 weeks' gestation, this is offset to some extent by increases in the survival rates of babies of very low gestational ages, for whom the risk of developing cerebral palsy is greater.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.2/2">In addition, the Medical Research Council is funding the national perinatal epidemiology unit (NPEU) to conduct an 18-month trial, known as the TOBY trial, to look at the possibility of preventing cerebral palsy by cooling the bodies of some babies in a high-risk group. The trial will be finished in mid-2008 and NPEU is expecting to publish a report at the end of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.2/1">The Rapid Review Panel (RRP), convened by the Health Protection Agency at the request of the department, has evaluated some systems that generate hydroxyl radicals for air and surface decontamination purposes. Two of these products have demonstrated significant promise for outbreak situations to decontaminate wards which have been emptied of all staff/patients. Since the initial recommendation the department has held discussions with the two companies involved regarding improvements which have been made to their product since the initial RRP review. As a result, one of the products has been used within the National Health Service, and the department is pursuing discussions regarding the products uptake in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/2">This conclusion of usefulness for decontaminating wards could potentially be transferable to the decontamination of other enclosed spaces such as railway carriages and so on, which can be emptied of people and sealed during the decontamination process. Safety concerns surrounding the hydroxyl radicals mean that the systems are not deemed appropriate for use while members of the public are actually located in the spaces to be decontaminated. However, despite the invitro data on flu viruses, data demonstrating a reduction in influenza transmission are lacking.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.0/1">There are currently no plans in place to use biofuels as part of the energy mix to heat the House of Lords' portion of the parliamentary estate. The boilers that generate heating to the buildings consume natural gas and there are presently no alternative piped supplies. It is theoretically possible to generate methane gas onsite by passing organic waste through an anaerobic digester but this has been determined as impracticable for the parliamentary estate, mainly because of the small quantity of organic waste arising from the kitchens and the lack of space to locate a digester. For future boiler replacement, biomass systems will be considered as part of a range of sustainable options.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.3/1">Recent studies considering all sustainability options for the building services of the palace discounted the option of using heat pump technology from the River Thames for the primary heating to the palace. This was principally because the means of distributing the heat around the palace is by steam, which would be very difficult and disproportionately uneconomic to generate using heat pump technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.3/2">When there is a need for a major overhaul of the heating and cooling infrastructure of specific buildings on the parliamentary estate, it is intended to investigate the potential viability of utilising any of the available forms of sustainable energy technologies, and the option of employing heat pump technology is one that would be included in the study.</p>
