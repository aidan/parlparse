	<p pid="a.21.2/1">The effects of passive smoking on those suffering from asthma and other respiratory conditions are well recognised. Although we do not intend to introduce legislation banning smoking in the workplace or public areas, we accept the right of everyone to breath air unpolluted by cigarette smoke and we encourage the introduction of smoke-free environments. We recognise that this is not always going to be possible and encourage in these circumstances other measures to be taken to reduce people's exposure to smoke.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">This year the Department of Health is funding local tobacco control alliances across England to carry out projects in close co-operation with local employers to tackle passive smoking and to increase the number of smoke free environments. These projects vary in nature from the production of smoke-free guides to pubs and restaurants to the provision of advice and support to managers wishing to introduce policies. We hope that many will be suitable for national application.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.0/1">The Department of Health-funded Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) evidence-based guideline The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2000), which is applicable to National Health Service and independent sector providers, recognises the importance of women seeking abortion receiving accurate, impartial information. Verbal advice must be supported by printed information which every woman considering abortion can understand and may take away and read before the procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/2">The guideline states that professionals should be equipped to provide women with the information they need in order to give genuinely informed consent: that abortion is safe and complications are uncommon; description of the abortion methods that are available; immediate complications including haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion, uterine perforation which may require immediate abdominal surgery, cervical laceration which may require suturing and anaesthetic complications; complications in the early weeks following abortion including incomplete abortion requiring re-evacuation, continuing pregnancy, pelvic infection, short-term emotional distress and ectopic pregnancy; and long-term effects of abortion (which are rare or uproven) including breast cancer, infertility and psychological sequelae.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/3">In 2001 the Department of Health also funded the RCOG to produce the patient leaflet About Abortion Care; which is available for use by NHS and independent sector providers. The leaflet does not provide information on foetal development. The leaflet can be found at <a href="http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/pdf/12062001abortioncare.pdf">www.rcog.org.uk/resources/pdf/12062001 abortion care.pdf</a>. Copies have also been placed in the Library. In addition, many NHS and independent sector providers produce their own literature for women considering an abortion.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.8/1">The former Minister for Regional Development did not request an allocation of &pound;48 million for &quot;the purchase of new trains in the present financial year&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.8/2">Additional resources were provided by the Assembly to the Department for Regional Development (DRD) in December 2000 following the report of the Railways Task Force. The larger part of these resources involved the provision of grant support to Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) for the purchase of new trains. The amounts earmarked for this purpose in 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 amounted to some &pound;49 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.8/3">A contract for the new rolling stock was let by NIR in spring 2002 involving staged payments to the contractor throughout the period 2001&ndash;02 to 2004&ndash;05. The department has made and will continue to make the appropriate grant payments to NIR to achieve this, although some rephasing or expenditure has been necessary in line with the contract details. The draft budget for 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 includes the required provision and I can report that the delivery of the trains in 2004 is on schedule.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.8/4">The change in government accounting policy following the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting in April 2001 gave rise to a question in respect of the interpretation and application of the new rules on resource budgeting. Clarification of the nature of the stage payments confirmed that they did not create an asset, and hence those payments were not a charge on the department's departmental expenditure limit (DEL).</p>
	<p pid="a.23.8/5">Although DRD made substantial grant payments to NIR in 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 in respect of trains, none of this scores in the budget under the resource budgeting rules that apply for those two financial years. As soon as this technicality was clarified, in August 2002, &pound;49 million was made available for re-allocation under the normal rules that apply to all departments. This funding, together with other funds, making a total of &pound;141 million, has been allocated to good effect across departments and is profiled to be spent in the current financial year The details of this expenditure were announced by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ian Pearson MP, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-13">13 November</phrase>, reflecting the proposals put forward in October by the former Finance Minister, Dr Sean Farren.</p>
