</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-10-31a.75.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="75"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001031/text/01031w01.htm#01031w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.75.2/1">Nigel Sheinwald, the United Kingdom's Permanent Representative to the European Union, represented the United Kingdom at the <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-28">28 September</phrase> Council. The main matters dealt with at the Meeting were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/2">The list of A points was adopted in full, except items on the Schengen Information System, Sirene, on which one member state maintained a parliamentary scrutiny reserve, and on minimum standards for the security of passports. Common Visa List:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/3">The Council agreed to a mechanism for deferring the entry into force of a visa exemption for certain third countries. Further discussion would take place in the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) and the European Parliament would be reconsulted. This is a measure in respect of which the United Kingdom has not sought to opt in.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/4">Europol: money laundering:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/5">Political agreement was reached on extending the Europol Convention to cover all money laundering and the accompanying Council declaration on predicate offences, subject to consideration of the European Parliament's Opinion. This would formally be adopted at the Council's meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-30">30 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/6">Commission Proposal for a draft Council Directive on minimum standards on asylum procedures:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/7">The Commission presented this proposal as its first response to the call by the Tampere European Council in October 1999 to create a common European asylum system. The proposal set out minimum procedural guarantees to ensure that member states could process cases quickly and fairly at a national level and that secondary movements of asylum seekers were avoided. Common standards and time limits would assist in dismissing inadmissible and unfounded cases. Member states gave a general welcome to the proposal, which was remitted to the Asylum Working Group for further consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/8">Reception conditions for asylum seekers:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/9">This was an orientation debate on key points in the Presidency's discussion document. No conclusions were drawn but the Presidency stressed that this was a key priority and it would be seeking to agree conclusions at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in November in order to provide a background to an anticipated legislative proposal from the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/10">Council Decision to create a provisional Eurojust Unit:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/11">Political orientation was reached on key elements of the text, subject to consideration of the European Parliament's opinion, which had not yet been received. The text was remitted to COREPER for resolution of some technical issues and the language regime at the request of one member state. A new Article was agreed which would allow the Commission to be associated fully with the general work of the unit, particularly in relation to the development of the permanent Eurojust and which would also enable the Commission to lend its expertise to cases considered by the unit where these fell within Commission competence. The United Kingdom maintained its parliamentary scrutiny reservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/12">Framework Decision relating to the status of victims in criminal proceedings:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/13">This text was remitted to COREPER to resolve the outstanding issue on compensation. One member state lifted its scrutiny reserve provided that a recital was included to the effect that the Decision did not imply an obligation to treat victims as parties to criminal proceedings. The United Kingdom maintained its parliamentary scrutiny reservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/14">Commission proposal to create a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/15">The Commission presented this draft Council Decision, which was aimed at improving and developing existing judicial co-operation arrangements and providing the public with practical information about access to justice in cross-border litigation. The Civil Law Committee would discuss this further.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/16">Protection of the environment through the criminal law: orientation debate:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/17">There was general support for the introduction of measures to combat environmental crime, in order to establish a European Union acquis in this area. The Presidency would produce an initiative for a new instrument incorporating the aspects of the 1998 Council of Europe Convention on Environmental Crime which were acceptable to all member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/18">Preparation for the joint JHA/European Council of Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) Council:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/19">Over lunch, the Council prepared the joint ECOFIN/JHA Council meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-17">17 October</phrase> on financial crime. The Presidency explained that this would feature a debate on a common and coherent European Union strategy towards more effective co-operation in the financial sector, law enforcement and judicial co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/20">Brussels/Regulation:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/21">The Presidency urged Ministers to pursue this dossier in their capitals as it was a key element of the mutual recognition programme on civil law. The</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/22">Commission advised that it would be issuing modified proposals during the next week of the e-commerce aspects of mutual recognition in light of the European Parliament's Opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/23">Other items:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/24">The Council noted a communication from Germany on the need for Community-level action on fighting dogs, calling for a Commission initiative on this matter. The Commission doubted if there was a legal basis for Community action but undertook to examine this in greater detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/25">Mixed Committee with Iceland and Norway:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/26">The Committee heard progress reports on the draft Common Visa List, which Iceland and Norway would apply, and on the application of the Schengen arrangements to the Nordic countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.5/1">The sentencing framework now contained in the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 sets out the criteria which must be met before it is appropriate for an offender to be imprisoned for a given offence: broadly, the offence (or the offence and one or more offences associated with it) must be so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified for the offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/2">There are a number of property and other non-violent offences for which the maximum available penalty is imprisonment because of the possible seriousness of the worst examples of offending falling within that offence. It is for the courts to use their discretion when deciding whether imprisonment is justified, taking into account all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors relating to the offence and any previous convictions of the offender or failure to respond to previous sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/3">Additionally, the Government have concluded that there are certain types of persistent offending for which a sentence of imprisonment is invariably necessary. We introduced provisions requiring an automatic minimum sentence of seven years' imprisonment for third-time traffickers in Class A drugs and of three years' imprisonment for third-time burglars. In each case, such a sentence must be imposed unless the court is satisfied that there are particular circumstances relating to any of the offences or to the offender which would make it unjust to do so.</p>

Currently there are plans to provide additional places for mothers and babies at two existing women's prisons and at two new-built prisons for women. There are no plans at present to extend the age limit of babies remaining with their mothers in prison beyond 18 months. It is proposed to run a small pilot scheme at a mother and baby unit with a flexible age limit up to four years of age. A full feasibility study will be carried out before this pilot can start.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.0/1">The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) bans signatory states from the development, production, storage and use of chemical weapons. The UK takes a leading role in implementing the treaty and takes all allegations of non-compliance seriously. We would only consider requesting the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to undertake a challenge inspection where this was warranted by the circumstances of an individual case.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.0/2">Sudan acceded to the CWC on <phrase class="date" code="1999-05-24">24 May 1999</phrase> (entry into force being <phrase class="date" code="1999-06-23">23 June 1999</phrase>). Following allegations of the use of Chemical Weapons (CW) in Lainya in southern Sudan in July 1999, 17 environmental samples obtained from the area by Mr Damien Lewis were analysed by DERA, Porton Down for the most likely CW agents and their breakdown products. Although traces of the explosive TNT and its breakdown products were present in eight of the samples, no evidence was found of the CW agents tested for. Low levels of arsenic were measured in 15 of the samples at concentrations well within the expected natural limits for environmental samples. We understand that samples from the same site analysed in both Finland and the United States confirmed the UK analyses. The UK therefore concluded that there was no evidence to substantiate the allegations that chemical weapons were used in Sudan. The UK has informed the OPCW and the Sudanese Government of these findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.2/2" qnum="HL4396">What steps they have taken to consolidate the United Kingdom's national criteria against which they assess licence applications to export arms and dual-use equipment with those of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-10-31a.82.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="82"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001031/text/01031w02.htm#01031w02_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.82.3/1">Licences to export arms and other goods controlled for strategic reasons are issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, acting through the Export Control Organisation of the DTI. All relevant individual licence applications are circulated by DTI to other government departments with an interest, as determined by those departments in line with their own policy responsibilities. These include the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/2">In the reply given by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary to Stephen Timms MP on <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-28">28 July 1997</phrase>, he set out the criteria which would be used in considering advance approvals for promotion prior to formal application for an export licence, applications for licences to export military equipment and dual-use goods where there are grounds for believing that the end-user will be the armed forces or internal security forces of the recipient country. As the Minister said then, Her Majesty's Government are committed to the maintenance of a strong defence industry as part of our industrial base as well as of our defence effort, and recognise that defence exports can also contribute to international stability by strengthening collective defence relationships, but believe that arms transfers must be managed responsibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/3">We have since taken a range of measures designed to ensure the highest standards of responsibility in our export control policies. These include the adoption during the UK's Presidency of the EU of a Code of Conduct on Arms Exports; the publication of Annual Reports on Strategic Export Controls which are among the most transparent of those of any arms exporting country; the ban on the export of equipment used for torture; the ratification of the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel landmines and the passage of the Land Mines Act; and our many efforts to combat illicit trafficking in and destabilising accumulations of small arms.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/4">Since the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports on <phrase class="date" code="1998-06-08">8 June 1998</phrase>, all relevant licence applications have been assessed against the UK's national criteria and those in the Code of Conduct, which represent minimum standards that all member states have agreed to apply. The criteria in the EU Code of Conduct are compatible with those which were announced by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary in July 1997. At the same time there is a large degree of overlap between the two. It is clearly in the interests of government departments involved in assessing licence applications, British exporters and other interested parties that the criteria which are used should be set out as clearly and unambiguously as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/5">With immediate effect, therefore, the following consolidated criteria will be used in considering all individual applications for licences to export goods on the Military List, which forms Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994; advance approvals for promotion prior to formal application for an export licence; and licence applications for the export of dual-use goods as specified in Annex 1 of Council Decision 94/942/CFSP when there are grounds for believing that the end-user of such goods will be the armed forces or internal security forces or similar entities in the recipient country, or that the goods will be used to produce arms or other goods on the Military List for such end-users. The criteria are based on those in the EU Code of Conduct, incorporating elements from the UK's national criteria where appropriate. As before, they will not be applied mechanistically but on a case-by-case basis, using judgment and common sense. Neither the fact of this consolidation, nor any minor additions or amendments to the wording of the two sets of criteria used before, should be taken to imply any change in policy or in its application.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/6">An export licence will not be issued if the arguments for doing so are outweighed by the need to comply with the UK's international obligations and commitments, by concern that the goods might be used for internal repression or international aggression, by the risks to regional stability or by other considerations described in these criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/7">Criterion One</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/8">Respect for the UK's international commitments, in particular sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council and those decreed by the European Community, agreements on non-proliferation and other subjects, as well as other international obligations</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/9">The Government will not issue an export licence if approval would be inconsistent with, inter alia:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/10" class="indent">(a) the UK's international obligations and its commitments to enforce UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes, as well as national embargoes observed by the UK and other commitments regarding the application of strategic export controls;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/11" class="indent">(b) the UK's international obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/12" class="indent">(c) the UK's commitments in the frameworks of the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Wassenaar Arrangment;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/13" class="indent">(d) the Guidelines for Conventional Arms Transfers agreed by the Permanent Five members of the UN Security Council, the OSCE Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers and the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/14" class="indent">(e) the UK's obligations under the Ottawa Convention and the 1998 Land Mines Act;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/15" class="indent">(f) the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/16">Criterion Two</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/17">The respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country of final destination</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/18">Having assessed the recipient country's attitude towards relevant principles established by international human rights instruments, the Government will:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/19" class="indent">(a) not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/20" class="indent">(b) exercise special caution and vigilance in issuing licences, on a case-by-case basis and taking account of the nature of the equipment, to countries where serious violations of human rights have been established by the competent bodies of the UN, the Council of Europe or by the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/21">For these purposes, equipment which might be used for internal repression will include, inter alia, equipment where there is evidence of the use of this or similar equipment for internal repression by the proposed end-user, or where there is reason to believe that the equipment will be diverted from its stated end-use or end-user and used for internal repression.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/22">The nature of the equipment will be considered carefully, particularly if it is intended for internal security purposes. Internal repression includes, inter alia, torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; summary, arbitrary or extra-judicial executions; disappearances; arbitrary detentions; and other major suppression or violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms as set out in relevant international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/23">The Government consider that in some cases the use of force by a government within its own borders, for example to preserve law and order against terrorists or other criminals, is legitimate and does not constitute internal repression, as long as force is used in accordance with the international human rights standards described above.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/24">Criterion Three</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/25">The internal situation in the country of final destination, as a function of the existence of tensions or armed conflicts</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/26">The Government will not issue licences for exports which would provoke or prolong armed conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflicts in the country of final destination.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/27">Criterion Four</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/28">Preservation of regional peace, security and stability</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/29">The Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the intended recipient would use the proposed export aggressively against another country or to assert by force a territorial claim. However a purely theoretical possibility that the items concerned might be used in the future against another state will not of itself lead to a licence being refused.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/30">When considering these risks, the Government will take into account inter alia:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/31" class="indent">(a) the existence or likelihood of armed conflict between the recipient and another country;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/32" class="indent">(b) a claim against the territory of a neighbouring country which the recipient has in the past tried or threatened to pursue by means of force;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/33" class="indent">(c) whether the equipment would be likely to be used other than for the legitimate national security and defence of the recipient;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/34" class="indent">(d) the need not to affect adversely regional stability in any significant way, taking into account the balance of forces between the states of the region concerned, their relative expenditure on defence, the potential for the equipment significantly to enhance the effectiveness of existing capabilities or to improve force projection, and the need not to introduce into the region new capabilities which would be likely to lead to increased tension.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/35">Criterion Five</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/36">The national security of the UK, of territories whose external relations are the UK's responsibility, and of allies, EU member states and other friendly countries</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/37">The Government will take into account:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/38" class="indent">(a) the potential effect of the proposed export on the UK's defence and security interests or on those of other territories and countries as described above, while recognising that this factor cannot affect consideration of the criteria on respect for human rights and on regional peace, security and stability;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/39" class="indent">(b) the risk of the goods concerned being used against UK forces or on those of other territories and countries as described above;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/40" class="indent">(c) the risk of reverse engineering or unintended technology transfer;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/41" class="indent">(d) the need to protect UK military classified information and capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/42">Criterion Six</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/43">The behaviour of the buyer country with regard to the international community, as regards in particular its attitude to terrorism, the nature of its alliances and respect for international law</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/44">The Government will take into account inter alia the record of the buyer country with regard to:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/45" class="indent">(a) its support or encouragement of terrorism and international organised crime;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/46" class="indent">(b) its compliance with its international commitments, in particular on the non-use of force, including under international humanitarian law applicable to international and non-international conflicts;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/47" class="indent">(c) its commitment to non-proliferation and other areas of arms control and disarmament, in particular the signature, ratification and implementation of relevant arms control and disarmament conventions referred to in sub-para (b) of Criterion One.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/48">Criterion Seven</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/49">The existence of a risk that the equipment will be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/50">In assessing the impact of the proposed export on the importing country and the risk that exported goods might be diverted to an undesirable end-user, the following will be considered:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/51" class="indent">(a) the legitimate defence and domestic security interests of the recipient country, including any involvement in UN or other peace-keeping activity;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/52" class="indent">(b) the technical capability of the recipient country to use the equipment;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/53" class="indent">(c) the capability of the recipient country to exert effective export controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/54">The Government will pay particular attention to the need to avoid diversion of UK exports to terrorist organisations. Proposed exports of anti-terrorist equipment will be given particularly careful consideration in this context.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/55">Criterion Eight</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/56">The compatibility of the arms exports with the technical and economic capacity of the recipient country, taking into account the desirability that states should achieve their legitimate needs of security and defence with the least diversion for armaments of human and economic resources</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/57">The Government will take into account, in the light of information from relevant sources such as United Nations Development Programme, World Bank, IMF and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports, whether the proposed export would seriously undermine the economy or seriously hamper the sustainable development of the recipient country.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/58">The Government will consider in this context the recipient country's relative levels of military and social expenditure, taking into account also any EU or bilateral aid, and its public finances, balance of payments, external debt, economic and social development and any IMF- or World Bank-sponsored economic reform programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/59">Other Factors</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/60">Operative Provision 10 of the EU Code of Conduct specifies that member states may where appropriate also take into account the effect of proposed exports on their economic, social, commercial and industrial interests, but that these factors will not affect the application of the criteria in the Code.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/61">The Government will thus continue when considering export licence applications to give full weight to the UK's national interest, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/62" class="indent">(a) the potential effect on the UK's economic, financial and commercial interests, including our long-term interests in having stable, democratic trading partners;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/63" class="indent">(b) the potential effect on the UK's relations with the recipient country;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/64" class="indent">(c) the potential effect on any collaborative defence production or procurement project with allies or EU partners;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/65" class="indent">(d) the protection of the UK's essential strategic industrial base.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/66">In the application of the above criteria, account will be taken of reliable evidence, including, for example, reporting from diplomatic posts, relevant reports by international bodies, and intelligence and information from open sources and non-governmental organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">Plans for the Centre for Defence Medicine (CDM) are progressing well, with the main Service Level Agreement having been signed in early October. The CDM is due to open in April 2001 but we have already commenced the build-up of the Centre, with a small number of Service medical personnel having now taken up posts there. The CDM will develop progressively, over a period of five to 10 years, to its full strength. It is planned that the functions of the Royal Defence Medical College will transfer to the CDM, where they will be at the heart of the Centre, and that this process will be essentially complete by 2006. There are no plans for the Defence Medical Services' Training Centre at Aldershot to transfer to Birmingham.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.3/2">All export licence applications are rigorously assessed to determine the risk of the proposed export being misused in contravention of our national export licensing criteria and those in the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, including for risk of diversion or re-export to undesirable end-users. Applications are refused if it is assessed that an unacceptable risk of diversion exists. ECO seeks advice on applications from other departments with an interest as determined by those departments in line with their policy responsibilities. All applications for Standard Individual Export Licences must be accompanied by appropriate end-user undertakings or, if the consignee is a Government body, a copy of the official purchase order or relevant part of the contract. As noted in the 1999 Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls, we regularly ask overseas posts to conduct checks to confirm the veracity of end-user information. We systematically take into account reliable information from a variety of sources, including reporting from diplomatic posts, international organisations and Non-Government Organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/3">As regards the facilities in Sudan to which the chemicals were exported and what was the stated purpose for the export of these chemicals, enquiries are being made under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. As confidential information is involved, the parties concerned will be asked if they consent to its disclosure, and this may take some time. I will write to my noble friend as soon as possible and place a copy of that letter in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.5/1">UK Agriculture Ministers proposed the addition of Chardon LL to the UK National List in March. After objections to the proposal were raised, Mr Alun Alesbury was appointed by Ministers to hear representations in relation to the proposed listing, and a hearing is currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.5/2">The Government have now learned from the French authorities that the data from French trials on varietal distinctness, uniformity and stability (DUS), which supported the Chardon application for National Listing in the UK, were based on 1 year's data from accredited breeders' trials and 1 year's data from government-run trials. This is apparently one of the procedures allowed by the French authorities for DUS trials of new maize varieties. The relevant directive (72/180/EEC) requires two years of official trials.</p>
