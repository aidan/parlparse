	<p pid="a.81.3/1">Compensation has already been paid by the Government to the Chagossians. It was made in two stages: &pound;650,000 was paid to the Government of Mauritius for the benefit of the Chagossians in the early 1970s. This would be &pound;5.5 million at today's prices and was given for the express purpose of assisting resettlement.</p>

In addition, the Government of Mauritius made land available to the value of a further &pound;1 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.8/1">Of the 15 members of staff from the House of Lords seconded to PICT in January 2006, one has subsequently left the organisation and a second has submitted his resignation. However, steps have also been taken to fill a number of vacancies carried over from the previous House of Lords Computer Office. In addition to this, a former House of Lords member of staff has been appointed to the new dedicated role of House of Lords Members' Computing Officer.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.11/1">One of the strategic intentions behind the House of Lords' decision to participate in the Parliamentary Information and Communications Technology Service (PICT) was to ensure that the House could draw on a much larger pool of specialised skills than were previously available. In the new organisation some staff employed by the House of Lords continue to provide services dedicated to the House of Lords, while others now work on joint projects and infrastructure of benefit to both Houses. Equally, there are now staff employed by the House of Commons in PICT who are providing services and expertise to the House of Lords.</p>

Technical support is defined as addressing a fault in either hardware or software; and assistance in using software is also deemed as technical support. It is PICT policy that complaints are also logged and escalated to appropriate managers for response and appropriate follow-up action. Complaints may be defined as such by the caller, if they are not satisfied with a service, or through the escalation process either by a senior manager or the customer service team, should they decide that customer feedback is tantamount to a complaint.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-20">20 April 2006</phrase>, Kevin Hazelwood was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for public protection. He will be detained indefinitely, and may not be released until the parole board is satisfied that his continued detention is no longer necessary for public protection. He may not ask the parole board even to consider his case until he has served five years and seven months from the date of sentence. I have decided not to refer his case to the Court of Appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/2">In my public interest capacity, I have the power to refer certain sentences to the Court of Appeal as unduly lenient. Before doing so, I give very careful consideration to the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case, and am advised by independent, specialist lawyers on the sentence imposed. I have approached this case in this way, and have concluded that, as the law stands, the sentence for public protection imposed on Kevin Hazelwood is not one with which the Court of Appeal would be likely to interfere.</p>
