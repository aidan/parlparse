	<p pid="d.159.1/2" qnum="HL482">What is the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' current strategy to achieve its targets of reducing farming costs by 25 per cent by 2010; and</p>
	<p pid="d.159.1/3" qnum="HL483">Whether as part of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' simplification plan to reduce its administration costs an assessment will be made of whether United Kingdom farmers have been disadvantaged by over-implementation of regulations compared with other European Union member states.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-12-11d.159.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="159"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61211w0001.htm#06121122000032">
	<p pid="d.159.2/1">Defra does not have a target to reduce total costs to farmers by 25 per cent. However, we do have a commitment to reduce administrative burdens by 25 per cent by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.159.2/2">Lord Davidson's review on the implementation of EU legislation, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>, found that the unnecessary over-implementation of EU legislation may not be as widespread in the UK as is sometimes claimed. It is sometimes beneficial for the UK economy to set or maintain regulatory standards that exceed the minimum requirements of European legislation.</p>
	<p pid="d.159.2/3">However, the review did conclude that there were areas in the stock of legislation where regulatory burdens can be removed. The review included three Defra case studies: on waste legislation, on fisheries legislation and on the herd register for bovine animals. It makes specific recommendations for Defra in these areas. The report also includes wider recommendations to encourage the spread of best practice across departments in the implementation of EU legislation. Some of these build on Defra's existing best practice work.</p>
	<p pid="d.159.2/4">Defra's 2006 simplification plan, <I>Maximising Outcomes, Minimising Burdens</I>, will be published on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase> and will be available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/regulat/requlat.asp">www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/regulat/requlat.asp</a>. Copies of the plan will also be placed in the House Library. The Defra simplification plan will take forward the specific simplification proposals from Lord Davidson's review. In addition, the more generic recommendations which aim to further strengthen the implementation of EU legislation in the future will, if they are not already, be incorporated into our programme of better regulation culture change.</p>
	<p pid="d.159.2/5">The plan reports on the key findings from the cross-Whitehall exercise to measure the administrative burdens imposed by regulations, and how these burdens fall on different stakeholders. It also details simplification projects, many of which are already under way, which will ensure that Defra meets its commitment to reduce administrative burdens by 25 per cent by 2010. Reducing these burdens is just one aspect of better regulation and the plan details initiatives that will improve the way in which Defra and its delivery bodies interact with business. We are working with business stakeholders, including the National Farmers' Union, to develop these initiatives and to help to monitor our delivery of the plan as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="d.159.2/6">Defra's farm regulation and charging strategy, <I>Partners for Success</I>, was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-28">28 November 2005</phrase>. The strategy commits the Government to improving the way in which we regulate (and enforce regulation) and to reducing bureaucracy. This will improve farmers' capacity to help to protect the environment, animal health and welfare, food safety and worker safety. It is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/regulation/charge/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/regulation/charge/index.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="d.160.1/3" qnum="HL534">Whether they will reduce the charges that United Kingdom poultry producers are required to pay on an annual basis under the integrated pollution prevention and control regulations once they are registered under the scheme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-12-11d.160.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="160"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61211w0001.htm#06121122000039">
	<p pid="d.160.2/1">The integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) directive applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of industrial activities. This means that emissions to air, water (including discharges to sewer) and land, plus a range of other environmental effects, including noise and vibration, must be considered together before a permit is granted. IPPC aims to prevent emissions and waste production and, where that is not practicable, to reduce them to acceptable levels.</p>
	<p pid="d.160.2/2">The regulator must set permit conditions so as to achieve a high level of protection for the environment and human health as a whole. These conditions are based on the use of the &quot;best available techniques&quot;, which balances the costs to the operator against the benefits to the environment and human health.</p>
	<p pid="d.160.2/3">Regulatory costs have to be met by those whose activities cause the need for them and so cannot be waived. Intensive livestock installations will be charged &pound;3,331 for a permit application and then annual charges of &pound;2,229 for a small installation and &pound;2,794 for a large one. The IPPC directive applies only to poultry installations with places for more than 40,000 birds and to installations with places for more than 2,000 production pigs or 750 sows. Large units are those greater than 10 times the lower threshold&mdash;that is, those greater than 400,000 birds, 20,000 production pigs or 7,500 sows.</p>
	<p pid="d.160.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-19">19 May</phrase>, the industry accepted an offer from the Environment Agency whereby, provided that permit applications are received evenly through the <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January 2007</phrase> application period, a subsistence charge of &pound;1,471 for an existing small installation and &pound;1,844 for an existing large one will be made to industry from August 2007 until March 2008. This represents a substantial saving to industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.160.2/5">The IPPC directive is required to be implemented in its entirety in all member states by 2007. In the UK, the farming sector is among the last to be regulated by the national transposing regulations (with the exception of new installations). Most other industrial sectors have had to apply for an IPPC permit and comply with the provisions of the IPPC regime sooner than intensive livestock.</p>
	<p pid="d.160.2/6">Some EU member states may not charge for IPPC permit applications, but may recover varying proportions of their costs from the regulated industry, while others bear the cost in general taxation. This is a political decision for each national Government. The differing practices that are in place make it difficult to make comparisons of the costs to producers across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="d.160.2/7">I met representatives of the industry recently and assured them that I would look again at what might be able to be done to reduce the costs of these regulatory requirements.</p>

The UK continues to support the UN peacekeeping force, which is working with the new Congolese army to tackle the foreign armed groups. We are also supporting the reform and training of the new Congolese army by providing &pound;3 million for basic life needs support, such as tents and water.

	<p pid="d.164.2/1">It is the long-standing policy of the British Government not to offer consular assistance to non-British nationals, except in cases where a specific agreement to do so exists with another state. A recent Court of Appeal judgment in a judicial review application brought by some of the detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility who were formally resident in the UK confirmed that there is no duty on my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, in domestic or international law, to make the formal request for release and return from Guantanamo Bay sought by those detainees. In these proceedings, the Government's assessment was that the US Government would be very likely to resist any request for the release of the claimants, and that lobbying would make it more difficult for the UK to engage with the US on wider issues of detainee policy, including our wish to see the Guantanamo Bay detention facility closed.</p>

In addition to the development of the action plan, the department has announced the procurement of up to 300,000 audiology pathways to provide assessment, fitting and follow-up.

This has been the situation both prior to and following the closure of the Office for Contracted Prisons at the end of March 2006. The Home Office is responsible for contractual management, ensuring that contractors deliver the service as set out in the individual contracts. The chief executive of the National Offender Management Service is the ultimate authority for each contract. With the exception of HMP &amp; YOI Ashfield, this is delegated to regional offender managers for the area where the prison is located. Within each of the contracted establishments is a Home Office controller whose task is to ensure adherence to the contract on a day-to-day basis and to take remedial action in the event of non-compliance. The Home Office controllers are line-managed through the regional offender manager. The attached table lists contracted adult establishments and their respective regional offender managers.</p>

In reviewing the level of fixed penalties, the group normally considers relevant factors that might justify an across-the-board increase in the level of the standard fixed penalties and the small number of non-standard fixed penalties. It would not be practical to review individually the level of every fixed penalty.</p>
	<p pid="d.174.0/2">The group has to date received no representation proposing an increase in the fixed-penalty level for failing to comply with a statutory weight restriction.</p>

	<p pid="d.176.2/1">The operational management of HMP &amp; YOI Ashfield has always been the responsibility of Serco, the company holding the contract. This has been the situation both prior to and following the closure of the Office for Contracted Prisons at the end of March 2006. The Home Office is responsible for contractual management, ensuring that Serco delivers the service as set out in the contract. The chief executive of the National Offender Management Service is the ultimate authority for the contract. For HMP &amp; YOI Ashfield, this is delegated to the head of the commissioner's support bureau, which is part of NOMS. In fulfilling this task, the bureau works closely with the Youth Justice Board in identifying its requirements as the customer for Ashfield's services.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.2/2">As with all contracted establishments, there is a Home Office controller at Ashfield whose role is to ensure adherence to the contract on a day-to-day basis and to take remedial action in the event of non-compliance. The Home Office controller at Ashfield is line-managed through the head of the commissioner's support bureau.</p>
