Research to inform policy development is therefore a priority, and we can also draw on an extensive back-catalogue of work already conducted by Defra and its predecessors. Research is prominent in our commitments in the 2006 UK Climate Change Programme, including:</p>
	<p pid="c.116.8/2">research, at a cost of &pound;1 million over three years, to improve the inventory of emissions from agriculture;research on impacts and adaptation responses for land managers;research to improve our understanding of the contribution which improved land management practices, including environmental stewardship measures, can make to climate-change mitigation; andraising the efficiency of nitrogen use in agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="c.116.8/3">We are also developing a policy position, supported by research and development work, on the use of anaerobic digestion to reduce methane emissions. The full range of research and development projects&mdash;past, current and proposed&mdash;to reduce emissions are available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project_data/Default.asp">www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project_data/Default.asp</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.124.0/1">Giving priority to siblings in school admissions can support families, especially those with young children, and this is acknowledged in paragraph 2.10 of the draft new school admissions code. The Education and Skills Select Committee, in its 2004 report on secondary school admissions, supported the use of this criterion but was concerned that giving priority to siblings could also substantially reduce the number of school places available for other families, including those with only one child or where the eldest child has yet to start school. This is exacerbated if schools do not take account of a family's change of address when applying the sibling criterion or by the use of other criteria, such as catchment areas that are some distance from the school.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/2">Giving priority to siblings will reduce the number of places available to other families. At schools with a high proportion of selection by ability or aptitude there will be fewer non-selective places available for other families if siblings of those admitted by selection are given priority. Accordingly, paragraph 2.13 of the draft school admissions code states that priority for admission to schools that select more than 10 per cent of the intake by ability or aptitude should not be given to children on the basis that they have a sibling at the school. This is not an absolute prohibition; schools may continue to use the criterion but will need to justify doing so in the context of admission arrangements in their area if an objection is made to the schools adjudicator.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/3">Parental support for schools is important, and the Government recognise this in the draft new school admissions code. The Government are also aware that some partially selective schools are concerned that they will not be able to encourage a family ethos if they do not give priority to siblings. The new code will establish a clear and straightforward framework for school admissions that puts the family at the heart of the system. It is essential that we extend fair access and choice to all families, not just a few.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/4">To date, more than 2800 representations have been received on this issue, primarily from parents who have children at partially selective schools and who may have expected their younger children also to be admitted. All the responses to the consultation will be taken into account in preparing the new school admissions code, for which we will seek the approval of Parliament early in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="c.125.2/1">We expect local authorities to take action to ensure that any school in an Ofsted category is improved and removed from that category as soon as possible. Each of these schools will have its own mix of issues that need to be addressed and resolved with urgency. The Education Act 2006 will ensure that local authorities act more swiftly and decisively to turn round a school in special measures. The Act strengthens authorities' powers of intervention in such schools and, in order to protect the interests of children, provides for radical action such as closure to be taken where inadequate progress is being made after 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.126.2/1">UK Sport, the Government's lead agency for elite sport, currently invests in 29 of the 35 Olympic governing bodies of sport. Awards are made annually on the basis of investment in the governing bodies' World Class Performance Pathway. The total level of financial support received includes programme funding direct to the NGB, a budget for athlete personal awards, usually paid directly to the athlete by UK Sport, plus an allocation from TASS funding and for EIS service provision. A quarter payment would usually be a quarter of that total annual award; however, the actual amount received is variable, as it is subject to each sport's agreed drawdown requirement based on cash flow.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.2/2">For 15 of the Olympic summer sports receiving new or additional funding for London 2012, funding is also subject to their progress against a number of agreed performance and governance triggers. These triggers, in two distinct stages, were announced by UK Sport in April 2006 as a means to ensure that the governing bodies were &quot;fit for purpose&quot; in relation to their receiving public funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.2/3">For Q3, the final quarter of 2006, each sport will have been assessed against the funding triggers and the funding received based on their being in one of the following four categories:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.126.2/6"> <td>Category 1</td> <td>GB governance and performance management structure in place; all stage 1 and 2 performance and governance triggers met. In full receipt of Q1, Q2 and Q3 funding.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.126.2/7"> <td>Category 2</td> <td>GB governance and performance management structure in place; Q1 and Q2 funding released in full. Q3 funding initially limited to up to 75 per cent as not all stage 2 performance and governance triggers met.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.126.2/8"> <td>Category 3</td> <td>GB governance and performance management structure in place; Q1 funding available or released in full. Q2 and Q3 funding available at up to 50 per cent (depending on cash-flow need) while sports progress towards stage 1 funding triggers.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.126.2/9"> <td>Category 4</td> <td>GB governance and/or performance management structure not yet in place or additional 2012 award not yet issued, as awaiting implementation of existing award conditions.</td> </tr>
		</tbody>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-12-05c.130.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="130"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61205w0003.htm#06120575000517">
	<p pid="c.130.2/1">The information in the table details how many recipients in each Olympic sport received World Class Performance Pathway support in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 (accurate to November 2006) via UK Sport, the Government's lead agency for elite sport. The figures are based on athletes on UK Sport's World Class Performance Pathway programme in 2004-05 and 2005-06 and its World Class Podium programme in 2006-07. Each recipient would have received an average of &pound;45,000 programme support from their governing body plus a separate athlete personal award, usually paid directly to the athlete by UK Sport. The average payment made across each Olympic sport is in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.2/2">Funding per sport is guaranteed for each four-year Olympic cycle; therefore, programme funding is in place for each Olympic sport until March 2009 (the end of the Beijing cycle). The funding of each individual athlete in each sport is subject to a performance review at least annually, held by the performance director.</p>
