(HL4663)</p>
	<p pid="b.74.0/4">The most recent available information on registration of newly diagnosed cases of cancer (incidence) is for the year 2003. The latest figures on mortality are for the year 2004. Numbers of cases of cervical cancer by Strategic Health Authority are presented in Table 1 below. Numbers of deaths are given in Table 2. Age standardised mortality rates (directly standardised to the European standard population) are given in Table 3. These are presented as three-year moving averages from 1995, due to the small numbers of deaths in each Strategic Health Authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.81.9/1">Under the Freedom of Information Act, there is an appropriate limit, currently &pound;600 for central government and &pound;450 for other public authorities. This is there to prevent authorities being unable to perform their functions because of FoI requests, for which there has to be an upper limit. Under the current regime, departments can also, where appropriate, charge disbursements for providing information to applicants.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.9/2">After the first full year of its implementation, the Government are conducting an assessment of the Freedom of Information Act and considering its impact to ensure that it is operating well. When the fees regime was introduced, Ministers committed to reviewing its operation after a year. However, no decisions have yet been taken about any changes to the regime.</p>

It is anticipated that the appointments will be completed by mid-June for London vacancies and the end of September for vacancies in the regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.8/3">There is currently no backlog of asylum appeals at the AIT. However, between April and September 2005 the AIT accrued a backlog of entry clearance and family visitor appeals due to higher volumes of receipts, particularly family visitor appeals, than anticipated. These appeals were processed by the end of December 2005 and now form part of the tribunal's work in progress. They are currently awaiting appeal bundles from the relevant entry clearance posts and will be heard throughout the remainder of this calendar year. Planning for the clearance of these appeals was not contingent upon the appointments of additional immigration judges from the current competitions.</p>

In accordance with our obligations under the Ramallah agreement, our ambassador in Tel Aviv informed the Israeli authorities that we were delivering a letter in these terms on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase>.

We also raised our concerns on at least five separate occasions after this point. On 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase>, our ambassador in Tel Aviv informed the Israeli authorities that we might have to withdraw from the mission due to security concerns.
