To quote an average period taken would be misleading, even if the information were available. A minor change to the name of the device would require a new type approval order to be drawn up and signed. Modifications such as software changes could require considerable testing by the Police Scientific Development Branch of the Home Office before type approval could be recommended. Other modifications that do not have any direct bearing on the working of the device may be approved simply by a letter to the manufacturer.</p>

The Police and Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) of the Home Office is responsible for testing and evaluating new speed camera devices. PSDB ensures that all testing is completed as quickly as is practicable so that the police have the best equipment available. But proper and rigorous testing is essential, and applicants can take time to supply the relevant documentation and meet the necessary testing standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.6/1">Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons' report of his unannounced inspection is being published today. Copies have been made available in the Library and the Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/2">My noble and learned friend Lord Williams of Mostyn, the then Minister of State at the Home Office, made a Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="1999-06-28">28 June 1999</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 32-45), on the report of an unannounced full inspection of Wormwood Scrubs prison that had taken place in March 1999. That report made deeply disturbing reading. Sir David Ramsbotham's inspection had taken place against the background of criminal investigations into allegations that a number of members of staff at Wormwood Scrubs had assaulted prisoners. Sir David and his team of inspectors had found the overall treatment of prisoners was profoundly unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/3">In his Statement last year, my noble and learned friend Lord Williams of Mostyn, the then Minister of State at the Home Office, said that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary had made it absolutely clear to the Director General of the Prison Service that change must be delivered at Wormwood Scrubs. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary expected a robust action plan to be put in place quickly, and my noble and learned friend Lord Williams of Mostyn, the then Minister of State at the Home Office, expected the majority of Sir David's recommendations to be accepted and implemented. My noble and learned friend Lord Williams of Mostyn, the then Minister of State of the Home Office, reported that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary had asked Sir David Ramsbotham to carry out a further inspection in six months' time and that the result would be reported to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/4">The Chief Inspector returned to Wormwood Scrubs between 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-17">17 February</phrase> this year, and his report of that inspection is published today. He found Wormwood Scrubs much improved from his previous visit. Change had taken place, and life for prisoners has improved. Prisoners felt safer, and their relationships with staff were better. Healthcare was radically improved, education had been expanded and, together with employment, could attract most prisoners into purposeful activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/5">The extent of the changes required, including substantial cultural change, inevitably takes time. Nevertheless, the Chief Inspector found that a promising start had been made and real improvements had already been delivered. The report makes 99 recommendations for further improvement, but encouragingly identifies 12 examples of good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/6">I should like to pay tribute to all those who have contributed to this change. Senior managers at Prison Service headquarters have given the establishment both leadership and support. The Governor and his management team have tackled the problems at Wormwood Scrubs with determination and commitment, and their legitimate authority has been restored. It also gives me great pleasure to commend the staff of Wormwood Scrubs for what has been achieved. This time last year, there were serious concerns as to whether or not the Prison Officers' Association would co-operate fully with what needed to be done. Sir David notes the determination of the vast majority of staff in the prison to see Wormwood Scrubs restored to a place of excellence, known for the high quality of the treatment of, and conditions for, its prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/7">Staff at Wormwood Scrubs still face a difficult time. A number of staff are still suspended from duty in connection with the investigations into the allegations of assault. I understand that the first criminal trials are likely to start in the next few weeks, and this will bring further unwelcome attention on everyone connected with the establishment. Nevertheless, today's report shows how much has already been achieved in the face of these sorts of difficulties, and, with Sir David Ramsbotham, I am optimistic that the programme of improvement will be continued and completed at Wormwood Scrubs. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is still keeping the option of market-testing open, but we believe that this report shows the kind of rapid progress he had hoped for.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">The Chairman of the Environment Agency has provided me with a report of progress up to the end of April 2000. Copies are being placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">The Government are pleased to note that the major work programme set out in the action plan is almost complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">Key developments since the agency's last report, which covered the period to end of December 1999, are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/4" class="indent">Completion of the first phase of the telemetry works resulting in an additional 109 river level gauges, 16 river flow gauges and 65 rain gauges. These will enable conditions to be monitored during flooding and the calibration of flood models.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/5" class="indent">A concordat between the agency and the Meteorological Office has been signed to provide a framework for improved liaison and exchange of data.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/6" class="indent">The agency has completed its programme of visual inspections of its flood defences. Local authorities have inspected between 75 per cent and 90 per cent of their defences. The remainder are scheduled for completion by September in line with the Government's High Level Targets. Defences belonging to third parties have been inspected where identified through discussions with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/7" class="indent">Of the 1.6 million properties within the flood plain, 1 million addresses have been identified as high risk. This will enable flood risk information and other publicity material to be better targeted within the wider flood plain.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/8" class="indent">A letter designed to raise awareness of the flood risk to caravan sites has been produced and distributed together with a request for site owners to make visitors aware of such risks and what they should do in the event of a flood.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/9" class="indent">The agency is producing guidelines to enable the severity and extent of flooding to be calculated on a consistent basis in order to better inform post-event surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/10">Two activities have yet to be fully completed by the agency. These are the introduction of the new flood warning codes and revised management structures. The new flood warning codes are scheduled to be introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-12">12 September 2000</phrase>. The introduction of the revised management structures will be phased during April to September 2000 in order to minimise the risk of disruption to services.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/11">The agency's Easter Floods Project Team has now completed its work and is to be congratulated for its efforts in delivering the action plan and meeting the priorities we set out in striving for a seamless and integrated service of flood forecasting, warning and response. The outstanding issues will be taken forward by the agency's National Flood Warning Centre. Further activity in improving flood defence will be driven by the High Level Targets that the Government set last November.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/12">As regards the flooding earlier this month, the Government are acutely aware of the suffering experienced by many communities in Northern England, and express the Government's sympathy to all those affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/13">We have asked the Chairman of the Environment Agency to provide a report on the flooding, by <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-21">21 July 2000</phrase>, to include:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/14" class="indent">the impact of the flooding;</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/17" class="indent">to what extent the effects of these floods were mitigated as a result of the measures taken to implement the independent report of the Easter 1998 floods; and</p>

	<p pid="a.28.5/1">(a) The relevant procedures for RAF Boards of Inquiry at the time of the accident on the Mull of Kintyre in June 1994 provided no right of representation on behalf of deceased aircrew.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.5/2">(b) A RAF Board of Inquiry at that time was primarily intended to identify the cause of an accident and was not directly comparable to a British criminal court. However, where the cause was found to be human error, the board was also required to assess such failings. The RAF Flight Safety Manual (AP3207) stated that the finding of negligence must only be made where there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.5/3">(c) One of the conclusions of a review of Board of Inquiry procedures in 1997 was that such inquiries should no longer attribute blame in reporting the causes of accidents. This conclusion has now been put into effect. The terms under which the inquiry may be re-opened, in the event that new evidence came to light which justified that course, would need to be considered at that time.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.5/1">In reaching his decision on the closure of Merrywood School, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment was satisfied that approval would benefit pupils educationally. As the noble Lord is aware, the Secretary of State's decision was based on a number of factors, not least the poor educational opportunities the school offered its pupils. It is, I believe, relevant that Merrywood has been in special measures since April 1997 with very little evidence of any significant improvement in standards. The small number of pupils displaced by the school's closure will be likely to benefit by accessing a better standard of education if they attend alternative schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/2">the noble Lord will also be interested to hear that Bristol is included in the second phase of Excellence in Cities, which targets inner city under-achievement, and pupils from the area currently served by the school will be able to benefit from this programme. Finally, Bristol City Council has agreed to take forward plans to develop an education park based on the Merrywood site. It is intended that this park will provide lifelong learning activities and, in partnership with local schools, offer study support opportunities for local children.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-06-21a.34.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100298" speakername="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" colon=":" colnum="34"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000621/text/00621w03.htm#00621w03_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.34.0/1">There are two main criteria that are applied to determine eligibility for a winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/2">First, the person must be aged 60 or more in the relevant qualifying week and second, the person must be ordinarily resident in Great Britain. Adequate proof of age is therefore essential to ensuring that public money is being properly spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/3">Birth certificates, as certified copies of entries made by law concerning the date of birth of an individual, are the most effective means of verifying birth dates with regard to winter fuel payment claims. They are classed as primary evidence. However, a photocopy of a birth certificate can be accepted if it has been issued and endorsed by the appropriate authority, or has been notarised and stamped by any one of the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/4" class="indent">an established civil servant;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/5" class="indent">a member of the Foreign Service of the United Kingdom, Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service, or a British Diplomatic or Consular Officer;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/6" class="indent">a doctor or surgeon registered under the law of the country where the event occurred;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/7" class="indent">a minister of religion;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/8" class="indent">a barrister, solicitor or advocate who is authorised to practise in the country where the event occured;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/9" class="indent">a notary public* or any other person allowed to administer oaths in the country where the declaration is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/10" class="indent">a magistrate;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/11" class="indent">an officer of a bank who is authorised to sign documents on its behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/12">If, for whatever reason, it is not possible for someone who wishes to claim a winter fuel payment to locate their birth certificate, or if they do not possess one, then the department would ask for two pieces of secondary evidence. Secondary evidence includes items within the list below, which is not exhaustive:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/13" class="indent">a passport;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/14" class="indent">a certificate of baptism;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/15" class="indent">a certificate of confirmation;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/16" class="indent">a certificate of marriage;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/17" class="indent">a certificate of adoption;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/18" class="indent">a National Health Service medical card;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/19" class="indent">a certificate of naturalisation, alien's registration card, Home Office travel document;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/20" class="indent">a certificate of service in HM forces;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/21" class="indent">a certificate of employment under the Crown;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/22" class="indent">a certificate of service in the mercantile marine;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/23" class="indent">a certificate of membership of a trade union or friendly society;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/24" class="indent">apprenticeship indentures;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/25" class="indent">an early certificate or testimonial from an employer;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/26" class="indent">life insurance policy;</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/27" class="indent">membership cards or papers of an approved society or unemployment insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/28">A claim to a winter fuel payment would not be refused on the basis of it not being accompanied by an original birth certificate. There are therefore no budgeting savings. There is also no question of any fraud investigation or prosecution being instigated because someone fails to provide such evidence. *A notary public (or notary) is a public official, usually a solicitor, whom the law allows to certify documents.</p>
