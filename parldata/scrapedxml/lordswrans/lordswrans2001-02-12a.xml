These estimates should be treated with caution as they are based on 1999 claim data, and the relevant data on market prices in 2000 are not yet available.

	<p pid="a.6.3/1">The BSE inquiry report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-26">26 October 2000</phrase>. In welcoming it, we said that the Government's substantive response would be announced in the coming months. The Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-21">21 December 2000</phrase> that they would be making an interim response as a basis for public discussion before finalising their full response.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/2">The Government's interim response was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">Friday, 9 February</phrase>. There will be a parliamentary debate on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase>. The response has been prepared with contributions from across Whitehall and the devolved administrations and seeks to present the actions being taken in all the legislatures.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/3">This response is intended to focus on the future. It sets out what has happened since March 1996--which was the point to which we asked the inquiry to take its examination. It gives full attention to the 167 specific findings and conclusions in the inquiry report, and to the major themes that emerge from it: management of scientific advisory committees and how scientific advice is used in developing policy; openness; risk and uncertainty; the structure of government and the legislative framework; and the need for rigour in the development and implementation of policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/4">The response takes the opportunity to set out how the Government are taking the lessons and comments in the report as a spur to developing the action already under way as a result of the Modernising Government agenda, the Office of Science and Technology's work on the use of science in government and work on developing a government statement on risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/5">The Government intend that this interim response should be the subject of positive action to seek the views of interested parties. Public debate on how the lessons in the report can be most effectively applied and embedded across departments will help to ensure a comprehensive final government response to the BSE inquiry report.</p>

The authority licensed the project, so far as it related to paragraph 3(2)(a) of Schedule 2 to the 1990 Act to &quot;promote advances in the treatment of infertility&quot;, as it aimed, among other things, to provide new information in identifying the quality of embryos before implantation.

This code contains a requirement to declare at an early stage any potential conflict of interest that might arise in the course of authority business. Any relevant business interests, positions of authority or other connections with commercial, public or voluntary bodies must be declared.</p>

In preparation for further local loop unbundling, nearly 700 exchanges have been surveyed by BT, though it is ultimately up to individual operators where they place orders for unbundling facilities. It was agreed last month that BT would bring forward work on unbundling at the most popular exchanges and building work at the first of those exchanges should start before Easter. Requests for &quot;distant location&quot;, where an operator locates its equipment outside the local exchange, are going forward on a business as usual basis with BT.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.6/1">The figures quoted in the Daily Telegraph are taken from the recently published Home Office study Migration: An economic and social analysis. These figures represent an initial estimate of the fiscal contribution that migrants make to the economy--that is the value of the taxes they pay over and above what they consume in benefits and other public services. However, as noted in the Home Office study, there are a wide range of possible assumptions that affect estimates of the contributions of both migrants and the UK-born population. Work is under way to refine these assumptions and it is the intention to publish the findings from this analysis, which will include details of the methodology used and the calculations.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.5/1">The 2001 report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which makes recommendations about the pay of the senior Civil Service, senior military personnel and the judiciary, together with the annual uprating of parliamentary salaries, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-09">9 February 2001</phrase>. Copies are in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the chairman and members of the Review Body for their work.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.5/3" class="indent">an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> of 3 per cent in the minimum and maximum values of each of the pay bands for the senior Civil Service. Within the bands, departments will determine individual awards on the basis of performance. As last year, a further 0.4 per cent of the total senior Civil Service paybill should be made available to fund additional performance awards for the most senior staff, whose pay has fallen well behind comparable remuneration elsewhere;</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/4" class="indent">an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> of 3.7 per cent in judicial salaries; and</p>

	<p pid="a.21.5/6">The Government have decided to accept these recommendations. Their cost will be met within existing Departmental Expenditure Limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/7">Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the increase in pay bands for the senior Civil Service. Their pay entitlement will therefore increase from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> by 3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.5/1">I believe that in general the heating in the House of Lords is adequate for comfortable working. But satisfactory heating control in this building is undoubtedly difficult because of its age, construction and layout. In the event of any local discomfort, if a telephone call is made to the helpdesk (telephone extension 4747), the Works Directorate will do everything it can to assist.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/2">The heating is controlled by a computerised building energy management system which balances operational control with energy conservation. The system takes account of external temperature to calculate the optimum time to start the heating. In cold weather, particularly on a Sunday night, the shift technician makes a judgment whether to override the computer and start the heating earlier. The temperature settings in various parts of the Palace relate to the respective uses of the rooms. Occupants have widely differing comfort requirements, but heating technicians endeavour to meet personal preferences.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/3">The works rolling programme includes heating modernisation and improvement projects. The main Palace boilers are to be renewed in 2002-03. Heating and air conditioning is being improved in three committee rooms each year. &pound;300,000 is spent each year on the modernisation of basement plant rooms, and each summer recess, as part of the PDVN installation project, heating is modernised and other maintenance is carried out in a section of the building.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/4">One further difficulty is that, in very cold weather, the doors which have to remain open for the Line of Route allow in a great deal of cold air. At these times it is only after 1 pm that the Royal Gallery, Prince's Chamber and the Chamber itself can really warm up.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/5">If an occupant requires additional heating in a room, an electric heater can be provided, subject to the loading on the electrical distribution. Seventy electric heaters have been issued. They are regularly checked for safety under a portable appliance testing contract. There is clearly a safety implication if they are left on overnight or over weekends.</p>
