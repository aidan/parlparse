The key recommendation of the review was that future studies should focus on improving the long-term health of Gulf veterans with persisting symptoms. The focus of our research effort is, therefore, to identify suitable rehabilitative interventions for those veterans, and a contract has been awarded to a group at Cardiff University, acknowledged experts in this field.

	<p pid="a.290.2/1">The Government continue to be concerned about human rights in Russia, including psychiatric detention, media freedom, journalists' safety, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and actively look for ways to raise them with the Russian authorities. The most recent Foreign and Commonwealth Office human rights report highlights these concerns. All of these issues were raised bilaterally in the human rights consultations held in February 2007 and we are pressing the Russian Government to agree the date of the next round of bilateral discussions. They were also raised in EU/Russia human rights consultations on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-20">20 October 2008</phrase>. The EU has previously raised individual cases of alleged politically motivated forced psychiatric treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.2/2">The Government have also made representations, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, on the extremist activity law, including extension of the legal definition of extremism to include &quot;the abasement of national dignity&quot; and &quot;public slander of a state official&quot;.</p>
