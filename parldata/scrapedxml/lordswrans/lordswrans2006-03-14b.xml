The report is available on the Department for Transport's website. Further work is in hand to assess the potential mode share impacts, in the context of the project for the sustainable development of Heathrow.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.6/1">Since 1997 three specific coalfield programmes have been established in England. These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/2" class="italic">The National Coalfields Programme</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/3">The National Coalfields Programme is delivered by English Partnerships and the regional development agencies (RDA). The programme, made up originally of 86 sites throughout England, was established as a result of the findings of the Coalfields Task Force in 1998 and followed the initial transfer of 56 former British Coal sites to English Partnerships at the end of 1996. The programme has since been increased to cover 101 sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/4">The total investment to date has been &pound;338.4 million and the investment for the total programme is expected to exceed &pound;600 million, including recycled receipts. The programme is on target to create 42,000 jobs with 14,936 established to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/5">Where possible, English Partnerships seeks European funding through either RDA or local authority partners. Three sites, at Wath upon Dearne, Dinnington and Grimethorpe have been successful in securing Objective 1 funding to support industrial development. In addition, Objective 1 funding has contributed, alongside funds from the South Yorkshire Forest partnership, to environmental works on three further sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/6" class="italic">The Coalfields Regeneration Trust</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/7">The Coalfields Regeneration Trust, which operates throughout the English coalfields, was established in 1999. The trust is an independent grant-giving body that seeks to spearhead the social and economic regeneration of the coalfields working with a wide range of partners. The total agreed budget for the trust from establishment to the end of the current funding agreement in March 2008 is approximately &pound;150 million. The trust's Skillsbuilder programme introduced following the closure of the Prince of Wales colliery has so far resulted in 558 former miners moving directly into new jobs and the Selby retraining scheme helped a further 550 former miners into jobs. The trust's programmes in total have created over 1,000 jobs and assisted 11,646 people into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/8">A total of &pound;750,000 of Objective 1 funding has been directly matched to Coalfields Regeneration Trust funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/9" class="italic">The Coalfields Enterprise Fund</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/10">The Coalfields Enterprise Fund is a venture capital fund launched in April 2004 aimed at investing in small and medium sized companies with growth potential in the former coalfields. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister made a one-off investment of &pound;10 million into the fund in 2004&ndash;5 which with match funding is expected to provide up to &pound;25 million investment into the coalfields.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.6/11">In Yorkshire more generally, Objective 1 funding has supported over 550 projects with grant of &pound;670 million involving total expenditure of over &pound;2.1 billion. The programme has created over 16,500 jobs, assisted over 6,500 businesses and attracted over 300 new businesses to the sub-region.</p>

	<p pid="b.208.0/1">Around half of DFID's &pound;54 million programme to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) this financial year supports humanitarian work. We are supporting the UN High Commission for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs Rapid Reaction Fund, Oxfam, International Rescue Committee (IRC) and other NGOs to support refugees, displaced persons and their host communities, including those affected by recent violence in eastern DRC. As just one example of what this support provides, the UK's &pound;683,000 grant to IRC is providing vaccinations against preventable diseases, increased access to water and sanitation and improved food security for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities in South Kivu.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/2">The Secretary of State for International Development this week announced that we would continue to increase our humanitarian support to DRC&mdash;up to &pound;30 million in 2006 and the same in 2007. Most of this will go to the UN action plan. The money will be put at the disposal of the humanitarian co-ordinator in DRC who will be able to distribute the funds quickly and flexibly as priority needs dictate. One of the action plan's main elements is the protection of vulnerable populations, including refugees. It will support emergency health, sanitation and nutritional provision, as well as supporting the safe and dignified return of Congolese refugees from neighbouring countries. It will also help to rebuild the lives of returnees, including the rehabilitation of basic services and provision of basic household goods.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/3">The UK also works at several levels to help put an end to the continuing pockets of conflict in DRC. We are a member of a group of ambassadors and senior UN and EU representatives supporting the transition to democracy in DRC (CIAT&mdash;<i>Comit&eacute; International d'Accompagnement de la Transition</i>). CIAT has consistently pushed the Congolese transitional government for faster progress in a number of key areas, notably preparations for elections, security sector reform, disarming militias and ending corruption. We are pressing the transitional government to work together to make the democratic process a success, and avoid a return to conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/4">The presence of foreign armed groups in eastern DRC&mdash;such as Rwandan ex-FAR/Interahamwe and various Ugandan groups&mdash;is a continuing source of instability. We support the UN's more robust stance against these groups and have consistently urged the DRC's neighbours to work constructively in support of the peace process in the DRC. We have also emphasised with the UN and Congolese authorities that all operations against militia groups must take into account the potential impact on the local population.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/5">Ill-disciplined and underpaid members of the Congolese armed forces (FARDC&mdash;Forces Arm&eacute;es de la R&eacute;publique Democratique du Congo) are also creating insecurity for local communities. The Secretary of State for International Development visited DRG in October last year and stressed, in discussions with President Kabila and other members of the Government the need to provide properly for DRC's security forces. He offered &pound;3 million of UK support for accommodation, water and human rights training, but on the condition that the Congolese Government pay and feed their troops first. The UK is providing two members of the EU Security Sector Reform Mission in DRC to assist with the army integration process. The UK and international partners also formally presented a dossier to President Kabila on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase> this year cataloguing the most serious abuses carried out by FARDC soldiers, urging that the soldiers concerned be brought to justice.</p>

	<p pid="b.218.6/1">The focus of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the south is on supporting Sudanese refugees returning from surrounding countries. The UNHCR has agreements or is in discussions with the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Ethiopia concerning Sudanese refugee repatriation. The UNHCR also provides assistance to movements of internally displaced people within the south and Darfur. The primary agency for north-south returns is the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and Returns, Reintegration and Recovery Unit (RRR).</p>
	<p pid="b.218.6/2">The UK is actively involved with all UN agencies on the issue of returning refugees, including through weekly returns co-ordination meetings in Khartoum. We remain concerned about the ability of many areas to absorb and integrate large numbers of returning refugees and have been working with the UN, NGOs and the Government of South Sudan to ensure these issues are addressed. To support this, the UK is providing early and significant contributions to the UN 2006 work plan, from which the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator has already allocated over $40 million to the south. For longer term recovery and development in the south, the UK is establishing the &pound;l0 million service delivery fund. This will act as a bridge to the multi-donor trust fund while it develops projects to meet longer-term development needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.2/1">The Khartoum State is host to approximately 4 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) from across Sudan. The IDP population has increased since the 1980s, in both camp and non-camp environments, and presents the Khartoum authorities with significant concerns for urban planning. In March 2004, the Sudanese Government stepped up a process of demolitions and interruption of essential services as a way of moving IDPs to new sites. We have consistently made clear that while we acknowledge the right of the Sudanese authorities to re-plan their urban environment, the process must be guided by international human rights conventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/2">The UK and international community have been working closely with the Government of Sudan to ensure that their treatment of IDPs is compliant with these conventions. The UK has funded a number of projects in this regard, including providing an expert to work with the Khartoum authorities on settlement and re-planning in Khartoum State. The majority of the interventions in Khartoum State are under the UN's 2006 work plan for Sudan, to which the UK is contributing &pound;40 million. They will focus on providing essential services for IDPs.</p>

The report also stresses that the crimes which have taken place in Darfur,</p>

	<p pid="b.220.2/3">We are clear that grave abuses of human rights have occurred and are still occurring in Darfur. There must be no impunity for those who have committed these crimes and those responsible must be brought to justice. We strongly support the International Criminal Court, which is now conducting a formal investigation into the situation in Darfur. Both my right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development made clear during their respective visits to the Darfur peace talks in Abuja and Sudan, including Darfur, in February 2006 that the parties must take urgent steps to improve the situation in Darfur and bring those responsible for atrocities to justice.</p>
