	<p pid="a.97.2/1">We have serious concerns about the use of the death penalty in Iran. Ministers and officials have pressed the Iranian authorities on many occasions to address this.

We will be raising this case with the Iranian authorities and seeking clarification of the ages of the men at the time the alleged offence took place. The imposition of the death sentence for offences committed by those under the age of 18 would violate Iran's freely undertaken obligations under Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 37 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">It is a longstanding principle that, where it is cost effective to do so, recovery is sought of all overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">The Department for Work and Pensions seeks to recover social security overpayments where customers innocently or otherwise, provide incorrect information in relation to their claim or fail to notify a change of circumstances. In addition, the department seeks to recover overpayments that are not recoverable under social security legislation&mdash;for example, paid twice for the same period. This is on the basis that customers have no right to retain money that they should not have received. The department's policy is to seek recovery in the cases where it is reasonable to expect the customer to have been aware of the overpayment.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">Rates of recovery are set to avoid undue hardship and take account of the financial and personal circumstances of the customer. In exceptional circumstances the Secretary of State can exercise his discretion to waive recovery of an overpayment to avoid severe hardship or where the recovery would be against the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/4">With regard to housing and council tax benefits, the local authority must decide whether an overpayment is legally recoverable and, if it is, whether it should actually recover it. This decision, as well as the method and rate of recovery, is the responsibility of the local authority. The authority must have regard to the customer's financial circumstances and avoid causing hardship to either customers or any of their dependants.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/5">The policy of HM Revenue and Customs on recovery of tax credit overpayments is set out in its Code of Practice 26, <i>What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?</i> The criteria used to determine whether overpayments of tax credits should be remitted are contained in Code of Practice 26.</p>
