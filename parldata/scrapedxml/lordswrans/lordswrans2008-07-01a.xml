	<p pid="a.25.5/1">Airspace planning and regulation is the responsibility of the independent Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The process for making changes to airspace is governed by the CAA's airspace change process. Under this process it is for airspace change sponsors, for example NATS, to develop and consult on proposals. Detailed guidance is given on what impacts are to be taken into account, how they should be measured and who should be consulted. Informed by the consultation, the sponsor submits the proposal to the CAA's directorate of airspace policy for assessment against regulatory requirements. In determining whether to accept or reject a proposal, the CAA's process reflects the Secretary of State for Transport's directions and guidance to the CAA on the exercise of its statutory duties and environmental objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.5/1">The National Asylum Support Service has ceased to exist but the functions it carried out continue through the regional asylum teams. All asylum seekers are informed by the regional asylum teams about their entitlement to NHS treatment at their first reporting event.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/2">Eligibility for free NHS care is based on ordinary residence in the UK. General Practitioners have discretion to register patients for primary care and Department of Health guidance is that asylum seekers should be so registered. In England, asylum seekers awaiting a final decision on their claims are exempt from charges for NHS hospital treatment under the NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989 as amended. Unsuccessful claimants may continue free of charge until they leave the country with a course of treatment which had already started before appeal rights were exhausted. In the recent case of YA (Palestine) v The Secretary of State for Health, the judge has ruled that failed asylum seekers may potentially be deemed &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; for the purposes of NHS regulations and therefore entitled to free treatment on the same basis as other residents. The Department of Health has appealed against this judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/3">The rules relating to healthcare for foreign nationals in England are currently being reviewed jointly by the UK Border Agency and the Department of Health. The review has looked at a range of issues regarding immigration and asylum, including the eligibility of failed asylum seekers and their children. Proposals will go out to public consultation shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/4">Similar provisions apply in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Department of Health is intending to engage with the devolved Administrations following the completion of the review in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/1">The priorities for THINK! road safety campaigns in the current financial year and allocated budgets are:</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/2">Drink drive, &pound;3.6 million. There are two campaigns a year, in June and December. Our primary target audience is male drivers under the age of 30 and the strategy is to make them believe there is a strong likelihood that they will get caught if they drive over the legal alcohol limit and to inform them of the consequences, both legal and to the quality of their life, of a conviction.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/3">Motorbike safety, &pound;2.5 million. There are two main strands to the motorcycle campaign. The first is aimed primarily at car drivers and consists of a TV commercial prompting them to look out for motorcycles when driving. The second is a sponsorship of British Superbikes and is aimed at leisure bikers.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/4">Speeding, &pound;3 million. We have a TV campaign aimed at all drivers in urban areas which highlights the dangers to pedestrians of exceeding the 30 mph speed limit with the proposition: &quot;Hit a child at 40 mph and she has an 80 per cent chance of being killed, but hit her at 30 mph and she has an 80 per cent chance of surviving&quot;. There is also a campaign on radio and outdoor media highlighting the dangers of driving too fast on rural roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/5">Seatbelt wearing, &pound;3 million. A new seatbelt campaign is in development and will be launched in October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/6">Children, teenagers and parents, &pound;4.1 million. We have campaigns aimed at primary school children designed to help them learn the green cross code and at teenagers reminding them that they should avoid distractions on the roads. We also target parents with the message that children copy behaviours that they see their parents practise, so they should ensure that they always set a good example when using the roads.</p>

This is a matter for the US Administration and the companies involved. It is hoped that the contract with Northrop Grumman teamed with EADS, which involves final assembly of the aircraft in Mobile, Alabama, and manufacture of wing sets by Airbus UK, can be finalised soon.</p>
