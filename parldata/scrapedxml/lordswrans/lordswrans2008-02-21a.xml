	<p pid="a.83.2/1">Both advisory committees for cervical and breast screening have discussed the issue of diethylstilbestrol (DES) and have agreed that women who took DES and their daughters should be managed individually and should discuss any concerns they have with their general practitioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.2/2">Regarding cervical cancer, women exposed to DES in utero should be offered an initial colposcopic examination, if there is an absence of abnormalities only routine cervical screening is required. If abnormalities are found annual colposcopic examination of the vagina and cervix, at a specialist centre, may be required. However, this would need to be considered on an individual basis between the woman and her gynaecologist.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.2/3">The risk of breast cancer in women who were prescribed DES is thought to be relatively small. The National Health Service breast screening programme does not identify women who are at an above average risk of developing breast cancer and therefore does not invite such women more often. It is therefore important that these women take up their invitation to be screened when it is offered and to be breast aware, so that they can spot the signs/symptoms of breast cancer and seek medical help early.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.2/1">In 2007-08 a service level agreement (SLA) and accountability framework has been issued to ensure that strategic health authorities (SHAs) are held to account for the training they support. The SLA also sets out that there should be a learning and development agreement in place with service providers to underpin the education and training funds passed to National Health Service trusts. The role of the department should be to focus on outputs and accountability rather than on ensuring that a fixed amount of money is spent for a particular purpose regardless of local priorities. SHAs were asked in July 2007 to provide a report on their performance against a variety of key performance indicators set out in the service level agreement. They were expected to publish an annual investment plan by <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-30">30 June 2007</phrase> which was based on long-term workforce planning.
