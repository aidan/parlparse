	<p pid="a.78.0/1">The Community Rail Awards are organised by the Association of Community Rail Partnerships (ACoRP). Individual awards are sponsored by a number of rail industry bodies including the Department for Transport. There were more than 200 nominations for this year's awards, which are clearly serving their purpose of rewarding innovative activity on community railways, by operators and by volunteers, and of stimulating further such activity. The Government welcome ACoRP's initiative in launching the awards.</p>
