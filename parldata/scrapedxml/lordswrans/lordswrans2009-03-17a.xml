	<p pid="a.15.2/1">The Government recognise that climate change is one of the most serious challenges facing the world today, and helping all sectors of the economy address this challenge is a key priority. The livestock sector makes a significant contribution to UK eating habits as part of a healthy balanced diet, and also sustains traditional landscapes and habitats. The meat and livestock industry recognises that it needs to reduce its environmental impact and is developing a road map to achieve this, which is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/2">Consumers also have a role to play and want to be able to make informed choices about what they eat. They are less receptive to being told by others what they should eat. Our approach is to support industry efforts to maximise the benefits it delivers and minimise the negative impacts, and to ensure consumers have access to information that they can rely on to make informed choices about their diet and lifestyle.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.0/1">Detailed information about the cost of implementation in England is provided in the regulatory impact assessment on electronic identification (EID) of sheep and goats. This is available on the Defra website. An updated version will accompany the consultation that is planned for the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/2">We have always taken the view that the cost of implementing EID is disproportionate to the benefits. However, the majority of other member states do not share our concerns. Hilary Benn recently raised these concerns again directly with Commissioner Vassiliou, and will continue to press for further changes to the requirements to help reduce the implementation burdens on our industry. However, EID is an EU obligation which we have to implement from <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December 2009</phrase>; failure to do so is likely to result in single farm payment disallowance and EU infraction proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/3">Independent epidemiological modelling has identified that the introduction of EID and individual recording could reduce costs of managing an outbreak of exotic disease over the current UK system by up to 13 per cent as a result of fewer infected premises and fewer animals being culled. It will also improve our ability to track individual animal movements. There will also be management benefits for those farmers who want to make use of EID and gather individual performance data to make their businesses more profitable.</p>

The National Bee Unit provides written material on Varroa management (available on its Beebase website) and issues advice to beekeepers both through comprehensive training sessions on effective management of Varroa and when visiting individual beekeepers.

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">The Government fully understand recent concerns over high interest rates that some lenders charge. We secured agreement from credit card lenders to develop fair principles for any interest rate increase they introduce on reviewing an individual's account. These came into force in January 2009 and provide extra protections when a customer's or group of customers' interest rate is changed as a result of a perceived change in their ability to repay their debts. The Government have also implemented a number of measures to provide vulnerable and low-income consumers with access to affordable credit and free debt advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">The Government are monitoring the market for high-cost credit closely, including through the new Consumer Finance Forum, chaired by Gareth Thomas, the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Our analysis suggests that lenders within this sector are beginning to support higher income groups or having to leave the market altogether because of their own financing difficulties. This is putting low-income groups at risk of being forced into the hands of illegal money lenders. We have established dedicated illegal money-lending teams across the UK to tackle this criminal activity, but we also want to avoid further restricting access to credit for these more vulnerable groups. The Government are not persuaded of the case for an interest rate cap because of the risk it will force more low-income consumers into the hands of illegal lenders. This view was supported by the Competition Commission in its market investigation of the home credit sector.</p>

Some of these may relate to premises which are not authorised to sell or supply alcohol, because under the Licensing Act 2003 premises licences and club premises certificates are not confined to authorising the sale or supply of alcohol; they can also provide regulated entertainment and/or late night refreshment.</p>
