BAA sits as an observer on the Department for Transport's Stansted project board and is therefore present during discussions on project progress. This group manages the work that it is necessary for the Government to undertake in order to ensure the delivery of its policies relating to increased capacity at Stansted. BAA's director of Stansted Generation 2 regularly meets senior officials in the department to update them on BAA's progress towards submitting its planning application for a second runway. The department has engaged with BAA to ensure that BAA's surface access modelling work complies with the department's standards. The respective legal and policy teams have also met to discuss timetabling and to ensure that all the necessary legal procedures are on track.</p>

If someone decides to employ a personal assistant directly (even for only a few hours a week), they have the same legal responsibilities as any employer has towards their employee.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.5/2">We know that these sorts of responsibilities&mdash;for example, paying tax and national insurance and arranging liability insurance and the provision of statutory leave entitlements&mdash;can be a barrier to the uptake of direct payments.

This compares with a figure of &pound;9 million at 2005-06 prices in the outline business case published in 2005. The scope of the IT procurement expanded between the outline and full business case to include furniture, training, station-end equipment and implementation of an integrated risk management tool for the fire rescue and service.</p>

In performing this function, they carry out elements of the former role of county councils in drawing up structure plans, which was abolished by the 2004 Act.

	<p pid="b.122.2/1">The European Court of Human Rights judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November 2007</phrase> on application no. 57325/00 found evidence of adverse discrimination by the Czech Republic because children of Roma origin were disproportionately assigned to special schools and thereby denied access to mainstream schools. This judgment has no direct relevance to England since parents have free choice of schools, and the issue is rather how to encourage greater take-up of schooling by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children, whether in mainstream or special schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.2/2">The Government are committed to enabling all pupils, regardless of their background, to achieve their potential. Local authorities have a duty to ensure that all children of compulsory school age have access to education, regardless of their nationality or ethnicity. In a speech on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-17">17 October 2007</phrase> the Secretary of State reaffirmed his belief that many local authorities and schools need to do more to improve school outcomes for Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children. He said that some local authorities were turning around their low attainment, in particular, by involving parents in designing the services they provide, and by engaging them much earlier through children's centres; and that this should happen in every area.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.2/3">The Government have developed a national programme which supports local authorities and schools to meet the needs of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children. This programme, launched in September 2006, works with parents to boost attendance, using e-learning and mobility projects to help pupils whose schooling is interrupted. The programme will be extended to involve more secondary schools, and to increase the number of local authorities. The Government would also support proposals for a Gypsy, Roma and Traveller history month in June 2008 to raise awareness.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.2/1">As I said in my earlier reply of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-23">23 October</phrase>, I am very sorry that the department's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> to Mrs Bullock was open to misinterpretation, and an apology has been sent to Mrs Bullock, copied to the Archer inquiry team. However, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I can assure the noble Lord that at no time did anyone in the department claim that Lord Archer of Sandwell had &quot;ignored the department's offer of a meeting with the inquiry&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/2">The letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> was prepared by the department's customer service centre, using information supplied by the blood policy team. The letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Department of Health officials met with members of the inquiry team on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-25">25 April</phrase> to discuss how the Department may assist. In the months since April, the Department has suggested further meetings with the inquiry team, but as yet Lord Archer's team has not arranged to meet again&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/4">This was intended to convey that the department remained ready to meet Lord Archer's team and I am sorry if any other interpretation was possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/5">Mrs Bullock replied to the department on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-24">24 August</phrase>. Mrs Bullock's letter alerted us to the possibility that our own letter may be capable of different interpretations, as Mrs Bullock's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-24">24 August</phrase> stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/6" class="indent">&quot;You have written that for five months the Dep. of Health has, 'suggested further meetings with the enquiry team', but that these requests have been ignored or refused by Lord Archer's team&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/7">Mrs Bullock requested information about contacts between the department and Lord Archer's inquiry team and her request was brought to the attention of the blood policy team. A reply to Mrs Bullock, copied to the Archer inquiry team, was sent from a freedom of information officer in the department on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-17">17 September</phrase> and stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Thank you for your further letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-22">22 August</phrase> requesting information on the dates the Department wrote to Lord Archer's inquiry team suggesting a meeting. We are treating your letter as a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Your letter has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/9" class="indent">I am sorry if our reply of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> to your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-09">9 July</phrase> to Alan Johnson was misleading in this respect. For your information, I attach two e-mails between the inquiry team and the Department suggesting a meeting once the inquiry team has had an opportunity to hear all the evidence and review relevant documentation which we are making available. No criticism of the inquiry team was intended and I apologise for the unfortunate wording of the previous letter.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/10" class="indent">As you know, officials met with the inquiry team on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-25">25 April</phrase>. We appreciate that the inquiry team is currently occupied in hearing evidence, and will no doubt contact the Department once it has completed this process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/11">During the time that this further reply was in preparation, the department's head of blood policy received a letter from Lord Archer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-04">4 September</phrase>, stating that his attention had been called to the department's first reply to Mrs Bullock of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> and that he was concerned that the letter could be taken to imply that requests for a meeting had been ignored by the inquiry team. He asked that the department take steps to avoid repeating any misconception in future correspondence.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/12">The head of blood policy immediately spoke to Lord Archer to apologise for any misunderstanding. When a reply had been sent to Mrs Bullock, the head of blood policy contacted Lord Archer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-18">18 September</phrase> to repeat his apology in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/13" class="indent">&quot;The department's initial response to Mrs Bullock was written by our customer service centre and they have written again to Mrs Bullock apologising for the misleading impression they gave that your inquiry team had ignored our offer of a further meeting. I apologise that the erroneous impression was given, in the original letter, that your team had ignored our offer: this is not the case and I too was concerned when I saw the initial reply to Mrs Bullock&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/14">The department has now met the inquiry team again, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-19">19 September</phrase>. The department has also copied to the inquiry team, in stages from June to October, several thousand official documents identified in the <I>Review of Documentation relating to the Safety of Blood and Blood Products (1970-1985</I><I>)</I>, which was issued in May 2007. I can therefore assure the noble Lord that our officials are co-operating fully with the inquiry team.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.2/15">Officials have traced 11 pieces of correspondence in July and August that used the same information. These were received and replied to before we were aware of any possible misunderstanding from the wording used. A follow-up letter has been sent to clarify our position and prevent any further misunderstanding.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.5/1">There is ongoing work to minimise the peak and average energy requirements of the House of Lords areas within the Parliamentary Estate while continuing to allow the House to work efficiently. Much work is undertaken during routine maintenance, especially to replace older-style lamps with modern low-energy lamps as carried out in the Lords Chamber during 2006. Major items of equipment, when near to the end of their lives, are always replaced with more efficient models, as was the case during replacement of the main heating boilers in the Palace in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.5/2">The control of heating and cooling systems in all buildings on the Parliamentary Estate is monitored by a Building Management System which is supervised around the clock by staff in Parliamentary Works Services.

WA 47</phrase>) which provides further details. It is looking at many issues including road safety and how any route compliance could be assured if such lorries were to be permitted. It will also assess the implications arising from the European single market if these vehicles were to be allowed, although it is not considering whether heavier lorries will be driven by foreign operators and drivers, nor is it looking at taxation which is a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.0/3">The benefits of the move to 44 tonnes were reviewed in 2004 by Heriot-Watt University, who compared the effects of increasing the maximum weight of lorries from 41 tonnes with their forecasts made for the Commission for Integrated Transport in 2001. The results showed that the benefits were greater than predicted.</p>
