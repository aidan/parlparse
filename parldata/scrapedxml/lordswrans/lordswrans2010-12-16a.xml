The review of the two statutory advisory NDPBs, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) and the Animal Procedures Committee (APC), commenced simultaneously in autumn 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/2">Following the dismissal of the ACMD's chairman and the subsequent resignations in 2009, the work on the APC was prioritised and the ACMD review was suspended whilst the new interim chairman was appointed. This also allowed the new interim chairman time to establish new working practices and the membership of the council's working groups. After the publication of the review of the APC, work on the ACMD review recommenced. It will be completed in early 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised that it maintains a Scientific and Clinical Advances Advisory Committee, which regularly reviews research regarding the creation of human embryonic stem cells or embryonic-like stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells. The most recent meeting at which the committee considered this issue took place on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-09">9 September 2010</phrase>. The minutes of this meeting are available on the authority's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">The Government do not routinely collate or analyse information on the total number of research publications worldwide on approaches used in stem cell research, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) or embryo-derived stem cells. However, details of current published medical research are available on UK PubMed Central and on the US website PubMed Central.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/3">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is funded by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and is one of the main agencies through which the Government support biomedical research. The MRC supports research into all approaches to harness the potential of stem cells to treat human disease. While the MRC has not yet awarded any proposals to pursue the induced pluripotent stem cell approach to treat human disease, three projects that directly related to efforts to reprogramme differentiated adult stem cells have been supported. The total value of these awards is &#163;4.2 million. The MRC has supported one project relating to human somatic cell nuclear transfer, and the value of this award was &#163;500,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/4">It is not evident at present which area of stem cell research may deliver the most effective treatments for particular conditions and more research is needed on all types of stem cells to determine which routes should be pursued in the development of cell-based therapies.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/5">In June 2010 the MRC and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine held a workshop to examine human somatic cell nuclear transfer and its role in stem cell research. Participants, who included preeminent international experts, discussed the range of stem cell technologies and concluded that it was unclear at present which would be more useful for therapeutic development, and that the answer may differ for different disorders. The report of this workshop summarising the state of the global research effort in this area and providing more detail is available on the MRC website at <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Utilities/Documentrecord/index">http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Utilities/Documentrecord/index</a>. htm?d=MRC007577.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.5/1">The Government published an interim impact assessment of the reforms to higher education funding and student finance on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-29">29 November 2010</phrase>, which included some analysis of the potential impact on part-time students. This is available at: <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/i//10-1309-interim-impact-assesstnent-he-funding-and-student-finance.pdf">http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/i//10-1309-interim-impact-assesstnent-he-funding-and-student-finance.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.5/2">The Government propose that, from 2012-13 onwards, new part-time students will be eligible for up-front loans for their tuition costs, as is already the case for full-time students.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.5/3">Part-time students will be able to take out non-means tested loans for tuition costs if they are studying at a rate of at least one-quarter of the intensity of a full-time course. This is an extension on the original proposal-of one-third intensity-and will extend the availability of the loan to a greater number of students, and better reflect the way that many part-time courses are structured.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.5/4">New part-time students will be able to defer repaying their loans until they are employment and earning at least &#163;21,000 a year. We will also improve the advice and guidance available to young people so that they are aware of the support available.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.2/1">The independent review of higher education funding and student finance led by Lord Browne recommended that there should be no upper limit on the amount universities are able to charge their full-time undergraduates. The Government, however, believe that there should be a defined absolute maximum on the graduate contribution which universities can charge, and have therefore proposed a higher amount maximum of &#163;9,000 in exceptional circumstances, with a basic amount maximum of &#163;6,000 unless universities agree a specific access plan for their institution with the Office for Fair Access.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/2">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills published on the <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-29">29 November 2010</phrase> an interim impact assessment on urgent reforms to higher education funding and student finance, available at <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/i/10-1309-interim-impact-assessment-he-funding-and-student-finance.pdf">http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/i/10-1309-interim-impact-assessment-he-funding-and-student-finance.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/3">The assessment highlighted that a number of factors can influence participation and made reference to research carried out on the 2006-07 HE finance reforms, which found that while a &#163;1,000 increase in fees could be expected to result in a 4.4 per cent decrease in participation, this would be offset by increases resulting from provision of loans and grants (3.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent increases). We expect the number of students to be broadly maintained at current levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.2/4">The assessment also indicated that the financial viability of HE institutions is affected by three major factors: individual institutions' ability to charge graduate contributions at different levels, the response from students to individual institutions, and the impact of broader funding changes. The Higher Education Funding Council for England will monitor the financial health and sustainability of institutions to protect the public investment in higher education, but higher education institutions are autonomous institutions and, if a university mismanages its affairs, we cannot offer a guarantee of protection.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.2/2">The details of the initiative have not yet been determined. We are not being prescriptive and want first to draw on the wealth of expertise from students and others with a proven track record in widening access. The NSP steering group has been invited to look at options and to come up with its own suggestions. The number of students who can benefit from the new programme will depend on the menu of options that are recommended by the steering group and the mix that institutions opt to deliver. We have suggested that an option of a first free year for disadvantaged students or a foundation year to attract young talented people into the professions could help to support 18,000 students. In addition, we will look to increase the leverage of government funding by getting matched contributions from universities.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.3/5">Like the interim OBR, we have not estimated a historical series for the output gap, and therefore the cyclical position of the economy, prior to 2009. We have therefore not made an assessment of the start of the current economic cycle. However, we plan to return to this issue in future work, taking into consideration a variety of different approaches.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.3/6">For our November forecast we judged that there was an output gap of around 3.25 per cent in the second quarter of 2010. Our forecast assumes that the output gap will narrow by approximately 0.7 percentage points a year from 2013-14, which would imply that it closes in 2016-17. This would be consistent with the current economic cycle ending in 2016-17.</p>

A penalty charge relating to those contraventions shall not be imposed except on the basis of a record produced by an approved device or information given by a civil enforcement officer as to the conduct observed by him. The Department for Transport's advice on the duties of those civil enforcement officers, which reflects its interpretation of relevant legislation, is set out in paragraph 6.14 of <I>Operational Guidance to Local Authorities: Parking Policy and Enforcement</I>, published in March 2008.

Also, reliable unemployment estimates are available only for the UK and government office regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">The estimates are in accordance with the agreed definitions of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The ILO definition of economic inactivity relates to people who are not in work and not unemployed.

	<p pid="a.234.2/1">The Government are introducing the new Work Programme, which will help people with a wide variety of needs to move into employment. Work Programme providers will be offered higher rewards for supporting harder-to-help customers, such as those who have never worked, move into employment. This will ensure that it is worthwhile for providers to offer all customer groups appropriate employment support. The Government aims to have the new work programme in place nationally by the summer of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/2">However, we recognise that, in itself, the Work Programme will not be enough and alongside the Work Programme, we will deliver a more flexible advisory service in Jobcentre Plus, giving local offices more control and allowing them to deliver in a way that is responsive to local needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/3">In October we also launched Work Clubs to encourage people who are out of work to exchange skills and share experiences, and Work Together to enable the development of work skills through volunteering. We also announced the new enterprise allowance, which will support unemployed people who wish to move off benefits into self-employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/4">We will also be launching Work Experience. Work Experience will offer eligible 18 to 21 year-old unemployed people a period of work experience between two and eight weeks in length and will be targeted at those customers who are harder to help, particularly those who want to work but find a lack of experience a barrier.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/5">We aim to deliver this on a voluntary basis from January 2011, before the mandatory elements go live in April 2011. Several large employers have already expressed a wish to support Work Experience and the wider Get Britain Working measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.2/6">Last month we also published our White Paper, <I>Universal Credit: </I><I>W</I><I>elfare that </I><I>Works</I>, setting out our plans to introduce the universal credit, which will be the first step in making sure that work pays for everyone and that we better target financial support towards those most in need.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.2/1">Universities are responsible for their own admissions policies and decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.2/2">The Government are committed to access to higher education being based on talent and potential, irrespective of background, and the coalition agreement recognises the need to attract a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Good admissions policies consider all the achievements, qualities and potential of applicants, whatever their background. It is very much in a university's interests to admit those who will prove the best students and who will reap the most benefit from their chosen course.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.2/3">The higher education sector keeps under review its admission policies and continually strives to improve them. The Supporting Professionalism in Admissions Programme (SPA) is a sector-led initiative and earlier this year produced updated guidance on the use of contextual data in admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.2/4">The Government are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-06">6 December</phrase> we published draft guidance to the Director of Fair Access, setting out our expectations on how he might approach the approval and monitoring of universities access agreements, including how contextual data can be used to target outreach and other activities. We are also investing in improving the school attainment of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds through a new pupil premium and setting up a new &#163;150 million national scholarships programme, to encourage them to apply to university.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.5/1">The Government have been very clear about the importance of widening participation and improving fair access in higher education-all those with the ability should have access to higher education irrespective of family income.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.5/2">The Government have set out plans to reform higher education student finance in England, which will offer a more generous package of financial support for low-income students living in England wishing to attend university in 2012-13. No full-time student will need to contribute to their tuition costs up front, and students from families with incomes of &#163;25,000 or less will be entitled to a more generous full maintenance grant of &#163;3,250 a year. Students starting part-time courses in 2012-13, often those from non-traditional backgrounds, will be entitled to an up-front loan to meet their tuition costs so long as they are studying at an intensity of at least 25 per cent of a full-time course.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.5/3">We are establishing a new framework with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation, and government investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Widening participation will remain a key strategic objective for all institutions. As now, all universities will produce widening participation strategic assessments for HEFCE as a condition of their funding. Universities wanting to charge more than a &#163;6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-06">6 December</phrase> the Government published draft guidance to the Director of Fair Access setting out their expectations and suggestions for how he might approach the approval and monitoring of institutions' access agreements. This includes a requirement to participate in the new &#163;150 million national scholarship programme. This work will be one of the areas supported by &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium to turn school-based achievement into success at university.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.2/1">Our reforms to higher education will shift the balance of public funds for teaching from direct grant to institutions to funding that follows the choices made by individual students. This will provide strong incentives for institutions to focus on providing high-quality teaching as efficiently as possible. Over time, popular and successful institutions will be able to grow and we expect new providers to enter the sector, provided that they can offer teaching to the high standards students will expect. We do not expect the overall income of the sector to reduce, and we expect improved teaching quality and better informed students to have a positive impact on the economy. In recognition that the UK's research base is a vital national asset and critical to long-term economic growth, funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms in a ring-fenced budget for the spending review period. Around half of this funding currently goes directly into universities. The remainder goes to institutes, many of which are sited in universities, and to large facilities, many of which are used by university researchers.</p>
