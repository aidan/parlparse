	<p pid="a.147.2/1">My right honourable friend the Minister has reached agreement with the EU Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, that the United Kingdom should, for this year, apply the same criteria as were used in 1999 and earlier years for determining the acceptability of hedges and other field margins included in claims based on whole Ordnance Survey field areas under the Integrated Administration and Control System. For 2001 and subsequent years, MAFF will work with the Commission in order to clarify what types of margins are acceptable for inclusion in aid claims and to identify ways of safeguarding environmentally valuable hedges, so that we can reach a permanent resolution of this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.3/1">The types of information which may be requested are set out in the Schedule to the Immigration (Passenger Information) Order 2000. The information specified in Part I of the Schedule to the order is contained in the machine-readable zone of passports and visas. Provision of this information is essential if we are to be able to grant or refuse entry to passengers in advance of their arrival in the United Kingdom. We have set out what we propose by way of such flexibilities in the draft Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-30">30 March 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/2">We would expect to come to a mutual agreement with carriers as to the routes for which we might start to require Part I information and as to when the requirement would start. Beyond this, we would only seek Part I information on specific occasions for intelligence purposes. We would endeavour to keep such requests to a minimum. The information specified in Part II of the schedule will only be requested where the carrier is in possession of it. However, we think it might take some time for carriers to put systems in place to allow them to provide us with any significant volume of information, so we will implement the new power gradually over the coming months. We will continue in this spirit of co-operation, but ultimately we reserve the right to insist upon the provision of passenger information under the new powers wherever we have good reason in the context of the immigration control.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.0/1">My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, Mr O'Brien, has laid an Order (The Gaming Clubs (Hours and Charges) Regulations 2000), in the House to simplify the current system of bingo charging.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/2">The current system of charges is set out in Section 3 of the Gaming Clubs (Hours and Charges) Regulations 1984. It prescribes the amount bingo operators may charge by way of admission and participation fees for games during any period of play of up to two hours (currently &pound;10 exclusive of Value Added Tax). It also sets out how the charges should be displayed. The arrangements for the charging notices are, however, complex and in practice most players will not know in advance of deciding to play what charge is being made for an individual game.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/3">The Home Office, therefore, proposes to make regulations that will establish a statutorily based notification system that will specify the form in which participation and any other charges must be notified so that they are transparent and easily understood. Notices will be displayed at the main point where payment for the charges is to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/4">The regulations will also allow a charge to be made for admission to a bingo club not exceeding &pound;10 per day which will be displayed at, or near, the principal entrance to the premises and a charge to be made for participation in a game of bingo not exceeding &pound;5 for each chance in playing the game. These are upper limits; in practice operators will set far lower charges than this.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/5">The measure will extend to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/6">A copy of the Regulatory Impact Assessment has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.3/1">The term cash limit is no longer used in relation to government expenditure. As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report 1998 (Cm 3978), Departmental Expenditure Limits cover spending capable of being subject to firm multi-year plans. The comprehensive spending review brought together operational costs of dealing with asylum applications and costs of support to adults and families claiming asylum into the Home Office Departmental Expenditure Limit, though with the recognition that funds available might need to be reassessed as a result of exogenous shocks, such as large increases in numbers of applications relative to previous forecasts.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.6/1">The statement reflects the comparative performance of two groups of pupils. The first group included all 15 year-olds in grammar schools. Their results were:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.151.6/4"> <td>Performance</td> <td></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.151.6/5"> <td>Percentage achieving 5+ grades A*-C at GCSE/GNVQ</td> <td>96.4%</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.151.6/6"> <td>Percentage achieving 1+ grades A*-G at GCSE/GNVQ</td> <td>99.6%</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.151.6/7"> <td>Average point score per 15 year-old pupil</td> <td>60.7</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.151.6/10">The second group included the top 25 per cent of 15 year-old pupils in comprehensive schools--based on their total GCSE/GNVQ point score (in order not to include and exclude some pupils with the same point score, the actual percentage of pupils included was 24.5 per cent). Their results were:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.151.6/13"> <td>Performance</td> <td></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.151.6/14"> <td>Percentage achieving 5+ grades A*-C at GCSE/GNVQ</td> <td>100%</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.151.6/15"> <td>Percentage achieving 1+ grades A*-G at GCSE/GNVQ</td> <td>100%</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.151.6/16"> <td>Average point score per 15 year-old pupil</td> <td>60.9</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.151.6/19">This analysis was carried out by the department's Analytical Services. It is based on the data collected for the secondary school performance tables published in November 1999. The analysis was carried out from a pupil level file and based on the results of all 15 year-old pupils in grammar schools and the top 25 per cent of pupils in comprehensive schools. This percentage was chosen because it reflects the proportion of pupils typically taken in by grammar schools in wholly selective LEAs. The pupils in the comprehensive schools were ranked according to their total GCSE/GNVQ point scores.</p>

WA 63, explaining the Government's decision to run the Millennium Volunteers Programme in England from a Unit within the Department for Education and Employment rather than to set up a new body. It was therefore no longer necessary to proceed with the appointment of the Chair of Millennium Volunteers. All those who applied for the post of Chair were informed of the decision in July 1998.</p>
