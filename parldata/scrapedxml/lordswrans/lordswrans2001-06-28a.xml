UNSCR 1333 (2000), which imposes inter alia an arms embargo on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, provides scope for the UN Sanctions Committee to approve of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective use to Taliban-controlled territory.

	<p pid="a.14.8/1">I am writing to report the outcome of the Environment Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-07">7 June</phrase>. As Council fell on the same day as the General Election, there were no Environment Ministers available to attend, and the UK was represented by Bill Stow, Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU. Council reached a political agreement on six common positions, two of which allowed agreement to be reached with the European Parliament at first reading. The UK abstained on the vote on a proposed Directive on low-temperature emissions from motor vehicles, and voted in favour of the other common positions. Council also adopted five sets of conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/2">Political agreement was reached on a Decision of the Commission and European Parliament on the Sixth Environment Action Programme. This will set out the EU's environmental priorities for the next ten years, focusing on climate change, nature and biodiversity, environment and health, and sustainable management of natural resources and waste. The UK achieved its objectives of a commitment to improve the policy process, a clearer priority for climate change action, and a commitment to further analysis before the development and adoption of detailed targets. Political agreement was also reached on a proposal to amend Directive 90/313, giving the public enhanced rights of access to environmental information in line with the more demanding requirements of the Aarhus Convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/3">In reaching Political Agreement on a Directive seeking to reduce the quantity of waste from electrical and electronic equipment and increase recycling, the UK achieved its objectives. The Directive delivers environmental benefits, and is in line with the Government's objectives on waste, and Council has avoided changes which would have made it more inflexible and less workable. In particular the UK secured additional flexibility for small manufacturers and on the arrangements for retailer takeback. Member states agreed that collection systems will have to be set up within 30 months of the Directive coming into force, with distributors having to take back used equipment free of charge on a like for like basis either in-store or through third parties. Producers were made responsible for reaching recovery and recycling targets within 46 months. A target of recycling 4kg waste per person per year by 36 months following entry into force of the Directive was also agreed. Agreement was also reached on a related Directive restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, protecting the environment from potential damage arising from the disposal of this equipment, and facilitating recycling. The Council agreed a date of 2007 for the phasing out of specific hazardous substances, including lead and mercury.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/4">Council was able to approve all of the European Parliament's amendments on a Decision establishing a list of priority substances under the Water Framework Directive, allowing it to be adopted at first reading. The list contains 33 Priority Substances, 11 of which are classified as Priority Hazardous Substances. The Commission will be responsible for bringing forward proposals for measures aimed at the progressive reduction and, for Priority Hazardous Substances, at the cessation or phasing-out of emissions, discharges and losses. A first reading agreement was also reached on a Directive regulating emissions from motor vehicles starting in cold conditions. The UK abstained on the basis that the costs of implementing the proposal were disproportionate to the limited environmental benefits it would bring about, and recorded its position in a statement for the Council minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/5">Council conclusions on climate change reaffirmed the EU's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its willingness to negotiate constructively at the resumed COP6 in July. Ministers reiterated the target of ratification and entry into force of Kyoto by 2002. The Council also held an informal discussion on climate change over dinner.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/6">In response to the Commission's White Paper on EU chemicals policy, Council conclusions were agreed. Ministers offered broad support for the proposal that existing and new substances would in future be subject to the same authorisation process (&quot;REACH&quot; - Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals) whilst stressing the need for realistic deadlines. The conclusions recommend an objective of phasing out uses of chemicals that lead to a significant negative impact on the environment by 2020, while maintaining the competitiveness of the chemicals industry. The Conclusions also call for a minimum of animal testing and increased public access to information about chemicals. Separately, in response to a suggestion by the Netherlands, Council agreed conclusions calling on the Commission to clarify the legal situation and possible consequences of the phase-out of mercury in the chlor-alkali industry, and to report back to Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/7">In preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Rio+10) in Johannesburg in 2002, Council conclusions were agreed setting out a broad EU approach with suggestions for themes for consideration at the summit. These include protection of natural resources, integrating environment and poverty eradication and making globalisation work for sustainable development. Council also agreed conclusions on a strategy for an integrated product policy, the overall aim of which is to reduce the environmental impact of products across their whole lifecycle.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/8">The Commission briefly updated Council on work on a number of forthcoming proposals, including its planned proposals on the labelling and traceability of GMOs, emphasising the difficult technical and legal implications of the proposals, which are still under consideration within the Commission. Commissioner Wallstrom also reported on developments in environmental relations with Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/9">The Presidency informed Council it would consider what progress could be made on the Directives on Public Participation in Environmental Decision-Making, Recreational Craft, Non Road Mobile Machinery and the Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management, before Belgium took over the EU Presidency in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/10">Over lunch Council discussed the Commission's Communication on an EU Sustainable Development Strategy, and a Presidency report on the integration of environmental considerations into other policy areas, in preparation for the Gothenburg European Council on 15-<phrase class="date" code="2001-06-16">16 June</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.0/1">Subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate for the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the overall resource Departmental Expenditure Limit for 2001-02 will be increased by &pound;7,803,000 (of which &pound;363,000 is administrations costs) from &pound;103,440,000 to &pound;111,243,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/2">The increase is the net effect of transfers from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) of &pound;7,308,000, to cover the estimated fall in Meat Hygiene Service income resulting from the revised charging methodology recommended in the Maclean report, and transfers of &pound;363,000 administration costs and &pound;132,000 programme costs from MAFF to reflect the cost of additional responsibilities transferred to the FSA.

With the exception of the increase of &pound;11,000 in the cash to accruals adjustment, which will bring the figures into line with those agreed in SR2000, all increases will be offset by transfers from the MAFF Departmental Expenditure Limit (detailed above) and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.</p>

A compromise was reached over the budget level at 280 meuros, which will be the basis of negotiation with the European Parliament, whose previous position has been for a higher figure. On the mechanism for co-ordinating health monitoring and rapid reaction to health threats, Council agreed to the use of the term &quot;structural arrangements&quot; instead of &quot;structure&quot; as the Commission had still to put forward their proposals on this point. Agreement was also reached on including rare diseases within the scope of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/3">Council agreed the Recommendation on drinking of alcohol by young people. The Recommendation proposes education and information and self-regulation of promotion, marketing and retailing to reduce alcohol abuse by children and adolescents. Council adopted Conclusions inviting the Commission to put forward proposals for a Community strategy on alcohol which would complement national policies. The majority of member states highlighted the need for Community action on gathering and disseminating data and information. The UK warned of the need to focus on alcohol-related harm rather than consumption per se and that any action should be proportionate and respect subsidiarity principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/4">Commissioner Byrne presented revised proposals for a tobacco advertising Directive which would ban tobacco advertising in the press, publications, radio, Internet and sponsorship (including free distribution) with a cross-border element. He stressed the compatibility of these proposals with the ECJ judgement striking down the previous tobacco advertising Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/5">The Commission gave an oral update on the epidemiological situation of vCJD and developments in research, surveillance and information exchange at Community level. The UK provided information on progress with developing support for CJD patients, measures to protect against person to person transmission (e.g. single-use instruments for tonsil surgery) and tenders for research into diagnostic tests for vCJD and BSE. Council adopted Conclusions, which call on member states to build on existing work on surveillance and prevention for all TSEs as they affect human health.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.3/6">A series of information items reports were received on health in other policies and the health dimension of the Northern Dimension Action Plan. There were calls for a second Health Council in each Presidency and information provided on a hospital partnership approach to the treatment of HIV/AIDS victims.</p>

Under Core Competence, around three-quarters of the current DERA organisation will be turned into a company with the registered name of QinetiQ plc. For strategic reasons, the remainder, known as the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), will be retained within Ministry of Defence to carry out functions that could not appropriately be transferred to the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">Since the announcement in July work has focused on achieving the legal separation of DERA into the two entities: QinetiQ and Dstl. This work has included the enactment of secondary legislation as outlined in Statutory Instrument 1246/2001 (made on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-28">28 March 2001</phrase>). This instrument will result in DERA being renamed Dstl and net assets attributable to QinetiQ being removed from the Trading Fund and transferred to the new company.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">Subject to final legal drafting and contractual negotiations, we intend to vest QinetiQ plc with its assets and liabilities with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-01">1 July 2001</phrase>. At that point, QinetiQ will remain a wholly government-owned plc. Thereafter, work will continue on preparation for its eventual sale.</p>

Those procedures have now been completed and the Disciplinary Panel hearing the complaints decided that, in view of the criticisms made about the Disciplinary Code and the investigation undertaken, it would be unreasonable to reach conclusions on the cases. Following those decisions, work is now under way on recommendations to be made to my right honourable friend the Minister for Community and Custodial Provision on whether or not the former members should be offered reappointments to the BOV.</p>
