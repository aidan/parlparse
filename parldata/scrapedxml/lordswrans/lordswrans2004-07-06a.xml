<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-07-06a.71.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="71"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040706/text/40706w01.htm#40706w01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.71.8/1">DfID's assessment of this relationship is twofold. First, access to basic facilities such as school toilets, safe drinking water, clean surroundings and information on hygiene all improve the quality of the school environment and influence better learning. This is important in terms of the overall goal of achieving universal education and eliminating gender disparity in education. Basic sanitation for girls in particular can lead to a lower dropout rate for girls, especially at puberty. For example, in Bangladesh, a school sanitation and hygiene education programme reported to increase girls' attendance rates by 11 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.8/2">Secondly, the opportunity costs of parents sending girls to school are substantially reduced when households have ready access to safe drinking water and girls are no longer required to collect water from distant water pumps.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.8/3">As part of its support for the peace process in Sudan, DfID has provided approximately &pound;2 million to assist UNICEF's education programmes in the conflict-affected areas of the country, providing books and materials to over 2,000 primary schools and supporting the construction of water and sanitation facilities where these were priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.5/1">The police and other emergency services need to alert other motorists and pedestrians to their presence if they are to provide fast response times and to do so safely. Much work has previously been undertaken to identify the most effective means for doing this. The sirens now in use are designed to operate in such a way as to attract the attention of pedestrians, to be heard by motorists in different situations and to indicate the direction from which the vehicle is approaching. They are often supplemented by the use of alternate flashing headlights. We have no current plans for further work in this area.</p>

The paper makes clear that the timing of the third anthrax vaccine dose was varied, and that the main immunisation programme was suspended before the point at which a fourth dose would have been due. There is no formal record of consultation between the Ministry of Defence and the manufacturer and supplier, the then Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR), Porton Down about these variations.

	<p pid="a.77.3/1">The DTI UK Safeguards Office is concerned with the application of international safeguards on civil nuclear material in the UK, including depleted uranium. This involves working with the UK nuclear industry (and others with safeguards reporting requirements) and safeguards inspectors from the European Commission (currently part of the Directorate for Transport and Energy (DG-TREN) and based in Luxembourg) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) the security regulator, promotes a robust security regime for civil nuclear material. We cannot comment on the security measures taken, which could be of potential use to terrorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/2">Imports of depleted uranium into the United Kingdom do not require the specific approval of the department. All imports of armour-piercing ammunition, whether or not containing depleted uranium, require an individual import licence granted by the department under the Import of Goods (Control) Order 1954. No other product containing depleted uranium requires such an individual import licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/3">Although strategic export controls do not regulate the actual use of depleted uranium, any exports of depleted uranium from the Community are controlled under Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000. The DTI is responsible for the licensing of goods controlled by the regulation.</p>
