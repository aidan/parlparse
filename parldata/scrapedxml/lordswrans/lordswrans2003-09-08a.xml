	<p pid="a.3.2/1">There are no &quot;New Targeting Social Need (New TSN)&quot; status areas. Ideally targeting is aimed towards those who are in most need. Where programmes are delivered to individuals, departments must identify who are the most deprived and who need the particular service. Measures such as benefit entitlement, entitlement to free school meals etc can be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">Some programmes (for example, rural development, urban regeneration, etc) are delivered on an area basis and in these cases, areas must be identified for targeting. The Northern Ireland multiple deprivation measure assists with area-based targeting. It ranks electoral wards on the basis of relative deprivation. As well as an overall measure of multiple deprivation it includes separate domain measures including employment, income, health, etc which can be applied individually as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/3">Another consideration in targeting resources on an area basis is that the areas to which one type of programme is appropriate, for example, urban regeneration, may not be appropriate to other types of programme, such as rural development or forestry. The need for a particular service must also be taken into account. While areas may have similar overall levels of deprivation, their specific need for particular government services such as housing, employment, schools, transport etc may differ.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.2/2">Financial assistance is available from several government departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies for the sustainable development of tourism throughout Northern Ireland including the north coast area of County Antrim. Accommodation development, amenity and visitor attractions, marketing programmes and events are among the areas which could be eligible for support under a variety of grant schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/3">One specific initiative which applies to the North Antrim coast area is the Natural Resource and Rural Tourism Initiative (NRRTI). Jointly developed by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Department of the Environment and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, the initiative is aimed at developing tourism in selected rural areas throughout Northern Ireland. Some &pound;3.3m of the NRRTI funding has been made available during the period 2002&ndash;06 to promote and assist the development of sustainable projects which will increase the tourism potential in the Glens and north coast area of County Antrim.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/4">In order to build on achievements to date, a masterplan for the area will be developed as part of the recently announced ministerial initiative for the Giant's Causeway. The development of tourism beyond the Causeway itself will have a number of benefits including easing pressure on the site, assisting in encouraging visitors to stay longer in the locality and thus increasing spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/5">In addition, grant aid has been awarded to the following organisations under DCAL's Water-Based Tourism Measure funded under the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (Peace II):</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">The average waiting time for an MoT appointment at the Belfast centre is currently 6 and a half weeks, with a maximum waiting time of 9 weeks for about 40 per cent of customers. Customers who are willing to travel to other test centres can get tests in shorter periods. For example, average waiting times last week for the Larne and Downpatrick centres were just over three weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/2">The principal causes of the current waiting time difficulties have been a significant increase in demand and the temporary closure of test centres for the installation of new test equipment&mdash;which in turn requires an extensive programme of staff training. Demand at the Belfast centre has been particularly affected by the current temporary closure of Mallusk, which handled 13 per cent of the agency's throughput last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/3">The Mallusk centre will reopen on <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-16">16 August 2003</phrase>, and the programme of refurbishment across all centres will be completed in September. In the meantime a number of steps are being taken to alleviate the position. These include: continuing efforts to recruit additional staff; increased overtime working; longer opening hours; diverting technical staff from other duties to testing; working with the equipment supplier to secure higher levels of productivity; better public information and awareness, so that customers have the option of choosing centres with lower waiting times; and relocating staff in order to match capacity and demand as closely as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">DfID remains strongly committed to meeting the Millennium Development Goal to halt and begin to reverse the incidence of malaria by 2015, recognising the importance of malaria, not just in terms of disease burden, but also the potential it has to undermine economic growth and human development.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">Since 1998, DfID has provided in excess of &pound;110 million to support malaria control activities globally and at country-level. This includes support to Roll Back Malaria, an international partnership to reduce competition and duplication of effort, develop technical consensus, increase political commitment and raise the profile of malaria.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/3">This commitment to combating malaria has been recently reaffirmed by DfID's pledge to increase its commitment to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria to 280 million US dollars. Successful implementation of existing Global Fund proposals will result in the annual number of treatments for resistant malaria in Africa increasing from 15,000 to 4 million and result in the purchase of 7.5 million insecticide-treated nets (ITN) over the next two years. These nets offer substantial protection against malaria. The proper use of insecticide-treated nets, combined with prompt treatment for malaria at community level, can reduce malaria transmission by as much as 60 per cent and the overall young child death rate by at least one-fifth.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/4">DfID also provides support to the Medical Research Council (MRC); to the Malaria Consortium Resource Centre; and to initiatives to help find new low-cost malaria treatments. Malaria control activities at country-level are supported through DfID bilateral country programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/5">DfID is committed to supporting national governments and partners in order to ensure that effective drugs and commodities are accessible to the poor. We have committed over &pound;1.5 billion, since 1997, to strengthen health systems to deliver vital drugs and health care treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.5/1">Following the most recent fighting in Liberia, between 200,000&ndash;300,000 people had to leave their homes and seek shelter in over 100 different locations in Monrovia. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and a small number of NGOs have provided emergency humanitarian assistance throughout the crisis under extreme conditions, and in the last few weeks, the UN and additional NGOs have re-entered Liberia to increase the humanitarian effort. Malnutrition remains a major concern particularly among vulnerable groups, and safe drinking water as well as sanitation and basic hygiene remain critical issues, especially in the areas where refugees have moved to. Security remains a major concern for operational humanitarian agencies. While the deployment of ECOWAS (ECOMIL) has stabilised a secure zone in and around central Monrovia, access is still very limited outside the city. Agencies are operating on the basis of ad hoc negotiated access to rebel-controlled areas. In such difficult circumstances, it is crucial that the UN takes a strong lead in humanitarian co-ordination. After a difficult beginning, the agencies have reported that co-ordination with the UN has now dramatically improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">21 August</phrase> DfID committed an additional &pound;4.7 million to support humanitarian needs in Liberia. The funds are being allocated to UN agencies. NGOs and the ICRC to provide an immediate response. This brings the UK's total humanitarian assistance to Liberia to &pound;7.6 million this year. Our approach is to strengthen the UN system to take on a lead role in co-ordination and delivery of assistance, to support NGOs and the Red Cross in provision of immediate relief, and to ensure collaboration between the major donors in planning and monitoring of assistance. Last month we hosted a meeting of NGOs working in Liberia, or planning to do so, to discuss the situation and identify what help is needed on the ground. We have invited NGOs to put proposals to us and we have just agreed to fund a supplementary feeding programme for all refugee children under the age of five in Monrovia. Our strategy has been developed with advice from an assessment team who are currently based in Monrovia. This team will remain in the region to assess the evolving humanitarian situation in Liberia, and monitor DfID-funded operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.5/3">The UK is committed to working closely with the international community to ensure that ECOMIL, and the UN Mission planned for Liberia, are successful in restoring peace and security. We have contributed &pound;1 million to ECOMIL and have seconded a military adviser to ECOWAS. We have also offered military advisors to the UN planning mission and headquarters. The UK is also working in the UN Security Council to ensure that the forthcoming resolution authorises the deployment of a UN mission with a strong mandate to: restore and maintain security; establish peace-building initiatives; and provide the conditions to allow the transitional government to operate effectively and work towards holding free and fair elections. We are monitoring developments in the region closely to ensure that ex-combatants do not cause problems in neighbouring countries. A regional approach to disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDF) will be important if the region is to eliminate the &quot;guns for hire&quot; culture that has developed. We are discussing options for DDR with the UN, ECOWAS and other interested parties, and are considering how we can best support this process.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">We are pleased to announce today the specific projects which will receive funding from the 2003&ndash;04 allocation from the Capital Modernisation Fund to assist small retailers in deprived areas to improve the security of their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">Some &pound;5.8 million has been distributed to regions in England and Wales according to the formula based on an equal share for each region, crimes impacting on retailers and percentage of people living in the most deprived wards. The remaining &pound;200,000 of the third year funding has been set aside for administration and evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/3">This year's funding will provide assistance to a minimum of 5,000 individual retailers and essential businesses. As in previous years, this funding will be spent on schemes identified by regional Home Office directors, in conjunction with crime and disorder reduction partnerships and a variety of interventions will be employed, including enhancing the security of individual premises and improving the environment of shopping parades. This will mean that over the 3 years of the initiative, since 2001, over 12,500 individual shops units will have directly benefitted from improved security measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/4">We have placed in the Library a paper showing the allocations of funds to individual projects. The Home Secretary has also written to honourable Members in England and Wales who have projects in their constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which came into force in April 2001, placed a general duty on listed public bodies to be proactive in promoting race equality. It is a positive duty, requiring public authorities to seek to avoid unlawful discrimination before it occurs. As policy makers and service providers they need to take steps to ensure that their policies and services are fair, and to put things right when they are unfair or unlawful. As employers, they need to ensure that their procedures and practices are fair so that the public sector can better reflect the society it serves. The duty under the Act is a lever to raise standards of practice and to lead towards elimination of discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">Public bodies were required to have in place by <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase> realistic and timely plans for complying with their new obligations under the RR(A)A. The aim of the duty is to lead to sustainable and significant change over a period of time&mdash;it is not about putting in place &quot;quick fix&quot; solutions or arrangements. The time-scale for delivery of improvement will vary across different bodies. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) has issued codes of practice which provide guidance to public bodies. The Home Office is working closely with the CRE to support effective implementation of the duty to promote race equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">The Act requires public bodies to consult on the likely impact of proposed new policies on race equality and this should involve a wide range of black and minority ethnic communities. Race equality schemes should include arrangements for assessing which of their functions are relevant to the duty, which should be reviewed at least every three years.</p>

However, since April 2002, five members of staff have been dismissed for this type of offence as a result of internal disciplinary action under the Prison Service code of conduct and discipline.

The department's accommodation strategy has secured the disposal by way of an agreement for the transfer to the Department of Constitutional Affairs of the present Home Office at 50 Queen Anne's Gate. This follows the transfer in December 2002 of Clive House to that department. Together this reduces the department's exposure to the London office market by about 39,500m(1). Inclusion of the sale of the above freehold buildings in the PFI contract for 2 Marsham Street was considered. However, the property consultants advised the department that the price tendered by the developer of &pound;33.75 million was unlikely to offer better value for money in comparison to their expectation of what the department would achieve by arranging disposal of these buldings using a competent firm of property agents. The Office of Government Commerce also advised that it could be better value to the Exchequer as a whole if the properties were retained for potential other government use should one be identified before the new headquarters at 2 Marsham Street is occupied, Decisions on the sale of these buildings have still to be reached.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.2/1">The Government has identified the need to address the particular issues of offending by this age group and to use the experience of the youth justice reforms to inform its approach. In doing so, we will take account of the recommendations of the Social Exclusion Unit Report, Reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.2/2">Compared with older prisoners, offenders aged 18 to 20 have fewer basic skills, higher unemployment rates and are more likely to have been excluded from school. The most immediate priority, therefore, for reducing their re-offending is to improve their access to programmes and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.2/3">We have agreed that the new funding provided for prison education should have a particular focus on 18 to 20 year-olds. Priority has therefore been given to expanding provision in establishments holding female prisoners and young offenders aged 18 to 20. We have also agreed that the strategy for this age group should be underpinned by the principle of testing new approaches to sentence delivery through 18 to 20 year-olds in the first instance. For example, the National Probation Directorate has already commenced piloting the Intensive Control and Change Programme (ICCP) which will be delivered through a community punishment and rehabilitation order (CPRO) and involves a number of key partner agencies, such as the Police and Connexions. One of the aims of the ICCP is to reduce reconviction rates by 10 per cent compared with a similar group receiving short custodial sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.2/4">The Government have also funded the extension of the High Intensity Training Programme (HIT), previously piloted at HM Young Offenders Institution Thorn Cross, and planned to start at HMYOI Deerbolt later this year. The regime included offending behaviour, education, mentoring and throughcare components.</p>

I expect this work to be completed in the autumn and for decisions to be taken on our programme of reform as soon as possible thereafter.

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs that the department would have incurred regardless of the operation taking place such as wages and salaries are not included. Savings on activities that have not occurred because of the operation&mdash;training exercises for example&mdash;are deducted from the total costs of the operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">Neither the net additional costs incurred by United Kingdom personnel engaged in the search for WMD in Iraq, nor the net additional costs of those engaged in reconstruction can be differentiated from the total net additional cost of UK personnel deployed to the Gulf region. For example, stock accounting records will identify the recipient of stock as entitled UK military personnel, not whether they are engaged in reconstruction work or in the search for WMD. It is therefore not possible to identify costs related solely to the WMD search team.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.3/1">Service personnel are entitled to the full use of NHS hospitals on the same basis as other United Kingdom citizens if appropriate military provision is not available. They will therefore benefit from the sustained investment through the NHS Plan which will reduce waiting times. Provision for accelerated diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation to return service personnel back to fitness faster than would otherwise be the case is available through service level agreements (SLAs) with NHS trusts that host the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) in Birmingham and Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs). These SLAs also include provision for fast-track out-patient appointments if service personnel are needed for immediate operational deployment. In addition, in 2003&ndash;04, up to &pound;8 million for accelerated diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation is available for use in the NHS or, as appropriate, with private healthcare providers. A pilot scheme for fast-tracking orthopaedic cases is currently being run at MDHU Northallerton. Finally, the joint MoD/Department of Health reception arrangements for military patients (RAMP) ensure that in times of conflict casualties are returned to the UK and receive the care that they need in NHS hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.2/2">Calculating all the costs of military action will take some time to determine since it will include the cost of ammunition, bombs and guided weapons consumed in excess of peacetime levels and equipment destroyed and damaged. Excluding those costs, the latest estimate is that the net additional cost of operations in Iraq for 2002&ndash;03 is around &pound;700 million.

	<p pid="a.43.2/3">Items in the &pound;700 million estimate include costs for the procurement of equipment or modifications under the heading of urgent operational requirements, increased maintenance and stock consumption, civil sea and air charter and provision of infrastructure in the theatre of operations.

	<p pid="a.47.8/1">Real progress has been made in Iraq over the past few months. Coalition forces continue to support Iraqi leaders both nationally and at the local level. Political progress has been made, with the increasing effectiveness of the Iraqi Governing Council and the recent appointment of Iraqi departmental Ministers. We now seek to accelerate progress in other areas, including enhanced security across the country, and the reliable provision of basic utilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/2">In the light of the evolving security situation in Iraq, and the increasing military tasks arising out of the reconstruction efforts in the south of the country, the UK divisional commander in theatre has been conducting a formal review of UK forces and resources in Iraq. While the full scale of the requirement, which will be largely driven by initiatives of the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Department for International Development (DfID) to accelerate reconstruction activities in Iraq, has yet to be fully developed, there is an immediate requirement for two battalions and some additional specialist personnel, vehicles and equipment to allow him to fulfil the expanding range of tasks for UK forces in Multinational Division (South East) (MND(SE)).</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/3">Accordingly, we are deploying to Iraq the balance of 2nd Battalion The Light Infantry, a company of which is already in theatre. This battalion will be involved in supporting current operations and in offering additional protection to the Coalition Provisional Authority. They are currently based in Cyprus and were already identified as an &quot;over the horizon reserve&quot; for Iraq. Their role in Cyprus will be filled by two batteries from 16 Regiment Royal Artillery.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/4">In addition, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets (1 RGJ) will deploy to Iraq immediately supported by some specialist personnel and equipment. This deployment will enable MND(SE) to increase force protection, accelerate training of the Iraqi civil defence corps and improve our information-gathering capability in MND(SE). 1 RGJ are currently designated the spearhead land element, are already at high readiness, and are therefore the most appropriate unit to call upon. They will be replaced as spearhead land element by 42 Commando Royal Marines.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/5">We plan to maintain the deployment of these units until around November, providing an interim additional capability to our commanders in theatre. Additional units would deploy to replace them in theatre if the requirement remained. We plan for some of the roles progressively to be conducted by Iraqi personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/6">In addition to the requirements that we have already fully identified, we anticipate additional tasks in the near future which will require military resources, in particular the provision of military support to critical infrastructure work planned by CPA(S) and DfID. This work will deliver a more stable power supply; improve fuel availability and significantly improve the delivery of water services to all sectors of the population in the MND(SE) area. The military capabilities needed will be identified as the detail of the plan's implementation takes shape. We will immediately take steps to identify and reduce notice to move for some additional headquarters and units, to allow further deployments as rapidly as possible in response to this accelerating programme of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/7">These measures will give extra capabilities to our commanders in theatre, allowing them to increase their proactive efforts to improve wider security across the region, and allowing them to support the essential reconstruction and regeneration efforts in their area of operations. The commitment of the United Kingdom and its Armed Forces to Iraq remains undeterred by recent events. We are determined to help the Iraqi people to forge a new, peaceful and secure future for themselves and we will meet this commitment with appropriate forces in Iraq for as long as required, and no longer.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">. Well-kept records provide an essential underpinning to good child protection practice. Practice experience has shown that families can be more effectively safeguarded when records into past inquiries into one-off (or patterns of) unfounded, false or malicious allegations of child abuse are retained. Should a fresh referral be made at some point in the future, it would be untenable for an agency with child protection responsibilities to deny that there had been any previous history. Agencies that work for the protection of children must be able to record their decisions without fear that these records may be destroyed whenever concerns about a child are ultimately unfounded.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">History is a statutory subject for all pupils aged five to 14. The latest Ofsted evidence on the teaching of history states that pupils' achievements in primary school have improved steadily, and in secondary schools there has been a particular improvement at key stage 3 over the last reported year. The Government have no plans, therefore, to review the content of the national curriculum for history, although we will be asking QCA to produce guidance, including possible additional units for DfES/QCA schemes of work, for primary and secondary history teachers to further improve children's understanding of key aspects, individuals and events in British history and their ability to more firmly relate these to a broad chronological framework. We are concerned, however, at reports that pupils are duplicating the study of particular periods of history at GCSE and beyond thus producing a narrowing of the curriculum. We will ask QCA for advice on whether the GCSE criteria for history should be reviewed, as part of an overall review of the coherence of 14 to 19 history provisions. QCA's new GCSE history hybrid pilot project is already exploring ways of broadening the history curriculum 14 to 16.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">At each key stage, pupils are taught about life processes and living things, and to use first-hand experience and varying information sources to assist with scientific investigation. The science curriculum emphasises the need to learn about living things in their environment. At both GCSE and A-level, the use of fieldwork in the delivery of the curriculum is encouraged but not compulsory as it is for each school or college to decide how best to teach its students.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/2">A number of letters have been received by Ministers in the department from the members of the executive committee of the Field Studies Council in recent months, particularly following the publication of its joint report with the British Ecological Society Teaching Biology outside the classroom. Is it heading for extinction? The responses point out that at both GCSE and A-level, the use of fieldwork in the delivery of the curriculum is encouraged but not compulsory as it is for each school or college to decide how best to teach its students.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/3">Our major initiative &quot;Growing Schools&quot; is a project to develop and disseminate best practice in the use of the outdoor classroom in a number of curriculum subjects, and in particular biology and geography. I am pleased to say that Tony Thomas, Chief Executive of the Field Studies Council, has therefore kindly agreed to sit on the Advisory Group for &quot;Growing Schools&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/4">Our &pound;51 million partnership with the Wellcome Trust to establish a network of science learning centres will provide continuing professional development for primary science coordinators and secondary science teachers and technicians. We anticipate that, over time, the centres will help teachers to develop their skills in out of classroom teaching.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.5/1">Co-ordination will make the admissions process smoother. Parents will be able to apply for all the schools they wish their child to attend in the LEA's area on one application form instead of having to make several applications to different admission authorities. They will receive only one offer from their LEA and all will receive the offer on the same day. Currently offers may be notified at different times and some parents may have a number of offers while others have none. This creates anxiety for parents and children and additional work for LEAs who must then find places for children with no offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2">The regulatory requirements for co-ordinated admissions schemes were drawn up in consultation with a focus group of interested parties, including representatives of LEAs, the Churches and foundation and voluntary-aided schools. The requirements for primary schemes are minimal and allow LEAs to draw up timetables which will suit the needs of their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/3">My department does not keep figures for the numbers of children involved, but our research has shown that parents find the process easier when admissions are co-ordinated. We expect co-ordinated admissions to be cost neutral in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/2">The ETP pilots closed at the end of June 2003 and the remaining pilot consortia are in the process of winding-down their pilots. In order to give the pilot consortia reasonable time in which to manage the closure process, the PPA will continue to receive electronic prescriptions for payment processing until <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-30">30 September 2003</phrase>. This should enable pilots to ensure that patients who have signed up for the pilot do not experience difficulties in obtaining their prescriptions, and that they are clear about the arrangements for receiving their medicines once ETP transmission has ceased. The timescale should also minimise inconvenience for healthcare professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/3">The ETP pilots have been closed as they have served their purpose to test the feasability of the electronic transmission of prescriptions. An independent evaluation on the pilots has been completed and received by the Department of Health. Because of this, limited work has been done to model potential costs for their continuation. Based on the current patient and prescription numbers, the costs to the National Health Service and the department are relatively small (with most costs being met by the pilot consortia). However, there are some resource implications. The main costs to the department relate to the processing of the electronic prescriptions from the pilots by the PPA. Assuming prescription volume did not exceed 10,000 items per month and there was no increase in functionality or scope the PPA estimate their costs at around &pound;230,000 per annum. This figure does not include the cost of connecting the participating pharmacies to the NHSNet.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.0/1">The Chief Medical Officer, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, has proposed an NHS redress scheme which will provide appropriate redress to patients who believe they have been harmed as a result of the health care they have received.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/2">A detailed design for the redress scheme will not be completed until the close of the consultation period upon the Chief Medical Officer's report and the issues raised by those responding to his recommendations have been considered. The scheme will conform with the principles outlined in the Chief Medical Officer's report, which are&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/3" class="indent">to provide a fair, equitable and appropriate response to people who have been harmed in the course of their health care. It is intended that all care then required will focus on the needs of individual patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/4">Redress will include a full investigation of the events complained about; a clear explanation of those events; an apology, immediate and remedial care where those are necessary; and financial compensation where that is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/5">Prompt and thorough investigation of events complained about, and careful assessment of the case for compensation by any successor body to the NHS Litigation Authority, will exclude unjustifiable claims from the scheme. The possibility that there may be a higher number of requests for redress, both justified and not justified, will be considered in full during that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/6">The detailed design of the redress scheme will take into account a number of issues, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/7" class="indent">(a) The results of research commissioned for the Chief Medical Officer's report which suggests that most people want an investigation, explanation and apology when something has gone wrong, and evidence that action is taken to reduce the risk of a reoccurrence. Only some people seek financial compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/8" class="indent">(b) The need for clear criteria that will be used to determine whether or not financial compensation is warranted, and so make clear what the scheme can and cannot offer complainants, from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/9">The recruitment, training, working practice and accountability of those responsible for securing care for people who have suffered harm as a result of their earlier care will be considered in full at that time.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.5/2">The MSBT has considered the relative efficacy and risks of the different types of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) available to the National Health Service and recommended the use of United Kingdom single unit FFP as opposed to pooled plasma. However individual clinicians remain free to choose the best product for their patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.5/3">As a precautionary measure all FFP produced by the UK blood services has been leucodepleted to remove the white cells which evidence suggests may carry the greatest risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Although most UK FFP is not virally inactivated, high levels of safety are achieved by using single unit, as opposed to pooled plasma, by screening out potential high risk donors and by testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C before it is released to hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.5/4">The decision taken to import FFP from the United States for young babies and children born after <phrase class="date" code="1996-01-01">1 January 1996</phrase> will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable group who will not have been exposed to bovine spongiform encephalopathy through the food chain. As an added precaution, it is being treated by the National Blood Service (NBS) with methylene blue viral inactivation to further reduce the risk of viral transmission for this the most vulnerable group. The methylene blue photoinactivation system for FFP has a CE mark of conformity under the Medical Devices Directive. In addition, the NBS will be removing more than 90 per cent of the methylene blue before the FFP is issued to National Health Service hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.5/1">The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) was established under the Care Standards Act 2000 as part of the Government's reforms to modernise the regulatory system for care services and independent healthcare. Its main aims are to drive up the quality of services and improve the level of protection for vulnerable people by the regulation of social care and independent healthcare services. It carries out regular inspections of services against national minimum standards set by the Secretary of State for Health and has strong powers of enforcement to ensure that services meet the required standards.

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">Parliamentary approval for additional resources of &pound;22 million for the set-up of these new services will be sought in a supplementary estimate for the Department of Health. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at &pound;11.3 million will be met by repayable cash advances from the contingencies fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">The expenditure is required to ensure the set-up of two new bodies detailed in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill currently before Parliament.

CSCI will take on the social care services work of NCSC, the work of the Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) and the joint review team of the SSI/Audit Commission. SSI is currently a part of the Department of Health.

The Attorney-General was consulted for his views on the public interest in prosecuting this case in September 2001 (although not on the strength of the evidence). He expressed the view having regard to Parliament's intention in enacting the legislation, the stated policy of the HSE and the seriousness of the consequences of the alleged conduct of the Metropolitan Police that a prosecution was in the public interest. A prosecution had the support of the family of the deceased police officer.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.5/1">Yes, we believe it was. Parliament made a deliberate decision in 1997 that the protection of health and safety law should extend to police officers. The legislation achieved cross-party support. It was a response to representations by the Police Federation and was passed with the strong support of that body and of ACPO and the national associations of police superintendents. The same principles of enforcement apply to both public and private bodies. The various types of enforcement mechanisms serve different purposes: prohibition notices prevent an immediate danger, improvement notices improve systems, and prosecutions take place because of serious breaches of the law. It is not unusual for the HSE to enforce by way of a notice as well as to bring a prosecution. The HSE's stated policy is to prosecute where death has resulted from a breach of the legislation, with exceptions if the potential defendant is a member of the deceased's family or if the breach is trivial. Neither exception applied. After the death of PC Sidhu, HSE informed the Metropolitan Police of its intention to prosecute. Over a year later, because of the slow progress of improvement in health and safety management, six improvement notices were issued. The benefit from this prosecution has been a substantial improvement in working practices within the Metropolitan Police Service. HSE will now seek to support these improvements, and to assist in the wider application by other police forces through discussion with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.2/1">The Health and Safety Executive is reviewing with the Home Office and police service stakeholders how health and safety at work legislation applies in the context of operational policing. Those involved include representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers (England and Wales), police staff associations, the Association of Police Authorities, and the Metropolitan Police Authority. Health and safety legislation requires employers to safeguard the health and safety of police officers and others affected by their work so far as is reasonably practicable. This allows Chief Constables to take full account of the inherent risks in some police work when deciding what safeguards are needed. There is no question of health and safety legislation fettering police duties to preserve life. Neither of the incidents cited in the recent HSE prosecution involved attempts to preserve life, nor even &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of suspects.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.3/1">There is no direct connection between the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 and insurance issues for those companies involved in asbestos removal and disposal; nor is there any relationship between the making of these regulations and the numbers of contractors who fail to renew their licence.</p>

The Asbestos Removal Contractors Association has said that premiums have risen 200 per cent for removal contractors between 2001 and 2003.

	<p pid="a.77.11/1">The Government are proposing a civil partnership registration for those same-sex couples who choose to make a legally recognised commitment to each other through registering a partnership. The costs to the public purse will depend entirely on how many couples choose to register.

	<p pid="a.77.11/2">Opposite-sex couples already have the option of making a legally recognised commitment through marriage.

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">The Government's decision to propose a civil partnership registration scheme for same-sex couples only was taken on the basis of policy considerations. The Government developed their proposals on civil partnership registration to address a specific shortcoming in the current treatment of same-sex couples. Opposite-sex couples have the option of gaining legal recognition for their relationships, through getting married. Same-sex couples do not have that option. The Government's proposals would ensure that all same-sex couples, like opposite-sex couples, have the opportunity to make a legally-recognised commitment to each other and to gain rights and responsibilities to reflect that commitment.</p>

The WEEE Directive only applies to whole products placed on the market and not to individual components, sub-assemblies or consumables. Computer memory chips, camera film, CD-ROMS, floppy disks or even batteries are not covered as individual items. They need only be recycled at the end of their life when still retained within the whole device and it is the producer of the original whole product who is responsible, not the manufacturer of each part. However printer cartridges are described, it is clear that they too fall into this cadre of items and are not separately covered.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.5/1">No genetically modified plant may be cultivated in the UK or the EU unless it is authorised for such use on safety grounds under European Directive 2001/18/EC. A GM plant may also need authorisation under EU seeds, novel foods and/or pesticides legislation as appropriate. In the case of authorised GM plants being used in accordance with the terms of the relevant consents, a farmer would not commit a statutory offence by cultivating such plants, whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/2">If it were suspected that unauthorised GM plants were being cultivated by a farmer, the relevant authorities would decide in each case whether they considered an offence to have been committed, and whether to prosecute. If the farmer in question could show that the unauthorised cultivation had occurred without his or her knowledge or intent, and that they had had no reason to expect this, this would be taken into account in deciding whether or not to prosecute. It would be an absolute defence to prosecution for the farmer to show that he had taken all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid commission of the offence. If there was a prosecution, it would be for the trial court to determine whether an offence had in fact occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/3">The possibility of a successful civil legal action&mdash;for example by a seed company against a farmer&mdash;would depend on demonstrating to the satisfaction of a court that a legal duty owed by one person to another had been breached. The act of accidentally planting an authorised GM plant would only therefore give rise to such an action if, in the circumstances of the particular case, that also resulted in the farmer breaching some other legal duty owed to another person. It would be for the parties concerned to decide, on the basis of their legal advice, whether to commence legal proceedings on that basis and it would be for the courts to decide on the outcome of those proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/4">The Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission is due to submit a report to the Government this summer that explores the issue of liability in relation to GM crops. We will assess the possible need for further action in this area in the light of that report.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">The Curry commission report stated that one of the greatest opportunities for farmers to add value to their output was to build on the public's enthusiasm for locally produced food or food with a clear regional provenance. In response to this and building on the section on local food in the Government's wider Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food Defra has produced a local food policy paper (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/locfoodpolicy.PDF">http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/locfoodpolicy.PDF</a>) which looks at the claimed benefits of the local food sector and the rationale for public support, and sets out the framework within which such support will be given. To encourage the sector to develop Defra will focus its efforts where it can add value at national level, principally through national grant schemes, its public procurement initiative and spreading best local food practice nationwide. At a regional level the regional development agencies (RDAs) will endeavour to ensure there is properly co-ordinated public sector support for local food initiatives within their area and seek to address the problems of infrastructure which are hampering the development of the local food sector. Details of these measures will be contained in the regional plans which the RDAs are developing as part of the overarching delivery plan for the Government's Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">Defra will liaise with other government departments on initiatives led by them which, while not focused exclusively on local food, have an impact on the local food sector. In the case of the Department of Health this includes the National School Fruit Scheme, the &quot;Five a Day&quot; community initiatives and the Food and Health Action Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">The local food policy paper was drawn up by the department following a series of meetings of the Defra Cross-Cutting Group on Regional Food. This group brings together RDAs, Government Offices of the Regions, the Countryside Agency, Food from Britain and the Food Standards Agency. To help inform its thinking the cross-cutting group commissioned a cross-departmental Local Food Working Group to carry out a detailed examination of the local food sector. The subsequent report, Local food&mdash;A snapshot of the Sector (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/specialfoods/localfood/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/specialfoods/localfood/index.htm</a>) was published on <phrase class="date" code="">9 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">In compiling its report, the Working Group on Local Food sought to review all the available evidence and to gather as many views as possible from a wide breadth of stakeholders. A written consultation of over 500 stakeholders was carried out, including Food Links UK and its constituent members. The group also made visits to the local food sector in all the administrative regions of England. Many of these visits were facilitated by representatives from the various regional Food Links organisations. The working group also held a one-day workshop to enable a range of players and commentators in the local good arena to have an in-depth debate about the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">Finally, in drawing up the local food policy paper, we also took into account the recommendations of the Curry commission (themselves based on extensive consultation), together with the submissions which we received from over 1,000 organisations during the separate consultation exercise which the department carried out on the question of how to respond to the Curry recommendations.</p>

The UK approval holder submitted data in support of the review, including a number of laboratory studies that identified potential mutagenic effects from the use of pesticides containing dichlorvos. These included studies concerning direct effects on DNA, and on chromosome structure and number.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/2">Summaries of the data were submitted to the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. The committee concluded, with the assistance of advice from the Committee on Mutagenicity, that dichlorvos should be regarded as an in-vivo mutagen at the site of contact, and that no threshold could be assumed for the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of dichlorvos.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/3">Ministers' decision to suspend all dichlorvos approvals was taken on a precautionary basis in the light of the committees' advice. These suspensions will continue until such time as the approval holders submit further data providing reassurances regarding the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of dichlorvos.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/4">There is no ongoing government research or investigations into the incidence of clothes moth infestations in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.3/1">As part of our response to the seventh report of Session 2002&ndash;03 by the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on badgers and bovine TB, the Government undertook to review the pages of the TB webpages of Defra's internet site. This will include decisions about whether to update or replace existing pages which have fallen behind or become obsolete.

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">The Weymouth laboratory of the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) is designated under the Shellfish Hygiene Directive (91/492/EEC) as the community reference laboratory for monitoring bacteriological and viral contamination of bivalve molluscs and as the national reference laboratory for the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/2">In this capacity, the laboratory advises on use of the most probable number (MPN) procedure, but does not undertake routine testing of shellfish samples for the purpose of the classification of shellfish harvesting areas in the UK. In England and Wales this is undertaken by local laboratories of the Health Protection Agency and hospital trusts, in Scotland by FRS Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen, and in Northern Ireland by the Public Health Laboratory at Belfast City Hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/3">The Shellfish Hygiene Directive specifies the use of a five-tube three-dilution MPN procedure for the testing of shellfish samples for classification of production areas. In France, official laboratories use both a five-tube three-dilution MPN procedure and an alternative semi-automated procedure. The latter is calibrated and validated against the MPN test. The method currently in use in Holland does not appear to conform to the requirements of the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/4">Shellfish waters are also sampled under the Shellfish Waters Directive (79/923/EEC) and the associated UK regulations. In England and Wales, this is the responsibility of the Environment Agency, in Scotland of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and in Northern Ireland of the Department of the Environment. CEFAS does not undertake any responsibilities or practical work in relation to the testing of samples taken for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/1">Regional wild bird indicators drawn from the Common Birds Census are currently available for 4 regional populations from 1970 to 2000. Regional data are limited because of an insufficient number of sampling sites. In order to address this problem the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the British Trust for Ornithology will be using data from the Breeding Birds Survey (BBS), a new survey set up in 1994 in order to improve upon the coverage of the Commons Birds Census, which was originally used to produce the wild bird population indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">Figures for 2001 were not produced due to lack of data due to field restrictions to sample sites due to foot and mouth disease. It is hoped that data from the BBS will first be used to produce the 2002 national indicators which will be available in December 2003, with regional results, including additional regional indicators, following in early 2004. The better regional coverage of the BBS should enable more regional indicators to be produced.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/3">Because of foot and mouth disease restrictions on field visits in 2001 no figures were produced for that year.</p>

IPPC is being introduced on a sector-by-sector basis, concluding in 2007. Permitting is carried out by the Environment Agency and the local authorities depending on the classification of the installation.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.3/3">The Environment Agency has field staff who determine IPPC permit applications. Applications are determined by teams in the appropriate geographical area. An officer would lead on the permit determination, assisted by a permit team and technical officers. The exact make-up of the team would depend upon the complexity of the determination and the amount of secondary legislation that needs to be considered. Each of these permitting teams is supported by national advisers who would tend to specialise by sectors. At certain times over 200 operational staff will be dealing with IPPC permit applications. Approximately 50 officers provide the operational staff with policy and technical advice on IPPC.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.5/1">It is for companies that want to sell any pestcide product to show that it is not harmful to human health or to the environment. The point of the EC pesticide review, which we strongly support, is to ensure that all pesticides that continue to be produced commercially have been shown to meet modern standards of human and environmental safety. Armillatox is being withdrawn because no company chose to support tar acids (the active substance in Armillatox) in the EC pesticide review programme. Therefore we cannot be sure that the product meets modern standards of human and environmental safety. If a company wishes to re-introduce a pesticide that has been withdrawn because it was not supported in the review programme, it can re-apply for approval provided the application is supported by a modern data package.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/2">Armillatox is being withdrawn from the market under a recent EC regulation (EC No. 2076/2002). This is one of a series of regulations made as a result of a major EU review programme of all pesticides used in agricultural and related areas under Directive 91/414/EEC. Many older products like Armillatox which has been widely used to control honey fungus, were approved on the basis of limited experimental data that do not meet modern standards.</p>
