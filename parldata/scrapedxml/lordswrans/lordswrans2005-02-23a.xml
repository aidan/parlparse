The low level of cultivation and low production figure in 2001 reflect the Taliban ban on opium cultivation; the ban did not however address the underlying causes of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, which was enforced with a mix of threat and bribery and drove up the price of opium, benefiting those with opium stockpiles.</p>

Many departments maintain several databases holding personal information on individuals for differing purposes.

	<p pid="a.208.2/1">The UK state pension is payable to all those who satisfy the conditions of entitlement regardless of where they choose to live during retirement. Where a person is living outside the UK the state pension is uprated if there is a legal requirement or a reciprocal agreement to do so. In some respects these arrangements are more generous than those applied to the payment of pensions abroad by other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries; for example, restricting the exportability of the pension to claims made from within the country and paying exported pensions at a lower rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/2">However, the non-uprating of state pensions in certain countries is the subject of an appeal to the House of Lords from a decision of the Court of Appeal which found in favour of the Government. We will respond accordingly at the hearing which is set for <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/3">Since 1997, there have been two meetings between the UK and Australian governments at which the issue of the uprating of UK state pensions to persons living in Australia was discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/4">At the first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-12">12 July 1999</phrase>, the Australian government stated their intention to terminate the reciprocal social security agreement with the UK, giving the reason as the refusal of successive British governments to uprate UK state pensions paid in Australia. Formal notification was of this given on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-01">1 March 2000</phrase> and the agreement was terminated from <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/5">At the second meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-09">9 October 2002</phrase>, the issue of uprating was raised again by the Australian government. The UK Government's response was that the position and policy on the issue remained unchanged.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">The publication of Sir John's report was followed by a more major review of government policies which impact on innovation. The innovation report was published in December 2003 and examined investment by the Government in R&amp;D and wider innovation across the whole UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/2">One of the main findings of the report was that a step change was needed in the way government supported research and development to enable us to achieve real impact from our investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/3">The DTI's subsequent business support review led to the development of a number of generic support products within the technology strategy, no longer linked to individual sectors such as construction, but focusing the funds we have available on supporting industry-led technological development in areas with clear market focus and delivering broader public benefits. This mirrored Sir John Fairclough's recommendation that funding programmes should be targeted at competitiveness issues and should withdraw from short-term knowledge-transfer and incremental improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/4">It is too early to say what level of support the construction industry will be able to obtain from the new strategy, and how this will compare to the previous levels of funding available to the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/5">A number of the competitions to date have had a clear relevance to the construction industry and the modem built environment is recognised by the Technology Strategy Board as a key area for improvement. The onus is however on the sector itself to take advantage of funding opportunities as they arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.5/1">The Government believe that a market-based approach is the best way of delivering energy security, including through the provision, maintenance and replacement of electricity generating capacity to meet demand, and that this approach is working well.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/2">We expect that market signals will show when new build is both needed and economically viable.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/3">Recent announcements show that the market is already thinking about the need for new build to meet future demand. For example, Centrica is proposing to build a new power station in south west England and E.ON recently announced plans for an upgrade of its generating facility on the Isle of Grain (from part-time oil-fired generation, to full-time gas-fired generation).</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/4">For the market to work effectively, market participants need to know that the Government will let it work. As set out in the energy White Paper, the Government will not intervene in the operation of the market except in extreme circumstances such as to avert, as a last resort, a potentially serious risk to safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/5">However, through the Joint Energy Security of Supply Working Group (JESS), the DTI and Ofgem continually monitor developments in the market, and look for ways of helping the market to work effectively to deliver secure energy supplies.

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">The estimated time to construct and commission a nuclear power station, from decision to build, through to the electricity generation stage, is between 10 to 15 years. It is difficult to state with more precision the time taken due to many influencing factors including: the location of the site; the type of reactor to be built; the length of time for the approvals processes; and the length of time for any public inquiry. The time taken for the building of a new plant on an existing site would be expected to be less, when compared to a new site, due to the grid connection infrastructure already being in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.2/1">We understand there are currently 122 refugee and asylum seeker dentists on a database that is jointly maintained by the Refugee Council and British Dental Association. Of these dentists, 72 are reported as having taken the international English language test, which a dentist has to pass at level 7 before he/she may take the General Dental Council's (GDC's) international qualifying examination (IQE). So far, 30 dentists have been successful and of these 20 have passed part A of the IQE, 11 part B and 3 have become eligible to practise here by passing part C of the examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/2">We have worked with the GDC to reduce the backlog of non-European Union dentists waiting to take the IQE. With our support, the GDC has arranged for twice as many IQE sittings to be made available in 2004 than in 2003. Tenders have been invited for IQE provision in 2005-07 specifying that a guaranteed minimum completion time for dentists taking IQE is required. In addition, the Department of Health has recently agreed to support two extra sessions for retaining and returning advisers in the postgraduate dental deaneries to support dentists who are studying for the IQE, but who may require advice to maximise their chances of passing the exam.</p>
