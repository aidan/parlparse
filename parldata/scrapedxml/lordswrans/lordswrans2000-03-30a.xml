	<p pid="a.81.2/14">The majority of rifles used by the Armed Forces are of the SA 80 type. Experience in recent conflicts has shown that these rifles have a tendency to become unreliable when used in extremes of climate. We have now carried out statistically valid trials to confirm these problems and, as a result, are considering modifying the weapon to increase its overall reliability. A decision on the way forward is expected shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.0/1">An initial cost estimate of about &pound;2 million was provided to the Department for International Development in accordance with the principles of Government Accounting, under which we recover the additional cost of any goods or services provided to other government departments. As these principles are well established between departments, neither the Prime Minister nor the Chancellor of the Exchequer was consulted.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">At the time, DfID was still funding the UK's response to the emergency in Mozambique from within its existing resources. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury agreed that if and when these are exhausted, the Secretary of State for International Development will be allowed access to the Reserve to continue funding the emergency rescue effort. This has been fully understood throughout the crisis and officials from the Treasury and DfID have been keeping in close touch.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.5/1">The change to the boundaries takes effect on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April</phrase>, as planned. The responsibility for policing those parts of Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey which are currently within the Metropolitan Police District will pass from the Metropolitan Police to the respective county forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/2">Essex Police, Hertfordshire Constabulary, Surrey Police, their Police Authorities, and the Metropolitan Police have prepared for the changeover in a thorough and professional manner. A great deal of detailed work has been put in since my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced the change in June 1998. He commends them for their close co-operation, and he is confident that there will be a smooth transfer of responsibilities. People in the transferring areas need have no concerns about disruption to their local policing service.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/3">The funding for the three county Police Authorities will be increased from April to reflect their enlarged areas. In addition, we are making special payments out of the police grant totalling &pound;10 million to go towards costs arising out of the transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/4">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is confident that the benefits of the boundary changes will soon show through. He decided to change the boundaries for three main reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/5">Firstly, it makes it easier for the criminal justice agencies in the area to work together in the fight to reduce crime. Local councils and other agencies will no longer have to work with two different police forces when discharging their responsibilities under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. This is an important step towards aligning boundaries in the criminal justice system, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/6">Secondly, the change supports a democratic accountability. It gives local people a say, through their county Police Authority, in the way their area is policed. People in the transferring areas will not have a vote in the forthcoming election for London's Assembly members, who will be in the majority on the new Metropolitan Police Authority. It is right that these areas be policed by county forces whose Police Authorities, with councillor members in the majority, already provide local democratic accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/7">Thirdly, the change allows the Metropolitan Police to focus its efforts on the huge task of policing the nation's capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/8">The Metropolitan Police have policed the transferring areas since the time of Sir Robert Peel. I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of all the officers and civil staff of the Metropolitan Police who have worked in these areas over the years. They deserve the Government's thanks, and the thanks of the local communities.</p>

It also contains a suite of Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPIs) with a summary of the Metropolitan Police's performance against those BVPIs for which historical data are available, and targets for future performance. The plan also sets out a five-year plan of Best Value reviews. The areas selected for review in the coming year are: investigating and detecting crime; combating bureaucracy and managing information, and consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/6">The plan also sets out the means by which the Metropolitan Police aims to exceed the 2 per cent efficiency gains required by the Government from all police forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.2/8">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary believes that the Commissioner's plan will enable the MPA to make an effective start to providing a solid basis for monitoring and interrogating the Metropolitan Police's performance as the foundation for the plan the MPA will develop for 2001-02.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.8/1">The Director for Qualifications in the Department wrote to Chief Education Officers in England on 29th November 1999, confirming that &pound;35 million, the estimated national cost for 2000-01 of implementing the post-16 curriculum reforms in the schools they maintain, has been included in Education Standard Spending for that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.8/2">The letter made clear that, while it is for individual LEAs to decide how much funding to allocate to their schools, Ministers expect LEAs to do all they can to support the successful introduction of these reforms. They should give careful consideration to the implications of the reforms in their calculation of school budgets for 2000-01 in the light of the funds available within the overall local authority settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.8/3">Since the acutal costs of implementing the reforms will vary from LEA to LEA and school to school, it would not be meaningful either to break the national figure down into amounts at local authority level, or to seek to calculate a cost per sixth form pupil.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.8/4">In addition, schools will be receiving &pound;290 million in special grant for 2000-01, depending on their size. This funding will be part of their delegated budgets: those with sixth forms will therefore be able to use it if they wish to supplement funding received through their LEA's allocation formula to implement the post-16 curriculum reforms.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">The education maintenance allowance (EMA) pilots started in September 1999. The pilots are at an early stage but we are encouraged by progress so far. There is considerable anecdotal evidence that the EMA is making a real difference to young people's attendance and effort, and in time this should result in better attainment. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has announced that we will be extending the pilot scheme from September 2000, with additional funds made available by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2">Three main factors were used to select the EMA pilot areas.

The Consumer's Committee for Great Britain was established under the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Despite its name, the Committee's statutory responsibilities relate only to the interests of consumers in the operation of marketing schemes made under the Act. As a result of changes over the years, only one such scheme now remains, covering wool, and this scheme does not have any direct impact on consumers. We are considering, along with the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly, whether the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 should be amended. In the meantime, we intend to leave the Committee in abeyance and not re-appoint members.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">The launch of the euro in eleven European Union (EU) countries has major implications for UK firms of all sizes across a number of business sectors, including agriculture. That is why the Government established the Euro Preparations Unit (EPU) in the Treasury. Since its inception in December 1997, EPU has run a major business information campaign on the euro and published euro factsheets and case studies, which help SMEs in particular to take account of the euro now that it is a business reality. Further information can be found in the Treasury's regular euro progress reports, the most recent of which was published in November 1999. Copies of these reports are available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.5/1">Of the brains removed, a total of 3,951 were in a suitable condition for examination by all the tests that were to be applied. The results from the microscopic analysis of brain tissue showed that 18 cattle had signs of BSE infection and 3,933 were negative and showed no sign of infection. These results were put to the House on <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-16">16 July 1999</phrase>. Subsequently, the Prionics western blot test has been used on all samples and this test has confirmed the initial findings. No additional positive brains were identified. Samples will also be examined using the DELFIA test. Testing by DELFIA, and consequential interpretation of the results, has been delayed by the need to have the test evaluated by the European Commission. However, all 18 of the positive brains identified so far are positive by DELFIA. Final interpretation of the data must await the completion of DELFIA testing and evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.8/1">We are today announcing a programme of modernisation to give strategic direction to the management of research and development in the National Health Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/2">High quality modern health care depends on high quality research-based evidence. These changes bring the management of R&amp;D in the NHS into line with the principles set out in The new NHS (Cm 3807, December 1997). They provide a quality framework within which all R&amp;D funded from NHS resources will respond to the principles and needs of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/3">The Department of Health will take the lead in expressing priorities for the national effort in health services research, on behalf of the NHS. The NHS will work with other funding bodies and the universities to deliver advances in knowledge that the NHS needs for evidence-based practice and policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/4">Collaboration will replace unproductive competition. There will be no time-consuming NHS-wide bidding for NHS R&amp;D allocations from April 2001. Instead, the Government will use a modernisation fund to encourage research partnerships and networks in areas of high priority for the NHS. We want to ensure that consumers of health services are involved at every stage in the research process. New guidance will reinforce the standards of governance and performance management required of R&amp;D in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/5">The NHS is part of the national science base. These reforms ensure that the NHS and the Department of Health meet the obligations of their partnership with other research funding bodies. Within this framework, the NHS will target resources on providing a suitable environment for high quality research conducted within strategies that take account of its priorities and needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/6">The paper Research and Development for a First Class Service: R&amp;D funding in the new NHS sets out a new statement of policy and principles together with plans for implementation. Copies have been placed in the Library. It is also available on the Department of Health's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/7">These reforms build on a new review led by Professor Michael Clarke on behalf of the Central R&amp;D Committee for the NHS. We are today making his report available on the Department of Health's website. As well as the management and funding of R&amp;D in the NHS, Professor Clarke's review considered NHS priorities for R&amp;D related to cancer, the elderly, heart disease and stroke, mental health, and primary care, and took account of a review of research priorities for accidental injury. We are placing these reports on the department's website. We intend to make early progress with the R&amp;D priorities for cancer, heart disease and stroke, and mental health.</p>

This is an operational matter for which the agency is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/4">It is difficult to find an effective way of consulting the general public directly about the introduction of parking charges, but we inevitably receive unsolicited letters in the course of consulting representative organisations. In this case we received some 60 letters, of which only two or three were in favour. In such circumstances we would expect that the majority of people who feel strongly enough to write would be opposed to the proposal, but they amount to a very small proportion of the thousands of people who visit the park in a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/5">All the interested organisations that we consulted supported the introduction of parking charges in principle, although some had reservations about the level of the charge and the times when they would apply.

	<p pid="a.101.8/1">There is no routine screening programme for diabetes at present. However, this is currently being reviewed by the National Screening Committee. Residents in nursing homes and residential care accommodation, like the rest of the general population, are registered with family doctors and have access to general medical services. GPs are encouraged to screen patients for diabetes, particularly those in high risk groups, during routine consultations or to test for diabetes of patients present with symptoms or signs of the disease. Other health care professionals such as community nurses, pharmacists, optometrists and chiropodists may identify symptoms or signs and refer patients for further investigation.</p>
