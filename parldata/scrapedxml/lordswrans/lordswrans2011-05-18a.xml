	<p pid="a.326.2/2">We recognise that delivering apprenticeships in rural areas has its challenges. However, evidence from the national employer skills survey tells us that small and medium-sized enterprises employ proportionately more apprentices than larger employers, and we are committed to simplifying the system to make it as easy and simple as possible for them to continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/3">The National Apprenticeship Service and local enterprise partnerships are key to shaping effective delivery, and group training association (GTA) and apprenticeship training agency (ATA) models are making it easier for small business take on apprentices.

	<p pid="a.326.8/1">The defence dental services (DDS) oral health strategic plan provides the framework for improvement in defence dental services. The plan focuses on the tailored provision of dental treatment to service personnel at the earliest opportunity in their careers and the development of a clearly defined preventive pathway based on a risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.8/2">Project MOLAR is designed to provide an early oral health assessment and then rapid initial treatment of Army recruits, quickly improving their oral health. Introduced in 2006, this initiative has resulted in a significant increase in the dental fitness of the Army and the halving of the outstanding treatment need of the population. The success of the project is such that it will now be extended to the other services. The reduction in the need for operative treatment affords the opportunity to increase the number of preventive interventions, such as fluoride applications, which will in turn reduce future treatment needs in the population and helps to increase the number of personnel who are able to deploy on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.8/3">Robust performance management systems are also in place and these are supported by intelligent analysis of more accurate and detailed reports available since the introduction of the Defence Medical Information Capability Programme (DMICP). Furthermore, continued analysis of morbidity data from operational theatres informs policy changes and assists in the identification of the most effective treatment options for the population.</p>

The individual GCSEs or iGCSEs in those subjects do not all have to be achieved in a single exam session to count towards the English Baccalaureate.

We understand that the Kyrgyz Government intend to establish a special commission for discharging the report's recommendations. We believe this provides an opportunity for the Kyrgyz authorities to focus on the process of rehabilitation that is much needed in Kyrgyzstan, including in respect of the report's recommendations on accountability and impunity. This can make an important contribution to a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous future for all the people of Kyrgyzstan. We will continue to monitor developments closely. We will also consider ways in which we can build on our existing support for Kyrgyzstan-including, for example, a recent commitment of &#163;200,000 to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's community security initiative, which is designed to reduce inter-ethnic tensions by promoting respect for human rights and providing advice on community policing principles.</p>

	<p pid="a.350.0/1">Employers can use a wide range of pension schemes to fulfil their duty to automatically enrol qualifying workers into a workplace pension, including defined benefit, defined contribution, stakeholder, or group personal pension schemes which must meet the qualifying criteria set out in the Pensions Act 2008:</p>
	<p pid="a.350.0/2">defined benefit schemes automatically qualify if there is a contracting-out certificate<sup>2</sup> and the vast majority of defined benefit schemes are contracted out schemes. Those defined benefit schemes that are not contracted out, must satisfy a test of overall scheme quality based on a benchmark of 1/120ths annual accrual;defined contribution or money purchase schemes require an overall minimum contribution of 8 per cent of qualifying earnings of which at least 3 per cent must be paid by the employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.0/3">The decision about which qualifying scheme to use will be made by the employer, who will consider what best suits his workforce and business needs when making that choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.0/4">To ensure that employers' potential use of contract-based schemes would not conflict with the spirit of the distance marketing directive, DWP sought advice from the EU Commission. The Commission concluded the pension reforms anchor membership of workplace personal pensions firmly in the employment relationship, and do not place the worker in an unbalanced economic position.</p>

	<p pid="a.352.5/1">The World Bank is engaged in independent feasibility studies of the Rogun dam project in Tajikistan, which aim to take full account of the views of all interested parties. We are not aware that any Government have played a direct role in the appointment of consultants to the project, which we understand have been selected by strict, well-established international tendering processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.5/2">Water management issues present a significant challenge in central Asia. We continue to believe that dialogue among the parties affected, and multilateral co-operation and co-ordination (including through the EU, UN and Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, as well as organisations such as the World Bank), provide the best path to a sustainable solution. We look forward to the World Bank reports in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.353.0/1">We have not made a formal estimate of this scenario. However, in our grant letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England we stated that overall income to the sector could rise by 10 per cent in cash terms by 2014-15 based on an average fee of &#163;7,500 per year. If average fees turn out to be higher than this there would be a commensurate increase in fee income.</p>
