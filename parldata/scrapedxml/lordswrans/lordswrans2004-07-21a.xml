	<p pid="a.45.2/1">Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are joint civil-military teams that draw upon a range of expertise. Although predominantly military in composition, the British contribution to PRTs in Northern Afghanistan includes representatives from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development. The troops who serve in the PRTs are mostly infantry, drawn at the moment from the First Battalion, The Green Howards, together with the appropriate supporting staff. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-01">1 July 2004</phrase>, the UK-led PRTs have been under the command of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and so operate under the ISAF rules of engagement, which are robust and consistent with our obligations under national and international law.</p>

Some 8 per cent of the total applications received by the Commission from the 25 EU member states, in response to the first call for proposals for new Masters courses and scholarships under Actions 1 and 2 of the programme, were from UK higher education institutions. I look forward to the results of the selection exercise and hope that future calls for proposals will attract an even greater response from our higher education institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.3/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) have liaised with the Audit Commission since the coming into force of the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations 1998 in April 1999. The role of the commission is to appoint auditors to local government who then carry out their responsibilities and exercise their judgment independently of the Commission. The Commission has not therefore asked its appointed auditors to specifically identify the use of accumulated surpluses, but it has drawn their attention to guidance issued by the ODPM/WAG to individual authorities on the treatment of surpluses arising. This guidance advises that any surplus of income over costs should either be carried forward to the following financial year and offset against projected future costs (thereby resulting in reduced charges); or it should be reinvested in the quality of delivery of the building control service.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/2">There are no enforcement powers in the charges regulations. It falls to individual local authorities to interpret and apply the requirements of the regulations, to remain within <i>vires</i> and to justify their treatment of any surplus arising. However, the ODPM/WAG will continue to work with the Audit Commission in monitoring the situation and in introducing more transparency in accounting practices and providing further guidance, as appropriate. The ODPM/WAG is also currently giving consideration to proposals for a new local authority building control charging regime with the aim of introducing greater flexibility and accuracy in charge setting.</p>

The manifesto commitment was about providing new and extending existing opportunities to enable increased levels of take-up. This is being fufilled chiefly through the roll-out of school sport partnerships (all schools will be in a school sport partnership from September 2006) under the national strategy for PE, school sport and club links. Provision is also being enhanced through the Big Lottery Fund's investment of &pound;581 million in school sport facilities over 2000 to 2006. By spring 2005, funding will have been committed to 1,700 projects across England. Space for Sport and the Arts is investing an additional &pound;130 million in primary school sport facilities in deprived areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">Customs will normally consider for investigation and prosecution cases involving a clear commercial use of endangered species listed in Annexes A or B of EU Regulation 338/97 or in circumstances where a deliberate or organised attempt has been made to evade or breach the regulations for commercial gain and where there is both sufficient evidence to give a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to do so. There were no seizures during 2003 that customs deemed to meet these criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">Many seizures made are &quot;technical&quot; in nature, including errors on permits, incorrect descriptions or incorrect arrangements made for the carriage of the specimens in breach of the IATA regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">Live animals and birds seized by Customs are taken to the Animal Reception Centre at Heathrow Airport or other suitable border inspection posts to ensure compliance with the appropriate health and welfare requirements. Customs arrange the rehousing of specimens in consultation with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the Animal Reception Centre and others such as zoo authorities. In the case of highly endangered species included in Annex A of EU Regulation 338/97, Customs are required to consult JNCC, which is designated as the scientific authority for endangered fauna under the regulations. The precise rehousing arrangements depend on a number of factors including rarity of species, the number of specimens seized and availability of suitable zoos and other establishments, which can include captive breeding programmes in the case of highly endangered species.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">The 99 seizures of live animal and bird species in 2003 contained a total 2,925 specimens from the following type or genus:</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/1">Much of the detailed information sought is not available. HM Customs and Excise have no information on how many of the seizures were declared for export in the country of origin and do not require evidence of the intended destination or disposal in order to determine liability for seizure.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">Of the 411 seizures made in 2003: 42 seizures related to imports through ports; 310 related to airports; 237 were in air or sea freight; 174 were from individuals; and 30 were from 12 individuals or companies from whom Customs seized endangered species on a previous occasion since central records began in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/3">Smuggled plant items seized by Customs are taken to the Royal Botanic Gardens, who are the designated scientific authority to Defra, the United Kingdom management authority for CITES. These plants undergo quarantine and any that fail are destroyed under controlled conditions. Defra plant health inspectors will also monitor any seized plants which did not have appropriate certificates.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/4">All plants considered to be highly endangered (ie on Annex A of EU Regulation 338/97) are retained by Kew for conservation purposes. Others are either retained by Kew or donated to other botanical institutions, zoos or wildlife parks. The plants are cared for and used in the best interests of conservation.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.9/1">Only invalid carriages complying with the Use of Invalid Carriages on Highways Regulations 1988 can be used on pavements. Information provided to the Department for Transport indicates that the Segway human transporter is not such a carriage, so could be used only on a road.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.9/2">To be used on the road the human transporter would have to be registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. It would also be required to comply with the requirements of the Road Traffic Act 1988, including vehicle construction and lighting regulations, in the same way as any other powered two-wheeled vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.9/3">The Government have not carried out any assessment of the relative safety of its use on the pavement or road.</p>
