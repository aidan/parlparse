	<p pid="a.93.2/1">The Government are holding regular discussions with other governments, UN agencies, NGOs and other humanitarian actors about contingency planning for a range of eventualities in Iraq. In the event of military action, a key priority would be to minimise the suffering of the Iraqi people. This would include enabling, as quickly as possible, the provision of immediate humanitarian assistance by those best placed to do so; access for other humanitarian actors; and re-establishment of the UN Oil For Food Programme distribution network.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/2">In addition to its ongoing humanitarian programme in Iraq and its annual support for UN agencies' global emergency preparedness activities, the Department for International Development is providing &pound;3.5 million to support UN humanitarian contingency planning for Iraq, including the prepositioning of basic supplies, through funding to UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, WHO, OCHA and UNSECOORD.

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">In the written reply of my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary to Menzies Campbell on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-15">15 April 2002</phrase>, (Official Report, column 723W), he informed Parliament that we had questions about other possible breaches of the Israeli assurances about the use of UK-supplied equipment in the Occupied Territories exported under previous administrations. The Government have looked into the issue further and I am now able to inform Parliament of the outcome of our inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/2">The only equipment that has been identified as being used by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) in the Occupied Territories, and that can justifiably be regarded as constituting a breach of the assurances, is a combination of Puma and Nachpadon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). These are derivative APCs on a Centurion chassis, and which therefore have a significant and recognisable UK content. Parliament was informed of this in the reply of my honourable friend Mr Bradshaw to a Parliamentary Question from Mr Galloway on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-11">11 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/3">In our view, the Israeli assurances did not cover equipment of components exported by the UK to a third country, which components were then incorporated in that country into products for onward export. The announcement of my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary of <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-08">8 July 2002</phrase> set out how the Government will approach licence applications for goods where it is understood that the goods are to be incorporated into products for onward export.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/4">We intend to inform the Israelis of the results of our inquiries. We shall re-emphasise our current concerns about exporting arms to Israel that might be used against Palestinian targets, and that our policy on assessing Israeli export applications has not changed; we shall continue to assess export licence applications for the proposed export of controlled goods to Israel on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/5">Our staff will continue to monitor the deployment and the use of equipment by the IDF in the Occupied Territories during their regular tours of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem; and will report to me any sightings of British-supplied equipment.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.2/3">The Bill provides a right of appeal for any UK resident aggrieved at the decision to enforce a foreign disqualification in the UK. An appeal may be made on any of the grounds laid down in the Bill for recognising a disqualification. This includes determining whether a defendant was duly notified by the state of the offence of the proceedings against him and entitled to take part in them, which provides an important safeguard where a disqualification has been imposed in absentia. The appeal will not extend to the circumstances of the original offence. Rights of appeal against conviction will already have been dealt with in the state of the offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.0/1">Regular and reserve personnel deployed to the Gulf from the United Kingdom will usually not receive local overseas allowance (LOA) as the operational welfare package (OWP) is being made available to the great majority of those engaged on operations. LOA is constructed around the lifestyle of personnel based overseas, but the needs of those deployed on operations are quite different and are addressed by the OWP. The package will be delivered in stages, commensurate with the operation. The intention is to implement the communication elements of the package as soon as possible, taking account of the lack of infrastructure and harsh environment in many deployed locations. This will allow deployed personnel 20 minutes of publicly funded telephone calls per week; free forces aerogrammes and concessionary parcel rates; access to the internet and e-mail; and newspapers. Additionally, BFBS TV and radio; televisions, video recorders and videotapes; Expeditionary Forces Institute shops; and publicly funded laundry will be provided as soon as practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/2">Local overseas allowance (LOA) is not part of the military salary or a reward for overseas service. It is a tax-free cost of living addition paid only in circumstances were personnel are likely to incur greater day-to-day expenditure overseas than they would in the United Kingdom. This is not generally the case for those deployed on operations. It is accepted that those personnel who are temporarily deployed away from their permanent, LOA earning, duty station, while no longer incurring the full range of additional costs associated with that station, still have ongoing financial commitments overseas, and that many have families who remain at the permanent duty station. Consequently, all service personnel continue to receive the full LOA rate for the first 17 days of their deployment. Additionally, married accompanied personnel continue to receive the full LOA rate unless their accompanying spouse also leaves the permanent duty station for more than 17 days, at which point an abatement of approximately 35 per cent is applied. Single or married unaccompanied personnel lose 20 per cent of their full LOA rate after the first 17 days.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has just successfully concluded a long-term partnering agreement (LTPA) with QinetiQ for the delivery of the MoD's test and evaluation requirements.

	<p pid="a.100.5/4">The LTPA establishes a framework within which the MoD's relationship with its contractor can grow, over time.

	<p pid="a.103.5/1">The Work Foundation estimates are based upon a small sample of employers. The estimates are therefore subject to significant sampling and non-sampling error. Estimates from the Labour Force Survey, a much larger household survey of employees, suggest that in autumn 2002 absence rates were 1.8 per cent in the private sector and 2.3 per cent in the public sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.2/1">This Government have already reduced the rate of VAT to 5 per cent for certain services where a price cut will have the greatest effect on the regeneration and renewal of the UK's housing stock. In Budget 2001, we introduced reduced rates for the renovation of dwellings that have been empty for at least three years and for certain residential conversions. These measures help to bring vacant homes back into use and encourage better use of existing housing stock. We keep under review the use of other reduced rates for construction work where these will help with regeneration and renewal but we believe that unemployment can be tackled more effectively by targeted schemes such as the New Deal. The outcome of France's tax reduction, and reduced rates generally, are due to be reviewed by the European Commission this year, and we will be monitoring that work closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.2/1">No prosecutions have been undertaken as a result of seizures made by the detector dogs.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/2">A decision to bring a prosecution before the courts is a matter for the enforcement authority. It would take into account a number of factors, including the weight of evidence to prove intent to break the laws in question and the ability to bring the offender before the British courts. These criteria may not be easy to satisfy in the case of air passengers bringing in meat illegally, especially where small quantities are seized.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/3">In many cases, other penalties may be more appropriate. All seizures are confiscated and destroyed. We have been working with the Home Office to add details of repeat offenders to the warning index used by immigration officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/4">Officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have discussed with enforcement officers on a number of occasions the circumstances under which prosecutions might be brought against those importing meat illegally. We have made clear that prosecutions are an important aspect of deterrence which we would like to see used where there is clear evidence of a serious breach in the rules. We have also worked with the Magistrates' Association to raise awareness of the seriousness of illegal imports and to highlight the penalties available.</p>
