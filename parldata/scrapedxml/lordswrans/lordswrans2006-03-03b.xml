The regulations make clear under what circumstances it is not unlawful to possess magic mushrooms. The regulations also enable my right honourable friend, the Home Secretary, to issue a licence in respect of the production, supply, offer to supply or possession of psilocybe fungi for research purposes rather than for general use. A person does not commit an offence of possession of psilocybe fungi if the mushrooms are growing uncultivated on their land. A person does not commit an offence of possession if they pick psilocybe fungi for disposal (that is, for destruction or delivery to a person who can lawfully take custody of them) as soon is reasonably practicable and holds them in accordance with that purpose. The Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, for example, is licensed to lawfully take custody of psilocybe fungi for botanical and research purposes. There is no obligation on landowners to remove psilocybe fungi which are growing uncultivated on their land.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.3/1">The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) has announced a provisional decision to grant access to Grand Central Trains to the east coast main line. Grand Central Trains will not require any direct government subsidy. Should Grand Central Trains abstract revenue from GNER, the Department for Transport (DfT) may be exposed to part of this risk. The DfT will also forgo premium from GNER if the Leeds half-hourly service is not introduced. The sums involved will depend on the ORR's final decision.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.2/1">The Department for Transport (DfT) consults widely before setting the service specification for rail franchises. Part of this consultation is with the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). The ORR's prime role is the allocation of available network capacity and setting Network Rail's user charges. The DfT consultation with ORR primarily covers understanding of our franchise specifications and the implications of these on network capacity. Open-access rail service proposals are handled by ORR, which consults widely, including with DfT, on whether applications for access rights should be granted.</p>
