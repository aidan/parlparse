	<p pid="a.144.3/1">Under Protocol 11 to the European Convention on Human Rights, sitting judges in the European Court of Human Rights may be candidates for re-election when their term expires. The process of election set out in the convention requires the government of each state party to put forward three candidates. Election is a matter for the Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/2">The process of interviews with candidates, instituted by the Assembly for the first elections to the new Court, is the means by which the Assembly seeks to ensure that its choice between the candidates is an informed one. In the Government's view it would not be fair to other candidates if sitting judges alone were exempt from the interview requirement. Nor can it see any inherent conflict between such interviews and the principle of judicial independence. Nevertheless there could clearly be dangers for that principle if, for example, questioning to a sitting judge focused upon that judge's record in decided or pending cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/3">The Government are confident that the Assembly is fully aware of the need to respect judicial independence and will conduct the interview process accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.2/1">Some data collected centrally on numbers of persons detained in police or court cells may have ceased, although none so far has come to light. Certain central collections continue for specific purposes but they do not give figures for the numbers of persons by category detained in police or court cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/2">In England and Wales there are two sources of central information. One source monitors the total number of prisoners held in police cells due to prison overcrowding (the number has been zero since June 1995 when the overspill from prisons ceased). The other source counts persons by age, sex and offence sentenced to &quot;one day&quot; either in a police or Crown Court cell where detention can last up to eight o'clock of the evening of the day of sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/3">In Scotland and Northern Ireland no data are available centrally in respect of court cells. In Scotland the only data available centrally in respect of police cells are on the basis of person nights in legalised police cells which fall under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Prison Service. Hence the data do not count persons and no data are available centrally on ordinary police cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/4">In Northern Ireland annual totals are available for numbers of persons detained in police (PACE designated) cells for non-terrorist suspects and holding centres for terrorist suspects but this data cannot centrally be broken down further.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/5">Data on the number of persons held in police cells under Immigration Acts are not collected centrally by the immigration authorities since virtually all such persons are arrested and detained by the police and in such cases the immigration authorities will only get involved if asked to do so. In these circumstances, where detention is maintained, arrangements are made to transfer such persons into the immigration detention estate as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.3/1">The Prison Service is committed to ensuring that all prisoners can practice their religion. A key part of this is ensuring that visiting ministers are given accurate information about prisoners from their faith. Prisons are required to record the declared religion of a prisoner on arrival and to make arrangements for the appropriate minister to be informed. The Prison Service recognises that foreign national prisoners, including Immigration Act detainees held in prison establishments, may need help with translating and interpreting.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.3/2">Prison Service policy is for information to be provided in a form and language the prisoner can understand. All establishments, including those holding Immigration Act detainees, have access to Language Line, a 24-hour telephone interpreting service.

	<p pid="a.155.2/1">This Answer assumes that the Question refers to detention places. Current plans for the detention estate for each of the years is as follows: by the end of 2000, 889 places; 2001, 889 places; 2002, 1,381 places; and 2003, 1,381 places. In addition, the reception centre at Oakington has 400 places used under detention powers. The increase represents the new centres at Aldington and the replacement for Harmondsworth, less the return of Rochester to the Prison Service. Present proposals are for Aldington and the Harmondsworth replacement to be procured through the private finance initiative route, not capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/2">In the context of the Spending Review 2000 and the need to increase the removal of failed asylum seekers, consideration is being given to a further expansion of the detention estate. Preliminary work is under way on finding possible sites. I am unable to give the noble Lord information about the extent of that possible expansion until funding has been settled.</p>

It acts by implied devolution of authority from the Cabinet and its decisions therefore have the same formal status as decisions by the full Cabinet.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">There are no instances of mixed estates which are contrary to the agreement reached at the time of the sale of the families quarters estate to Annington Homes Ltd (AHL) in November 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">It might be helpful to clarify what this means in the context of the sale agreement. There are two definitions of mixed estate: one is where civilian residents are &quot;pepper-potted&quot; among military occupants of service families accommodation (SFA) and the second is where civilians occupy houses adjacent to a military &quot;patch&quot;. In recognition of the sensitivity of the &quot;patch&quot; ethos, the terms of the sale agreement precluded the former but allowed for the latter. A condition of the sale is that those SFA, identified by the MoD as surplus to operational requirements, are to be disposed of in discrete blocks. As a result, there are estates where civilians are now residing in former service families' quarters which are situated adjacent to or alongside a military &quot;patch&quot;; hence the term, mixed estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/3">Prior to the sale, there were some SFA scattered around big towns occupied by Territorial Army and Careers Information Office staffs and this situation maintains. However, there are no examples of mixed estates where military occupants are &quot;pepper-potted&quot; among civilians.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/4">Over 3,000 properties have been released to AHL throughout England and Wales under the terms of the guaranteed release scheme. The majority of these properties have been sold to private individuals and it is not possible to identify each estate where service families are adjacent to civilians.</p>

Specified risk material includes the brain and spleen of all sheep and the spinal cord and tonsils of cattle slaughtered in the UK aged over six months and the thymus and intestines of all cattle slaughtered in the UK for human consumption.</p>

WA 191) related to car driving employees when considering the effect of new road building schemes and road maintenance.

The consultation document also declared the Government's requirement of any system that the costs of operating it should be commensurate with the benefits derived from it. However, as information about the number and size of excavations in the road is not collected centrally, it is not possible at the present time for the Government to make a meaningful estimate of future yield.</p>

This included proposals in relation to public transport for both the Transitional Objective 1 and Peace II programmes. Negotiations on the new programmes are currently under way and we do not yet know precisely what the outcome or final allocations will be.

Part of the remit of the task force will be to identify the range of options for the future of the railway network in Northern Ireland. This will take account of the scope for securing additional sources of funding to augment public expenditure for railways, including public private partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.3/1">The Working Time Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1998 supersede the current arrangements which calculate pay during periods of annual leave on the basis of basic earnings. Under the regulations staff are now entitled to a week's pay in respect of each week of leave. A week's pay is to be determined in accordance with Articles 17 to 20 of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. The articles do not clearly define a week's pay. Difficulties arise in determining what payments are to be included in the calculation due to the 24-hour nature of the service provided by the HPSS and the wide variety of working patterns, which include shift work, night work, weekend and public holiday working, standing-by and sleeping-in duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/2">Regional negotiations are expected to take place with staff representatives in early May with a view to reaching agreement on the definition of a week's pay. Trusts would then implement any agreed arrangements as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.3/1">The financial position of the Northern Ireland trusts and the boards is regularly monitored by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, but the information supplied is used for the purposes of internal discussion and advice only. While the most up-to-date information provides a best estimate of the year-end financial position, in some cases the forecasts do not reflect additional income allocated to boards in recent months. The true picture of the year-end position of the trusts and boards will be shown in the audited final accounts, which fully reflect additional allocations received and are produced some months after the year end. A comparison of projected overspends within Northern Ireland with those in England and Wales would therefore not be meaningful at this stage. A detailed knowledge of the assumptions underpinning the projections of all trusts and boards in Northern Ireland, England and Wales would be necessary before any reasonable conclusions could be drawn.</p>
