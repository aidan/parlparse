Initially, we plan to call out five consultant anaesthetists and two consultant orthopaedic surgeons to report in mid-June and four consultant general surgeons to report in mid-July. Each individual will be mobilised for a period of no more than three months, which allows a little over two months' deployment in an operational theatre with the balance comprising pre-deployment training and post-tour leave. We expect to have to continue using similar, or possible slightly higher, numbers until next spring. The requirement will be reviewed regularly to ensure that the numbers called out are the minimum required to support operations.</p>

Regional assemblies in England will have a significant range of powers, but, unlike the National Assembly for Wales, we are not proposing that assemblies should have powers on such matters as the National Health Service, education, social services, local government or agriculture, nor will they have powers to make secondary legislation.

Setting unnecessarily low maximum permitted levels for nutrients in food supplements would have a detrimental impact on both manufacturers and health food retailers and would place an unnecessary restriction on consumer choice.

	<p pid="a.95.5/1">I have today placed in the Libraries of both Houses copies of the report of the quinquennial review of English Heritage. The report is also available on line at the DCMS website <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a>. The report affirms the value of English Heritage and its statutory functions. It also highlights a number of areas which need further work, in particular reviews of English Heritage's:</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/2" class="indent">1. property management function including consideration of alternative options for the management of its properties;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/3" class="indent">2. national, regional and local roles leading to a new structure which will equip the organisation to deliver its statutory and leadership responsibilities in a cost-effective and consistent manner;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/4" class="indent">3. research programme leading to the adoption of a targeted strategy linked to priorities for the sector as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/5">English Heritage already has much work under way as part of its modernisation programme. I have therefore asked it to integrate the review's findings and recommendations into that process. DCMS and other interested departments will work closely with English Heritage to ensure that the recommendations in the report are implemented quickly.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/2" qnum="HL4161">Whether their procurement policy includes environmental criteria; and, if so, what are the criteria.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-05-21a.96.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="96"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020521/text/20521w04.htm#20521w04_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.96.2/1">Government procurement policy is to obtain value for money having due regard to propriety and regularity. Value for money is defined as ''the optimum combination of whole life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to meet the customer's requirement''. Sustainable development objectives, including policies aimed at reducing adverse environmental impacts, are pursued within the framework of this procurement policy and the EC procurement rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/2">Government departments have been required since 1990 to operate procurement strategies that take into account the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions. This means drafting contract specifications (including for production processes) that reflect government objectives; selecting suppliers that have the technical capacity to meet the environmental criteria specified; and awarding contracts to the bids that offer the best combination of quality and whole-life costs for the contracting authority. Whole-life costs will include, for example, energy consumed over the life of the product or service and disposal costs. Incorporating environmental criteria into procurement is explained in a note published jointly by HM Treasury and the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions in 1998 and may be viewed on the Office of Government Commerce website. Detailed guidance on government policy and specific environmental criteria may be found in the Green Guide for Buyers&mdash;URL: <a href="http://defraweb/environment/greening/greenpro/greenpro.htm">http://defraweb/environment/greening/greenpro/greenpro.htm</a>.</p>
