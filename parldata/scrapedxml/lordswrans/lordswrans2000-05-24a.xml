	<p pid="a.87.0/1">The Government do not collect comprehensive information on the pension benefits provided by private sector schemes or public corporations. However, research by the Government Actuary's Department suggests that the majority of private sector pension schemes provide for widows continuing to receive a pension after remarriage although in most cases the amount of the spouse's pension is reduced if there is a significant age difference. Most large occupational pension schemes in the private sector allow for payment of survivor's benefits to the unmarried partners of the opposite sex of scheme members, but in an overwhelming majority of cases this is at the discretion of the trustees. Survivors' benefits are provided to same-sex surviving partners in a minority of schemes, usually at the trustees' discretion.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/2">The public service pension schemes at present provide survivors' pensions only for the legal spouse of a deceased member. This pension is suspended on the remarriage or cohabitation of the widow or widower. The Local Government Pension Scheme has taken the opportunity to amend its scheme rules and allow lifetime pensions for widows in the context of introducing a new scheme. Other public service schemes are considering the extension of lifetime pensions to widows.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/3">There is currently no provision to pay survivor benefits to opposite-sex and same-sex partners in the public service schemes. The Government have indicated that if the general membership of a public service scheme wanted to extend these benefits and were prepared to pay the additional costs, they would be prepared to consider how practicable arrangements could be devised for achieving this in the context of a statutory scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/4">The Table shows the extra costs that would be incurred by public service occupational pension schemes, based on estimates provided by the Government Actuary's Department.</p>

I have considered the report of the review and the outcome of the BPC poll, together with the Minister for Rural Affairs at the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales Secretary for Agriculture and Rural Development. We agreed that the council carries out a necessary function that could not be so efficiently carried out by other means.

These new interactive services will play a crucial part in the Government's plan to make the United Kingdom a world leader in the knowledge economy by 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today placed in the Library copies of the Annual Report of the British Board of Film Classification for 1999, which gives details of the board's financial accounts and activities for the year ended <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-31">31 December 1999</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-16">16 May</phrase>, the High Court announced that the Board had lost judicial review proceedings brought by it in respect of appeals against its decision not to classify seven sexually explicit videos in the R18 category--which are available only in licensed sex shops. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary and I are very disappointed with the outcome. We believe that the situation is unsatisfactory and will be considering carefully whether there are any additional effective steps that can be taken to protect children from exposure to sexually explicit material. Any such changes may require legislation and we intend to issue a consultation paper on the matter shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.5/1">The Law Commission published a consultation document on the law of double jeopardy on <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-12">12 October 1999</phrase> following my request to it of <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-02">2 July 1999</phrase> as part of the Government's response to the Stephen Lawrence report. The consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-31">31 January</phrase> and the commission is considering the responses received before making its final recommendations to the Government. As the terms of reference intended, the consultation document did refer to prosecution rights of appeal but not in any detail as to how these might be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/2">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has, therefore, today formally asked the Law Commission to undertake a review of the law governing prosecution appeals against judge directed acquittals in criminal proceedings and other adverse rulings by a judge which may lead to the premature ending of the trial. The terms of reference for this review are:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/3" class="indent">&quot;To consider</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/4" class="indent">(a) whether any, and if so, what, additional rights of appeal or other remedies should be available to the prosecution from adverse rulings of a judge in a trial on indictment which the prosecution may wish to overturn and which may result or may have resulted, whether directly or indirectly, in premature termination of the trial;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/5" class="indent">(b) to what, if any, procedural restrictions such appeals would be subject and to make recommendations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/6">I should emphasise that the issue here is the question of a prosecution right of appeal against adverse rulings made by the judge, which leads to the ending of the trial before the jury has considered the evidence. The question whether, and in what circumstances, a jury's decision on the evidence to acquit can be challenged is the subject of the double jeopardy consideration by the commission. Both these issues are entirely separate from the prosecution's right of appeal against an unduly lenient sentence after a jury has convicted a defendant.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.2/1">This project, known as EWAY, is intended to utilise part of the former route of the old Comber railway line. No decision has been made on whether to proceed with the EWAY project. Consequently, compensation to property owners is not an issue at this time. However, within the Belfast Urban Area Plan 2001, which is the statutory plan for Greater Belfast, it is proposed that the old Comber railway line will be utilised for road schemes. Land to build these schemes has therefore been afforded protection. The owners of properties affected by planning blight because of these schemes may seek compensation by means of the Planning Blight (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1961.</p>
