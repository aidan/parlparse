	<p pid="a.44.6/1">The independent Parole Board last considered Mr Chester's case on the papers in December 2002, prior to the interim arrangements introduced as a result of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) judgment in Stafford.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.6/2">In April 2003, Mr Chester's solicitors requested that the case be referred back to the Parole Board for reconsideration at an oral hearing, and that a fresh set of reports should be obtained. According to the solicitors, the Parole Board listed the case for an oral hearing on two separate occasions. However, on neither occasion were the solicitors or the Secretary of State told and as a result the hearing did not proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.6/3">In February 2004, a single member of the Parole Board considered the case under the interim arrangements and recommended that the case should proceed to a full oral hearing. That hearing was scheduled for early May 2004 but was deferred for three months at the request of Mr Chester's solicitors in order that they could commission an independent report.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.6/4">The deferred hearing was rescheduled to take place on 21-<phrase class="date" code="">22 September</phrase>. Unfortunately the judge was unable to attend and the Parole Board rearranged the hearing for <phrase class="date" code="">29 September</phrase>. At that later hearing, Mr Chester's counsel requested a further deferral to enable witnesses to attend. The case has now been relisted for hearing in early December.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.3/1">The costs of requiring all trains to be compliant with the regulations made under the DDA will depend on the date that by which time all non-compliant rolling stock must be made accessible. We consulted earlier this year on our proposals for setting an end date for all rolling stock to comply with the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations. This indicated the Government's preferred date of 2025. The total capital costs of meeting that date are currently estimated at &pound;33.4 million for surface rail and &pound;71.1 million for the London Underground.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/2">No estimate is available for the costs of making all stations accessible. However the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is planning to consult soon on its draft disability strategy, which we expect will consider how best to allocate resources to help station operators to meet their obligations under Part 3 of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/3">London Underground is committed to improving access and has developed a key network strategy. The strategy identifies 100 stations across the network (in addition 40 are already accessible), which covers all lines and major branches and gives good opportunities for accessible interchange both between lines and with other modes. Other stations will be linked to those on the key network by fully accessible bus services.</p>
