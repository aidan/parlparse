	<p pid="a.51.5/1">Animal Health (AH), an executive agency of Defra, has a programme of co-ordinated exotic animal disease exercises being undertaken by Animal Health divisional offices (AHDOs) throughout Great Britain. This is in addition to the Defra/Animal Health national exercise which is held approximately every two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/2">The aim of the exercises is to demonstrate the AH's emergency preparedness to deal effectively with outbreaks of exotic animal disease and identify lessons for the future. Each AHDO is required to take part in one full-scale exercise each year and AH strategically ensures that it tests plans for the exotic diseases that are deemed to be a high priority for contingency planning. The distribution of exercises is based on a mixture of the most likely diseases to be encountered and the national strategic objective of ensuring that plans for all high-priority diseases are tested.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/3">During the last financial year (April 2006 to April 2007) there were a total of seven British exercises undertaken (involving 16 AHDOs). Of these, two (involving four AHDOs) were for foot and mouth disease. In Scotland, there was one exercise (involving three AHDOs) with none for foot and mouth disease. In Wales, there was one exercise (involving two AHDOs) with none for foot and mouth disease. In addition, during this period, six AHDOs (including one in Wales) were involved in Exercise Hawthorn, the national avian influenza exercise. The last national exercise for foot and mouth disease, Exercise Hornbeam, was in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.4/2" qnum="HL5435">What is the annual amount raised by the imposition of Value Added Tax (VAT) on the cost of repairs to historic houses; and what consideration they are giving to removing VAT on such repairs or providing a tax allowance to offset the cost of such repairs.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.5/1">Approved alteration work to listed houses is already VAT zero-rated. Under our VAT agreements with our European partners, we may not extend our existing zero rates or introduce any new ones. It is therefore not possible to extend this zero rate to cover all repair work to all historic houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">A direct tax allowance for repairs and other running expenses is already available for owners of historic properties that are open to the public as a trading activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/3">As regards further measures, all taxes are kept under review and any changes are considered by the Chancellor as part of the Budget process.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/4">HM Revenue and Customs does not collect data on VAT from individual goods and services.</p>
