The Government have considered this previously and remain of the opinion that a detailed study would not be a proper use of resources given their position on Schengen. Our decision not to participate in Schengen is based on our geography. Common travel arrangements are sensible for countries with land borders. However, the United Kingdom has a unique island position and traffic is naturally channelled to ports where immigration controls are most effective. Signing up to Schengen and abolishing our border control would conflict with this.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.8/1">Women play a vital role in the Armed Forces. They have made, and continue to make, a valuable contribution to recent and current operations. The great majority of posts in the Armed Forces are already open to them. Only posts in the Royal Marines General Service, Household Cavalry, Royal Armoured Corps, the Infantry and Royal Air Force Regiment remain closed for reasons of combat effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/2">Following a detailed study into the performance and suitability of women in these close-combat roles, we have concluded that the case for lifting the current restrictions has not been made. We are today placing in the House of Commons Library the report of this study, entitled Women in the Armed Forces, together with a short paper explaining the reasons for the decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/3">Although women are, on average, less able to meet the physical demands of these roles, some women would certainly be able to do so and this was not, therefore, in itself a reason to exclude them.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/4">The key issue was whether the inclusion of women in close combat teams could adversely affect the combat effectiveness of those teams in a high-intensity direct fire battle. All the units in question operate primarily in small units as fire teams or tank crews.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/5">The evidence available suggests that on operations other than close combat the presence of women in small units does not affect performance detrimentally. However, there is no evidence to show whether this remains the case under the extraordinary conditions of high intensity close combat.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/6">Given the lack of relevant direct evidence from either field studies or the experience of other countries, we have concluded that military judgment must form the basis of the decision. The military advice is that under the conditions of a high-intensity, close-quarter battle, group cohesion becomes of much greater significance to team performance and in such an environment the consequences of failure can have far-reaching and grave consequences. To admit women, therefore, would involve a risk without any offsetting gains in terms of combat effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/7">The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 allows the Armed Forces to exclude women from close combat posts. The judgment of the European Court of Justice in Sirdar the Army Board and the Secretary of State and relevant European Community equality law uphold that position, subject to a requirement periodically to assess the position.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/8">The Ministry of Defence is committed to equality of opportunity consistent with the need to maintain combat effectiveness. It will continue to work with the Equal Opportunities Commission and discuss with it the results of further work to examine the wider issues raised by this study. Women must have the same opportunities as men to progress to the highest ranks.</p>

They also have a duty to ensure their children receive a suitable education in school or otherwise. If parents have been offered a school place for their child, the LEA has met its duty. If parents do not accept the place offered and do not make alternative provision, it is for the LEA to consider whether to take school attendance proceedings.</p>

There is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an approved document if the person carrying out the work prefers to meet the relevant requirement in some other way. Approved documents are intended to provide guidance on ways of meeting the requirements of the Building Regulations for some of the more common building situations. It is for the Building Control Body, on a case-by-case basis, to satisfy itself that the requirements of the Building Regulations have been met. In relation to sandwich panels, its considerations in such matters can be assisted by referring to the relevant guidance contained within Appendix F of Approved Document B, along with any other suitable sources of information. The powers of enforcement of the Building Regulations are set out in various sections of the Building Act 1984. Sections 35 and 36 provide the main powers for enforcement by a local authority and paragraph 52(1)(c) stipulates the course of action to be taken by an approved inspector who is of the opinion that there is a contravention of a provision of the Building Regulations.</p>
