	<p pid="a.1.2/1">If the 1998 reporting (1,331 teacher deaths) is fairly accurate, and given the overall HIV infection trends in the adult population, Zambia will lose to AIDS annually about 2.8 per cent of its teaching force between 2000 and 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">To this should be added morbidity, based on approximate loss of 6 months of labour prior to full-blown AIDS, and 12 months' loss prior to death, giving a figure of 4.2 per cent loss of available teacher labour to 2010--i.e. 1,996 teacher equivalents per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">This has to be compared to national output of trained primary teachers of 2,226 per annum at present. The estimates in 1 and 2 are likely to be under-estimates, therefore the supply-demand is almost balanced at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.0/3">The court concerned may be either the Sheriff or a District Court. However in practice the majority of community disposals made and any subsequent breach proceedings conducted occur in the Sheriff Courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/4">In detail, the respective roles are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/5" class="indent">(a) The Procurator Fiscal. When an offender appears before the court for breach proceedings, it is customary for the Procurator Fiscal to be present also. This is because of his involvement in the original criminal proceedings which led to the imposition of the community order, and because, if the offender disputes that he has breached the order, it will be the Procurator Fiscal (and not the social worker or probation officer) who will have to lead evidence to satisfy the court that there has been a breach. Because of this, it may happen that a local authority social work department asks the Procurator Fiscal to review the evidence before the matter is passed to the court for its decision as to whether to institute breach proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/6" class="indent">(b) Local authority social work departments appoint a supervising officer, who is responsible for ensuring the offender's compliance with the terms of the community order in accordance with national standards and objectives. Where he considers that the offender has breached the order, the supervising officer submits a report to the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/7" class="indent">(c) Justices of the peace sit in the District Courts in Scotland. They carry out functions in these courts in respect of breaches of community disposals similar to sheriffs in the Sheriff Courts. The District Courts are involved in the decision to commence breach proceedings, and in hearing breach proceedings, only where the original order was made in a District Court in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/8">Part III of the Bill, as amended at Report stage in the Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-27">27 June 2000</phrase>, provides for the loss of benefit to occur only after the Sheriff or District Court has determined that an offender has breached his community order. The roles of the various parties in taking breach action are the same.</p>

The common law of Guernsey permits parents to use reasonable corporal punishment in the chastisement of their children. In Jersey, there is no legislation currently prohibiting corporal punishment of children by parents. Article 9(5) of the Children (Jersey) Law 1969 provides that: &quot;nothing in this Article shall be construed as affecting the right of any parent, teacher or other person having the lawful control or charge of a child to administer punishment to him&quot;. The law in the Isle of Man is that parents may administer &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; to their children.</p>
