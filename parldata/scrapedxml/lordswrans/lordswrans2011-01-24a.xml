	<p pid="a.83.3/1">The phrase &quot;Good for nature, Good for you&quot; was chosen by the Commission as part of its organic promotion campaign to convey that a system of farming that promotes biodiversity can improve the lives of European citizens by enhancing their enjoyment of rural areas. The wording may be ambiguous in the English language as it could be seen to suggest that all organic products are nutritionally beneficial, which is not the case, for example, for organic confectionary. When the campaign was being developed in 2006-07, Defra officials proposed that the Commission adopt the wording &quot;Good for nature, good for us&quot;, better to convey the essential objective.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.6/1">Whether organic production delivers environmental benefits is a complex issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.6/2">In respect of improved biodiversity attributable to organic systems, studies include those by Shepherd et al. 2003, Hole et al. 2005 and Norton, L. et al. 2008. While these recognise that alternative methods of encouraging biodiversity on non-organic farms may be at least as effective, they also note that the organic system provides a valuable whole farm approach to encouraging environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.6/3">However, other studies arrive at different conclusions. For example by Gabriel et al. 2010 conclude that organic farming delivers only small increases in biodiversity on average and in some farm types a slight reduction in the numbers of small birds such as linnets and skylarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.6/4">In terms of organic production being better for consumers, recent studies funded by the Food Standards Agency have shown that there are no important differences in the nutrition content of organic food when compared with conventionally produced food. However, it is clear that some consumers prefer not to have detectable residues in their food, and certified organic food contains fewer pesticide residues than food produced using conventional methods.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.6/5">Organic regulation imposes strict animal welfare requirements on farmers and many consumers prefer to rely on the assurance of good welfare provided by the purchase of certified organic livestock products. Consumers may also choose organic products because they do not use hydrogenated fats or synthetic flavours. As stated above, consumers of organic products may also contribute to environmental benefits biodiversity. These are areas in which consumers may consider that organic foods are better for them.</p>

All zero rates are derogations from the normal European Union VAT rules, and represent benefits not enjoyed by charities elsewhere in Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.6/2">The Government continue to look at ways of ensuring that VAT does not act as a barrier to the reform of public services where such options are open to us and affordable within agreed funding arrangements. For example, we are continuing to work closely with the charity and other sectors to explore options for implementing the European Union VAT exemption for cost sharing, and the recent announcement of a new VAT refund scheme for academies demonstrates the Government's willingness to create a level playing field for VAT where this can be done in a fair, targeted and affordable way.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.5/1">There has never been a requirement for all early education and care settings to be led by a graduate professional. We have, however, recently removed the overly prescriptive requirement for all Sure Start children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas to provide full day care, and the associated requirement that this provision be delivered by both a qualified teacher (QT) and an early years professional (EYP).</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/2">In the past, children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas were required to provide full day care, i.e. 10 hours a day, five days a week, for 48 weeks a year. However, the National Audit Office memorandum for the Children, Schools and Families Committee, December 2009, suggested that in some areas, when demand for full day care is low, money intended for other Sure Start services-like family support and outreach to vulnerable families-is subsidising the provision of early education and care.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/3">We do expect children's centres to continue to play a critical role in early education and care, including providing and encouraging take-up of free nursery education for two, three, and four-year-olds and additional hours where there is demand. Furthermore, where children's centres in disadvantaged areas offer early education, we would expect this to be of the highest standard and delivered by either a QT or an EYP.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/4">The Government remain committed to investing in the quality of the early education and childcare workforce, and will develop proposals to support this by March 2011. The recent local authority and school funding settlement provides for the ongoing support and development of the workforce. From April 2011 Funding is being made available through a new simplified early intervention grant. Continued national investment in the early years workforce includes the funding of places on the early years professional status programme and the new leaders in early years programme which began in November.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/1">Regulation 244/2009 sets the timetable for the EU-wide mandatory phase out of incandescent bulbs. This became law, directly applicable in all EU member states, in spring 2009 after agreement by the European Parliament and Council. Article 7 requires the European Commission to review the regulation no later than five years after it entered into force. We have no plans to seek an early review.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/2">Compact Florescent Lamps (CFLs) contain small quantities of mercury. The amount of mercury is limited by the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive to 5 mg (and will be reduced over the next two years). Before the ban on placing 100W incandescent light bulbs on the market came into force in September 2009, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) reviewed the potential health effects of mercury exposure from broken CFLs, and found that the exposure was likely to be small and very unlikely to cause harm. Nevertheless, they should be disposed of responsibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/3">The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) requires CFLs to be recycled. WEEE requires distributors to take back used electrical equipment but in the UK many retailers have opted instead to pay into a central distributor take-back scheme, which has funded many local authority recycling sites. From these sites, manufacturers are obliged to fund the transport, treatment and recycling, where most of the mercury can be recovered.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/4">CFLs also cause less mercury to be emitted to the environment over their life time than incandescent light bulbs. This is because mercury is emitted from power stations during electricity generation. As CFLs are more energy efficient, less energy needs to be generated.</p>

These projections were subsequently updated by the previous Administration to reflect the final design of the feed-in tariffs (FITs) scheme as introduced in April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/2">The final impact assessment, which was published in February 2010, includes the most recent projections. These suggested that approximately 750,000 small-scale (i.e. up to 5MW) renewable installations would be incentivised under FITs by 2020, generating approximately 3TWh additional small-scale renewable electricity in 2020. Of these, 725,000 were expected to be domestic scale renewable installations, predominantly solar photovoltaics.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/3">The final impact assessment also estimated that the expected cost to consumers of FITs, cumulative to 2030, would be in the order of &#163;6.7 billion, leading to an average increase in annual household electricity bills of approximately &#163;8.50 over the period 2011-30. It should be noted that these estimates relate to the costs of supporting all FITs installations and not just PV.</p>

This is because entitlement to ESA is not condition-based but is based on someone's functional assessment, which varies between individuals with the same condition.

	<p pid="a.120.2/1">The safety of electric ovens and hobs is regulated by the Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 1994 (SI 1994/3260). European Harmonised standards, also published as British Standards, such as BS EN 60335-2-6:2003 provide a presumption of conformity to the requirements of the regulations. However, that presumption is challengeable by an enforcement authority by an argued safety case. The regulations do not make it mandatory to comply with a standard, but products must comply with the regulations and be safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/2">The standards set what are considered as &quot;State of the art, good engineering practice, extending of scientific knowledge, ability of engineering to produce solutions, reasonable expectations of consumers, and further relevant aspects&quot;. Compliance with a standard is a generally easier route than complying directly with the requirements of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/3">It is for CEN/CENELEC and the national standards bodies such as the British Standards Institute to keep the standards up to date. Inputs into the national standards bodies, such as through the British Standards Institute (BSI), and from European initiatives such as that for the older person and persons with disabilities take forward the understanding of what forms a safe product. The Government would only become involved in extreme cases, e.g. where a product is removed from the market by Trading Standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/4">Currently clause 7.9 of BS EN 60335-1:2002 requires that switches on electrical appliances which may give rise to a hazard when operated shall be marked or placed so as to indicate clearly which part of the appliance they control. A revision to BS EN 60335-2-6:2003 will make it necessary for electric ovens and hobs to have either a tactile or audio-visual indication for switches. As time passes, expectations change and state of the art advances these requirements can be expected to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/5">The Government are currently content with the standardisation activity which is kept under review. Persons with strong views on current requirements of standards are free to directly approach the national standards body-for the UK that would be BSI.</p>

The Government's policy on influenza vaccination is informed by the expert advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). In its statement of <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-23">23 July</phrase>, JCVI recommended that only those children with clinical conditions which put them more at risk from the effects of influenza should be offered the vaccine. JCVI does not recommend that children under the age of five outside the at-risk groups should be vaccinated. JCVI met on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-30">30 December</phrase> to review the latest evidence on this issue. The JCVI chairman subsequently assured me that this advice remains appropriate, and recommended that efforts be focused on maximising vaccine uptake among all those in the risk groups. As with all vaccination programmes, JCVI will keep this matter under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.3/1">Under longstanding agreements with our EU partners, we are permitted to retain our existing VAT zero rates, but not to apply any new ones or extend the scope of existing zero rates. For that reason, no estimate has been made of the cost of introducing additional VAT zero rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.3/2">Local authorities and NHS bodies do have to pay VAT on goods and services. However, many of their activities are carried out under a statutory obligation, not by way of business, which means that, even where they make a charge for them, those bodies are not required to charge VAT. Ordinarily, if a body is not charging for goods or services supplied in the course of business, it is not allowed to reclaim as input tax any VAT it has incurred on goods or services bought in to make that supply. However, to avoid such irrecoverable VAT falling as an additional burden on taxpayers, legislation exists to allow local authorities and NHS bodies to recover VAT charged to them on purchases to fulfil their statutory obligations, subject to certain conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.3/3">Charities are not subject to similar statutory obligations, and so their activities are covered by the normal VAT rules. However, they do benefit from a range of tax reliefs which for 2009-10 the Government estimate are worth approximately &#163;3 billion per annum. These include reliefs from VAT, for example: VAT zero-rating on the sale of donated goods, medical and scientific equipment and, for qualifying charities, goods for use by disabled people. All zero rates are derogations from the normal EU VAT rules, and represent benefits not enjoyed by charities elsewhere in Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.0/2">The Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts show that the Government's plans will deliver sustainable growth for each of the next five years, with employment rising by 1.1 million by 2015, and the deficit falling. These forecasts took full account of the VAT increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/3">The Budget assumed no further change to the 20 per cent standard rate of VAT, which is a structural change to the tax system to deal with a structural deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/4">The VAT increase is broadly progressive in terms of households' expenditure; and, overall, the Budget will have no measurable negative impact on child poverty in the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/5">The poorest will benefit from other measures announced in the Budget including the &#163;1,000 increase in the income tax allowance, the increases in child tax credit, and new triple-lock annual increases in the state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/6">In addition, VAT on everyday essentials like food and children's clothing will remain zero-rated and household energy will remain subject to the reduced rate.</p>
