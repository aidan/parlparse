	<p pid="a.96.6/1">Further to my reply to Lord Clarke of Hampstead on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-11">11 July</phrase> (Official Report, WA 63), I can announce that today the Government are publishing in full the independent report, its summary and recommendations, of the Hon. Mr Justice Butterfield following the completion of his review.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/2">The Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I asked Mr Justice Butterfield to examine the circumstances that led to the termination of the London City Bond (LCB) prosecutions in Liverpool Crown Court on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November 2002</phrase>, the changes in practice within HM Customs and Excise (HMCE) since the time of the cases to which those prosecutions related, and HMCE's compliance with best practice in the use of investigation techniques. The full terms of reference for this review were given in the reply I gave to Lord Peston on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November 2002</phrase>, (Official Report WA 26). In addition the House will be aware that the Government are looking at the links between law enforcement agencies which investigate serious crime, alongside the review the Chancellor has announced on the future of the tax institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/3">The Government welcome the report, and is grateful to Mr Justice Butterfield and his team for completing the study so promptly and for the extensive research that underpins his conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/4">The review's main findings are:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/5" class="indent">that there were major failings in the investigation into and prosecution of the LCB cases, investigated by HMCE from 1995 to 1998;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/6" class="indent">but that, since then, there have been significant changes, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/7" class="indent">far-reaching improvements in management, structure and culture within HMCE;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/8" class="indent">changes to the legal framework controlling the regulation of Excise warehouses, which have closed the loopholes used by the criminals in the LCB frauds; and</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/9" class="indent">following the Gower/Hammond review, the separation of responsibility for the conduct of prosecutions from responsibility for the conduct of investigations, by making the Customs and Excise Prosecutions Office (CEPO) accountable to the Attorney-General, and not to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, since April 2002; that these changes have gone a long ways towards dealing with the problems within HMCE underlying the LCB cases, and Mr Justice Butterfield makes a number of recommendations designed to reinforce this change process.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/10">Mr Justice Butterfield also identifies three important areas of concern in criminal law and practice highlighted by the LCB cases, all of which have a wider application than HMCE cases. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/11" class="indent">the use of &quot;abuse of process&quot; in trials as a mechanism for attacking investigation processes;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/12" class="indent">the challenges investigators and prosecutors face in complex cases in meeting their disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996; and</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/13" class="indent">aspects of informant handling. HMCE investigation and prosecution</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/14">The Government welcome Mr Justice Butterfield's conclusion that significant progress has already been made by HMCE in dealing with the issues underlying the failure of the LCB cases, and the unequivocal finding that there is no evidence in the LCB cases of improper enticement or encouragement to commit crimes or of entrapment.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/15">Most importantly, the Government welcome Mr Justice Butterfields's conclusion that &quot;HMCE should now put the events of the London City Bond cases behind them and move forward, but not in a spirit of complacency&quot;, and the recommendations he makes on how this process, already substantially under way, can be reinforced.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/16">Mr Justice Butterfield makes a number of important recommendations that encourage HMCE and the CEPO to continue the programme of reform underway in the Department. These recommendations relate to:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/17" class="indent">HMCE's role as an independent investigating force&mdash;the Government accept Mr Justice Butterfield's finding that, under the current arrangements, HMCE should continue in its present role;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/18" class="indent">the handling of human intelligence sources&mdash;the Government accept these recommendations, and HMCE will promptly implement the new guidelines and procedures which are outlined in the report;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/19" class="indent">training for investigators&mdash;the Government accept these recommendations, and HMCE will incorporate them into an improved training programme for specialist investigators;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/20" class="indent">external scrutiny of investigations work&mdash;the Government accept the principle of external scrutiny of HMCE investigations work, and HMCE has been asked to undertake a study to identify how additional external scrutiny can best be introduced; and</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/21" class="indent">HMCE's regional structure, and in particular expertise in Scottish Law&mdash;the Government agree with the analysis in the review, and has asked HMCE to ensure that proper and informed legal advice is available to Scottish investigators and intelligence officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/22">In addition, the review recognises that CEPO has been revitalised since the Gower/Hammond review and welcomes the changes that have taken place, in particular the increased independence that followed the transfer of accountability for HMCE's prosecution function to the Attorney-General in April 2002. However, Mr Justice Butterfield draws a number of conclusions, which include recommendations:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/23" class="indent">that, in order to make its independence from HMCE even more transparent, CEPO should become an entirely separate prosecuting authority accountable to the Attorney-General;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/24" class="indent">that there should be an increase in the number of investigation legal advisers employed within Customs, who play no part in the prosecution process but are available to provide advice to investigators; and</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/25" class="indent">that a more systematic dialogue between HMCE and other government departments responsible for related practical and policy issues would be desirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/26">The Government strongly agree that the ability of prosecutors to exercise their decision-making and other prosecution functions independently should be ensured. The Government will be considering the full practical implications of these recommendations, and in particular how the independence of the prosecutors in CEPO can best be strengthened further. The Government will provide a detailed response to all these recommendations in the autumn. Criminal justice system</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/27">The review concludes that the criminal justice system does not work as effectively as it should, but recognises that some of the problems identified are being addressed in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament. The review recommends that consideration is given to:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/28" class="indent">reforming the operation and rules of the disclosure regime in complex criminal cases;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/29" class="indent">the power of judges to control proceedings before them relating to abuse of process; and</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/30" class="indent">the operation of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.6/31">These recommendations have potential implications across the criminal justice agencies and departments. While accepting that they highlight important areas of concern, the Government will give them further detailed consideration before deciding whether to accept them.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.3/1">We are pleased to announce the publication of the independent Complaints Audit Committee (CAC) annual report for 2002&ndash;03. Copies are available in the Library of the House and on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.3/2">This is the CAC's ninth annual report. Their role is to monitor the effectiveness of IND's procedures for investigating formal complaints about the conduct and efficiency of staff in IND. Their findings are a very valuable contribution to the process of continuous improvement within IND.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.3/3">The annual report highlights a number of areas where IND could improve, together with useful recommendations. IND will use these recommendations to help to inform its wider change and reform strategy, one of the key elements of which is to make it a more customer-focused organisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.2/2">The new Challenge Fund will be used in co-operation with partners in the ex-service organisations, non-governmental organisations and public sector to pump-prime new projects or research or buy into existing activities in order to give them a veterans-related dimension.</p>

We would like the fund to be used to support a few projects in each area.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/4">&pound;500,000 has been made available for the remainder of this financial year and up to &pound;750,000 is planned for each of the next two financial years. Arrangements for the longer term will depend on the success of the fund over this initial three-year period.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">The Government will make an announcement in due course in response to the consultation on the future of Great Britain's equality institutions launched last October (Commons Hansard: <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-22">22 October 2002</phrase>; col. 246W), which looked at the possibility of creating a single equality body among other options. As the consultation document made clear, no new body would be established before 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2">The Government are taking forward a significant legislative agenda on equality matters. This includes introducing protection against discrimination in employment and vocational training on the grounds of sexual orientation, religion and belief and age to implement the EU Employment and Race Directives. We are also strengthening and widening existing disability legislation, providing rights of recognition for trans-gendered people and looking at how same-sex partnerships might be recognised. These are far-reaching changes which will need time to bed down once they are introduced. We do not believe that a single equality Bill is the most appropriate way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.5/1">We have today published for consultation a set of draft clauses that we intend to be part of a wider gambling Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/2">The Bill will make major changes to the way in which gambling is regulated and controlled in Great Britain. It will build on the work undertaken by Sir Alan Budd and the gambling review body that he led.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/3">It is based on the three key principles. First, the principle that the system of gambling law and regulation must keep the gambling industry free of crime. Our industry has a high international reputation for integrity, which must not be put at risk. Secondly, the law must ensure that gambling is conducted fairly, so that players know what to expect. Thirdly, there must be effective protection for children and the vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/4">The controls we have on gambling today date from the 1960s and 1970s. They have served us well, but have failed to keep up with society's attitudes to gambling and developments in technology and the leisure industries. They need to be modernised. But modernisation must not be allowed to generate an upsurge in problem gambling. I am determined that we will maintain the highest standards of social responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/5">Sir Alan recommended the establishment of a new national regulator for all forms of gambling. It was proposed that this regulator, the gambling commission, should license gambling operators and key individuals involved in the provision of gambling, and that local authorities should license gambling premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/6">In A Safe Bet for Success (published in March 2002, Cm 5397) we accepted the vast majority of the gambling review's recommendations. We have been working closely with the interested industries, representatives of groups encouraging responsible gambling, local authorities, consumer groups, other government departments and the devolved administrations to prepare draft legislation that would give effect to this new system of regulation, which will be centred on the creation of a new national regulator&mdash;the gambling commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/7">The proposals published today allow for the establishment of a gambling commission, transforming the Gaming Board for Great Britain into a new body with wider functions, greater flexibility to act and stronger enforcement powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/8">The clauses describe the three purposes of gambling regulation, which will guide the work of the Commission. They outline the ways in which the commission will be able to use codes of practice to ensure best practice across each sector of the gambling industry. Codes of practice issued by the commission will be an important feature of the new legislation, giving the regulator more flexibility to respond to changing circumstances that may raise issues of consumer protection or threats to vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/9">The draft Bill goes on to describe the principal function of the gambling commission&mdash;the licensing of gambling operations and key personnel. The commission will have flexibility to impose licence conditions on categories of licences and, where necessary, on specific operators. It will also have powers to review licences where it believes conditions have been breached or where there is some threat to the three objectives of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/10">Local authorities are to be responsible for the licensing of gambling premises. Details of these proposals will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/11">The Government remain committed also to the sale of the Totalisator Board and the abolition of the Horserace Betting Levy Board. We will bring forward legislation to achieve these objectives as soon as parliamentary time becomes available. Should parliamentary time become available prior to the introduction of a gambling Bill, we will leave open the option of pursuing our horseracing proposals in a smaller, separate measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/12">I understand that a Joint Committee of both Houses is to be convened to examine the Government's draft proposals. The draft gambling Bill is precisely the sort of legislation, cutting across party lines but with some potential for controversy, that will benefit from pre-legislative scrutiny by both Houses. Such scrutiny will improve the legislation and build parliamentary understanding and public confidence, enabling us to strike the right balance between deregulation and the protection of young and vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/13">We will publish the draft Bill in full later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">The Government are publishing today their response to the Isaacs report, which followed an investigation by Her Majesty's Inspector of Anatomy, Dr Jeremy Metters CB. We advised the House about the publication of the Isaacs report on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-12">12 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">The inspector's report addressed the case of the late Mr Cyril Mark Isaacs and the retention of his brain for research purposes following a coroner's post mortem in 1987 without the knowledge or consent of his widow, Mrs Elaine Isaacs. Mr Isaacs's case proved to be part of an arrangement whereby the coroner's office in north Manchester would identify brains suitable for a research programme at Manchester University. The inspector also found evidence that brains were used following post mortems on adults in other locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">The report made 34 specific recommendations that bear on the responsibilities of the Department of Health, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills. We have considered these carefully and we are today publishing our joint response and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/4">We pay tribute once again to Mrs Elaine Isaacs for bringing her husband's case to public attention and to Dr Metters for his thorough investigation and report.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/5">We are very grateful to the Retained Organs Commission and to National Health Service trusts for the arrangements they put in place to deal with inquiries from the public arising from the publication of the report. We understand that the commission's helpline has taken over 860 calls and, of these, some 580 were specific enquiries about organ retention from a deceased person which are being passed to the relevant NHS trusts for investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/6">While there is still work to be done, the programme of action on the removal, retention and use of human organs and tissue that we have put in hand since we accepted recommendations by the Chief Medical Officer in 2001 has already achieved significant improvements. Following extensive consultation, we published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-25">25 April</phrase> a comprehensive, interim framework of guidance and other materials to reflect transparent new systems founded on consent. The interim framework comprises: a statement on the use of human tissue and organs under the current law, a code of practice Families and Post Mortems, post-mortem consent forms and leaflets, a code of practice on import/export of human body parts and a summary report on the responses to the consultation document Human Bodies Human Choices. Steps have also been taken to modernise the practice of pathology and to improve the management of joint NHS and academic posts. In addition, the inquiry findings will be taken into account in the development of relevant policy initiatives bearing on death investigation and coronial services which are currently being taken forward by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/7">We also intend to bring forward legislation establishing a comprehensive new framework for the removal, retention and use of organs and tissues from both adults and children.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.5/1">Further to my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-20">20 January 2003</phrase>, I wish to report further developments in respect of the restructuring of Horticulture Research International (HRI).</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/2">I am pleased to report that Defra has reached agreement with the University of Warwick about the future of HRI Wellesbourne and Kirton. We believe that the agreement will provide a stable and sustainable future for HRI and meet the core recommendations of the independent quinquennial review team.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/3">Subject to finalising the details of the agreement and confirmation of the conclusion of a Defra business case that it represents best value, we expect the settlement with the university to contain the following key elements:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/4" class="indent">(a) HRI will continue to serve the horticulture industry as part of the university.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/5" class="indent">(b) Defra will grant the university a guaranteed research contract for an agreed programme of work. The contract will be for eight years at a total annual value of &pound;5 millon in years 1 to 6, &pound;3.5 million in year 7 and &pound;2 million in year 8;</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/6" class="indent">(c) Defra will transfer HRI's sites at Wellesbourne, Warwickshire and Kirton, Lincolnshire to the university with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, subject to &quot;clawback&quot; arrangements to protect the public purse;</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/7" class="indent">(d) The university will make a financial contribution equivalent to the value of the dwellings and agricultural land at Wellesbourne as assessed by the Valuation Office Agency;</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/8" class="indent">(e) Following a programme of redundancies, the remaining HRI staff at Wellesbourne and Kirton will transfer to the employment of the university on TUPE terms with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/9" class="indent">(f) The university will inherit ongoing redundancy and pension liabilities of transferring staff; and</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/10" class="indent">(g) Defra will make a financial contribution to outstanding works required in respect of the Wellesbourne and Kirton estates.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/11">We plan to exchange letters of intent with the university as soon as practicable followed by a business transfer agreement in the autumn, subject to negotiations and the Defra business case.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/12">The independent quinquennial review team recommended that HRI Efford should close. The University of Warwick has indicated that it does not wish to acquire the site. Defra and HRI have carefully considered the review team's recommendation alongside other options and, regrettably, concluded that Efford should close in October. Staff at Efford will have access to the same support services as those similarly affected at other HRI sites and will receive redundancy compensation in line with agreed terms and procedures. The land and buildings at Efford are a valuable public asset which will be sold on the open market and the receipts invested in the wider restructuring of HRI. HRI will ensure that existing contracts at Efford are honoured. Defra will facilitate discussions with the horticulture industry and the research community about the need, if any, to make specific alternative provision for the research capability presently offered by Efford.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/13">Negotiations are continuing between Defra and the East Malling Trust for Horticultural Research about the establishment of East Malling and Wye as an independent research station. The East Malling Trust has made proposals which we plan to discus with it later in July. It is in everyone's interests to ensure that the new research station would be financially viable on the basis of a mixed portfolio of funding as recommended by the quinquennial review team. We aim to decide the future of East Malling and Wye by the end of September at the latest.</p>
