	<p pid="a.1.2/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="1987-04-01">1 April 1987</phrase>, Guernsey has made a voluntary annual contribution towards the costs of defence and international representation undertaken by the United Kingdom. The contribution has two elements. The insular authorities have assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the Alderney breakwater (which was completed in 1865 to shelter the British fleet). Prior to April 1987 the cost of maintaining the breakwater was met by Her Majesty's Government. At 2003 prices the average annual cost since 1987 associated with the breakwater is &pound;780,000. Guernsey also remits to the UK the fees collected for the issue of British passports. These amounted to &pound;216,201 in 2003.</p>

The UK intends to support the continuing NATO presence by seconding a small number of staff to the NATO HQ in Sarajevo although no firm decisions have yet been taken. The UK's main military commitment in Bosnia will, however, be through the proposed EU-led military mission, for which we have offered to take the first lead.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.5/1">There is no ban on recruitment and no one expressing a wish to join the Army is turned away. Some individuals who have successfully passed through the recruit selection process may be given a date to commence their phase one (basic) training later in the year. This practice, which has been introduced as an expedient to help to maintain balance in Army manpower numbers, is likely to continue until October.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.0/1">The School of Dental Sciences at the University of Newcastle has today announced the results of a study comparing the bioavailability (absorption) of fluoride in water in which fluoride occurs naturally with artificially fluoridated water. The report of the study, copies of which have been placed in the Library, shows that the researchers found no evidence for any differences between the absorption of fluoride ingested in artificially fluoridated drinking water and in drinking water in which the fluoride is present naturally at fluoride concentrations close to one part per million. Nor did they find any evidence for difference between the absorption of fluoride from hard and soft waters at these fluoride concentrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">These findings provide further reassurance of the safety of fluoridated water. All water contains some fluoride and about half a million people in an area stretching from Hartlepool in the north-east to Essex receive naturally fluoridated water at concentrations close to the one part per million level at which water is artificially fluoridated. No health effects, other than enhanced resistance to tooth decay, have been detected in residents of this naturally fluoridated area.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">In the report <i>Water Fluoridation and Health</i>, published in September 2002, the Medical Research Council made the investigation of the bioavailability of fluoride its first priority for further research. With the favourable outcome of this study the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Dental Officer have been able to complete their advice on the implications of the MRC report for policy on fluoridation.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">The advice confirms that government should continue to support research to strengthen the evidence base on the benefits to oral health and safety of fluoridation. In this connection CMO/CDO recommend that the research community is consulted about:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5" class="indent">developing a scientifically robust design for evaluation of potential new fluoridation schemes under the Water Act 2003;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/6" class="indent">investigating cancer rates in relation to fluoride in water;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/7" class="indent">other research projects that would contribute to the evidence base&mdash;eg dental fluorosis, adult dental health, impact of water fluoridation on quality of life; and economic impact; and</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/8" class="indent">monitoring fluoride exposure using data already collected as part of the national diet and nutrition survey and future such surveys to be used to monitor fluoride exposure.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/9">Further research on fluoridation would need to be considered against other priority calls on the Department of Health's research and development budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/10">The favourable outcome to the research on bioavailability has also enabled us to take decisions on the management of research information on fluoridation. The department already funds the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre at Manchester University. The oral health unit, which has been established within the centre, will be responsible for maintaining a national information base on research studies on fluoridation taking account of the report of the systematic review of water fluoridation carried out by York University. The unit is associated with the Cochrane Oral Health Centre which is also sited at the University of Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/11">The function of the British Fluoridation Society is now to promote the benefits of the fluoridation of water in reducing tooth decay. To this end we have allocated &pound;85,000 to the society in 2003&ndash;04 and have committed &pound;87,000 for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
