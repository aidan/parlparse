	<p pid="a.106.0/1">The child maintenance premium allows parents with care in receipt of a prescribed benefit to keep up to &pound;10 of any maintenance where the non-resident parent is paying child maintenance under the new rules. The child maintenance premium can be received with the prescribed benefit as an income disregard or be paid direct to the parent with care by the Child Support Agency. In March 2007, the agency was paying child maintenance premium in respect of around 57,000 cases. Our analysis is confined to cases where the agency is responsible for paying the child maintenance premium; we have not yet estimated the numbers benefiting from the income disregard.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/2">Our most recent analysis reveals that, inAugust 2006, there were around 13,600 new scheme child support cases in which the parent with care was eligible to be paid the child maintenance premium by the CSA, but was not receiving it from the agency. However, it should be noted that the parent with care is unlikely to be losing out financially in the majority of such cases, because they will instead be receiving the full amount of maintenance being paid to the agency by the non-resident parent. In particular:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/3">in around 2,500 such cases, the amount of regular maintenance being received by the parent with care is &pound;10 or less. That is to say that the amount of maintenance the parent with care is currently receiving is identical to the amount of child maintenance premium to which they are eligible; andin around 11,100 such cases the amount of regular maintenance being received by the parent with care is greater than &pound;10. That is to say that the amount of maintenance they are currently receiving is greater than the amount of child maintenance premium to which they would have been entitled.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/4">The reason that child maintenance premium was not in payment for all such cases is generally that, while Jobcentre Plus has notified the Child Support Agency that the parent with care is on benefit, the CSA has not yet made the required adjustments to the amount of maintenance received through setting up the child maintenance premium payment. In these cases, however, the parent with care retains responsibility for informing Jobcentre Plus that they are in receipt of child maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/5">In those cases where investigations reveal that benefit may have been overpaid, the decision as to whether to recover and the amount of any weekly repayment will be dependent on the circumstances in each individual case. In particular, in those cases where the benefit overpayment is deemed to be as a result of official error, the department can choose to waive repayment.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/6">No pilot scheme is or has been undertaken by the agency aimed at increasing the number of child maintenance premium payments. However, the child support agency is currently in the process of implementing a programme aimed at ensuring that all those parents with care eligible for the child maintenance premium are getting the correct amount of maintenance to which they are entitled.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.8/1">The idea of charging corporations and other wealthy litigants higher charges (court fees) totally cuts across our policy principle of setting court fees to reflectthe cost of providing the service. This is based on the general principle that parties are expected to pay the full cost of the civil justice system they are using to resolve their dispute. The Government's guidelines, as defined in the <I>Fees and Charges Guide </I>issued by the Treasury, generally prevent charging above cost as this would amount to indirect taxation. Charging above cost not only would discriminate against corporations and wealthy litigants, but may be open to challenge under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.3/1">It is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the savings from changing the retirement age by one year. Extending pension ages has an impact on pension costs, which will vary with options chosen by retiring officers, and in some cases can rise in some cases as a result of later retirement. Extension would also affect pay costs and operational effectiveness.</p>

Not all forces record this as a separate crime, but from the partial returns provided it has been estimated that there were around 33,000 reported instances of number-plate theft in 2004. A follow-up exercise indicated an increase to 40,000 thefts for 2005.</p>
