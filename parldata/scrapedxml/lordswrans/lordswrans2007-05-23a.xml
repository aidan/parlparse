	<p pid="a.105.0/1">Subsequent to my Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March</phrase> (<I>WA 286</I>), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has established that certain medical reports and examinations for aircraft crew licence issue and renewal are undertaken by a statutory body for a statutory fee. In such circumstances these services are outside the scope of VAT and will remain VAT-free.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/2">When these services are not provided by a statutory body for a statutory fee, including when they are provided by a medical examiner authorised or approved by the statutory body, they have been liable to the standard rate of VAT since <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May</phrase>. However, VAT is not chargeable unless the relevant medical examiner is registered for VAT, which is not required unless his turnover from this and other taxable activities exceeds the annual VAT registration threshold&mdash;currently &pound;64,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/3">Therefore, medical examinations for aircrew licence issues and renewals have remained VAT-free in many cases, with no impact upon medical examiners, aircrew, airline operators or airline passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/4">A full regulatory impact assessment of the changes was provided by the Paymaster-General and can be found on HMRC's website at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/vat-medical-services.pdf">www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/vat-medical-services.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.0/1">The child maintenance premium allows parents with care in receipt of a prescribed benefit to keep up to &pound;10 of any maintenance where the non-resident parent is paying child maintenance under the new rules. The child maintenance premium can be received with the prescribed benefit as an income disregard or be paid direct to the parent with care by the Child Support Agency. In March 2007, the agency was paying child maintenance premium in respect of around 57,000 cases. Our analysis is confined to cases where the agency is responsible for paying the child maintenance premium; we have not yet estimated the numbers benefiting from the income disregard.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/2">Our most recent analysis reveals that, inAugust 2006, there were around 13,600 new scheme child support cases in which the parent with care was eligible to be paid the child maintenance premium by the CSA, but was not receiving it from the agency. However, it should be noted that the parent with care is unlikely to be losing out financially in the majority of such cases, because they will instead be receiving the full amount of maintenance being paid to the agency by the non-resident parent. In particular:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/3">in around 2,500 such cases, the amount of regular maintenance being received by the parent with care is &pound;10 or less. That is to say that the amount of maintenance the parent with care is currently receiving is identical to the amount of child maintenance premium to which they are eligible; andin around 11,100 such cases the amount of regular maintenance being received by the parent with care is greater than &pound;10. That is to say that the amount of maintenance they are currently receiving is greater than the amount of child maintenance premium to which they would have been entitled.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/4">The reason that child maintenance premium was not in payment for all such cases is generally that, while Jobcentre Plus has notified the Child Support Agency that the parent with care is on benefit, the CSA has not yet made the required adjustments to the amount of maintenance received through setting up the child maintenance premium payment. In these cases, however, the parent with care retains responsibility for informing Jobcentre Plus that they are in receipt of child maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/5">In those cases where investigations reveal that benefit may have been overpaid, the decision as to whether to recover and the amount of any weekly repayment will be dependent on the circumstances in each individual case. In particular, in those cases where the benefit overpayment is deemed to be as a result of official error, the department can choose to waive repayment.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/6">No pilot scheme is or has been undertaken by the agency aimed at increasing the number of child maintenance premium payments. However, the child support agency is currently in the process of implementing a programme aimed at ensuring that all those parents with care eligible for the child maintenance premium are getting the correct amount of maintenance to which they are entitled.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.8/1">The idea of charging corporations and other wealthy litigants higher charges (court fees) totally cuts across our policy principle of setting court fees to reflectthe cost of providing the service. This is based on the general principle that parties are expected to pay the full cost of the civil justice system they are using to resolve their dispute. The Government's guidelines, as defined in the <I>Fees and Charges Guide </I>issued by the Treasury, generally prevent charging above cost as this would amount to indirect taxation. Charging above cost not only would discriminate against corporations and wealthy litigants, but may be open to challenge under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">Prior to 2003 the supply of number plates was unregulated, so no action against suppliers was possible for the period 1997-02. A register of number-plate suppliers was introduced in January 2003 as a consequence of powers obtained in the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001. The register is maintained at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The police and certain trading standards departments are responsible for enforcement and since <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-16">16 March 2007</phrase>, the DVLA has also acquired powers to enter and inspect registered premises and bring prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">The courts are not obliged to pass details of all convictions to the DVLA, so the total number of convictions on a year-by-year basis since 2003 is not known.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.5/1">In 2005 the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) wrote to every police force in the UK requesting crime figures on stolen number plates to assess the scale of the problem. Not all forces record this as a separate crime, but from the partial returns provided it has been estimated that there were around 33,000 reported instances of number-plate theft in 2004. A follow-up exercise indicated an increase to 40,000 thefts for 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/2">There are no other official data for the period specified. The DVLA has requested, through the Association of Chief Police Officers, that police forces collect data on the theft of number plates fromnow on.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/1">The vehicle excise duty paid on a taxicab first registered from <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March 2001</phrase> is determined by the vehicle's carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, the more polluting the vehicle, the more VED it will pay. The VED for taxicabs first registered prior to March 2001 is determined by the vehicle's engine size.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/2">However, where the use of a vehicle is an essential component of business activity&mdash;for example, for taxi drivers&mdash;the tax system is designed so that, broadly speaking, businesses can deduct from their turnover all the costs incurred for the sole purpose of generating business profits. Such motoring expenses are therefore allowable for deduction against turnover.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.0/1">Neither International PEN nor the International Human Rights Federation has been consulted about this case. However, the Government are aware of the case and of other prosecutions under Article 301 of the Turkish penal code against journalists, writers and publishers.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">We remain concerned that charges continue to be brought against individuals for the non-violent expression of opinion. EU Enlargement Commissioner Rehn has made clear that he thinks Article 301 should be amended or repealed. We support this view. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary also raised reform of Article 301 in her latest meeting with Turkish Foreign Minster Gul on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-27">27 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/3">Turkey's human rights record is subject to intense scrutiny through EU accession negotiations. Much progress has been made already&mdash;for example, the repeal of the death penalty, and adoption of a zero-tolerance approach to torture. But progress in the negotiations will continue to be measured against Turkey's reforms, including freedom of expression.</p>
