	<p pid="a.483.2/1">The Ministry of Justice holds information on whether or not applicants and respondents in private law cases in England and Wales were recorded on court administrative systems as having a legal representative. The proportions of litigants in private law cases brought from 2006 to 2010 under the Children Act 1989 who did not have a recorded representative are set out in table 1. It should be noted that parties without a recorded representative are not necessarily litigants in person.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.2/2">Figures are only given for the High Court and the county courts as information is not available for all family proceedings courts (FPCs). However, in 2010 only about 17 per cent of children involved in private law applications had their case dealt with at an FPC.</p>

Schedule 1 financial orders and special guardianship orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.2/20" class="indent">5 Figures exclude cases heard at Family Proceedings Courts (FPCs). This is because during the period considered not all FPCs were using FamilyMan Those FPCs not using FamilyMan provided aggregate returns that did not include information on representation. Therefore information for FPCs would be incomplete.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.2/21">Information on parties in family cases who did not have the support of a McKenzie friend is not recorded centrally. It is only recorded on case files held by the courts, and the information requested could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
