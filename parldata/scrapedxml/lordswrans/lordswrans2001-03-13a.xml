	<p pid="a.77.1/2" qnum="HL341">What is the estimated annual cost of promoting and assisting exports of military goods; how many United Kingdom jobs are sustained by arms exports; and whether the resulting cost per job could be better used elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">A number of government departments, including the MoD, FCO and DTI, contribute to the Government's policy of maintaining a strong defence industry through promoting legitimate sales of UK defence products overseas. While no central record exists of the cost of implementing this objective across government, the net operating cost of the Defence Export Services Organisation, which co-ordinates government-wide support, is estimated at &pound;12 million in the financial year 2000-01. Against this, MoD estimates that defence exports save the defence budget about &pound;400 million per year. These savings come from spreading the fixed overhead cost of the UK's own equipment requirements over the longer production runs generated by defence exports, from the sale of surplus military equipment to overseas governments and from royalty receipts on exports of equipment developed using public money.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2">In addition, defence related exports sustain an estimated 90,000 jobs out of 345,000 in the defence industry. The benefits generated by defence exports thus far outweigh the cost to government of their support.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">We plan to resume the anthrax immunisation programme for personnel deployed on operations to the Gulf shortly. Immunisation was last offered in 1998 but had to be suspended due to manufacturing difficulties at our supplier. We have now received the first new supplies of licensed anthrax vaccine and will be in a position to resume the voluntary immunisation programme in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2">Anthrax immunisation is safe and effective. As in 1998, it will be offered to personnel on the basis of voluntary informed consent. By accepting it alongside other defensive measures, Armed Forces personnel will have the very best protection possible against anthrax used as a biological weapon.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.5/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for the Environment represented the UK at the Environment Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase>, accompanied by Sam Galbraith, Scottish Executive Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture. The UK, along with other member states, except Germany, who abstained, voted in favour of the common position on the proposed directive on motorcycle emissions. Council adopted three sets of conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/2">The presidency proposed a compromise text on a directive to limit emissions from motorcycles in two stages, 2003 and 2006. In supporting the proposed text on tighter limits from 2003, providing between 60 and 70 per cent reduction in hydrocarbons and 30 to 60 per cent reduction in carbon monoxide, member states accepted my amendment to extend the deadline for &quot;enduro&quot; bikes to assist the small UK manufacturers in adapting to the new limits. Germany proposed binding limits for 2006 to be agreed now, in advance of the Commission's proposed limits due by the end of 2002, which will be based on a new test cycle currently under development. The UK, along with the majority of member states, agreed to accept Germany's proposed limit values for 2006 as indicative non-binding limits only and Council achieved a Common Position, with German abstention, that meets both our environmental and manufacturers' needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/3">Short Council conclusions on climate change were agreed reaffirming the EU's commitment to reaching agreement on the Kyoto Protocol at the resumed COP6. Following a presentation by the Commission of a Communication preparing for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Rio+10) in 2002, Council conclusions were agreed listing strategic objectives for the summit. Council conclusions were also reached on a Communication reviewing future bathing water policy. These will guide the Commission in preparing its proposal for a revised directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/4">A public policy debate was held on the Sixth Environment Action Programme, which will set out the EU's environmental priorities for the next 10 years, primarily climate change, nature and biodiversity, environment and health and sustainable management of natural resources and waste. It was clear from the debate that there was a general wish to make the programme more specific by adding some key objectives and deadlines, although since the proposal has only recently been published, there were not many concrete suggestions. Delegations also generally wish to see a short, clear programme. The negotiations on this dossier will proceed throughout the remainder of the Swedish Presidency with the aim to reach Common Position at the June Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/5">A policy debate was also held on a White Paper on a future EU chemicals strategy. This proposes a new framework for risk assessment and management of both existing and new chemicals. It follows an initiative launched by the UK under its Presidency in 1998. Member states expressed broad support of the Commission objectives. The next stage will be detailed consideration of the practicalities of how these objectives can be met. The Presidency aim to complete Council conclusions in June to direct the Commission in developing proposals for an effective and workable system.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/6">The Commission and Presidency updated Council on progress on an EU sustainable development strategy. The Commission presented its Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy, which seeks to address the environmental impact of products at all stages of their life-cycle. The Presidency gave progress reports on a number of current legislative proposals expected to reach common position at the June or October 2001 Environment Councils. The Commission reported on progress in drafting a new proposal on the traceability and labelling of GMOs. The Council also had an informal discussion on climate change at the end of the day's business.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.2/1">Her Majesty's Government started the review of chemicals policy during its Presidency of the European Union in 1998. The White Paper on chemicals policy was published in February. Member states will respond to the White Paper's proposals in forthcoming Council working group discussions. The Swedish Presidency aims to achieve agreement of Council conclusions by June. These will provide the basis for the European Commission to develop proposals for new legislation. Her Majesty's Government aim to include a number of important principles in the Council's conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">First, it is important to gather essential information on existing chemicals by agreed deadlines, giving equal emphasis to human health and the environment. Industry must have an increased role in assessing the hazards and risks posed by their chemicals. In gathering information, some animal testing will be necessary, but it must be minimised. Data sharing must be encouraged, and the European Union should therefore work with existing international initiatives to collate information on chemicals so as to avoid duplication of testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">Secondly, there must be a clear timetable and mechanism for decision-making and action on chemicals that pose an unacceptable risk. It is important to avoid a bureaucratic procedure that involves large-scale routine and unnecessary testing and which fails to make timely decisions once concerns have been identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">Thirdly, the public must also have a right to know what chemicals are in products and the risks they pose. Manufacturers and downstream users should have the responsibility to provide information to their customers about chemicals.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5">Chemicals are crucial to society. It is important to balance the need to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment with the need to maintain a competitive UK and EU chemicals industry in a challenging global market. Innovation to replace chemicals that pose unacceptable risks must be encouraged.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">The Shimizu judgment had the effect of weakening controls over partial demolition of unlisted buildings in conservation areas. We share the concern that the character of conservation areas could be adversely affected as a result. Following a consultation exercise last year, we therefore propose to require submission of a planning application where in a conservation area it is proposed to demolish any boundary wall, gate, fence and other means of enclosure and a chimney or porch on a dwellinghouse. This will give local planning authorities the opportunity to consider the impact that such works are likely to have on a conservation area. We shall bring forward the necessary amendments to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/2">This measure is designed to address the direct effects of the Shimizu judgment. We are currently considering the recommendation in English Heritage's report Power of Place for removal of a wide range of permitted development rights in conservation areas.</p>
