</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-13a.145.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="145"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51213w01.htm#51213w01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.145.5/1">The commanding officer or officer commanding of every training establishment (unit commander) is directly responsible and accountable for ensuring a pragmatic supervisory care regime is in place for the recruits and/or trainees, within his/her establishment. Supervisory Care is a regime that aims to provide appropriate levels of support, assistance or advice to students while in the training establishment. The level of supervisory care required throughout the various stages of a day will depend on the outcome of a unit commander's risk assessment which takes account of the particular factors at each training establishment. The term supervisory ratios is particularly nebulous as the levels of supervision are determined by the activities being undertaken and therefore supervisory levels will differ not only between the three services but potentially for each specific training activity. For example, the Defence Diving School uses five instructors for a class of eight when in the water, reducing to one instructor for classroom work. Phase 1 (initial training) establishments such as HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot; would use one instructor to supervise up to 30 trainees in a classroom environment but this ratio could reduce to 1:4 for a higher risk activity, as calculated by the unit commander, outside the classroom environment. The manpower requirement is regularly reviewed to ensure that adequate levels of support are in place and the single services have the means to bid for adjustments to their manpower complement if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.5/2">Supervisory ratios are therefore only representative of a training establishment as actual ratios will differ between training activities. For Army training establishments, the range of representative supervisory ratios during weekday instruction in December 2004 was 1:4 to 1:41. In December 2005 this range remains the same although there is a downward trend&mdash;the average ratio has reduced from 1:16 to 1:12. This compares favourably with current RN (range 1:4 to 1:30, average 1:12) and RAF (range 1:1 to 1:32, average 1:8) ratios. The RN figure includes a 1:10 supervisory ratio for Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM) Lympstone.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.5/3">Current effort is being directed to ensure that the three services share good practice in implementation of defence commander's risk assessment guidelines.</p>

According to industry estimates, refined sugar accounts for 10-20 per cent. of costs for a firm using sugar to produce a wholesale product. Defra's regulatory impact assessment on sugar reform estimates that for a 36 per cent. price cut in sugar, average retail prices of the various sugar containing products would be expected to fall by between 1 per cent.

	<p pid="a.148.2/1">Article 308 of the EC treaty allows the Council to act, by unanimity and having consulted the European Parliament, in furtherance of the objectives of the Community where the treaty has not provided a more specific legal base. The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Commission's proposal establishing the Fundamental Rights Agency says that it is a general objective of the Community to ensure that its own action fully respects fundamental rights, that the establishment of the agency will further that objective and that the treaty does not provide more specific powers to that end.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/2">In 1997, Article 308 (then Article 235) was used, in conjunction with Article 284 (then Article 213), as the legal base to establish the Vienna-based EU Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. As the centre will be converted into the Agency for Fundamental Rights, the use of Article 308 to establish the latter is a consistent approach in terms of legal base.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.11/1">Defra funding on immuno-contraceptive vaccines for squirrels is part of a much wider fertility control project, which includes planned work on wild boar and a non-immuno-contraceptive fertility control agent for rose-ringed parakeets. The total project cost is &pound;1,012k, with about &pound;830k of that being for immuno-contraceptive work. The project runs from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.11/2">For the squirrel component, scientists from the Central Science Laboratory and the Forestry Commission will be carrying out research work which is due to start in January 2006. The main squirrel research will cost about &pound;50k. However, there is other work in the wider project, for example, the development of techniques for administering immuno-contraceptive vaccines orally, which will also be relevant. This work is needed as injection is unlikely to be a practical proposition for most species. If everything goes well with the whole project, we will still be looking at several years before practical and usable fertility control methods are available in the UK.</p>

One of its functions is to prioritise work needed to determine the primary factors responsible for declines in woodland bird populations, and encourage further research, policy and management actions aimed at reversing the declines.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">The online questionnaire was only one of several ways we sought the public's views. We chose a questionnaire structure that could be used to quickly analyse large volumes of data rather that asking for &quot;free form&quot; text which would have been more difficult to systematically assess. The questionnaire was therefore focused on issues that we knew from previous experience were important to people, but we did allow for some commentary to be included and the public have used that opportunity to raise a wide range of issues. We have received about 36,000 completed questionnaires (both online and hard copy) and collected a great deal of data, including thousands of &quot;free text&quot; comments. The local, regional and national events provided people with opportunities to discuss other issues that were important to them.</p>

It is difficult legally for the EU or member states to seek redress on damaged infrastructure as the ownership has usually been transferred to the final beneficiary, such as the Palestinian Authority. We none the less press the Israeli Government on this issue. So far compensation for project damage has only once been paid (when a World Food Programme food warehouse was destroyed in Gaza).
