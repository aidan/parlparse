	<p pid="a.104.3/1">Under the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive and the Investor Compensation Directive, all EEA member states are required to set up a scheme to protect depositors and also a scheme to protect investors in the circumstances laid down in the directives. The UK achieves this through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) which covers all Financial Services Authority (FSA) authorised banks and investment firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.3/2">Firms passporting from an EEA state where the level and/or scope of coverage provided by their home state is lower or narrower than that provided by the FSCS, can opt to top-up into the FSCS to the level and/or scope of coverage provided by the FSCS. This means that the home state scheme is liable to pay the first tranche of compensation to the limits that apply in that state. The FSCS's liability is therefore restricted to the topped-up amount up to the UK limit of &pound;35,000 for deposits.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.2/1">Since 2002, all EU countries have been required to collect data on discarding, under the data collection regulation. Quantities of discards are estimated using data collected by scientific observers aboard commercial fishing vessels. The regulation requires member states to record the quantities of quota-restricted fish stocks landed and discarded, and the species and size composition of the discards each time the fishing gear is hauled. Deploying scientific observers in this manner is expensive and time-consuming, with the result that it is usually only possible to sample a small proportion of the overall fishing trips in a given area. As a result, it is necessary to extrapolate from the limited sampling to provide estimates for the entire fleet. Although the sampling is intended to cover a representative sample of the fleet, this does mean that the estimates of total discards are subject to uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/2">Estimates of mean annual averages from CEFAS (Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science) for the North Sea are that 5,427 tonnes of fish were discarded, from a proportion of 16,370 tonnes retained (25 per cent discarded) by English and Welsh vessels over 10 metres between the years 2003-06. CEFAS has concluded recently further research which is currently being peer reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/3">Estimates of mean annual averages for English and Welsh over 10 metre vessels fishing in the Channel, Western Approaches, Celtic Sea, and Irish Sea are 24,628 tonnes discarded, with 46,572 tonnes retained (35 per cent discarded) between the years 2003-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/4">Defra, NERC, the Royal Society and the EC have funded research into the impacts of fishing on the seabed and marine life. These studies have been conducted in UK shelf seas and off the shelf edge and have assessed impacts on marine habitats, vulnerable fish and invertebrate species, seabirds and marine mammals. Research on seabed impacts has shown that the relative impacts of fishing depend on the balance between fishing and natural disturbance. Thus seabed habitats in deep areas with low natural disturbance are much more vulnerable to fishing impacts that shallow areas of mobile substrate where natural disturbance is higher. Research on marine life has shown that the impacts of fishing depend on the abundance, life history and distribution of a species and the type and intensity of fishing activity. The more vulnerable species tend to be slow-growing, have limited distributional ranges and are taken in targeted fisheries or as bycatch. The less vulnerable species tend to be fast-growing and widely distributed.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.3/1">Revenue allocations are made to primary care trusts (PCTs) on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. The weighted capitation formula is used to determine PCTs' target shares of available resources, to enable them to commission similar levels of health services for populations in similar need.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/2">The components of the formula are used to weight each PCT's crude population according to their relative need (age, and additional need) for healthcare and the unavoidable geographical differences in the cost of providing healthcare (the market forces factor).</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/3">Although there is no specific consideration made for sickle-cell-related disease in determining revenue allocations to PCTs, it will be picked up in the models of utilisation of healthcare in the need element of the formula. The formula used to inform the revenue allocations to PCTs in 2008-09 takes account of &quot;unmet need&quot; to support certain groups within the population, e.g. ethnic minorities groups, which may not receive healthcare services to the same level as others with similar health characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/4">Once the department has made allocations to PCTs, it is for PCTs to determine how to use the funding allocated to them to commission the services they require to meet the healthcare needs of the local populations they serve. There is no ring-fenced allocation to PCTs to spend on sickle cell disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/5">The department deliberately does not break down PCT allocations into funding for individual policy programmes, as this would constrain local innovation and decision taking.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/6">Instead, the approach the department takes is to be clear about the priorities for the NHS through the operating framework. It is then for the National Health Service to decide how best to achieve those outcomes in the light of local needs and circumstances, including the level of resources to invest.</p>

The Government will continue to act in the UN, the EU and bilaterally to persuade Iran to comply with the demands of successive UNSCRs, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the international community.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.8/1">In April, the Government published our response to our earlier consultation on metering and billing and our consultation impact assessment of smart metering. We also laid amendments to the Energy Bill that would provide us with the necessary powers to introduce smart metering. The Government are now completing further work on our impact assessment. We are also investigating the rules and governance arrangements for smart metering, including the issues of data ownership and access.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.8/2">The Government are aiming to complete work on both the qualitative and quantitative evidence base over the coming months. Before taking decisions we also want to take into account any initial results from the Ofgem trials (the Energy Demand Research Project). Decisions will therefore be made after the second report from the trials, which is due in November 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.1/2" qnum="HL4674">What assessment they have made of the link between the possible existence of oil in eastern Abyei, Sudan, and the recent conflict in that area; and whether they will support measures to reduce any conflict related to this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">Following fighting in Abyei in May, the National Congress Party and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-08">8 June</phrase> a road map to resolve the Abyei dispute including oil revenue sharing. Oil remains an underlying factor in tensions between the north and the south, especially in the border areas such as Abyei where most of the oilfields are located.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">Under the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA), oil revenues are to be shared equally between the national Governments of north and south Sudan. The UK is working with the parties and with international partners to implement both the Abyei road map and the CPA, which are vital to lasting peace in Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">Clause 3 of the Local Transport Bill, currently before Parliament, would empower the Secretary of State for Transport to appoint a statutory Senior Traffic Commissioner with, among other things, powers to issue general directions and guidance to the other traffic commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">It would also allow the Secretary of State to issue statutory guidance to the Senior Traffic Commissioner, once appointed. However, the formal appointment and issuing of guidance by the Secretary of State can only take place after the Bill receives Royal Assent and the relevant provisions are brought into force. The draft guidance will also be subject to a public consultation exercise.</p>
