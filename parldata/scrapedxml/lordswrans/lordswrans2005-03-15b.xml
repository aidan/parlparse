	<p pid="b.126.9/1">Entitlement to disability living allowance and attendance allowance can be reliably established only after a claim has been made and the care and mobility needs of the individual customer fully assessed. For this reason we cannot reliably calculate the number of people receiving the benefits as a proportion of the overall eligible population.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.9/2">The department does, however, go to considerable lengths to publicise benefits. Information is available from the department's offices, from the citizens advice bureau and other advice agencies, and leaflets are available in post offices and doctors' surgeries. In addition, information and advice about disability benefits is provided by the benefit inquiry line. For people with Internet access, information about all benefits and how these may be claimed is also contained on the DWP website.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.9/3">We are increasingly developing closer working relationships with partners such as local authority social services and welfare rights organisations which are able to advise people about disability benefits in a far more targeted and personal way than would be possible through any mass disability awareness campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.9/4">In the five years to August 2004, the number of people receiving DLA increased by 26 per cent, and by 4 per cent. in the past 12 months alone. For AA the increases are 11 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.130.8/1">DVLA's records currently show that there are 1,737,636 vocational driving licence holders. This figure includes holders of both PSV and HGV licences. The records do not, however, indicate how many of these are actually using their licences. In 2003, the latest year for which we have figures, there were 426,000 goods vehicles and 96,000 public transport vehicles registered. This suggests that the number of active drivers is lower than the figures given above.</p>
