The employment termination process allows the address to be stored on JPA. In addition, the Army and the Royal Navy use an annual reporting letter as a method of updating regular reservists contact details held on JPA. The RAF discontinued the annual reporting letter in 1999 which had no effect on its ability to mobilise the required number of reservists for operations in Iraq in 2003.</p>

Where civil servants wish to draw pension before pension age, it is subject to actuarial adjustment; civil servants within five years of pension age who choose to use their redundancy payment to buy-out the actuarial reduction will be able to receive an unreduced pension.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-30a.374.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="374"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100330w0002.htm#10033049000104">
	<p pid="a.374.3/1">In 2009-10, the DWP allocated &#163;36 million in the north-east region to provide employment related support delivered through contracts with training providers. Through the DWP's Executive Agency-Jobcentre Plus-eligible customers, including young people not in education, employment or training, are referred to these training providers for help with securing employment. Additionally a range of measures has been introduced in response to the recession such as the Young Person's Guarantee. This includes &#163;1.4 million contracted through the Learning and Skills Council for 2009-10 with three training providers in the north-east. It is not possible to disaggregate any of this spend to young people not in education, employment or training.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.3/2">In 2009-10, the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) made &#163;360 million available to the Learning and Skills Council in the north-east to provide education and work-based learning for 16 to 19 year-olds. This funding is not specifically for those not in education, employment or training, but provides for any 16 to 19 year-old who wishes to follow these learning routes. In addition, a further &#163;1.8 million has been provided to meet the January guarantee of an offer of an Entry to Employment place for 16 and 17 year-olds who were not in education, employment or training in January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.3/3">Through DCSF and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the National Apprenticeship Service allocated &#163;64 million in 2009-10 to training providers contracted in the north-east region to supply apprenticeship training to young people aged 16 to 25, of which &#163;47 million was for those aged 16 to 18. Again it is not possible to identify the proportion of this funding that went towards supporting young people not in education, employment or training.</p>
