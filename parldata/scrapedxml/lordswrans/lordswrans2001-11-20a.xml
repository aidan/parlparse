	<p pid="a.128.0/1">Initially, winter fuel payments were made through automatic payment mechanisms to around 10 million people over State pension age who received certain qualifying benefits, without the need to claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/2">The scheme was later extended, from its outset, to most people aged 60 and over, regardless of whether they were getting a social security benefit. A claims process was therefore developed for those not receiving specific benefits as the Department did not hold sufficient information to establish entitlement, particularly where an individual had had no need to contact the Department for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/3">It was estimated that the extension meant that up to an additional 1.5 million people were eligible last winter (2000&ndash;01) and up to 1.9 million people could be eligible for previous winters. As a combined claim form was used to deal with these payments, it is not possible to give more details about the numbers of claims for each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/4">However, in total, approximately, 11.1 million payments were made for winter 2000&ndash;01. For winters 1997&ndash;98, 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000, around 1.1 million claims have been paid, in addition to the automatic payments. There are no time limits on claiming for these previous winters and successful claims continue to be paid. Estimates of the likely value of unclaimed payments cannot be derived with any precision.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.3/1">From April 2000 an information campaign ran to ensure that existing and potential customers knew about the changes to the winter fuel payment scheme and what, if anything, they needed to do to get a payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/2">This year, the campaign, using similar media, began in June and is continuing throughout the year. The information includes advertisements in national and local press; a leaflet and poster, a dedicated Winter Fuel Payment Helpline and information on the Internet. Full explanation of restrospective payments is available in the leaflet, the Internet and from the helpline. The leaflet is made available in a variety of venues, including local social security offices, post offices, electricity and gas outlets, supermarkets and doctors' surgeries.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/3">Eligible people are still able to claim for 1997&ndash;98, 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000 as there are no time limits for the payment in respect of these winters. However, it is up to the individual to choose whether or not to claim.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.0/1">The Government have been pressing the case, both by working with the Community External Fisheries Group and through inputs into the Development Council Fisheries and Poverty Reduction Strategy, for improvements to the way that the European Union negotiates and monitors its fisheries agreements with third countries and assesses their impact, including their impact on the third countries concerned. Better mechanisms are needed to ensure that these agreements provide value for money to the Community taxpayer, provide for proper enforcement and control, promote environmentally sustainable fishing and are coherent with Community development objectives. In specific relation to Mauritania, our pressure helped secure safeguards to protect Mauritanian fish resources, including a regular review on the state of fish stocks. But we shall continue to press for more, both by way of general principle and in relation to future draft agreements and are committed to working with other member states on this and future agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.8/1">The Environment Agency's navigation responsibilities were considered during stage 1 of the Financial, Management and Policy Review (FMPR) which has recently been completed. The review team considered a wide range of views on the subject, including responses to public consultation, reports such as that of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee and an independent consultant's study.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/2">The stage 1 report concluded that there were no compelling operational reasons for a transfer of functions from the Environment Agency to British Waterways but nor were there insuperable barriers to such a transfer. The report also concluded that there was an underlying policy issue to be resolved which was beyond the scope of the FMPR to address. Essentially, that was whether the institutional arrangements for the waterways should be structured to promote navigation and regeneration benefits, with flood defence and conservation accommodated within the structure, or vice versa. In this respect British Waterways and the Environment Agency offer different advantages.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/3">We have considered carefully the FMPR report and information and views provided subsequently by the Environment Agency and British Waterways. This has not been a straightforward decision. We are attracted by the potential regeneration benefits a transfer to British Waterways could bring, and accept the FMPR report's conclusion that flood defence issues do not pose an insuperable barrier to transfer, given British Waterways' safety record on its own rivers. However, any change needs to be justified by clear and objective evidence. On balance we do not judge there is sufficiently robust evidence on which to justify a transfer. We have therefore decided that current responsibilities should continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/4">The Environment Agency will be set challenging new targets to deliver the improved service on navigation and regeneration being developed through initiatives like Thames Ahead, working with local authorities and other partners. We look forward to positive results from this exercise, and to renewed good will and partnership with British Waterways in serving our important inland waterways.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.3/1">Advertising in Great Britain has been reduced following the first recruitment competition, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis carried out by the independent recruitment agent. However, advertisements have been placed in a number of specialist publications which are available in Great Britain and on a satellite television channel. Details are also available on the Police Service of Northern Ireland website.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.6/1">Recruitment to the Police Service of Northern Ireland is being carried out on the basis of 50 per cent Catholic, 50 per cent non-Catholic. The Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland recommended a 50:50 recruitment profile because this broadly reflects the breakdown of the population in the normal age range for recruitment.</p>
