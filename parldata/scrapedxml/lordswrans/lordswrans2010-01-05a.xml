In addition to the procurement of at least 22 Chinook helicopters, the new strategy will see the retirement of the whole Sea King fleet by early 2016, and the modification of the Merlin Mk3/3a fleet to allow it to contribute to helicopter lift operations on both battlefield and ship-borne littoral operations, in the way that Sea King Mk4 does today. The new strategy assumes post-2016 that all maritime helicopter requirements will be met from the Merlin and Wildcat fleets.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">HMCS is currently consulting on the proposed closure of 20 magistrates' courts. For each one of these courts a draft impact assessment has been carried out and respondents to the consultation are invited to comment on the potential impacts of closure. The decisions on whether to propose closure were taken on a case-by-case basis. Consideration was given to the proximity of other courts, the size and type of workload generated from the local area, and local transport links. Therefore, HMCS has avoided a generic approach but in all 20 cases, the alternative court is within 30 miles of the court proposed for closure. However, this is not to say that 30 miles would always be the appropriate level for &quot;reasonable travelling distance&quot;. In all cases it is possible to travel from the location of the old court to the new court on public transport or, in one case, on a combination of public transport and a local authority-run link service. It should be noted that all these courts were significantly underutilised and, at many of these courts, a representative group, which includes members of the local judiciary, had already decided to stop listing cases.</p>

For each court, HMCS has conducted a draft impact assessment and comments on these assessments have been invited from respondents to the consultations. Only once all responses have been analysed will the impact assessment be finalised.</p>

Proprietors themselves must have a criminal background check as part of assessing their suitability and the Secretary of State has powers under the Education Act 2002 to prohibit unsuitable individuals from taking part in the management of an independent school.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/3">Similar requirements for criminal background checks currently apply in children's social care and in registered childcare settings. In voluntary settings where individuals work with children and young people but which are not regulated by the Government, such as the churches or the Scouts for example, organisers are eligible to conduct CRB checks and we advise them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/4">Individuals wishing to become teachers or to work with children in regulated activity must be registered with the Vetting and Barring Scheme when the registration requirements under the new scheme are phased in from next year. Where relevant safeguarding information is found by the CRB or Access Northern Ireland during the vetting process, this information will be passed to the Independent Safeguarding Authority. The ISA will consider this and other information that it may hold or gather on a person to determine if the person poses a future risk of harm to children. An ISA children's list bar would prevent an individual from working with children in any instance of regulated activity with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/5">The Secretary of State has appointed Maurice Smith, former HM Chief Inspector of Schools, to consider the issue of racism in schools. The review is looking at the measures currently in place to prevent political impartiality, racially motivated discrimination and the promotion of partisan activities in our schools, and whether these need strengthening. Although Mr Smith has been asked to focus on the maintained sector the review is also taking evidence from the independent sector. He is due to report at the end of January 2010 and we will consider the findings carefully before deciding whether any further measures are required to strengthen those already in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.3/1">Local authorities responding to requests for information from central government, or contributing to reviews such as that conducted by Graham Badman, must be able to freely and frankly express their views, and provide examples and evidence, about what is working and what needs to change. Local authorities provided information in the expectation that it would remain confidential and any breach of confidence could make local authorities reluctant to participate in similar data gathering exercises in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.3/2">There are two specific concerns in addition to the general concern that there must be space for officials to express their views freely and frankly. The first concern is that some of the information provided by local authorities related to small numbers, or individual, children and there is a risk that these individuals could be identified if the data we held were combined with other information, including newspaper reports, or could in the future be combined with other information released under the Freedom of Information Act. Secondly, where the home educators are unwilling to co-operate with local authorities, some local authority officials have difficult relationships with some home educators in their area and then releasing this information could make their relationship worst.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.3/3">They have observed the campaign of vilification and harassment against Graham Badman and are concerned that they too could be targeted by home educators locally if their responses were released.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.3/4">We and individual local authorities keep the release of data under review, bearing in mind the nature and intensity of harassment and the risks this indicates. Some local authorities have decided that the risks to individual children and their employees are sufficiently low to release the questionnaire responses.

This does, however, appear to the department to be a likely outcome. The internet campaign of vilification and harassment against Graham Badman and individual home educators who have declared they support aspects of the review has worried local authority officers. Some have suffered personal harassment through the internet, some have found individual home educators have ceased to co-operate with the local authority and others have come under severe pressure from repeated Freedom of Information Act requests which seem intended more to disrupt their day-to-day work than genuinely to be seeking relevant information.</p>

Through governance reform programmes and initiatives to support greater regional economic integration, we aim to make trade-including of minerals like gold and cassiterite-more accountable and formalised, in order to reduce smuggling and illegal trade. We believe that this support and dialogue is having a beneficial impact, although we recognise that it will take some time before trade in the region becomes fully regulated.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/2">The sections of the letters from the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Department of Health and Children which were quoted during the Second Reading of the Contaminated Blood (Support for Infected and Bereaved Persons) Bill [HL] on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-11">11 December</phrase> (HL Deb, cols 1263-4), do not mention the fact that the Irish Government had set up an expert group to look into the issue of contaminated blood products, which reported in January 1995. The expert group found that wrongful acts had been committed by the BTSB, which led the Irish Government to set up the Hepatitis-C Compensation Tribunal to operate on a non-statutory basis to review claims for compensation arising from the many civil actions pending in the courts. The Irish Government subsequently set up the Finlay tribunal of inquiry, which reported in March 1997. This found that wrongful acts were committed. Following the findings of the Finlay tribunal, the Irish Government placed the Hepatitis-C Compensation Tribunal on a statutory footing.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.5/3">The MHRA uses other sources of data to support and clarify information from spontaneous reporting and the impact of regulatory action, including published research and drug safety studies. In evaluating these, the MHRA receives regular expert advice from its independent scientific advisory bodies, the Commission on Human Medicines and its Pharmacovigilance Expert Advisory Group.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.5/1">The incident involved a request from a Jonathan Cox, representing Citizens for Sanctuary and the St Nicholas Society, to come into Yarl's Wood to distribute gifts to children and not specifically from the Reverend Professor Nicholas Sagovsky, Canon Theologian of Westminster Abbey.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.5/2">The UK Border Agency has a duty to safeguard those in its care, especially children. That includes appropriate vetting of those who wish to work or operate in the immigration removal centres. Mr Cox's request was therefore declined primarily on security grounds because the two organisations were not known to centre staff and did not have suitable clearance to have direct contact with the children in our care. However, arrangements were made with the society for gifts to be delivered to the centre for onward distribution, which indeed occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.5/3">We have a full plan of activities for the celebration of major religious festivals, including Christmas. These include parties, a traditional carol service, and a visit by Father Christmas to Yarl's Wood.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.5/4">Ministers of religion are able to make arrangements with the manager of religious affairs to attend an immigration removal centre subject to appropriate clearance, and I understand that an invitation has been extended to the Canon Theologian to visit Yarl's Wood at some point in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.5/3">Your recent Parliamentary Question [HL587] has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/4">Ofsted inspects maintained schools against a specific framework and evaluation schedule, and against grade descriptors for all graded judgments. Inspectors make a judgment about the effectiveness with which a school promotes community cohesion. Inspectors are asked to evaluate the extent to which the school has developed an understanding of the religious, ethnic and socio-economic characteristics of its community in a local, national and global context. There is no specific judgment made relating to links between schools and extremist groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/5">Ofsted inspection reports on independent schools assess whether or not the schools are meeting statutory standards. From time to time both Ofsted and the DCSF receive information from a range of sources that might indicate concerns about a school having links with some form of extremism, and the impact this could have on the standard of education provided within the school. In these circumstances the DCSF might commission Ofsted to undertake additional, targeted work to examine whether an independent school is continuing to meet the statutory standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/6">Were the DCSF or Ofsted to receive information to indicate concerns about extremist influences impacting on the standard of education or wellbeing of pupils in any school, the DCSF could commission Ofsted to undertake an additional inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/7">A copy of this reply has been sent to Vernon Coaker MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.5/9">Your recent Parliamentary Question [HL588] has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/10">In relation to maintained schools, Ofsted has provided extensive training in matters relating to the judgement that inspectors make during inspections about the effectiveness with which a school promotes community cohesion. This does not, however, specifically include training for inspectors to identify links between schools and extremist groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/11">In relation to independent schools, Ofsted provides extensive training to ensure inspectors are able to make consistent and high quality judgements. When the inspection is of a faith or specialist school, inspectors with specialist knowledge of the relevant faith or specialism are deployed and, where relevant, inspectors with specific language skills are used. Training does not, however, specifically include training for inspectors to identify links between schools and extremist groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/3">In the case of maintained schools, an inspection may occur where there are concerns about the education and well-being of pupils. A school judged inadequate is subject to monitoring and intervention measures which could result in closure. In the case of independent schools, emergency inspection visits can be commissioned by the DCSF if there is evidence that a school might not be meeting any of the independent school standards including concerns about the quality of education or procedures for safeguarding children. Any remedial action or deregistration would take place on the basis that one or more standard had not been met.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.5/1">In some countries the UK Border Agency accepts visa applications at British diplomatic missions or visa application centres operated by our commercial partners, who pass the applications to a regional decision-making centre in another country. There are also countries where the UK Border Agency has no facilities to accept visa applications. It is not clear to which the noble Lady is referring. I would be happy to provide the information upon clarification.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.8/1">Since October 2008, as part of a planned programme over at least three years, the Environment Agency has been undertaking a series of remediation assessment actions at Brofiscin Quarry. It has completed a water balance survey for the quarry and a monitored natural attenuation feasibility study for contaminated groundwater beneath it. The monitoring data collected demonstrate that natural processes occurring in the groundwater are continuing to break down the contaminants.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.8/2">The Environment Agency has concluded its investigations to identify those it believes responsible for remediation at Brofiscin Quarry. It has held discussions with those identified in order to secure funding for voluntary remediation actions. Discussions are ongoing and the Environment Agency is keen to reach an agreement without the need for expensive litigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.5/1">The UK remains fully committed to the protection and promotion of all human rights, including the rights of women. We are strong supporters of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women and its committee. The UK last presented its report on our implementation of the convention to the committee in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/2">The UK promotes gender equality and women's rights through our membership of the Human Rights Council; our current membership of the Commission for the Status of Women; our promotion of women's rights bilaterally and through international organisations; and our support for the creation of a new composite UN gender entity for women.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/3">The UK has a clear policy in relation to UN appointments which is focused on promoting open, transparent and merit-based selection that attracts as broad a representation as possible. It may sometimes be the case that the best candidate for the job may not be a UK national.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/4">When assessing whether to field a candidate for upcoming vacancies within the treaty-monitoring bodies of the UN international human rights treaties, and the other human rights bodies of the UN, to which we are eligible to nominate candidates, the UK takes into account a range of factors, including: the impact that a UK incumbent can have on UK priorities; the current number of UK experts on these bodies; the balance of bodies on which we wish to be represented; whether there are other candidates standing who can represent UK interests; and, the resources and political capital available with which to run election campaigns. We prioritise our election bids to stand the best chance of success to those bodies identified on these criteria. Elections are frequently contested by a large number of candidates from a wide range of countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/5">For 2010, Patrick Thornberry will be the UK candidate for CERD (Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination). The UK will also be standing for the ACABQ (Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions). The UK has to date not put forward a candidate for the CEDAW committee. However, we do not rule out our fielding a candidate in the future. The appointment of the Under Secretary-General to head the new UN Gender Entity will be made by the UN Secretary-General, and not by election.</p>
