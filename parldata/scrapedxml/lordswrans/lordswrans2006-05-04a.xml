The Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that the decision to implement the bans demonstrated the EU's failure,</p>

	<p pid="a.97.2/1">The most recent information available on consumption of soft drinks by children dates back to the 1997 national diet and nutrition survey of young people aged four to 18 years. This survey showed that average consumption of soft drinks by the four-to-18-year age group in Britain in 1997 was 441g/day. Just over half of this (264g/day) comprised standard (that is, other than low-calorie) varieties.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.2/2">The causes of obesity are multifactorial. The Government have no current plans to assess the specific implications on childhood obesity of consumption of high-sugar soft drinks. Nor do they intend to promote the use of calorie-free sweeteners in soft drinks as part of their strategy to halt the rise in childhood obesity. The Food Standards Agency has commenced discussions with stakeholders on a strategy to address the calorie levels in foods to improve energy balance; the levels of sugar in some foods, including soft drinks, is being explored as part of this strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.8/1">The Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva has been unable to reach consensus on a programme of work for more than eight years. During that time the only issue which all countries have agreed should be taken forward is a fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT). The Government have called continuously for the immediate commencement of negotiations on an FMCT. Unfortunately, many other countries have sought to link progress on an FMCT to progress on a range of other disarmament-related issues. This has led to the stalemate that we see today in the CD. As my honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Kim Howells, said during his recent address to the CD in March this year, the package approach to starting substantive work in the CD has not delivered a consensus agreement on the way forward. But the CD is too important a mechanism to allow to remain inactive. It is therefore time to take a more pragmatic approach and start negotiating an FMCT.</p>

Foreign Ministers of EU and NATO countries hold regular informal meetings, most recently on 27 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase> in Sofia. Under the Berlin plus arrangements, EU and NATO meetings also take place between the Political and Security Committee and the North Atlantic Council. At the technical level, the EU-NATO Capability Group provides a forum for the exchange of information on military research and procurement. The UK was one of the key advocates for the development of the permanent liaison arrangements to ensure transparency between the EU and NATO which were agreed in December 2005. The UK continues to press for a strong EU-NATO relationship to ensure the organisations are mutually reinforcing and prevent unnecessary duplication. There has also been effective practical co-operation between the organisations, for example, in Darfur where the EU and NATO provide complementary support to the African Union, and following Hurricane Katrina where NATO transported EU aid.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.0/1">While we have closed some posts, this is in response to changing priorities, not overall budget reductions: the total Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) departmental expenditure limit was increased in the 2004 spending review by &pound;91 million in 2006-07 and &pound;110 million in 2007&ndash;08. There is no evidence overall of a decline in morale occasioned by post closures, although some staff directly affected have expressed concerns. As measured by the staff survey published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-04">4 April 2006</phrase>, which included senior staff, morale appears to be high: 77 per cent of FCO staff at home and abroad are proud to work for the FCO, 83 per cent feel they are doing something worth while and 91 per cent are prepared to put in extra effort when required. These figures compare well both to previous years and to other government departments. But the results also showed some areas we need to address, including recognition and reward of that commitment, leadership and how we manage and communicate change. We are taking action to tackle those issues. The results of the survey are available on the internet at the following address: <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/management/statistics/news/staff-survey/index.asp">www.civilservice.gov.uk/management/statistics/news/staff&ndash;survey/index.asp</a> and will be made available to honourable Members in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The UK remains committed to an ambitious, broad-based and pro-development outcome to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) round of trade negotiations. It is unfortunate that WTO members were unable to meet the end of April deadline for agreeing cuts in tariffs for industrial goods and agricultural products. But we will continue to push for a deal that can be finalised this year and which takes into account the needs of the poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">We understand the concerns from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries about possible negative short-term impacts of trade liberalisation. However, these are outweighed by the potential benefits on offer from the trade round and from which we all stand to gain. As set out in the Government's 2004 White Paper on trade and investment, the international response needs to acknowledge and tackle the short-term transition costs and look at how we can provide guaranteed, credible and additional aid to support these countries in the transition to more productive sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/3">We continue to argue for an effective response to the concerns of the ACP, including the provision of aid for trade and other transitional assistance for developing countries, and for economic partnership agreements with the EU to have a pro-development focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/4">Specifically regarding the impact of EU sugar reform, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development, Gareth Thomas, raised the issue with other EU Development Ministers at the 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-11">11 April</phrase> General Affairs and External Relations Council. We will continue to lobby the Commission and our EU partners on this specific issue and on wider ACP concerns about the impact of trade liberalisation.</p>
