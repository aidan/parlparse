	<p pid="a.1.5/1">We have always made it clear that there is no solely military solution to the problems faced by Afghanistan. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister's Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-12">12 December</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-12-12.303"><I>Official Report</I>, cols. 303-07</phrase>) outlined our approach and identified the need for the rejuvenation of the Afghan economy. Thus a comprehensive UK approach in support of the Afghan Government involving the MoD, FCO and DfID is in place. Together with the wider international effort this has resulted in over 5.4 million children now attending school, a third of whom are girls, and a 60 per cent increase in the number of functioning health clinics. These improved conditions have led to 4.8 million refugees returning to the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">The Afghanistan Compact, agreed between the Afghan Government and the International Community in February 2006, set out clear development benchmarks with timelines against which progress is measured. We are focusing considerable energy and resources into the Afghan National Army, who will ultimately become responsible for the country's security; this is now bearing encouraging results.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.0/1">The Central-Local Concordat, agreed between the Government and the Local Government Association (LGA), on behalf of local authorities in England, was signed in December last year. It commits both parties to a framework of principles to secure a new relationship between central government and local government. Discharging the rights and responsibilities of central government and local government set out in the concordat will require major changes in the behaviour and practice of both parties. The operation of this agreement will be monitored on a continuing basis, through renewed central-local partnership arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">We are discussing with the LGA how we take forward the concordat, focusing on its guiding principles and specific commitments. These include encouraging councils to make effective use of their power to promote the well-being of their area; enabling local government to conduct a growing share of the business of government; central government consulting and collaborating with councils in setting national policies and proposing legislation; reducing the burden of appraisal and approval regimes and the volume of guidance issued by central government to local authorities; supporting and encouraging strong leadership and effective partnership working at local level; and increasing local democratic accountability of key public services, in particular the police and health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">A single set of 198 national indicators for local authorities and local authority partnerships was announced as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 and consultation on detailed definitions of the set concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-21">21 December 2007</phrase>, with the aim of announcing final decisions in February.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">Local authorities across England are currently engaged in discussions with government offices on behalf of all government departments on the content of new-style local area agreements, which will have effect from 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5">In keeping with the 2006 local government White Papers, LAAs are negotiated agreements with flexibility for local authorities and their partners to reflect local priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.0/1">Central government is committed to uphold the principles of the Central-Local Concordat. While the concordat reflects the devolutionary gains that have been made in recent years, it also signals a clear direction of travel beyond arrangements already in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/2">An essential role for the Housing Corporation is to work closely with local authorities in providing affordable housing taking account of national, regional and local government strategies. The Housing Corporation has signed a protocol with the Local Government Association and has subsequently signed protocols with a range of local authorities across every region. The Housing Corporation's programme is allocated to registered social landlords and others. Distribution of the Housing Corporation's investment nationally is subject to national, regional and local priorities. Investment decisions by the corporation on specific projects are made in relation to a number of criteria including the quality and value for money of any proposed project.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/3">Discussions are currently being finalised with English Partnerships (EP) on their future national programme and priorities for 2008-09 taking account of local and regional priorities. An essential role for EP is to work closely with local authorities, bridging national, regional and local government strategies and priorities to support local authorities. EP's investment nationally is subject to EP's objectives and priorities and published investment criteria including those relating to quality and value for money linked to the funding of individual projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/4">The Government have taken the decision to bring together regeneration and housing work in a single new Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). Establishing the HCA will enable a range of existing regeneration and housing delivery programmes, including that of English Partnerships and the housing investment role of the Housing Corporation, to be brought together under the auspices of a single delivery focused agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/5">We want the HCA to be the best partner for local authorities. It will be subject to a duty to co-operate with local authorities in agreeing local area agreements and to have regard to every local improvement target specified in the local area agreement which relates to the agency when exercising its functions. It will also be a statutory consultee for the purposes of the preparation of a local authority's sustainable community strategy. We are working with the Local Government Association to prepare a supplementary Central-Local Concordat on housing and regeneration to show how the principles of the Central-Local Concordat will be fully reflected in this close collaboration.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.2/1">All non-maintained special schools (NMSSs) such as the Royal School for the Deaf and Communication Disorders (RSDCD) are responsible for their own financial viability. Local authorities (LAs) are responsible for any fees charged by a school for a child they may place in a school. Any discussion or negotiation of fees is a matter between a school and LA. The department has worked with the representative bodies of LAs, NMSSs and independent schools in developing a national contract for the placement of children and young people in day and residential provision in these schools. Although the contract is widely adopted by schools and LAs, it is not compulsory, nor could it be, as fees are a matter to be agreed by individual parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.2/1">It is appropriate that the Northumberland Care Trust reviews its personal medical services (PMS) contracts to ensure value for money. All primary care organisations in the north-east are looking to ensure that contracts deliver value.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/2">The proposals that have been brought forward by the Northumberland Care Trust are not about closing individual practices. The aim of these proposals is to ensure the continuity of the existing general practitioner (GP) services and, subject to agreement being reached, this will set a good foundation for the further development of primary care services for the benefit of patients across Northumberland.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/3">PMS contracts, including the terms of these contracts, are negotiated locally between primary care trusts and GP practices. It would not be appropriate for the department to become involved in these local negotiations. However, if a practice is unhappy with any of the proposed terms of the contract that is being offered to it, it can raise this through the contractual dispute resolution processes that are set out in legislation.</p>

Two reports have not yet received an interim response. Ten of the reports remain under consideration; two have been accepted; one has been rejected; and the subject matter of one has been incorporated into a further review.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.6/1">HM Revenue and Customs does not allow extra time in the event of a customer's computer system failing. There is a variety of payment methods available which do not rely on computer access. Customers are notified in advance of the date(s) that payment is due. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure payment reaches HMRC on time. There is full &quot;how to pay&quot; guidance relating to all, and this sets out the various methods of payment requests and reminders issued by HMRC.</p>

A cost-benefit analysis is planned as part of the evaluation strategy.</p>
