	<p pid="a.2.2/1">A national scheme of parking concessions for disabled motorists&mdash;known as the Blue Badge scheme&mdash;has been in operation since 1971. It was introduced under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 and includes all but four central London boroughs (Westminster, Kensington &amp; Chelsea, part of Camden and the City of London) based on the severe problems with traffic congestion and pressure on parking space in these parts of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">These authorities have introduced their own independent local parking schemes for disabled people who live and work in these areas by means of a traffic regulation order under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. These are exclusive to individual boroughs and there is no requirement for them to be compatible with other schemes. However, the Department for Transport continues to hold regular meetings with the four central London boroughs to encourage them to be as flexible as possible with these schemes and also to provide concessions for Blue Badge holders. In this respect we have succeeded in securing increased parking provision for Blue Badge holders.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/3">The issue of removal of the exemption for the four central London boroughs from the Blue Badge scheme to make it a truly national scheme is being considered under a current comprehensive review of the scheme. The Secretary of State intends to make an announcement on the future shape of the scheme in autumn 2002.</p>

Authorities must advertise the availability of the accounts for inspection at least 14 days before the commencement of the inspection period. After the end of the time allowed for inspection, electors can exercise their rights to object to the auditor on matters relating to the accounts. We plan to consult later this year on proposals to amend the Accounts and Audit Regulations, which may include the possibility of changes to the arrangements by which accounts are made available for public inspection.</p>

Our priorities for review remain as expressed in the Planning Green Paper, PPG1, PPG4, PPG6, PPG7 and PPGs 15 and 16. We will seek to reduce the volume of guidance, while increasing the clarity; making them clearer, more concise and better focused on implementing policy objectives, while aiming not to change the existing balance of economic, social and environmental objectives in national policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/1">Each G8 member will decide for itself how to meet the commitments entered into at the Kananaskis Summit, including on the methods and criteria for awarding aid. The Department for International Development is considering how best to use the resources allocated to development assistance from 2003 to 2006 under the new Comprehensive Spending Review but, as the Prime Minister announced before the G8 Summit, bilateral assistance to Africa will rise to &pound;1 billion by 2005&ndash;06. In setting our priorities we will take fully into account the extent to which developing country governments pursue effective pro-poor policies and implement reforms in governance. We encourage other donors to do likewise. Many African countries have already made commitments in the agreements that they have with the international financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">We are strongly supportive of African countries' efforts to set up the African Peer Review Mechanism that is being developed through the New Partnership for Africa's Development. These were endorsed at the recent African Union Summit and we look forward to seeing the mechanism become operational. It is intended as a mechanism for African countries to review each other, just as peer review in OECD is intended for OECD countries to be subject to review by their peers.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.0/1">DfID attaches great importance to the participation of civil society in the poverty reduction strategy (PRS) process, and we are tracking the extent and nature of civil society engagement through a number of channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/2">One important channel is the UK representatives on the executive boards of the IMF and the World Bank which see the joint staff assessments (JSA) produced by the staffs of these institutions on completed PRS papers to assess whether they provide a credible framework for new lending programmes. The JSA includes a description of the country's participatory process.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/3">A second channel is through DfID's country programme offices, which are in regular contact with civil society organisations. We have supported the consultation and monitoring process in several countries&mdash;Uganda, Honduras, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and the Gambia. In several of our country programmes, we are also providing technical, human and financial support to poverty monitoring units, which encompass or have strong institutional links to civil society organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/4">A third channel is DfID's PRSP monitoring and synthesis project which was set up to collect information from a wide variety of sources&mdash;including DfID offices themselves&mdash;on the PRS process. Its recent report on participation in PRSPs in sub-Saharan Africa concluded that civil society participation had added much to the process, but work needed to be done to consolidate the gains made so far. DfID's country offices are also supporting a number of UK-based NGOs to work with developing country partner organisations to strengthen their capacity to engage in national debates and policy processes.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.3/1">Her Majesty's Government have no such plans. It remains the responsibility of the Zimbabwe Government to compensate for the land they are acquiring and leasing to others through their current resettlement and indigenisation programmes. The UK has repeatedly offered to provide development funds to support fair and well managed land reform, including land purchase, which contributes to poverty reduction. Sadly this is clearly not the case at present and an ill conceived programme is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</p>

Birth targets and quotas have been removed in the counties where UNFPA is operating. The US delegation which visited China in May found no evidence of UNFPA involvement in coercive abortion or sterilisation in China, and recommended that the US Government should continue to fund UNFPA. Following a visit to China in April this year, a cross-party group of MPs came to similar conclusions. It is disappointing that the US Government have decided to ignore their own delegation's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.5/1">Vaccination status is an important aspect of the operational readiness of Armed Forces personnel, and it is the responsibility of commanding officers to ensure that personnel are up to date with the appropriate immunisations. Routine immunisations against hepatitis A, typhoid, meningococus C, rubella (for females and medical personnel), tetanus, diphtheria, polio and yellow fever are offered to members of the Armed Forces. Members of the regular forces, and reservists at high readiness for deployment, have their immunity maintained by routine booster immunisations. For other members of the reserve forces, immunisations should be brought up to date upon mobilisation. Units should also carry out pre-deployment checks of vaccination states.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/2">Any individuals who on entry to the services lack a BCG scar and test as having low immunity will also be immunised against tuberculosis. Personnel operating in areas with a specific health hazard, and those in special occupational risk groups (such as medical personnel), may also be given additional vaccinations before deployment. All three services have routine administrative procedures in place to check the vaccination status of both regular and reserve personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.5/1">The Mental Health Act 1983 requires that in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment it is likely that treatment will alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the patient's conditions in order to justify his detention for treatment. This has led to a significant number of people with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder, and who pose a risk to themselves or to others, being excluded from treatment because of uncertainty about whether their personality disorder can be &quot;treated&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/2">The draft mental health Bill does not rely on particular categories of mental disorder, and does not require that treatment alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the patient's condition. Instead, it requires that appropriate treatment be available. The same conditions for compulsion will apply to all patients with a mental disorder. We envisage that this will mean that some pople with a diagnosis of personality disorder may meet the conditions for compulsion in the draft Bill where they would not come within the scope of the 1983 Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.8/1">The most recent information available concerning trends in the administration of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) is contained in the Department of Health statistical bulletin Electro Convulsive Therapy; Survey covering the period from January 1999 to March 1999, England. It looked at information gathered from a one-off survey of National Health Service and independent sector care settings, including nursing homes, and was undertaken to provide data on ECT that are not currently available elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/2">The survey collected data on total number of administrations of ECT in NHS and independent sector care settings; sex, age, ethnicity, legal status and method of consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/3">In the three-month period surveyed it was found that:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/4" class="indent">there were about 16,500 administrations of electro-convulsive therapy;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/5" class="indent">2,800 patients received ECT treatment;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/6" class="indent">there were 900 male patients receiving treatment, compared with 1,900 female patients;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/7" class="indent">44 per cent of female patients and 36 per cent of male patients receiving ECT treatment were aged 65 and over;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/8" class="indent">75 per cent of ECT patients were not formally detained under the Mental Health Act 1983;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/9" class="indent">of the 700 ECT patients formally detained while receiving ECT treatment, 59 per cent did not consent to treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/10">The survey did not reveal anything surprising or untoward about the use of ECT but it did confirm a downward trend in its use.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/11">In the past ECT was believed to be effective with a wide range of mental health conditions but is now recognised to be of most benefit in the treatment of a narrower band of conditions. Evidence and research tend to support the use of ECT to help people with very severe, generally psychotic, depression and puerpural psychosis, either of which can be life-threatening if left untreated. People who are this severely depressed may refuse or be unable to eat and drink, with a consequent high mortality, as well as being at very high risk of suicide. For these people ECT can produce a faster onset of therapeutic action than is the case with drug-based treatments and can be a life-saving treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/12">Health professionals and mental health services managers are expected to ensure that ECT is administered to patients in accordance with the detailed guidance published by the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Special Committee on ECT entitled The ECT Handbook&mdash;The Second Report of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Special Committee on ECT.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.8/13">ECT is administered if consent is given, but where the patient does not consent, or a doctor certifies that the patient is mentally incapable of consenting or refusing, the responsible medical officer must seek a second opinion from a second opinion appointed doctor, who will be asked to confirm the clinical need for ECT as a treatment of choice.</p>
