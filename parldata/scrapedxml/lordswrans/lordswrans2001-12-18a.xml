Some 50 per cent of the total is recycled, including all glass, oil, wood and scrap metal (including steel cans). Some 75 tonnes of waste paper were recycled in the last financial year, and, as part of an effort to increase this figure, collecting bins for recyclable waste paper will shortly be made available at all photocopying points. Other waste (including compostable material) is recovered. It is incinerated and the heat used to generate electricity. The ash residue left after incineration is used as building or road sub-base material.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.3/1">Meridian Delta Limited have today been appointed exclusive partners with English Partnerships for the regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula and to take over ownership of the Millennium Dome through a 999 year lease.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/2">Once legally concluded the deal will provide a 20,000 seat arena inside the Dome, surrounded by an urban entertainment complex. The total investment in and around the Dome will be &pound;200 million. The deal also provides for the regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula through a joint venture between EP and MDL which, over its 20-year lifetime, will provide a total investment of around &pound;4 billion, at least 5,000 new homes and an estimated 20,000 full time jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/3">Meridian Delta Limited is a consortium that includes Lend Lease (developers of the Sydney Olympic Village and the Bluewater shopping centre) Quintain Estates and Development and Anschutz Entertainment Group, the second largest entertainment company in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/4">English Partnerships expects to conclude a legally binding contract with MDL by the end of May 2002, but it is intended that it will provide both a guaranteed minimum price for the land that English Partnerships is putting into the joint venture and a substantial share of the overall remaining profits of the joint venture.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/5">The precise amount to be received by EP over the lifetime of the deal depends on the final details of the deal and the amount of development ultimately undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/6">However, it will amount to several hundred million pounds and is structured in such a way that is likely to generate better value for the public sector than could have been achieved through either the deals with Nomura or Legacy. The deal also provideds for MDL to take on all of the risks associated with operating and maintaining the Dome. The public sector's only remaining interest will be to receive a share of profits once they exceed a threshold, still to be determined.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/7">We welcome the fact that the National Audit Office is scrutinising the sale process and will report to Parliament. We have kept the NAO informed throughout and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.8/1">There are a number of specialist centres for treating people with gender dysphoria in England, including the Charing Cross Hospital. Like all other services, decisions about whether gender reassignment surgery should be funded under the National Health Service are made by individual health authorities, who must take account of the wider picture in terms of local priorities and circumstances when determining how resources are spent. There should be no &quot;blanket ban&quot; on the provision of any service, and each case must be decided on its own merits. The health authority in which a person is resident is responsible for commissioning services for that individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.8/2">In the future, commissioning of these services will move to primary care trusts (PCT), and the responsible PCT will be the one with which the person is registered.

	<p pid="a.40.0/1">We are responding on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to the reports of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) and the Review Body on Nursing staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB), which were published on <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase>. We understand that a similar announcement was made by the Minister for Health and Community Care in Scotland, and the Minister for Health and Social Services in Wales. Copies of the reports are available in the Printed Paper Office and the Library. We are grateful to the chairman and members of both review bodies for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/2">The pay recommendations of the two review bodies are being accepted in full and without staging.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/3">Nurses, midwives and health visitors are to get an across the board increase of 3.6 per cent. Some 45,000 of the lowest paid nursing support staff on grade A will benefit from a minimum cash uplift of &pound;400 giving them pay rises of up to 4.3 per cent. Non-registered staff on grades A and B will also have access to an additional incremental point if they achieve national vocational qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/4">On call and standby payments increase by 50 per cent while psychiatric and regional secure unit allowances are inceased by 32 per cent. Other cash based allowances are increased by 3.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/5">London allowances will be increased by 3.6 per cent and the earnings related element will be consolidated into a new rate of &pound;3,228 for all nursing staff working in inner London irrespective of their earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/6">This year additional action has been targeted to support clinical leadership in the National Health Service. Staff undertaking matron roles will have access to an increased maximum salary up to &pound;32,760. The lowest three incremental points on the nurse consultant scales will be deleted giving a new minimum rate of &pound;33,940. Nurse consultants will potentially be able to earn up to &pound;46,675.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/7">On top of these increases the extension of the geographic coverage of cost of living supplements from 1st April 2002 to a further six health authorities will result in an estimated 20,000 more qualified NPRB staff benefiting from additional increases worth between &pound;400 and &pound;600.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/8">The minimum starting pay of a newly qualified nurse will rise to &pound;16,005. In inner London starting pay for a new nurse will be &pound;19,873, including London weighting and the cost of living supplement.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/9">The NPRB has also recommended an across the board increase of 3.6 per cent for physiotherapists, radiographers and other allied health professionals within its remit. The lowest increment of the basic grade will be deleted with the assimilation arrangements for all existing basic grade staff. Starting pay for newly qualified staff will increase by 7.5 per cent on 1st April 2002 to &pound;17,115 or &pound;21,028 in London, inclusive of London weighting and the cost of living supplement. Cash based allowances are increased in line with awards made to nursing staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/10">The Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB) has recommended an overall pay increase of 3.6 per cent for salaried doctors and dentists and general dental practitioners. In addition the DDRB has recommended adjustments to the pay scales, including increases in the scale maxima, for senior house officers, associate specialists, staff grade practitioners, and dental officers, and an extension in the dentists' commitment scheme worth around an extra &pound;5 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/11">For general practitioners, it has recommended an increase in the amount to be delivered through the fee scale of 4.6 per cent, together with an increase in the out of hours supplement for GP registrars from 30 per cent of basic salary to 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/12">The pay rise recommended by the DDRB takes the starting consultant salary to &pound;52,640 and that of a consultant on the maximum of the scale with maximum distinction award to &pound;133,585. The number of distinction awards has also been increased by 186 which will support the Government's proposals to reform the existing schemes to give more opportunity to reward consultants for their commitment and contribution to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/13">These above inflation increases are fair and reflect the important contribution that these key staff are making to delivering the modernisation agenda outlined in the NHS Plan.</p>

We hope that it will not be long before the country can, with reasonable confidence, be regarded as free of disease. We still need to maintain precautions against the recurrence of the disease. This will need to be recognised in an interim animal movement regime which, assuming all continues to go well, we hope to introduce in mid-February.

In his Statement of <phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary set out a comprehensive package of reform of the immigration and asylum process, some of which will need to be taken forward by new legislation. But it would not be practicable to consolidate these Acts before this reform package has been enacted. The Law Commissions have a responsibility for consolidation, and the Government will consult them about a consolidation. By the time the reform package is enacted, the commissions to be consulted may include the Northern Ireland Law Commission proposed to be established by the draft Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill. The draft Bill was published on <phrase class="date" code="">12 November</phrase> of this year. The Government also intend to introduce a consolidated version of the immigration rules after the next set of legislation.</p>
