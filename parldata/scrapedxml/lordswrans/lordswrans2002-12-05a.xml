</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-12-05a.122.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="122"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo021205/text/21205w01.htm#21205w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.122.0/1">The articles of the Schengen Implementing Convention in which the United Kingdom will participate are set out in the Council decision of <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-29">29 May 2000</phrase> (2000/365/EC). The Crime (International Co-operation) Bill implements those articles which require legislation, with the exception of Article 27, which was implemented by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and Articles 40, 42 and 43 were in part implemented by the Police Reform Act 2002. Other provisions of Schengen relating to extradition are included in the Extradition Bill. All other articles and elements of the acquis, including the Schengen information system, in which the United Kingdom will participate, will be implemented through administrative measures. This Bill will implement the relevant parts of the Schengen convention for the United Kingdom; Gibraltar will take forward its own implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/2">The articles of Schengen to be implemented in the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill are as follows. Article 40(2) allows for police officers from one member state to continue surveillance into another member state in emergency situations for up to five hours. Clause 83 of the Bill inserts a new Section 76A into the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) to allow automatic authorisation of overseas officers to carry out surveillance in the United Kingdom in strictly limited circumstances. Legislation to implement Article 40(1) arrangements for officers acting in pre-planned joint surveillance teams is only required in respect of civil liabilities; this was implemented by Section 103 of the Police Reform Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/3">Article 42 requies member states to ensure that officers operating under the terms of Article 40 are treated in the same way as officers of the member state in which they are operating in respect of offences committed by or against them. Clause 84 of the Bill extends provisions on assaults on police officers (Section 89 of the Police Act 1996 in England and Wales, Section 41 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 in Scotland and Section 66 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 in Northern Ireland) to cover overseas officers involved in Article 40(2) surveillance operations, authorised under Section 76A of RIPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/4">Article 43 requires member states requesting cross-border surveillance to be liable for any damage caused by its officers while on surveillance. Clause 85 of the Bill amends the provisions on liability of wrongful acts on constables (Section 42 of the Police Act 1997) to make the director general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) liable for overseas officers carrying out surveillance in the United Kingdom under Section 76A of RIPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/5">Articles 49, 52 and 53 cover mutual legal assistance arrangements between member states. Those parts of these articles which will not be repealed by the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 2000 (MLAC) are implemented by Part 1 of the Bill. Part 1 also implements MLAC.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/6">Articles 62 to 66 cover extradition arrangements between member states. These have subsequently been superseded by the 1995 and 1996 European Union (EU) Extradition Conventions which were implemented in the United Kingdom by the EU Extradition Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/419). However, Clauses 86 and 87 of the Bill are necessary to ensure that the United Kingdom can apply Schengen extradition arrangements to countries which are either non-EU participants in Schengen (currently Norway and Iceland) or are EU member states which have not yet implemented the 1995 and 1996 conventions in order to fulfil the United Kingdom's Schengen obligations). Other provisions of Schengen relating to extradition, including those on the transfer of the enforcement of criminal judgments, are included in the Extradition Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/7">Article 114 requires member states to designate a supervisory authority to carry out independent supervision of the national data file of the Schengen Information System (SIS). Clause 82 of the Bill creates a power of independent inspection for the Information Commissioner of the SIS and other specified EU information systems by inserting new Section 54A into the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/8">A transposition note has been prepared by the Home Office which provides more detail on the precise implementation for each article of Schengen covered by the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.0/1">There have been no human cases of West Nile fever virus infection in the United Kingdom and the risk of transmitting the virus by blood transfusion is minimal. There are currently no plans to defer donors from donating blood in the UK solely on the grounds that they have recently visited the United States. However this situation is being kept under review. Plasma is currently imported from the United States for the production of plasma products, including fresh frozen plasma for babies and young children born after <phrase class="date" code="1996-01-01">1 January 1996</phrase>, as a precaution against the theoretical risk of vCJD transmission. Viral inactivation of these products is carried out as a safety measure to remove the risk to patients of transfusion transmittable viruses, including West Nile fever virus, should it be present.</p>

Higher education institutions in England receive recurrent public support in the form of a block grant from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). Institutions set their own priorities for how that grant is spent. Birmingham University has supported its European Research Institute through a capital grant from the Joint Infrastructure Fund, now succeeded by the Science Research Infrastructure Fund (SRIF) administered by HEFCE. Universities receive a formulae allocation from SRIF and choose themselves how to spend it.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the National Statistician, Len Cook, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-05">5 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/3">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking whether Her Majesty's Government are concerned about the apparent under-enumeration in the 2001 Census among males aged 20&ndash;44.[HL310]</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/4">For the 2001 Census a new and more robust method was used, known as the One Number Census. In addition to the Census itself, a huge independent coverage survey was undertaken, covering around 0.32 million households and every local authority (the Census Coverage Survey). This survey was then combined with the Census, using standard statistical techniques, to estimate the Census non-response and to adjust for under-enumeration. There was also an extensive Quality Assurance process for every local authority, comparing the Census results with a range of other administrative data; and a national Quality Assurance process resulting in additional adjustments.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/5">This approach was adopted because we knew that Census non-response had been increasing internationally and that response to the 2001 Census was likely to be lower than previously. It is the use of this robust method, adjusting under-enumeration, which gives me confidence that the Census figures provide the most accurate possible estimate of the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/6">For men aged 20&ndash;44, the response rate to the Census in England and Wales was 90 per cent. That is based on the final estimates derived from both the Census and the Census Coverage Survey, thus indicating that the One Number Census method added 865,000 males aged 20-44 to the estimate that would have been obtained by the Census alone. The response rate varied within that age-range as follows: 87 per cent for men 20&ndash;24, 88 per cent for men aged 25&ndash;29, 90 per cent for men aged 30&ndash;34, 92 per cent for men aged 35&ndash;39, 94 per cent for men aged 40&ndash;44. These and further details about response were published with the Census results on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> and are available on the National Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/annexb.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/annexb.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/7">The 2001 Census results showed that the United Kingdom has 800,000 fewer men aged 20&ndash;44 than previously thought. The critical factor within the difference appears to be emigration. The data used to estimate the numbers of people leaving the country is derived, from the International Passenger Survey (IPS). This works well, but it captures travellers' intentions at the time of departure. These may be prone to change once people are abroad, particularly among young men with few ties at home. These issues are currently under consideration as part of the National Statistics Quality Review on International Migration, and one of the outcomes expected of this review is a set of options to improve intercensal population estimates, which will particularly involve males 20 to 44.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.8/1">The Centre for Management and Policy Studies (CMPS)has indeed built rural proofing into its policy-making courses for civil servants. The interests of people in rural areas feature in every session on identifying stakeholders and such sessions are integral to general policy-making courses. More specific examples include: after discussion with the Countryside Agency, a case study in rural transport issues has been built into the key policy-making course for fast-stream trainees, The Management of Policy Work, and will also feature in a new course for 2003&ndash;04, Developing Deliverable Policy; and a three-day partnership programme in May 2003 for senior civil servants and their equivalents in the public and not-for-profit sectors will be built around a case study of rural regeneration and land use in North Dorset.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-01">1 July 2001</phrase> the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency was successfully divided into QinetiQ plc, a wholly government-owned company, and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, which remains part of the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-06">6 March 2002</phrase> (Official Report, col. 313&ndash;14W) we informed the House in another place that we had decided to sell a substantial stake in QinetiQ to a strategic partner who would help to develop the company in preparation for a future flotation on the stock market. Our decision followed a detailed analysis of market conditions which led us to conclude that this approach offered best value for the taxpayer and would meet our objectives for a successful public private partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/3">Following the announcement in early September that the Carlyle Group had been chosen as preferred bidder in MoD's selection of a strategic partner, the MoD has now signed a deal with Carlyle. The transaction values QinetiQ at around &pound;500 million. Following adjustments to reflect current assets and liabilities, MoD will receive between &pound;140 million and &pound;150 million from the transaction (the final amount will depend on the company's exact financial position at completion). This will be in addition to &pound;50 million already received from QinetiQ as part of the purchase price for its assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/4">The Carlyle Group will acquire a 33.8 per cent economic interest in QinetiQ, with a further 3.7 per cent of the shares to be available for employees of QinetiQ. Management control and responsibility for setting future commercial strategy will now lie with QinetiQ and Carlyle, allowing them the freedom to make appropriate decisions to grow the business. MoD will retain those rights that are conventional for a major shareholder. QinetiQ's board of directors will be augmented by the appointment of two Carlyle nominees. MoD will also have the right to appoint two non-executive directors. QinetiQ employees will have the opportunity to invest in the future of the business through a staff equity scheme and will each receive a small free allocation of share options.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/5">This is a good deal for the taxpayer, for QinetiQ and for the company's employees. At completion, the taxpayer will have received a total so far of around &pound;200 million from the PPP, and MoD's retention of a significant stake in the business will ensure that the taxpayer shares in the anticipated future growth in the value of the company. The company will benefit from the injection of new private sector capital, together with the Carlyle Group's track record in assisting companies to grow and develop. As previously announced, our intention remains to sell our entire stake in QinetiQ within three to five years, probably through a flotation on the stock market.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/6">QinetiQ will remain a British company based in the UK. MoD will retain a special share in the company to ensure that the nation's defence and security interests continue to be protected. There will also be robust safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and to ensure that the integrity of the Government's procurement process is not compromised.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/7">Subject to the satisfactory fulfilment of a number of final conditions, we expect to achieve the formal completion of the sale process early in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">Progress towards the entry to service of Typhoon has been reviewed closely since the start, in April 2002, of test flying with the instrumented production aircraft. The process of gathering flight safety and performance data, which is necessary to accept aircraft into service, is taking industry longer than the agreed schedule. The large volume of work to resolve outstanding and arising design issues, although individually minor, has also progressed more slowly than expected. As a result, we have concluded with our international partners and with industry that the evidence required to permit contractual acceptance of the aircraft by the four partner nations will not be complete before the end of March 2003. Allowing for the joint, four-nation acceptance process, aircraft should then be ready for hand-over to the Royal Air Force by the end of June 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/2">In any event following the loss of a development aircraft in Spain on <phrase class="date" code="">21 November</phrase>, it is essential that there is a time allowance for the realignment of test flying tasks. Further delay cannot be ruled out until the causes and implications of the crash are fully understood. This second delay, since the contract was placed with industry, to Typhoon's entry to service is extremely disappointing, but safety remains paramount, and we will only accept aircraft that meet the agreed specification. Every effort will be made to accelerate the entry to service and work-up process to prevent or minimise any delay to the operational employment of Typhoon, scheduled for the second half of the decade. It is this latter date, of course, when the RAF is able to use the aircraft on operations, that is so critical.</p>
