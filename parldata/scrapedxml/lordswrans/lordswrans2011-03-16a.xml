	<p pid="a.59.5/1">The Ministry of Defence (MoD) operates a range of measures to tackle mental health issues among the Armed Forces, and we train our people and their commanders about the need to recognise mental health issues, one of which is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and to seek help if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2">The first level of clinical assessment of mental health problems is provided by primary care services and the unit medical officer. Diagnosis or suspicion of PTSD would nearly always lead to referral to one of the military departments of community mental health (DCMH). There are 15 DCMHs across the UK, which provide out-patient mental healthcare exclusively to service personnel. These teams are made up of psychiatrists and mental health nurses, with support from clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available, including medication, psychological therapies, including cognitive behaviour therapy and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy, and environmental adjustment. The MoD works with a group of NHS trusts, led by Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust, to provide in-patient care in specialised psychiatric units. These arrangements mean that most patients can be treated near their units.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/3">Reservists once demobilised are able to access the MoD provided mental health services through the Reserves Mental Health Programme (RMHP). The RMHP is open to any current or former member of the UK Volunteer and Regular Reserves who has been demobilised since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> following an operational deployment as a reservist, and who believes that the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health. Under the RMHP, we liaise with the individual's GP and offer a mental health assessment at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell in Nottinghamshire. If diagnosed to have a combat- related mental health condition, we then offer treatment via one of the MoD's DCMHs.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/4">We are working with the Department of Health further to develop healthcare services by implementing recommendations made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40562" name="Andrew Murrison">the honourable Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)</phrase> in the other place in his report into the health of our Armed Forces. These include more NHS veterans mental health nurses providing outreach and treatment; follow-up of service leavers 12 months after discharge, a 24 hour mental health helpline and enhanced service medical procedures to help identify mental health problems during service and prior to discharge, and where necessary treatment at DCMHs for up to six months following discharge.</p>

NHS histopathology laboratories provide a rapid turnaround service for urgent cases, as agreed locally with their cancer services having regard to the national waiting times standards for cancer care. The aim will always be to issue clinically appropriate guidance within the shortest possible time. However, a definitive report may often require additional molecular or ultrastructural investigations beyond the initial report.</p>
