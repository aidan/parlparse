	<p pid="a.55.0/1">In buying Reactor Sites Management Company Ltd from BNFL, after a competitive and rigorous process of pre-qualification against a testing set of criteria, Energy Solutions has also acquired the remainder of the subsidiary's contract with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to operate and clean up the 10 Magnox sites. The contracts were signed by Magnox Electric Ltd and are one year in duration with an option to extend. We believe the sale to be in the best interests of the business, its staff and its customer&mdash;the NDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/2">As stated in the NDA's strategy, the Magnox sites will be split into two regions (north and south) and competed for. The competition for the southern region is already under way; the one for the northern region will commence in 2010. Other decommissioning providers will indeed be able to bid in these competitions.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.0/1">The Marine and Fisheries Agency deals with around 400 applications each year, ranging from proposals for small-scale construction works, such as yacht club jetties and the disposal of dredgings from marinas, through to major port and offshore wind-farm projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/2">The performance targets for determining applications reflect both the scale and sensitivities of projects and the likely timeframes for resolving potential conflicts with other uses of the sea. They also reflect the likely timeframes for negotiating appropriate mitigation or compensation where works may adversely impact the marine environment and designated conservation areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/3">In the majority of cases, applications that do not raise concerns regarding interference with the activities of others, or which do not present a threat to the environment, can be processed within a period of 12 weeks. Others highlight areas of concern that call for negotiation with the applicant and their advisers to resolve or mitigate matters identified by the assessment process or during consultation. This extends the time necessary to reach a decision. For example, London Array&mdash;the world's largest offshore wind farm&mdash;licensed in December 2006, raised a number of issues, particularly navigational safety and protection of birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/4">A significant proportion, particularly the large-scale schemes, may raise issues which take considerably longer to decide. This could arise where the project presents a risk to a designated Natura 2000 site. In such cases, the project may be permitted only where it can be demonstrated that there is no alternative and must proceed for reasons of imperative overriding public interest, subject to agreement over suitable compensation. Schemes may also trigger the need for the project to be considered at a local or public inquiry (normally triggered by other consent regimes, such as a planning application or application for a harbour empowerment order) that may extend considerably the time necessary to reach a determination. A recent example is the harbour development at Immingham, where the licensing process was extended by an inquiry instigated under the Harbours Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.5/1">The allowance previously known as boarding school allowance was renamed continuity of education allowance (CEA) at the start of the school autumn term 2005. The allowance is available to all regular service personnel who are accompanied by their family on frequent assignments at both home and overseas. When claiming CEA, a service person must fully accept that this accompanied service is the overriding principle for any entitlement to CEA.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">There are different rates of CEA for the junior and senior stages of a child's education if a child boards at the school or is a day pupil, and to recognise if a child has a special educational need (SEN). All claimants must pay a minimum of 10 per cent parental contribution to their child's school fees. The current maximum rates of CEA per term are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.61.5/5"> <td>Allowance</td> <td>Maximum Rates per Term from 1 Aug 06</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.61.5/6"> <td>CEA (Board)&mdash;Junior</td> <td>&pound;3,695</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.61.5/14">The most up-to-date figures available for the cost of CEA are for the academic year 2005-06, where the cost to the MoD was &pound;93.6M (before tax and NIC).</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/15">Eligible MoD civil servants can only claim schooling allowance(s) when stationed overseas. This allowance is for children attending fee-paying schools overseas or at independent schools in the UK. There is no central record for the costs of the allowance paid overseas as these are reimbursed by local budgets and details could only be provided at disproportionate cost. All claimants must pay a minimum 10 per cent parental contribution to their child's school fees.</p>
