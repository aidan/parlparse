We believe the best way to eliminate unsafe abortion is to provide access to family planning information, services and supplies and to ensure that women have more control over the circumstances in which they have sex. In countries where abortion is legal, DfID will support programmes that make abortion safe and accessible. In countries where abortion is illegal and women are dying due to unsafe abortion, DfID will help make the consequences of unsafe abortion more widely understood and will consider supporting processes of legal and policy reform.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.2/1">Ships of the Bay class are already able to fulfil roles in addition to their main amphibious support function. For example, RFA Largs Bay provided humanitarian relief to Haiti earlier this year and Lyme Bay is presently supporting mine countermeasures ships in the Gulf. We have no plans to convert any Bay class ships specifically for these or other roles.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.5/1">The artist's resale right may only be exercised through a collecting society. The applicable legislative framework is the 2001 EU directive<sup>1</sup> on artist's resale right, which is implemented in the UK by the Artist's Resale Right Regulations 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.5/2">Under the 2006 regulations, where the holder of the resale right has not transferred the management of that right (including the collection of resale royalty) to a collecting society, the collecting society which manages copyright on behalf of artists is deemed to be mandated to collect resale royalties. Where there is more than one such collecting society, the holder of the resale right may choose which of those societies is mandated. The Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS) cannot, therefore, be said to be &quot;appointed by the Government to collect rights on behalf of all those artists not registered with other collection agencies&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.5/3">In the case of all collecting societies, including DACS, the level of administrative charges imposed for royalty collection services is a matter for the society concerned, although my department encourages all collecting societies to operate fairly and transparently.</p>

The Basel III reforms do not increase the relative capital required for trade finance exposures. G20 leaders have agreed to evaluate the impact of regulatory regimes on trade finance.

Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions that occur from sources owned or controlled by the organisation-for example, emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces and vehicles. Scope 2 emissions are from the generation of purchased electricity. This target was not set by the Higher Education Funding Council for England but was instead agreed by the sector after widespread consultation.</p>

Carbon management plans are also required in order to access any capital funding that may be available from April 2011. These plans are required to include a publicly available institutional target for an absolute reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2020 against a 2005 baseline; an implementation plan to achieve reductions; a commitment to monitor progress and report publicly annually; and for the plan to be signed off by the governing body.</p>

The targets will be analysed to establish the overall sector trajectory and this information will be published by the end of 2010. The level of institutional targets varies to reflect the contribution that different institutions can make to the sector-level target.

	<p pid="a.271.2/4">It is not possible to determine from information collected at death registration whether the deceased was a regular user of a specific category of drugs, since this information is not routinely recorded.

	<p pid="a.275.6/1">The standard interest rate used to calculate support for mortgage interest was fixed at 6.08 per cent by the last administration. That rate was too generous and resulted in the vast majority of people getting more than their eligible mortgage interest liability, which was unfair to taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.6/2">The plans of the previous Government would have meant that the standard interest rate would have reverted to the formula of Bank of England Base rate plus 1.58 per cent from January 2011, which at present would produce a rate of 2.08 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.6/3">The Chancellor announced in the June 2010 Budget that the standard interest rate would be based on the Bank of England's published monthly average mortgage interest rate. Legislation to introduce this change came into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October 2010</phrase> and the standard interest rate is currently 3.63 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.6/4">The department conducted thorough analysis on the likely impacts of this change, and we have included as much information as possible in the equality impact assessment published on the department's website: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/support-for-mortgage-interest.pdf">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/support-for-mortgage-interest.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.275.6/5">The department is in the process of developing a model to estimate the impact of changes to support for mortgage interest on the number of repossessions. However, any estimates will always be limited since detailed case-by-case information, such as arrears at the start of a claim, is not collected by the department. The department will consider whether the results can be used publicly once this is work is complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.6/6">The Council of Mortgage Lenders has told the department that it expects lenders to continue to exercise forbearance where it is fair to do so for the borrower, and the borrower has a chance of paying off any arrears in the future. The Council of Mortgage Lenders thinks that where arrears levels increase for some borrowers as a result of the change in the standard interest rate this does not translate into an immediate possession risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.6/7">At the comprehensive spending review 2010, the Chancellor announced funding for a one-year extension to the temporary package of support for mortgage interest changes that had been due to expire in January 2011. This extension maintains the waiting period for new working age claimants at 13 weeks and the limit on eligible mortgage capital at &#163;200,000, and provides additional support to homeowners facing difficulties.</p>

This gives details of the impacts at local authority level. A copy of the document has been placed in the Library.

For example, we have trebled the discretionary housing payment funding to local authorities.

	<p pid="a.280.5/2">In 2009, NEST's predecessor body, the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority, conducted a public consultation on how NEST should invest its members' money. Respondents to the consultation question on whether NEST should offer an ethical or socially responsible investment fund were all in favour of NEST offering such a fund, as demand for these products has grown considerably in recent years. Research suggests that over 40 per cent of defined contribution schemes currently offer an ethical fund. In 2007, a DWP survey into NEST's target group found that, of those respondents who said they would make an investment choice, 29 per cent said they would invest in an ethical fund regardless of the return and 49 per cent said they would invest ethically if the returns were equal to other investment types.</p>
