	<p pid="a.73.2/1">The information available is that between <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-13">13 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-04">4 December</phrase>, 2,883 asylum interviews were booked for the Liverpool and Leeds offices of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) These include interviews for applicants from the South East as well as the North East, Scotland and South Wales. For the same period, the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) provided 20 travel warrants for travel from the South-East to Liverpool. NASS has provided overnight accommodation in a few instances where applicants encourtered rail difficulties. I regret that it is not possible to separate travel costs for interview purposes from overall NASS dispersal travel costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/2">During the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-13">13 November</phrase>, 43 interviews were cancelled because of disruption to the rail network. This number has fallen subsequently, with five interviews being cancelled for this reason during the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-04">4 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/3">The majority of asylum interviews are held at the IND offices in Croydon. This is where the main casework operation is located. Effort is made to take account of the applicant's location when booking an asylum interview where possible, but consideration of the location and scheduled start time is very much based on facilities and optimising available resources. This is essential if IND is to deliver the White Paper target to take most initial asylum decisions within two months from April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/4">Given the volume of interviews booked for the Liverpool and Leeds office, it is not always possible or practicable to book interviews later in the day for applicants travelling long distances. It is inevitable therefore that a proportion of applicants will be required to travel during peak travel periods at some stage of their journey.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.5/1">The Government accept that in a minority of cases it is necessary to detain immigration offenders in prisons because they present a high risk to security and control to a degree which is not appropriate to the current immigration detention estate.

We are not therefore able to give the undertaking which is sought.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.2/1">The courts have imposed 122 football banning orders under the measures contained in the 2000 Act. Whilst there are no grounds for complacency, there has been no significant disorder involving English football supporters overseas since the Act came into force. The early indications are that the new measures are helping to deter disorder and encouraging the vast majority of travelling supporters to rid English football of its hooligan reputation. A copy fo the interim report of the Working Group on Football Disorder has today been placed in the Library. It outlines the group's provisional findings and the work upon which it has embarked. The group has been tasked to produce by April of next year a collective and cohesive plan for improving the image of English football, the behaviour of its followers and the role of football at all levels in promoting social inclusion. Measures aimed at tackling the racist and xenophobic attitudes that so often prompt football violence and disorder will feature in the plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.5/1">The purpose of the working holidaymaker scheme is not to meet skills shortages, or enable teachers to secure employment in the United Kingdom, but as a concession to the normal arrangements working holidaymakers who are qualified teachers are allowed to undertake supply teaching during their stay. In keeping with the ethos of the scheme, any teaching work should be incidental to a holiday and they should not be working for the whole of their time here. For those non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals who wish to engage in full-time teaching employment in the United Kingdom there are already provisions under the work permit scheme, and provisions in the Immigration Rules enabling approved exchange schemes for teachers and language assistants.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.5/2">We have nonetheless considered representations about the particular staffing difficulties and disruption faced by schools when supply teachers in their employ leave during the course of a school term because their leave to enter or remain as working holidaymakers has expired. In the interests of schools and their pupils, and in the light of the unique considerations which apply to the completion of school terms, we have agreed to amend the policy instructions in respect of working holidaymakers. This change will enable a short extension of leave to remain in the United Kingdom to a working holidaymaker who is already employed as a supply teacher, and whom the school wishes to retain, to enable them to complete the school term during which their leave to remain as a working holidaymaker has expired. Such leave will be granted on an exceptional basis outside the Immigration Rules in order to benefit those whose leave will expire during the course of a term but will not permit extensions to cover a whole term or more. Schools wishing to employ working holidaymakers as supply teachers will be expected to take account of the date upon which such a teacher's leave to enter or remain is due to expire when planning the coverage of vacant posts over the school year.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.8/1">Yes. Smoking policy for staff outside the Refreshment Department, approved by the Whitley Committee, is set out in Appendix G of the Staff Handbook. The basic principle behind the policy is that staff are entitled to work in a smoke-free atmosphere if they want to, and that staff who smoke should have the facilities to enable them to do so. Refreshment Department staff are covered by rules set out in paragraph 166 of the Handbook. Staff smoking policy is distinct from the rules on smoking applicable to Members.</p>

In June 1999 the Library and Computers Sub-Committee agreed that the ultimate aim should be that Xthe Library should be an entirely smoke-free area as soon as possible&quot;. The Sub-Committee rejected a proposal to make the Salisbury room a smoking room, as it was supported by neither the present occupants of the room nor smokers.

	<p pid="a.77.5/1">Smoking policy for Members is a matter for the Offices Committee and its sub-committees, and I intend to invite the Offices Committee and its sub-comittees to reconsider the matter. The smoking policy for staff of the House outside the Refreshment Department already provides that staff are entitled to work in a smoke-free environment if they wish to. Refreshment Department staff are only permitted to smoke during their authorised breaks and in the designated smoking room. The Health and Safety Commission has proposed the issue of an approved code of practice on passive smoking at work and staff smoking policy will be reviewed in the light of any such code.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.5/1">At the Berlin European Council in March last year, the EU agreed to reforms of certain aspects of the common agricultural policy and to a financial perspective for 2000-06. Together these helped pave the way for enlargement. The Government welcomed the CAP reform agreement as a step in the right direction but continue to advance the case for further reform, which many consider to be both desirable and inevitable. The accession process needs to take account of the fact that the CAP is constantly evolving, but it is not necessary to complete the CAP reform process before enlargement takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/2">The precise nature of the new member states' integration into the acquis will depend on the outcome of negotiations with those countries. As in all previous enlargements, transitional arrangements, in which EU policies are phased in over a fixed period of time, are likely to be necessary in a number of areas, including agriculture. The Government are committed to securing early enlargement without breaching the financial ceilings established at Berlin.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.8/1">The actual cost to the UK of applying the CAP to Poland and Hungary would depend upon many factors, but it would be limited in two ways. First, the financial perspective for 2000-06 agreed at the Berlin European Council in March last year set limits on enlargement-related spending. These limits leave the overall ceiling on spending in an enlarged EU well beneath the current Own Resources ceiling (1.27 per cent of Community GNP). Secondly, also at Berlin, the Government succeeded in retaining the UK abatement for the duration of the financial perspective. The abatement will apply to the bulk of spending in the new member states.</p>
