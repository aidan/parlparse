This is because there are many different factors which may or may not be involved in the cost of a case (such as detention costs, travel costs, and the cost of escorting the individual in question). We are unable to disaggregate the specific costs and any attempt to do so would also incur disproportionate cost.</p>

The award, which is an extension to the duration of the study, was granted at no additional cost to the MRC to allow the completion of the planned research. Such a time-only extension is the standard mechanism employed by the MRC for allowing grants to fulfil their original objectives. As such awards involve no significant changes to the research plans they are not subject to additional peer review. The original award, which was made in 2007, was subject to the MRC's rigorous peer review process and was considered to be internationally competitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/2">The MRC's peer review process includes an assessment of the importance of the scientific questions being asked, the research programme's potential for advancing biomedical science, and the justification for the resources requested; any ethical issues that need further attention are also identified. The process does not include a formal assessment of an applicant's previous research papers and any associated impact factors.</p>

The number of profiles held is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because some profiles are replicates-i.e. more than one profile is held for one individual.

The Government believe that this could go some way towards addressing the implications of the South Lakeland judgment. We hope to publish a final version of the PPS in spring 2010.</p>

The intention was to address the 1997 Shimizu judgment that consent from the local planning authority is required only for total or substantial demolition. Responses to consultation on the White Paper showed that there was general support for this measure, implementation of which would involve an amendment to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995.

	<p pid="a.77.8/1">In general terms a student whose visa is revoked has three options: they can appeal against the decision to revoke their visa to the independent Asylum and Immigration Tribunal; they can seek to regularise their stay in the United Kingdom by applying for leave to remain in another immigration category; or they can return home. Students who do not follow one of these courses of action will be considered for appropriate enforcement action. Action to enforce a person's departure is prioritised on those who pose the greatest risk to the UK public.</p>
