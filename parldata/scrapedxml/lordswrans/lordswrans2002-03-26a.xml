The ministerial priorities, which will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, are: to help create safe communities by reducing crime, anti-social behaviour and disorder through effective partnership working, including reducing the availability and use of Class A drugs; to reduce the fear of crime in all sections of the community and in particular to increase the trust and confidence in policing among minority ethnic communities; and to increase the number of offences for which offenders, and particularly persistent offenders, are caught and brought to justice, in partnership with other criminal justice agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/2">Subject to the approval of both Houses, the best value performance indicators will also come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.

The full list will be placed in the Library in the next few days.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/3">The Home Secretary will, by the summer, introduce a performance indicator on tackling persistent offenders. Persistent offenders must be caught and dealt with to protect the public from their activities. An indicator to measure police success in driving up performance will be introduced as soon as data collection systems are in place.</p>

The contract is for a period of 29 years and involves the construction of new office accommodation, its long-term maintenance and provision of facility management and business support services. The net present cost of the contract is around &pound;311 million at current prices. The demolition of the existing building at Marsham Street will start as soon as possible. On current plans, completion of the new development is expected to be spring 2005. Westminster City Council has already given planning consent for the re-development of the site, which includes mixed office, residential and commercial development.

	<p pid="a.39.5/2">Since that announcement, the Prosecutions Group of the Solicitors Office has forged ahead with a rapid programme of change to enable it to deliver legal services of a high quality in a responsive and flexible way. New managers and staff have been recruited, the organisation has been restructured and working practices are being reformed.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/3">The Parliamentary Answer also referred to accountability for the prosecutions function moving from the commissioners to the Attorney-General on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/4">Final agreement has not yet been reached on the implementation of Recommendation 4 of the Gower/Hammond recommendations which recommends that in relation to the prosecution function the solicitor for the Customs and Excise should not be funded by the commissioners but should have his own ring-fenced budget and be accountable for his own expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/5">This recommendation is accepted in principle by the Government but there are technical issues relating to the estalishment of a separate vote which require further time to resolve. The Government are committed to the full implementation of Recommendation 4 no later than <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, but in the meantime the Prosecutions Group budget will remain as part of the Customs and Excise vote, though it will be separately identified and managed by the solicitor for the Customs and Excise and financial accounts reports will be produced as if that budget had been established as a separate vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/6">As a consequence of these revised arrangements, the Attorney-General will not assume full accountability for the prosecutions function from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April</phrase>. Instead, from that date the following arrangements will apply:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/7" class="indent">(1) The commissioners (and Treasury Ministers) will be responsible for and accountable to Parliament for: anything done in the course of an investigation; enforcement policy, including the resources to be deployed; prosecution policy, ie the seriousness with which offences should in general be treated and wider issues of departmental policy such as the disclosure of informants; decisions on alternatives to prosecution such as compounding, civil evasion action etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/8" class="indent">(2) The Law Officers will be responsible for and accountable to Parliament for: the quality of legal advice given by investigation legal advisers; the quality of the Prosecutions Group casework decision-making in relation to cases referred to that group for prosecution; the application (the Prosecutions Group having consulted with Customs administrators, as appropriate) of prosecutions policy and public interest factors to individual defendants in cases referred to the Prosecutions Group for prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/9">Inspection of the Prosecutions Group by the CPS Inspectorate will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, and the Prosecutions Group will proceed with the trials referred to in the previous Parliamentary Answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/10">The Government are satisfied that the arrangements that will apply from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April</phrase> strengthen the involvement of the Attorney-General with the difficult and complex criminal casework conducted by the Solicitors Office, maintain the momentum of change that has been established and preserve an appropriate position on parliamentary accountability. maria</p>

Expressions of interest will be assessed by the SSDA against the criteria detailed in the SSC development guide published in December. Successful sectors will receive funding to develop a full proposal within six months. The SSDA will recommend licences for those sectors whose proposals meet the SSC standard.
