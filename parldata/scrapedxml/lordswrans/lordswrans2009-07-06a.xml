	<p pid="a.95.2/1">The Meat (Official Controls Charges) (England) Regulations 2009 and similar regulations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, will change the system of charging for meat hygiene official controls in approved meat plants, including abattoirs, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-28">28 September 2009</phrase>. Under the new charging arrangements abattoirs will be charged a percentage of the time costs of meat hygiene official controls carried out at their premises. The change will not increase charges for businesses if official control time remains unchanged and will provide an incentive for businesses to improve standards and compliance and to use official control resources as effectively as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/2">The Government will shortly be undertaking public consultation on proposals to amend the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (England) Regulations 2008, which will include a proposal to require only slaughterhouses processing cattle requiring BSE testing to have an approved required method of operation (RMOP). As the age over which cattle must be tested for BSE was raised in January 2009, the effect would be that only abattoirs slaughtering cattle aged over 48 months, instead of the current 30 months, would require an approved RMOP. Similar consultation exercises will be held in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/3">The European Commission published a proposal for a council regulation on the protection of animals at the time of killing, in September 2008. The proposed regulation will replace Directive 93/119 on the protection of animals at the time of killing. The text of the proposed regulation has been under consideration since last autumn and political agreement was reached on a presidency compromise text at the Agriculture Council on 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-23">23 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/4">Changes to the legislation regulating the welfare of animals in United Kingdom abattoirs will be required when the regulation applies in January 2013.</p>

A list of the 136 initiatives that delivered these savings has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/2">The original 170 efficiency initiatives were identified as part of the planning process for the 2004 Spending Review (SR04) which took place in late 2003. Over time, as the SR04 period progressed, these initiatives were modified as plans were firmed up and new information became available. As a result, the final number of efficiency initiatives at the end of the SR04 period totalled 136. To track through these changes and reconcile the original and final lists of initiatives would involve a manual trawl and investigation of electronic and paper files. This exercise would cost in excess of the &pound;750 disproportionate cost threshold.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/2">The UK Government do not collect data on the percentage of passports that can be read electronically. Research completed earlier this year by the Migration Experts Sub Group of the G8 Lyon/Roma Group suggests that 82 per cent of the countries in the world issue passports which comply with the ICAO Document 9303 and can thus be read electronically. The majority of those countries which do not comply issue comparatively few passports. Therefore the overall percentage of passports presented at UK ports of entry which can be read electronically is in fact significantly higher than the above figure.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.0/1">Since the formation of the inclusive government in February 2009, there have been a number of reported threats and violent or illegal incidents aimed at farmers in Zimbabwe. 3,000 farm workers have been evicted and displaced over the past two months. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is monitoring the situation closely and offering consular and other assistance as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) is providing wide-ranging humanitarian and other essential support to the poorest and most vulnerable across Zimbabwe, including both smallholder farmers and evicted farm workers. Our support includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/3">&pound;6.5 million of support to over 240,000 internally displaced people, as well as Zimbabwean migrants deported from neighbouring countries through the International Organisation for Migration (the UK is the largest donor);&pound;10 million in last financial year towards supporting rural livelihoods and subsistence farmers, including making seeds, tools and fertiliser available to improve local harvests; and&pound;500,000 for the re-integration of displaced communities into agriculture projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/4">This year we have announced a &pound;60 million package of support to the people of Zimbabwe, including a focus on boosting food security and helping the country to feed itself.</p>
