	<p pid="a.53.2/1">The recent announcement by the Minister for Borders and Immigration to expand the capacity of the immigration removal centre estate is to ensure that we have sufficient space to detain immigration offenders in order to effect their removal from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">The UK Border Agency now removes an immigration offender every eight minutes. This includes failed asylum seekers, overstayers and a record number of foreign prisoners. Challenging targets have been set to increase the rate of removals, backed up with a doubling of enforcement resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">Detention is necessary to ensure that immigration offenders do not abscond while the final stages of their removal are being arranged. It can also be used to &quot;fast track&quot; new asylum claims by housing applicants in centres with dedicated teams of case workers. This allows their cases to be decided quickly, leading either to faster integration in the UK for successful applicants or faster removal for those whose claims are refused.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/4">We have no plans to consult the Refugee Council or other relevant organisations about the construction of any new site. However, such bodies are represented on the detention users group (DUG) that meets quarterly with UK Border Agency officials. DUG members are informed of developments on matters relating to immigration detention and they are able to raise issues of concern with the UK Border Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.5/2">While the provision of humanitarian assistance remains a priority, peace can be achieved only through a political process. We regularly stress the need for all participants in the conflict in Darfur to cease hostilities and engage in the political process. We welcomed the appointment on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June</phrase> of a new joint UN-AU chief mediator for the Darfur political process, Djibril Bassole, formerly the Foreign Minister of Burkina Faso. The recently launched Qatar Darfur peace initiative is also welcome but needs to be framed within the overall UN-AU process. In recognition of the importance of the regional dimension the UK Government are an observer to the Senegal/Dakar process which is helping Sudan and Chad to reach a peaceful settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.5/1">The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 deems that certain convictions (including convictions by or before courts outside Great Britain) can be considered to be spent and do not have to be declared after a given period. That period varies according to the original penalty imposed. However, by virtue of Schedule 1, Part 1, paragraph (5) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (S.I. No. 1975/1023) and subsequent amendments, veterinary surgeons (among other professionals) are excepted from the effect of the 1974 Act. A conviction must, therefore, be declared under Article 5A(11) of the Veterinary Surgeons' Qualifications (European Recognition) Regulations (S.I. No. 2008/1824) regardless of where and when it was committed.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">Under the Weeds Act 1959 the Secretary of State has the power to issue an enforcement notice requiring an occupier or authority, responsible for land on which ragwort is growing, to take action to prevent it spreading to neighbouring land. If an occupier has unreasonably failed to comply with an enforcement notice, the Secretary of State may take action to arrange for the weeds to be cleared and recover the cost of doing so. The Weeds Act was amended by the Ragwort Control Act 2003, which provides for the publication of a code of practice for managers of land on how to prevent the spread of ragwort.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/2">Defra's policy under the Act is to investigate complaints about injurious weeds where there is a risk of spread to land used for horses and other livestock, for the production of conserved forage or for other agricultural activities, and where the complainant has already made an attempt to settle the matter informally. Defra's policy is to control rather than eradicate ragwort and other injurious weeds, as it is recognised that both make an important contribution to the biodiversity of the countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/3">Natural England investigates complaints under the Weeds Act on behalf of Defra and will investigate complaints in relation to common ragwort growing on the sides of roads, where the above criteria are met.</p>
