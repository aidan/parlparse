	<p pid="a.63.2/1">We have consistently recognised the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and the Russian Government's right and obligation to defend its citizens from terrorism. We have acknowledged and condemned the terrorist atrocities committed by some Chechen groups and their clear links to international terrorism. But we continue to emphasise that counter-terrorist operations in Chechnya, as elsewhere, must be in strict adherence to the rule of law and must respect human rights. We believe that the protection of human rights in Chechnya is an essential precursor to any political solution to the Chechen conflict.</p>

The purpose of the visit was to ask questions relevant to national security, to check on the welfare of the seven British detainees last seen in May and to establish the identity and nationality of two further detainees believed to have British nationality. As a result of these inquiries, one was identified as British. The other detainee did not have British nationality. The officials were from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Security Service.</p>

Some detainees reported minor medical problems and the official subsequently raised a number of these with the camp authorities.</p>

We have passed on to the families oral messages which were received and have briefed them on details of the detainees' circumstances. For reasons of privacy these details are not disclosed in this Answer. Detainees continue to be able to send and receive letters through the camp authorities and through the ICRC, although there is some concern about delays.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.2/1">Vaccines containing thiomersal (a mercury-containing compound known as thimerosal in the United States) have been in use for over 60 years. The only vaccines used in the routine United Kingdom childhood immunisation programme which contain thiomersal as an excipient in the final product are diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis (DTwP) and diphtheria and tetanus vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/2">In 2001, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) reviewed the available data relating to possible neurotoxicity of thiomersal in vaccines and advised that there is no evidence of harm caused by doses of thiomersal in vaccines. The CSM concluded that the risk: benefit balance of thiomersal-containing vaccines remains overwhelmingly positive. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the United States also published a detailed review of the evidence relating to possible neurotoxicity of thiomersal in vaccines in October 2001. The IOM findings were consistent with the CSM conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/3">We are aware of two new studies in the UK looking at the relationship between mercury in vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders in children. One of these studies is funded by the Department of Health and uses the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood. The other study is using the General Practice Research Database and is funded jointly by the World Health Organisation and the Public Health Laboratory Service (which receives its funding from the department). Neither of these studies supports an association between thiomersal exposure through the UK programme and neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The results of these studies have been made available to the department and a summary of the findings is available in a report to the US Congress which has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/4">In addition to the above studies, evidence from a recent study by M Pichichero et al (published in the November 30 2002 Lancet) showed that giving vaccines containing thiomersal does not raise blood levels of mercury. The findings of this paper suggested that ethylmercury is rapidly eliminated from the blood after administration intra-muscularly. The levels of ethylmercury in the blood were no higher than in samples taken at birth&mdash;before any vaccines had been received.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.6/1">During the passage of the Learning and Skills Bill, the issue of who should take the lead on providing support for home to school transport was debated, and it was agreed that local education authorities (LEAs) should continue to co-ordinate this. This was because LEAs are responsible for compulsory school age transport, many of them are already providing good support, and their local authorities have wider responsibilities for transport locally. The Department for Education and Skills arranged a major study of these arrangements Transport for Students in Further Education by transport consultants Steer Davis Gleave. The study was published earlier this year, and the report and recommendations are available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.6/2">My department responded to the consultants' recommendations by changing the legislation governing the support LEAs must provide for students of 16-19 and clarifying their responsibilities in Schedule 19 to the Education Act 2002. The legislation commences in January 2003 and requires LEAs to work with their learning and skills council, colleges, passenger transport authorities and other partners to meet the needs of students aged 16-19. They must take account of a number of factors, including ensuring that students are not prevented from accessing and completing their courses because of the availability of transport services or their ability to afford them. We have also provided development funding of &pound;9 million in 2002-03 to help 70 LEAs to research and develop more effective transport support arrangements. Finally, from September 2003 we will be channelling additional funding via the LEAs to help local partnerships to provide effective and sustainable transport support. This will complement the substantial additional funding to be provided to students of 16-19 from September 2004, when the education maintenance allowance is introduced nationally. We are confident that these measures will make a significant improvement to transport support generally and for rural areas in particular.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.2/1">The Crime (International Co-operation) Bill, which proposes measures to ratify the international convention on driving disqualifications, also proposes measures for the recognition by Great Britain of driving disqualifications imposed in the Channel Islands and Gibraltar as part of a package which also covers Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Her Majesty's Government propose that such recognition of disqualifications imposed in any one of these jurisdictions should occur only when that jurisdiction has put into practice recognition of driving disqualifications imposed in Great Britain. Only then will the relevant provisions in the Bill be commenced in relation to the relevant administration. Officials have been in touch with officials of the Jersey, Guernsey and Gibraltar administrations, all of whom have expressed themselves content in principle with arrangements on the lines proposed. No undertaking is required from the Jersey, Guernsey, or Gibraltar administrations to introduce reciprocal legislation. The Government will however encourage the Channel Islands and Gibraltar jurisdictions to consider doing so.</p>
