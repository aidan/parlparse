The starting point for the murder of a police officer in the course of his duty is 30 years. The court will consider any aggravating and mitigating factors which will increase or decrease the minimum term and, in exceptionally serious cases, may consider a whole life tariff. Release on licence may only be considered by the Parole Board once the minimum term has been served and the Board makes its decision on the basis of the risk to the community posed by the offender.

	<p pid="a.354.11/1">Laboratories on the Defra estate investigate and respond to animal and plant disease outbreaks. This work is carried out in energy intensive high containment laboratories which are regulated by strict legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.11/2">Many of the activities and processes carried out in the laboratories are energy intensive and there are. limited opportunities for achieving efficiencies which do not impact on the health, safety and security requirements within the laboratory environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.11/3">Defra's laboratory estate is at the cutting edge of research into animal and plant disease and a number of its laboratories have been designed to respond quickly and efficiently to outbreaks, such as foot and mouth and avian influenza. Maintaining this capability has a significant negative impact on energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.11/4">In 2005-06, the introduction of the Stewart Stockman building, a new high containment laboratory, designed to research and respond to animal disease outbreaks (such as foot and mouth), caused a significant increase in energy consumption on the laboratory estate.</p>

	<p pid="a.354.11/6">Defra has installed 14 voltage regulation units on its laboratory estate. This technology significantly reduces energy consumption of a whole building by regulating the voltage level entering the building. Average electricity consumption has reduced by 11 per cent as a result of installing this technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.11/7">Other energy efficiency projects which have been implemented include upgrades to more efficient lighting, improvements to motor energy controls and gas boiler sequencing controls, all of which have delivered significant savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.11/8">Thermal imaging surveys have been undertaken at a number of Defra laboratory sites. The results of the surveys will inform a programme of works to improve the thermal efficiency of buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.11/9">Defra is currently upgrading its electricity, gas and water meters to Smart meters which will provide accurate and up to the minute consumption data. This data will be used to monitor and identify excessive consumption, providing a focus for strategic consumption reduction. The Carbon Trust estimate that savings of between 5 to 10 per cent can be achieved through the identification of waste through Smart metering.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.11/10">To further improve operational efficiency, Defra has recently revised its requirements for facilities management (FM) provision to incorporate a more sustainable approach to the FM service. The recent sustainable workplace management contract awarded to Interserve, will further enhance Defra's capability to further embed sustainability in its operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.11/11">Defra has adopted the Carbon Trust's Carbon Management Programme and the entire Defra estate, including laboratories, was awarded Energy Efficiency Accreditation Scheme (EEAS) certification in June 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.356.3/1">An analysis of all Fire Service College Civil Service staff salaries by grade as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-01">1 June 2008</phrase> indicates that no material gender pay gap exists within junior grades at the college.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.3/2">At higher and senior levels, the gap is between 3 per cent and 10 per cent. This is as a direct result of two out of four male staff transferring in from other government departments with salaries at the top of the scale and the small numbers of staff in two grades having a significant effect on median salaries.</p>
