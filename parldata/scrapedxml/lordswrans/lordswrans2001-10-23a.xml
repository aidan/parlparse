	Palace of Westminster: Line of Route Summer Recess Tours
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.117.1/1">asked the Chairman of Committees:</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/2" qnum="HL845">How many visitors participated in the tours of the Palace of Westminster during the 2001 Summer Recess; how much revenue was generated from admission charges and from sales in the souvenir kiosks; what profit was generated from the visitor programme; and how these figures compare with those for the 2000 summer recess.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/1">There were 86,284 visitors over the eight weeks the Line of Route was open this summer, compared with 40,577 over a six-week opening period in 2000. Revenue from ticket sales (VAT adjusted, with the 2000 figure in brackets) was &pound;264,949 (&pound;119,991), and the provisional revenue from merchandising was &pound;100,343 (&pound;136,969).</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/2">The opening of the Line of Route is not intended to make a profit, but to contribute to the public's awareness and understanding of Parliament. The ticket price of &pound;3.50 represents an administration fee, offsetting the costs of ticket booking and of guides. The profits from merchandising, projected to be &pound;10,133 this year, also contribute to the operating costs. This compares to a merchandising loss of &pound;13,764 in 2000 (mostly attributable to one-off start-up costs). Both this year and in 2000 the opening of the Line of Route had a planned deficit of some &pound;232,000, thanks in large part to the costs of extra staff and security. In the event the deficit in 2000 was &pound;209,611, and this year it is estimated that the deficit will have been reduced to around &pound;168,000. The House of Lords is responsible for 40 per cent of this deficit.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.0/13">Note: The costs shown have the following characteristics; they do not include any increase for pay and prices over the period; they include both IT and non-IT cost estimates relating to each IT project; they include estimates where IT contracts have not yet been let; they do not include ongoing core costs which will be incurred once the projects &quot;go live&quot;. Additionally, the figures are high level estimates that are consequently subject to change. Because of the number of projects involved under each of the headings, the dates given can only be a broad indication of the timescales involved. The expected completion date for the Working Age Programme relates to the first phase of modernisation. The full modernisation of all working age services is likely to continue beyond this date.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/2" qnum="HL757">Whether, in respect of reinsurance cover against acts of terrorism provided for property wholly or partly in industrial or commercial usage in Great Britain and reinsured through the Pool Reinsurance Company Limited following the Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) Act 1993, they are contractually bound under the Retrocession Agreement to meet any deficit in the insurance fund and are therefore the reinsurer of last resort with unlimited liability; and, if so, whether this unlimited reinsurance cover would also be available to meet claims if such buildings suffer damage occasioned by war, invasion, act of foreign enemy, hostilities (whether war be declared or not), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection or military or usurped power; and</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/3" qnum="HL758">(a) For what reasons they would use their power to terminate the Retrocession Agreement between Her Majesty's Treasury and the Pool Reinsurance Company Limited with only 120 days' notice; (b) for how long they intend to keep the Retrocession Agreement in force; and (c) whether they will undertake not to terminate the Retrocession Agreement unless undoubted alternative reinsurance cover is available; and</p>

	<p pid="a.122.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring the continued availability of insurance cover for damage caused by terrorist attacks on industrial and commercial property in mainland Great Britain. The Retrocession Agreement was made following the decision of commercial reinsurers to limit the cover that they would offer in the UK market-place. The cover that is provided, as defined in Section 2 of the Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) Act 1993, deals with the shortfall. The Government act, in effect, as reinsurer of last resort with unlimited liability within the terms of the 1993 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/2">There is no single statutory definition of an act of terrorism or an act of war. Particular cases would have to be considered in light of the applicable statute and the terms of the insurance policies in question.</p>
