	<p pid="b.211.6/1">DfID agreed to provide &pound;1,486,000 towards the Ghana Government's justice sector development programme (JSDP) in July 2003. A cross-government steering committee was established to provide advice to a programme secretariat on allocating funds in line with government priorities. However, after 24 months and several attempts by DfID to kick-start the programme, less than 1 per cent. of programme funds had been disbursed. DfID therefore decided to close the JSDP in July 2005 and re-allocate the expenditure to other governance priorities in Ghana, such as public financial management and public service reform.</p>

	<p pid="b.212.5/1">The guidance published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, in <i>High Hedges Complaints: Prevention and Cure</i>, reflects the substance of the high hedges legislation in Part 8 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. Government guidance cannot impose restrictions above and beyond those set out in legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.5/2">The Government are aware of concerns that the problems identified in a complaint may not be fully remedied because of advice in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's guidance that councils should not specify remedial works to a hedge which would result in its death or destruction. This constraint arises from Section 69(3) of the 2003 Act, which states that the action specified in a remedial notice cannot involve removal of a hedge. In the Government's view, action that would kill a hedge amounts to the same as removing it altogether. This is about striking an appropriate balance between the rights of the hedge owner and those of the complainant.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.0/1">The Metropolitan Police's Art and Antiques Unit consists of one detective sergeant, three detective constables and two support staff. The unit is responsible for the collation and dissemination of intelligence pertaining to crime involving art and other cultural items. The intelligence is usually passed on to others to respond to, rather than being dealt with directly by the unit. There are also due diligence officers in many forces whose role it is to deal with the theft of art and antiques. It is not, therefore, just the resources of the Arts and Antiques Unit that are used to counter the illicit trade in cultural items. The role of the enforcement steering group&mdash;a group led by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and made up of representatives from relevant government departments and enforcement agencies&mdash;is to develop a more structured approach to tackling the illicit trade in cultural property. Resourcing the implementation of that approach remains a matter for the police.</p>

Subject to the usual rules relating to the use of capital moneys, PCTs are free to decide how best to use this incentive money.

In addition, awareness among GPs of the need to offer patients a choice of at least four providers has increased considerably.</p>

	<p pid="b.218.6/1">A record of all powers of entry is not maintained centrally. In July 1983 the Prime Minister agreed that the Home Office, together with the then Scottish Home and Health Department and Northern Ireland Office should take responsibility for scrutinising proposals to create or re-enact powers of entry within their home jurisdiction. Any new proposed power of entry is required to be submitted to the respective home department for consideration. Appendix A to the <i>Guide to Legislative Procedure</i> published by the Cabinet Office in June 2001 sets out the criteria for scrutiny of powers of entry. That guidance applies to both public and private legislation for which departments are responsible, including subordinate legislation. In England and Wales, those exercising a power of entry must have regard to Code of Practice B issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in addition to any requirements set out in the primary legislation granting the power.</p>

	<p pid="b.222.2/1">We are continually reviewing the powers in the Act. They are thoroughly reviewed by an independent reviewer, currently Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, to ensure that they are necessary, proportionate and used appropriately by the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.2/2">Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 gives the police power to arrest anyone reasonably suspected of being a terrorist or having committed certain offences under the Act. The decision to arrest a person under the Act may be the result of an intelligence-led operation or the result of an officer's judgment in circumstances where he feels an arrest is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.2/3">Statistics on arrests made under the Terrorism Act are published on the Home Office website. Many offences relating to terrorist activity, such as explosives, firearms or fraud offences, are dealt with under general criminal legislation. Therefore, not all individuals arrested under the Terrorism Act will necessarily be charged with offences under terrorism legislation. Under the Act, the Secretary of State is required to place a report on the operation of the whole Act before Parliament at least once every 12 months. The use of police powers is an operational matter for chief constables. We have always maintained that counter-terrorism powers need to be used sensitively, and it is particularly important that chief constables are able to demonstrate that they are exercised fairly and proportionately.</p>

The use of the power is an operational matter for the force concerned. The powers help to deter and disrupt terrorist activity by creating a hostile environment for terrorists to operate in. Law enforcement agencies must have appropriate powers available to them, and they must be used properly, fairly and consistently. We are working with stakeholders with a view to producing nationally agreed guidance for forces on the use of Section 44 stop and search powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.2/1">The UK Government support civil society in Uganda through a civil society umbrella programme (CSUP), which has been in place since 1999. The programme enables civil society organisations (CSOs) to monitor the implementation of Uganda's poverty eradication action plan and to represent the interests of poor people in policy-making debates. Some of the organisations that benefit from that support, such as the Uganda Debt Network, focus on debt issues. In total, the CSUP has so far provided nearly &pound;4 million of assistance to a wide range of CSOs. A new phase was agreed in 2003 that will provide additional support through to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.2/2">In Mozambique, the UK Government have been helping civil society to explore how it can engage in poverty monitoring and other policy processes since 2001. DfID has recently committed &pound;190,000 over two years to support the largest civil society network, the G20, to improve civil society's contribution to the development and monitoring of Mozambique's poverty reduction strategy. Specific objectives of the project include increasing the capacity of the G20 to engage in ongoing dialogue on poverty issues with the Government of Mozambique and improving the quality of civil society's contribution to the annual reports on poverty that inform the poverty reduction strategy. The Debt Group, a non-government organisation that monitors the impact of debt relief in Mozambique, is a prominent member of the G20.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.0/1">The United Kingdom currently provides all of its funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) through the Department for International Development. To date, DfID had spent &pound;13.37 million of the &pound;15 million funding commitment allocated to UNRWA in 2005&ndash;06. That expenditure includes a &pound;13 million core funding contribution; &pound;200,000 to help improve UNRWA's refugee records; and approximately &pound;164,000 to support the effective management of the UNRWA education system.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.3/1">The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has maintained its provision of health, education and sanitation services during and since Israel's withdrawal from Gaza. Withdrawal has had no significant immediate impact on UNRWA's work or on the socio-economic conditions faced by the refugees. UNRWA has been working with the quartet special envoy for disengagement, James Wolfensohn, and has focused on addressing the immediate needs of refugees through job creation programmes. It has released plans for improving education and upgrading primary health and environmental infrastructure over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.3/2">UNRWA co-ordinates with the Palestinian Authority (PA) on education issues, and UNRWA schools follow the PA national curriculum. In some areas, refugees attend schools maintained by the PA, and in others, non-refugees attend schools run by UNRWA. The international community recognises the importance of co-ordination between UNRWA and the PA. Mr Wolfensohn recently facilitated a meeting between both sides on co-ordinating their medium-term plans. DfID supports both sides in moving towards greater strategic co-ordination.</p>
