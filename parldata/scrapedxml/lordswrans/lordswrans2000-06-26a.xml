	<p pid="a.51.2/1">I am pleased to say that an additional &pound;15.8 million has been allocated to the CPS budget this year. This recognises the place of the CPS at the centre of the Criminal Justice System (CJS) and the contribution it can make to improving the performance of the CJS, including the police and other agencies. The &pound;15.8 million will allow performance to be raised on prosecutions, on information technology (IT), on diversity and on the Human Rights Act (HRA). Performance improvements will be targeted towards better working with the police, thereby saving police forces' time and money and ensuring that their work in catching suspects is more effectively translated into prosecutions. Consequently, some &pound;4.5 million of the money is to come from the Budget's &pound;100 million police modernisation fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.6/1">The Government are in regular contact with the Environment Agency and Sport England to discuss a range of issues. My honourable friend the Minister for Sport met representatives of all the angling governing bodies on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-13">13 January</phrase> this year at which funding to promote angling was discussed. A representative from Sport England was also present at the meeting. My honourable friend has given her support to a number of angling initiatives for young people and will be opening the European Championship.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/2">Sport England has made a substantial contribution to the promotion of angling through both the Sports Lottery Fund and grants to the governing bodies of the sport. For the year 1999-2000, grant-in-aid of &pound;27,500 was awarded to the National Federation of Anglers, &pound;29,000 to the National Federation of Sea Anglers, and &pound;27,000 to the Salmon and Trout Association. Thirty-one angling projects have received Lottery funding totalling over &pound;1.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/3">The Environment Agency is committed to developing and promoting sport and recreation, and the promotion of access for everyone, particularly beside, to and on, water. The agency has put in place several measures to promote angling as a sport and educational tool for young people. These include offering a 50 per cent concession on rod licence duties for anglers aged 12-16 inclusive, no licence being required for those under 12 years of age. The agency is also part-sponsor the National Federation of Anglers' Roadshow this summer, at which 5,000-6,000 mainly young anglers will take part. This year they have also introduced the Beginner's Licence, costing &pound;1 per day, in conjunction with coaching schemes. In the last three years, the agency has been targeting fisheries improvement projects in urban areas, the key reason being to improve fishing opportunities for many young anglers who have limited opportunities to travel. The agency has recently published Reel Life magazine, which is sent to 1 million licence holders, including junior anglers, which promoted coaching schemes run by the National Federation of Anglers, the Professional Anglers Association, and the Salmon and Trout Association; angling and conservation guidance; and specific pages dedicated to young anglers, designed to educate and promote good angling practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">Accommodation providers are required to collect asylum seekers from a designated arrival point in the dispersal cluster area, transport them to their address and provide reception services sufficient to acquaint the asylum seeker with their accommodation. Providers must facilitate registration with a local general practitioner, a dentist and, for dependants aged five and under, a health visiting service. Where asylum seekers require immediate health care, providers are required to make immediate arrangements as appropriate. Additionally, providers are required to provide information to asylum seekers regarding health care, education, leisure, recreation, legal, police, emergency services, independent local advice services and the One Stop Service, a grant funded service provided by the voluntary sector giving advice and support to asylum seekers.</p>
