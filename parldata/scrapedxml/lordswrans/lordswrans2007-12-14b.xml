	<p pid="b.86.8/1">The Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) remains the basis of our relationship with industry. We are driving forward with its implementation, not least through the development of an updated strategy. In doing so, we continue to work to maintain those sovereign capabilities identified in DIS, and to provide further clarity in a number of areas, such as setting out the detail of our transparency policy and our approach to supply networks including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Further, we are developing a package of measures to ensure that SMEs are not disadvantaged in their dealings with the Ministry of Defence, and will implement these measures in advance of the publication of the updated DIS where appropriate. Therefore, we do not anticipate that the change in publication date will fundamentally impact on our commercial relationships with industry.</p>

Against this background, the Government are also considering their response to the House of Lords Select Committee on Regulators Report on <I>UK Economic Regulators</I> ((HL Paper 189-I), including the committee's recommendations on co-ordination between regulators.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.5/1">This is an operational matter for Royal Mail. I understand that Royal Mail introduced Sunday collections in 1990 to enhance their service, but there has been very little take up from the public. Sunday postings are very low, but add a huge amount of cost to the business&mdash;up to four times more to handle these items than those collected on other days. Royal Mail have to have regard to their costs and have therefore decided to stop Sunday collections. This decision follows an application to Postcomm, the postal services regulator, and consultation with Postwatch which indicated that there was little demand for Sunday services. Sunday and Bank Holiday collections are not part of Royal Mail's universal service obligation and Postcomm has agreed to the withdrawal of the service.</p>
