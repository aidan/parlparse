	<p pid="b.23.2/1">The latest published data relate to 2003 and are shown in the table. In a flexible and dynamic labour market, such as that of the UK, it is impractical to make forecasts of this nature. The Government's plans for changes to the work schemes are outlined in <i>Controlling our Borders: Making Migration Work for Britain</i>, the five-year plan for asylum and immigration. The Government are committed to ensuring that UK employers have access to the skills and experience they need in order to maximise the economic benefits to the UK from migration. Skilled migrant workers should be enabled to fill vacancies which cannot be filled from within the UK or EU. Data for 2004 will be published in the Home Office statistical bulletin <i>Control of Immigration: Statistics United Kingdom, 2004</i> in August 2005. Further information on immigration can be found in the Command Paper Control of Immigration: Statistics United Kingdom 2003 (Cm 6363), available from the Library of the House and from the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/commandpubs1.html">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/commandpubs1.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.23.5/1">Unless action is taken to tackle climate change, there will be a growing risk of adverse effects on the environment, societies and economies.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.5/2">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in its third assessment report in 2001 that projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse effects on both environmental and socio-economic systems, but the larger the changes and rate of change in climate, the more the adverse effects predominate.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.5/3">The department funded the &quot;Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change&quot; scientific conference held at the Met Office earlier this year. The conference indicated that there is now greater clarity and reduced uncertainty about the impacts of climate change across a wide range of systems, sectors and societies. In many cases, the risks are more serious than previously thought. (Papers and presentations are available on the conference website at <a href="http://www.stabilisation2005.com">www.stabilisation2005.com</a>)</p>
	<p pid="b.23.5/4">The seriousness of the potential effects reinforces the need for urgent and ambitious action to tackle the emissions that cause climate change. For this reason, climate change is a priority for the UK's presidencies of the G8 and the EU this year. The &quot;Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change&quot; conference found that technological options for significantly reducing emissions over the long term already exist. Large reductions can be attained using a portfolio of options whose costs are likely to be smaller than previously considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.23.8/1">There is now very strong evidence that human activities are affecting the global climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2001 report noted that there was new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the past 50 years is attributable to human activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.8/2">Addressing this issue is a government priority, particularly during the presidencies of the G8 and EU during 2005. The UK hosted an international scientific conference &quot;Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change&quot; in February this year to provide an up to date scientific context to the UK's consideration of climate change in its presidency of the G8. The conference considered the risks and potential impacts of climate change associated with a range of different stabilisation levels of greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>

Both CoRWM and Defra have taken steps to widen the committee's access to scientific and expert advice.

	<p pid="b.28.8/1">Pathfinders are required to demonstrate that they have appropriate mechanisms for engaging and consulting with the community. This is reviewed by the Audit Commission as part of its scrutiny role. There are a wide variety of ways by which Pathfinders and their constituent local authorities are discharging this responsibility, including opinion surveys, formal consultations, public meetings, meetings with individuals and pressure groups, and involvement in planning and design. Community representation on Pathfinder boards is normally via elected councillors and LSP members. Projects implemented by local authorities are open to public scrutiny in the normal way, as are as projects that proceed through the planning process.</p>
