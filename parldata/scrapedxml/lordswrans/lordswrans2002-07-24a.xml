</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-24a.73.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100325" speakername="Lord Irvine of Lairg" colon=":" colnum="73"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020724/text/20724w01.htm#20724w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.73.5/1">There are two parts to the Libra project: the provision of a modern IT infrastructure and network to link the magistrates' courts with other parts of the criminal justice system and the special software for case management, accounting and other administration within the courts. Installation of the infrastructure and network is 75 per cent complete and will be completed during the first half of 2003. The specialised software has been delayed.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/2">The department has now signed a variation to the contract with Fujitsu Services (formerly known as ICL) in respect of the Libra project.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/3">Under these new arrangements, Fujitsu Services will continue to deliver the IT infrastructure and network and provide support until March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/4">However, the department has decided that Fujitsu Services will not be required to continue with the development of the specialised software for case management, accounting and other administration. Serious concerns arose last year when delays in delivery of the software and increases in their costs led Fujitsu Services to seek to renegotiate the contract. As many courts and offices had already been equipped with the IT infrastructure, a basis for renegotiation was agreed. Despite intensive negotiation however, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the specialised software at an acceptable price, which will deliver value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/5">Instead, the department will procure application services separately. Assessments show that robust, tried and tested software is now available in the marketplace which could meet requirements at a lower cost than that on offer from Fujitsu Services.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/6">The original 1998 contract was valued at &pound;183 million to run until July 2009. A variation to this was signed with Fujitsu/ICL in 2000, which was valued at &pound;319 million was to run unti 2013. This was not a real price increase as the extra cost was for the extra years and other benefits. In each case the contract with Fujitsu Services was for the delivery of both the infrastructure and the specialised software.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/7">The estimated value of the revised contract with Fujitsu Services is &pound;232 million which includes some &pound;31 million paid under the existing contract from 2000 to the end of June 2002 for the delivery and operation of the infrastructure services received by the magistrates' courts. In addition, the Government have paid Fujitsu Services &pound;6.8 million for design products produced as part of the software application development that can be reused. Apart from this amount, the financial and management risks of developing the software have been borne by the supplier.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/8">A number of studies have been carried out by external organisations to provide assurances on the way forward, including a benchmark exercise on the infrastructure costs and an assessment of the costs, timescales and market capacity to deliver the software application services.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/9">The benchmarking exercise shows that the cost of the provision of the infrastructure service in the revised contract is in line with the cost of similar services provided to organisations of similar size, structure and complexity in the private and public sectors. It is possible, but by no means certain, that a new competitive procurement could deliver the services for less cost, but the department's assessment of the costs of delays and procurement and completing the implementation of the service to all courts shows that the revised contract provides best value for money to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/10">The studies on the software application services indicate that the services can be delivered by the end of 2004&mdash;a delay of nine months on the original 1998 contract&mdash;and at a price that will be affordable and provide value for money. The department is planning on this basis. However, these services will be subject to new procurements and the House will be informed of the outcome when the procurements have been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/11">There are lessons to be learned for all parties from the project. Since the original award of contract a range of government guidelines on managing IT contracts and on PFI/PPP contracts have been issued. These have been fully utilised in the recent negotiation. Improvements introduced on Libra in the past 12 months include strengthening of the governance arrangements, better risk management, the use of external benchmarking and an external review under the gateway process. This has provided more effective controls for the negotiations and future plans. The new arrangement separates the delivery of the infrastructure from the application which is designed to better ensure the success of the overall programme and at the same time place appropriate risk with the respective providers and the department.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.3/1">The Government recently reconvened the Interdepartmental Working Group on Transsexual People to re-examine the implications of granting full legal status to transsexual people in their acquired gender, and to make recommendations to Ministers before the end of this year.

	<p pid="a.76.3/2">Reconvening the working group has been necessary as the interests of transsexual people touch on the policy responsibilities of a large number of government departments and the devolved administrations. Responses to the Court's ruling must be carefully co-ordinated.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/2">The Justices of the Peace Act 1997 (JPA) requires magistrates' courts committees (MCCs) to consult before making any decisions for reorganisation controlled by statute. There is accompanying guidance which sets out the court users that MCCs may wish to consult.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/3">Magistrates' courts committees use local knowledge to determine the scope of their consultation. However, MCCs are encouraged to consult more widely than statute requires. For example, on proposals for courthouse closures, the JPA requires MCCs to consult their paying authoirty. In practice, MCCs usually also consult magistrates, staff, MPs and professional court users. The Central Council of Magistrates' Courts Committees issued a good practice guide in December 2000 for MCCs to consider when determining courthouse closures, and this asks MCCs to consult widely. The guide is endorsed by LCD.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">The Government said in the White Paper Justice for All (CM 5563) that they intend to legislate to integrate the management of the courts delivering decentralised management and local accountability within a single courts organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2">The new arrangements will increase local accountability. At present, engagement with the local community is voluntary for both the magistrates' courts and the court service. There is no requirement for court users, the local community, or local authorities to be consulted about many key management decisions. In the new agency, however, managers of courts will be accountable to new local management boards which will include representatives drawn, for example, from the judiciary, the magistracy, local court users groups, victims support groups, local authorities and the local community.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.5/1">Under the Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 2001, the Home Secretary has been responsible since <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-07">7 January 2002</phrase> for the delivery of asylum appeal determinations to appellants who have no further rights of appeal within the Immigration Appellate Authorities (IAA). While the majority of these determinations have been served by post, some determinations have been deemed suitable for delivery in person either by a home visit or at a reporting centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/2">A pilot scheme to test the effectiveness of personal delivery procedures commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-07">7 January</phrase> in the areas covered by Croydon, East Midlands and Leeds Local Enforcement Units and more recently Eaton House (Heathrow). The primary focus of the pilot scheme has been to establish that the correct procedures are in place to ensure that determinations are delivered promptly and that asyluum seekers have access to their legal representatives and to the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/3">The Home Office has set targets for 48 hours for posting determinations and six weeks for those being served personally. This allows the Home Office, where appropriate, to serve the determinaton at a time when the appellant attends a reporting centre, in line with any reporting conditions, or by home visit. Where the Home Office is unable to deliver the determination in person within six weeks, it is posted to the appellant.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/4">The first evaluation of this pilot has now been completed and the results are as follows. Between <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-07">7 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase> the average time taken to deliver a determination in person (including those delivered at reporting centres when a person attends for their regular appointment) has been 19 days. A copy of the determination has been forwarded to the appellant's representative within a maximum of two and a half hours of personal delivery. For those appellants who were removed by <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May</phrase>, the average time between delivery of the determination and removal has been 13 days and the minimum time was one day.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/5">Failed asylum seekers who have been taken into detention or removed have been informed of their right to contact a legal representative and given reasonable opportunity to do so. Those wishing to apply for judicial review have had three working days in which to submit an application and a day in which to obtain the High Court reference number. During this time removal directions have been suspended.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/6">Two such applications for judicial review were made between <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-07">7 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May</phrase>. There have been no applications for a review (under rule 16 or 19 of the Immigration and Asylum (Procedure) Rules) by the chief adjudicator or president of the tribunal respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/7">As of <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase>, of the 76 determinations deemed suitable for personal delivery, 34 were succesfully delivered in person and 24 people have been removed from the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.5/8">The Home Office is now considering expanding the scheme in the light of the evaluation results.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-01">1 July 2001</phrase>, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency was successfully divided into QinetiQ plc, currently a wholly government-owned company, and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, which remains part of the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-06">6 March 2002</phrase>, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr Moonie) announced in another place that we had decided to sell a substantial stake in QinetiQ to a strategic partner who would help to develop the company in preparation for a future flotation on the stockmarket. Our decision followed a detailed analysis of market conditions, which led us to conclude that this approach offered best value for the taxpayer, and would meet our objectives for a successful public/private partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">Immediately following this announcement we initiated an open competition and carried out a pre-qualification process to identify potential partners. Almost 40 expressions of interest were received, and at the end of April 2002 12 organisations were selected to receive an information memorandum describing the company. Following the evaluation in late May 2002, of indicative offers from bidders, several companies were then provided with access to more detailed information on QinetiQ and invited to submit final binding bids. In order to maximise competition we do not propose to reveal how many companies were selected to participate in this stage, or their identities.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/4">We have received a number of responses within the past few days from the shortlisted bidders, and these are now being comprehensively evaluated by officials and specialist advisors. The results of the selection process are not yet available but we remain on track to identify the preferred bidder within the next few weeks, and complete the initial sale later this year.</p>

No conclusions were reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/3">During discussions of the framework convention on tobacco control, the commission along with the incoming Danish Presidency, urged member states to be flexible to allow the adoption of a strong European Union position for the next round of negotiations in Geneva in October. Some member states called for high level political input to seek to avoid adoption of a position that simply represented the lowest common denominator. The United Kingdom remains a supporter of a strong and effective convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/4">Council conclusions on patient mobility were adopted; with the Commission expected to bring forward proposals during the Danish Presidency.</p>

The Commission presented a draft directive on the safety of tissues and cells, to complement the current one on blood safety, as well as one on traditional medicines. There were also and two recommendations one on smoking prevention a tobacco control and another on the reduction of risks associated with drug dependence.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/6">Details of these and other agenda items are set out in the table which will placed in the Library. No votes were taken on any issue before the Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.6/1">Pursuant to my Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-22">22 July 2002</phrase>, Official Report, (WA20):</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/2" class="indent">We welcome the Audit Commission's report on housing benefit (HB) administration. Its emphasis on partnership and simplification is very much in tune with our current policy initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/3" class="indent">We are determined to work with local authorities to drive up standards of service, tackle fraud and error, reduce barriers to work and tackle social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/4" class="indent">In March last year we established a help team to work in partnership with local authorities to support them in improving the administration of HB. We are already seeing real improvements resulting from the team's work.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/5" class="indent">In addition, we have set up a help fund to support local authorities by providing funding for locally-led initiatives to improve the administration of HB. For the financial year 2001&ndash;02, a total of &pound;1,637,570 was awarded, which benefited over 200 authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/6" class="indent">We also want to help more authorities deliver a high standard of HB service by sharing good practice. We have now introduced a dedicated website for local authorities and have also distributed on CD a housing benefit manager's service improvement &quot;toolkit&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/7" class="indent">In April this year we published for the first time performance standards for the full range of HB administration. These standards provide authorities with a definition of what they should be delivering.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/8" class="indent">The spending review announced by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-15">15 July</phrase> includes the biggest investment in HB administration since the scheme began in 1988. Starting with &pound;40 million next year, we are investing an extra &pound;200 million over three years to help local authorities to meet the performance standards in delivery of HB.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/9" class="indent">From April 2003, all local authorities currently complying with the verification framework will receive a 50 per cent increase in their funding allocation for this work. In addition, any authority seeking to become compliant now or in the near future will also receive 50 per cent more than it otherwise would have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.6/10" class="indent">We will continue to review local authorities core administration subsidy each year and we will fund the set-up and ongoing costs of implementing the changes needed to bring in the new tax credits and the pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.5/1">No. Each bail decision is of course at the discretion of the courts and each case is considered on its own merits. The Bail Act 1976 establishes a presumption in favour of bail and then sets out exceptions to this presumption, so that the defendant need not be granted bail where he or she presents a bail risk. One of these exceptions is if the court believes the defendant would commit an offence. The Act even provides that defendants accused or convicted of non-imprisonable offences need not be granted bail if the court believes that the defendant would fail to return to custody and has a history of failing to surrender to custody in a previous grant of bail.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.5/1">Research studies have been conducted on the relative accuracy of clinical opinion (i.e. the judgments made by clinical professionals such as psychiatrists and psychologists) in the assessment of violence (including sexual offending) in relation to actuarial or statistical risk prediction tools. The evidence from these studies indicates that statistically based risk prediction tools are more accurate in their predictions than clinical judgment alone. For example, a study by Bonta, Hanson and Law in North America indicated that actuarial risk assessments might be up to three times more accurate than predictions based on only clinical judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/2">More recently there has been a move towards developing risk assessment processes which combine the use of actuarial tools and structured clinical judgment to guide the decision-making process regarding risk of serious offending.

	<p pid="a.97.5/3">The assessment process for dangerousness and severe personality disorder, currently being piloted at HM Prison Whitemoor, follows best practice by using a combination of actuarial tools and structured clinical judgment to inform the overall assessment of risk for future violent and sexual offending.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.2/2">Forecasts derived from the Office for National Statistics Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of Prisoners indicate that 124 persons per annum could fail to be treated under Clause 6 of the Bill as being at substantial risk of causing serious harm to other persons due to a severe personality disorder.

	<p pid="a.98.5/2">The police are nevertheless fully aware that road closures, particularly those on motorways, are very sensitive issues which can cause considerable inconvenience. They already keep them to an absolute minimum and, where they are necessary, do their best to reopen the road as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.2/1">The Government welcome the efforts that the police are making to try to reduce the number of police vehicle collisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">The police need to strike a balance between responding promptly to emergencies and apprehending offenders, and ensuring the safety of the public. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has ensured that measures are in place or being implemented to reduce the need for high speed pursuits and the risks when such pursuits are necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/3">There is a nationally agreed ACPO Pursuit Code of Practice and work is going forward on a national basis to implement recommendations from the 1998 Lind report on police pursuit driver training. In December 2000 ACPO launched its new police driver training course, introducing a universal standard for driving in England and Wales. The police also seek to ensure that there are effective management controls and that robust risk assessments are in place to ensure that safety is maintained at all times.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/4">Forces are progressing the use of automatic data recorders (ADR) and vehicle accident data recorders (VADR). The VADR is triggered if an impact occurs and can automatically download data referring to a number of issues, including speed, gear changes, braking and the use of blue lights. The ADR gives management information on the vehicle's performance, and in effect both devices operate on a similar basis to the &quot;black boxes&quot; on aircraft. Twelve forces in Britain have already commenced fitting these devices, and a further five forces are considering implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/5">ACPO recognise that there is still work to be done, particularly in terms of researching the reasons underlying the apparent upward trend in police vehicle collisions. The Police Complaints Authority has recently produced a report on this, making a range of helpful recommendations. Discussions have taken place with the Police Complaints Authority, and initial work has been agreed.</p>
