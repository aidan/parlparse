Our aim is both to prevent new service leavers becoming homeless and to provide an effective safety net for existing homeless ex-service personnel. Current measures to achieve this include:</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/2">enhanced housing advice and assistance to all service personnel;joint research to identify the extent of ex-service homelessness, to understand better the factors leading to it and to assess the effectiveness of remedial measures;supporting a range of initiatives by the voluntary sector, particularly through the Ex-Services Action Group on Homelessness, including funding for key workers and an advisory leaflet for homeless ex-service personnel in London;supported short-term accommodation for Service leavers at risk of homelessness; and working with the corporate, voluntary and government sectors to assist homeless ex-service personnel to return to sustained employment, through schemes such as Project Compass.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/3">Interim findings of a current study indicate that these measures are achieving considerable success, with the proportion of rough sleepers with an Armed Forces background down by around two thirdssince 2000.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-05-09a.259.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="259"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70509w0002.htm#070509105000176">
	<p pid="a.259.5/1">During the Government's extensive review and consultation on a new sentencing framework for Northern Ireland, a common theme that emerged was a lack of clarity in current sentencing. From the views expressed, it became clear that the cause of this lack of clarity was the existing automatic right of prisoners to 50 per cent remission, rather than any mitigating factors taken into account by the judiciary in considering individual cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.5/2">That is why our proposals for a new sentencing framework bring an end to automatic 50 per cent remission. Dangerous violent and sexual offenders could, if necessary, be detained indefinitely, while those committing other specified offences could be detained until the end of their prison sentence. For all other offenders, the court would set a clearly defined custodial part of the sentence, which the offender must serve in full, and a clearly defined licence period to be served under supervision in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.5/3">We will consult fully on a set of draft legislative proposals later this year.</p>

No other areas were suspended at that time, and UKAS accreditation for physical methods was reinstated in March 2002.</p>

The process of re-accreditation began in December 2004, when those sections put forward for accreditation were successful. Full accreditation was completed in April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.5/1">Analysis of historic treatment patterns suggests that, for the majority of dentists, the introduction of single-use reamers and files for endodontic treatment is likely to have a relatively small impact on overall practice expenses. Costs will vary, however, between practitioners, and the department is undertaking further work to understand better the range of potential costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.5/2">This work will enable the department to consider what advice may need to be given to primary care trusts on additional costs in 2007-08 and what proposals may need to be made in evidence to the review body on doctors' and dentists' remuneration.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.2/1">The Government are committed to introducing a national population screening programme for prostate cancer if and when screening and treatment techniques are sufficiently well developed for such a programme to be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/2">The department is supporting the development of screening technology for prostate cancer by having a comprehensive research strategy into all aspects of prostate cancer. We are, jointly with other National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) members, funding two NCRI prostate cancer research collaborative; the department is funding half the total &pound;7.4 million cost. Following a review of progress by an international expert panel, the department, Cancer Research UK and the Medical Research Council have agreed to provide a further three years' funding of &pound;3.9 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/3">The research undertaken by the collaboratives covers all aspects of prostate cancer and has already generated the groundbreaking discovery of the overactive E2F3 gene in prostate cancer tumours. This discovery not only provides the potential to identify those at risk of developing the disease but for the first time allows prediction of how aggressive the cancer will be. Research is under way to turn this into a diagnostic test so that we can identify patients whose prostate cancers are aggressive and urgently need treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/4">It is important to note that, for a screening technology to contribute to saving lives, effective treatments for the disease detected are essential. That is why the department is funding a &pound;20 million trial of treatments for prostate-specific antigen screen-detected early prostate cancer (the ProtecT trial).</p>

It is too soon to assess the impact and success of the THET project; the first annual report is due later this year.

	<p pid="a.270.2/1">While the UN has endorsed the temporary international mechanism (TIM), it does not have any role in its operation. All non-salary support to key Palestinian Authority ministries is run by the World Bank under window 1 of the TIM, following World Bank procurement guidelines. The UK monitors the procurement process on a monthly basis and has provided a procurement expert to the office of the president to ensure transparency. Humanitarian payments under window 2 of the TIM are contracted and paid for directly by the European Commission (EC) and meet UK agreed EC guidelines. The UK was closely involved in the design of the social allowance element under window 3 of the TIM, ensuring it had satisfactory checks and balances in place. This includes tracking each and every payment and conducting terrorist checks on individuals receiving payment. UK officials also conduct regular meetings with the EC to ensure its guidelines are being followed. A review of the TIM will take place this month that will include an assessment on the transparency of the TIM.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.5/1">The traffic officer service has been developed to enable the Highways Agency to take on a more proactive role in managing the strategic road network in England. The service has taken on a number of control-room and on-road functions traditionally undertaken by the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.5/2">The role of traffic officers involves: managing incidents except where there is loss of life, injury or potential criminal activity, when they will support the police at the scene; setting signs and signals, and answering emergency roadside telephones; arranging the removal of damaged or broken down/abandoned vehicles in partnership with the police and removing debris and other obstructions from the carriageway.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.5/3">Part 1 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 was the enabling legislation introducing the Highways Agency traffic officer service on the strategic road network in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.5/4">Traffic officers have the power to stop and direct traffic and pedestrians and to erect temporary traffic signs.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.5/5">Traffic officers do not have an enforcement role. This responsibility remains with the police. Both the Highways Agency and the police support this position. Traffic officers support the police where there are fatalities or suspected criminality at an incident. The traffic officers' role is to manage traffic in the vicinity of an incident, and in doing this they may liaise with the police on matters of compliance with road traffic law.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.5/2">However, whereas the original Norwegian proposal was for one mandatory traffic separation scheme of 560 nautical miles between Vard&oslash; and R&oslash;st, I understand that Norway was invited to amend its proposal to eight smaller traffic separation schemes and seven recommended routes connecting them, and that this routeing measure was formally adopted by the IMO and is due to enter into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
