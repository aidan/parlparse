Our aim is both to prevent new service leavers becoming homeless and to provide an effective safety net for existing homeless ex-service personnel. Current measures to achieve this include:</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/2">enhanced housing advice and assistance to all service personnel;joint research to identify the extent of ex-service homelessness, to understand better the factors leading to it and to assess the effectiveness of remedial measures;supporting a range of initiatives by the voluntary sector, particularly through the Ex-Services Action Group on Homelessness, including funding for key workers and an advisory leaflet for homeless ex-service personnel in London;supported short-term accommodation for Service leavers at risk of homelessness; and working with the corporate, voluntary and government sectors to assist homeless ex-service personnel to return to sustained employment, through schemes such as Project Compass.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/3">Interim findings of a current study indicate that these measures are achieving considerable success, with the proportion of rough sleepers with an Armed Forces background down by around two thirdssince 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.0/1">Improving poor people's access to effective health services is a priority for the United Kingdom. A critical aspect of implementing our 2005 and 2006 international development White Paper commitments to expand basic health services involves working with other international development partners, African Governments and civil society to ensure long-term predictable financing for the health sector to improve basic health services and ensure better health for the poor. Our support is instrumental in enabling countries to develop and implement plans for increasing their human resource capacity in health.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/2">As part of the Department for International Development's (DfID) response to tackling the health staff crisis, it awarded a five-year grant to the Tropical Health and Education Trust (THET), under its Civil Society Challenge Fund, in 2006 to help expand links between the UK National Health Service and poor countries. It is too soon to assess the impact and success of the THET project; the first annual report is due later this year. In addition, we will consider the report on effectiveness of links or twinning carried out by McKinsey for the Gates Foundation, which will useful in considering our approach to this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/3">In Somaliland, DfID has been working closely with a consortium of British organisations, which includes THET, to develop a proposal for building human resource for health capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/4">The proposal has been finalised, and DfID is now considering providing the necessary financial support to this pilot development scheme, which will also address regulatory issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.2/1">While the UN has endorsed the temporary international mechanism (TIM), it does not have any role in its operation. All non-salary support to key Palestinian Authority ministries is run by the World Bank under window 1 of the TIM, following World Bank procurement guidelines. The UK monitors the procurement process on a monthly basis and has provided a procurement expert to the office of the president to ensure transparency. Humanitarian payments under window 2 of the TIM are contracted and paid for directly by the European Commission (EC) and meet UK agreed EC guidelines. The UK was closely involved in the design of the social allowance element under window 3 of the TIM, ensuring it had satisfactory checks and balances in place. This includes tracking each and every payment and conducting terrorist checks on individuals receiving payment. UK officials also conduct regular meetings with the EC to ensure its guidelines are being followed. A review of the TIM will take place this month that will include an assessment on the transparency of the TIM.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.8/1">The Government will continue to provide base funding for the Association of Community Rail Partnerships (ACoRP) during 2007-08. It will also continue to fund community rail lines and services via franchise arrangements and grants to Network Rail. Funding for local community rail partnerships is a local responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.8/2">The Government sponsored an award in the 2006 Community Rail Awards. Since then, they have sponsored additional awards for the development and implementation of marketing plans for community rail routes, and the overall winner will be announced at the 2007 awards.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.8/3">Capital funding will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and there is no specific allocation for community railways.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.8/1">Under arrangements with our telephony supplier, the DWP has 2299 non-geographic telephone numbers in use for a variety of purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.8/2">The department delegates the administration and management of non-geographic telephone numbers to local management at operational level. The information on services linked to individual telephone numbers broken down by departmental units and its agencies is not available.</p>
