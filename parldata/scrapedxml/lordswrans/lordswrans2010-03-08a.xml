	<p pid="a.2.3/16">Figures above cover the Ministry of Justice HQ, HM Courts Service, HM Courts Service Estates and Tribunals Service in both years. The 2008/09 figures include the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and the 2007/08 figures are for its predecessor agency, HM Prison Service. Both years' figures exclude probation boards and trusts. Any expenditure incurred by headquarter functions transferred to MoJ from the Home Office are excluded up to November 2008 as expenditure is recorded on Home Office systems and can only be disaggregated at disproportionate cost. The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) has used none of the companies mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/17">Consultants are employed by the department to provide expertise for a defined period of time that is not available in-house.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/18">* The majority of payments to Accenture relate to the development of the Libra, an electronic case management system that enables courts across England and Wales to work in a standard way, using a consistent approach to manage their criminal, accounting and enforcement workload. It also provides a platform to enable further improvements and modernise money handling in magistrates' courts. Having one system has also improved information exchange between the courts and criminal justice partners such the Police, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Office of Criminal Justice Reform. This has led to a reduction in duplication of work and has enhanced services to court users, improving scheduling and monitoring of cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/19">** The payments to PriceWaterhouseCoopers include &#163;3.8 million in respect of rent and service charge payments for offices and car parks in the Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/20"><I>How we monitor contracts with these firms</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/21">In relation to engagement of external professional services, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) operates a robust &quot;business case&quot; approvals process based on Office of Government Commerce best practice principles. This process requires that a named Contract Manager be assigned by the business area concerned to each contract. Their role is to manage the day-to-day delivery and operation of the contract, for example by monitoring and ensuring the quality of all deliverables, monitoring spend against the pricing schedule and ensuring appropriate skills transfer (where applicable). The role of the Contract Manager is fully supported by the MoJ Procurement Directorate's Professional Services category management team. Professionally qualified category managers are on hand to assist with and/or manage the resolution of any contractual issues throughout the life of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/22"><I>How the department reports (1) during, and (2) at the end of, contracts to Buying Solutions</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/23">MoJ works closely with the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), including its Buying Solutions agency, to ensure compliance with procurement best practice and to achieve best value for money outcomes. There is no specific requirement for departments to report to Buying Solutions during or at the end of contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/24">(1) In accordance with OGC best practice guidance, and taking into account the value and complexity of the specific contract, Contract Managers determine and implement the extent/frequency of their internal reporting process to their key stakeholders throughout the life of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/25">(2) In relation to end of contract reporting, a key feature of the MoJ business case approvals process is a Post Contract Assessment phase. This requires that the person responsible for managing the contract (typically the Contract Manager) return a post contract assessment to the Professional Services category team within three weeks of the end of the contract. Aspects included are the extent to which key deliverables/expected benefits were met, the quality of the service, whether the contract was delivered to budget, whether and how skills transfer was achieved. A repository for the storing and analysis of post contract assessments is currently in the process of being devised and implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.3/1">The contribution that combined heat and power (CHP) will make meeting targets for the United Kingdom's greenhouse gas emission targets depends heavily on how the market responds to mechanisms such as the third phase of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/2">The level of saving is also dependent on what is used to fuel the CHP plant. The degree to which CHP is fuelled by renewable energy sources is likely to be driven by the relative attractiveness of the Renewables Obligation (for electricity output) and the Renewable Heat Incentive (for heat output). The proposals for the Renewable Heat Incentive are currently out for consultation. Published at the same time as those proposals was a paper prepared by AEA for the Government on the interaction between different incentives to support renewable energy and their effect on CHP. This presents a number of scenarios which consider the contribution of CHP to carbon emissions reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/3">The CO2 savings per annum associated with all types of CHP in 2020 in this paper are estimated to be in the range of 20 to 29MtCO2 depending on future fuel prices, cost of capital, the operation of the third phase of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the attractiveness of the investment in renewable energy.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.2/1">Applications for consent to market a genetically modified (GM) crop or food have to include an appropriate dossier of risk assessment information, including data from relevant tests or trials. The European Food Safety Authority plays a central role in evaluating the dossiers, and in the UK the environmental implications are considered by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. The independent scientists who undertake this scrutiny will draw on their knowledge of the wider scientific literature that is relevant to a given application, and further data or clarification will be requested from an applicant where a dossier is thought to be insufficient. A marketing consent will only be granted if it is clear that the GM product poses no unacceptable risks to human health, animal health and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/2">In this context of independent scrutiny of evidence, Defra and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) do not as a rule commission safety tests on specific GM crops or foods, although both commission research into generic aspects of risk assessment in this area. In addition, from 2000-2003 Defra funded a special programme of farm-scale research trials of several GM herbicide-tolerant crops, to assess the environmental implications of the novel herbicide use associated with the GM varieties. Details of Defra and FSA research are on their respective websites.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.2/1" qnum="HL2332">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether more British firms have experienced job losses than their overseas counterparts; and, if so, why.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-08a.25.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100821" speakername="Lord Young of Norwood Green" colon=":" colnum="25"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100308w0005.htm#10030843000674">
	<p pid="a.25.3/1">There is information available on the number of redundancies for the UK but not on the number of firms that have made workers redundant. Also, there is no internationally comparable information on redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/2">In the three months to December 2009, 168,000 people had become redundant in the three months before the Labour Force Survey interviews. The level was down 36,000 from the previous quarter and compares to a peak level of 302,000 in the three months to April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/3">Unemployment rates can provide some information on job losses but refer to individuals rather than firms. Unemployment rates are an aggregate measure of the proportion of individuals who are out of work but actively seeking employment. As such they refer to individuals within a country and do not therefore provide a measure of the extent to which firms in a country have made redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/4">Unemployment rates are also a proxy measure of net job losses as individuals can enter unemployment from economic inactivity, such as retirement, rather than just from employment. However a rise in the unemployment rate over a relatively short period gives an impression of the number of job losses net of recruitment in that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/5">A comparison of OECD harmonised unemployment rates is shown in Table 1. Data refer to the United Kingdom rather than Britain.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.3/26">Table 1 suggests that the UK has experienced a rise in its unemployment rate over the past quarter of similar but slightly lower magnitude than many other developed nations. Similarly the change in the unemployment rate over the past year is in line with the OECD and EU averages. Over the past two years the UK has had a rise in its unemployment rate lower than that for OECD countries on average and of the same magnitude as the EU average.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/27">The reasons for differences in the changes in unemployment rates during the global recession between countries are likely to be numerous. These include but are not limited to: the national unemployment rate before recession; the change in Gross Domestic Product; the efficacy of the welfare system; wage and price flexibility; the industrial composition of the economy; and the size of fiscal stimulus including targeted labour market policies. A combination of these and other factors has contributed to the changes in unemployment rates in Table 1. However the relative contribution of each is uncertain.</p>
