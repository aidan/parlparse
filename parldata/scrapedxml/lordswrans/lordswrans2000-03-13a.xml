We are also planning to develop a consultancy service for schools to help them address the needs of children from a minority ethnic background.

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">The UK does not have diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) so is unable to make effective representations to the FRY authorities on behalf of the Albanian prisoners (believed to be some 1,540) held in Serbia. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), as an impartial body, has access to the Kosovar prisoners. Through its contacts with the authorities, the ICRC is making strenuous efforts to ensure that those facing prosecution benefit from the legal safeguards laid down in international law. We strongly support their important role in this matter. The UN representative in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, has frequently made public calls for the release of the Albanian prisoners in Serbia.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.2/1">Under the original criminal injuries compensation scheme established in August 1964, compensation was assessed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB) on the basis of common law damages.

Any residual old scheme cases still outstanding at that time will be transferred for resolution by legally qualified members of CICAP in accordance with the transitional provisions of the 1996 scheme. Present estimates are that around 6,000 cases will be transferred. The panel will be set the target of clearing them within two years. The panel is being strengthened considerably to ensure that it can cope with this additional workload without prejudicing its capacity to deal with appeals made under the 1996 scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.5/1">A total of 990 persons were detained in immigration detention centres and prison establishments in the United Kingdom solely under Immigration Act powers on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-31">31 January 2000</phrase>. Of this total, 515 persons were held in prison establishments. This figure is not recorded in such a way as to identify those who were held pending deportation or those in prisons who had applied for asylum at some point. It may be helpful to know that a snapshot report showing the number of persons recorded as being held in detention in the United Kingdom, solely under Immigration Act powers, by place of detention, is placed in the House of Lords Library each month.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.5/2">From administrative data, it has been estimated that approximately 15,000 persons were detained for the first time under Immigration Act powers during 1999. This figure covers persons held in immigration detention centres, prisons and police cells and, in addition to persons detained solely under Immigration Act powers, includes persons detained under dual immigration and police powers. The estimate may under-record the numbers held in police cells and prisons, particularly those in the north of England. The figure is not intended to be a measure of all persons who spent time in detention during the year, as it counts only the first time a person enters detention and therefore does not include persons held during 1999 who were initially detained in an earlier year. The figure covers both those persons who have applied for asylum at some stage and those who have never applied for asylum, many of whom will have been detained for only a very short period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.5/3">The latest reliable snapshot of detained asylum seekers relates to those asylum applicants detained in immigration detention centres, prison establishments and police cells solely under Immigration Act powers as at <phrase class="date" code="1998-12-30">30 December 1998</phrase> for port applicants and <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-04">4 January 1999</phrase> for in-country applicants. On those dates, 741 such persons were recorded. The location of those detainees is not recorded reliably and it is not therefore possible to state how many were held in prisons. Data recording problems mean that an updated figure is not currently available.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.8/1">The number of cases with reduced benefit directions that went to appeal in the period April 1999 to February this year was 373. Of these, 99 were successful. The underlying purpose of a reduced benefit direction is to encourage parents with care to apply for child support, unless they have good cause for failing to do so. Delaying the imposition of this penalty until the case had been heard by an appeal tribunal would reduce this incentive effect. It is likely that the result would be substantially more parents with care seeking to avoid child support action, with a consequent increase in levels of child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.8/2">More than 80 per cent of parents with care who applied for income support in the last year were happy to co-operate with the Child Support Agency.

	<p pid="a.191.2/1">Since the Bullhouse Minewater Treatment Plant came into operation in September 1998 there have been significant improvements in the downstream chemical and biological quality of the River Don, and in the number of fish in the river. Around the time the plant was commissioned, a number of ochre-coloured seepages appeared in the Cranberry Holes Dyke, most likely caused by groundwater movements resulting from the presence of the minewater treatment lagoon. The agency is monitoring these seepages and, if necessary, the dyke will be assessed for treatment. The agency does not currently consider the seepage a significant threat to fish in the River Don.</p>
