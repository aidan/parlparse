	<p pid="a.168.2/1">Enlargement presents a substantial challenge for the EU. We welcome debate on how the institutions can remain effective after enlargement. That is why we welcome this year's IGC and have a positive agenda for reform. The longer-term issues in Joschka Fischer's speech are not for this IGC, as he makes very clear. They are about how a Union of 30 or more member states might function.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/2">On the substance of his ideas, he makes it clear that he is speaking in a personal capacity, not as a Foreign Minister, nor as a representative of the German Government. We welcome his contribution to the debate. Our own views are set out in the White Paper IGC: Reform for Enlargement.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.5/1">We have recently issued, as an exception to the national arms embargo on Iran, an export licence for the export of night vision equipment for the use of Iranian drug enforcement personnel. This equipment has been procured by a private company on behalf of the UN Drugs Control Programme (UNDCP) as a contribution to the UNDCP in Iran. These goods require a UK export licence as they are transiting the UK en route to Iran.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.2/1">The conflict in Sri Lanka, which has escalated recently, has been ongoing for many years. DFID has been providing assistance to non-governmental and international organisations which provide relief and rehabilitation directly to those affected. In 1999-2000 almost &pound;3.5 million was channelled through Save the Children, OXFAM, UNICEF, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Marie Stopes International. We expect to provide at least a similar amount this year.</p>

The civil law convention is an innovative and important international legal instrument which will enable victims of corruption to obtain appropriate remedies in the civil courts of all states which ratify the convention. The United Kingdom is not in a position to ratify the convention at present because the requirements of the convention with regard to the rules of limitation for civil proceedings go further than is provided for by current UK law. However, the Law Commission is currently considering the rules relating to limitation of actions and the Government will review this issue as soon as the Law Commission's report is available.</p>

London Transport's Unit for Disabled Passengers provides a comprehensive advice and information service for disabled people and extensive customer information activity, including station and train announcements, posters, radio bulletins and Ceefax. This will ensure that customers are aware of the situation and may consider alternative travel options as necessary.

	<p pid="a.180.0/1">The Government are issuing a consultation paper on proposed changes to the way cattle health testing for enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) and brucellosis is carried out in England. This is part of a GB wide initiative and is a direct result of our gaining an &quot;officially EBL free&quot; region status within the EU and the continued recognition of GB status as an &quot;officially brucellosis free&quot; region within the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/2">It is proposed to amend the EBL order to take account of new reduced test frequencies. For dairy cattle these would reduce milk testing from three times a year to twice in every fifth year. For beef suckler herds these would reduce blood testing from once every second year to once every fourth year. The proposed reductions are in line with veterinary advice. We aim to have the new arrangements introduced by September this year and fully effective by April next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/3">No changes are currently proposed for brucellosis testing. Test frequencies for brucellosis are currently subject to review but results are not expected before August. GB has had low or no incidence of brucellosis since 1993.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/4">Since these proposals would require changes to the EBL order we are also proposing to simplify publication of the list of laboratories approved to do milk testing and clarify the use of laboratory approval. The Government propose that these changes are also carried out into a remade brucellosis order and that both new orders take full account of devolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/5">The Government are pleased that in this consultation we are able to recommend reducing monitoring for EBL in England now that we have &quot;officially EBL free region&quot; status for GB. This reduces costs and burdens for both industry and the public purse and is in line with EU requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.3/1">The report of the preliminary findings of the study has been placed in the Library of the House and will be made available on the ministry website. The government inspection programme being undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will be focused on those imported seed species which are identifed as most likely to be affected. Further studies are in hand.</p>
