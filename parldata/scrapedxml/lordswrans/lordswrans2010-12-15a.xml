On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-07">7 December</phrase> we published proposals in the Green Paper, <I>Breaking the Cycle: </I><I>E</I><I>ffective </I><I>P</I><I>unishment, </I><I>R</I><I>ehabilitation and </I><I>S</I><I>entencing of </I><I>O</I><I>ffenders</I>, for public consultation. These proposals included the reform of sentences of imprisonment for public protection (IPPs) which are specifically targeted at violent and sexual offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.6/2">We propose to restrict these sentences to those who merit a minimum term of at least five years in prison. Offenders will still have to undergo a risk assessment before being considered for release, and the Parole Board will consider whether each individual case is suitable for release on licence. We are, however, proposing to make amendments to the risk test used by the Parole Board, so that the Parole Board will need to satisfy itself that the offender presents a risk which cannot be managed in the community. These proposals have been published on the Ministry of Justice website at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk">www.justice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.6/3">Violent and sexual offenders who do not meet the new threshold will be able to receive a long determinate sentence or in appropriate cases an extended sentence (where the offender remains under supervision for an extended period after release). Additionally, there are court orders available to manage the risk of serious sexual and violent offenders whose risk was not considered high enough at the time of conviction for an indefinite sentence, but who appear to present a risk at the end of their sentence.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.6/1">The Government have restored the earnings link for the basic state pension with a triple guarantee that the basic state pension will increase by the highest of the growth in average earnings, prices (as measured by the consumer prices index) or 2.5 per cent. We estimate this will mean that the average person reaching state pension age in 2011 will receive an additional &#163;15,000 in basic state pension over their retirement than they would have done under the old prices link.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.6/2">This commitment will benefit both existing and future pensioners by providing a more generous state pension giving a solid financial foundation from the state which is essential as part of the pensions system.</p>

We will encourage companies to offer high-quality pensions to all employees and from October 2012, all employers will be required to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme. We expect this radically to increase the number of people saving into a pension and lead to between 4 million and 8 million people newly saving or saving more in all forms of workplace pension schemes.</p>

This could include the &#163;1.4 billion regional growth fund and &#163;100 million empty homes funding to help bring empty homes back into use, as well as new incentive schemes such as the &#163;1 billion new homes bonus.

	<p pid="a.201.3/1">It is unlikely that the secure broadband services for the emergency services in the UK will use a spectrum allocation below 1 GHz due to the lack of available spectrum within that range. Even if spectrum could be freed for this purpose, the technical benefits would be minimal. The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) has explored with the Ministry of Defence future communications capabilities around the 400 MHz level (the existing Tetra range).</p>
