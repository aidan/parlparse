	<p pid="a.77.0/1">Police forces record crimes in accordance with the law and the provisions set out in the Home Office Counting Rules for Recorded Crime (HOCR). The relevant legislation (the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 as added to by the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001) created a single offence of racial or religious aggravation. Police recorded crime statistics currently include racially and religiously aggravated offences as set out in law. The Home Office plans to require forces to submit more detailed information on these and other notifiable offences from April 2011 which will provide additional data to show the split between the racial and religious elements.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/2">Police data on racially or religiously aggravated offences have been published in the <I>Race and the Criminal Justice System</I> report since 2002 and tables showing the figures for individual police force areas have been published since 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/3">Once new proposals by the Home Office are in place, The Ministry of Justice's chief statistician will be responsible for any decision concerning the inclusion of these new data in subsequent reports dependent on their quality.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/1">In July the Government of Cuba announced that they would release 52 political prisoners-originally detained in 2003-within three to four months. To date, 39 have been released and have travelled to Spain. The Cuban Catholic Church announced in October that eight other political prisoners (ie not part of the original 52) would also be released-and our embassy in Havana has been told that others will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/2">The UK, with our EU partners, will continue to monitor the situation closely-and our embassy in Havana will continue to discuss future releases with the Cuban Government and the Cuban Catholic Church. We hope that the Cuban Government will fulfil their commitment to release the remaining 13 (ie from the original 52) within their self-imposed deadline of early November. My honourable friend Jeremy Browne, Minister for Latin America, welcomed the announcement, and called on Cuba to allow all freed prisoners to remain in Cuba if they wish. We will continue to support this process and hope that it will lead to further human rights progress in Cuba including the release of all political prisoners in the country.</p>

We continue to call on Israel to freeze settlement activity. Settlements are illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace. We have made our views clear to the Government of Israel and will continue to discuss these issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">When police find children in cannabis farms they should follow Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) guidance which advises that such children should be assessed on a case by case basis to ascertain whether they may have been trafficked. Where circumstances give rise to reasonable suspicion that they are being exploited or abused, a child welfare response should be taken. No decision to progress charges against these children should be made until all relevant assessments have been undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">Published guidance by the Crown Prosecution Service requires prosecutors to consider not prosecuting trafficked victims in circumstances where they committed the offence under duress, or where they were coerced into committing the offence as a direct consequence of their trafficking situation. However, there must be consideration of the extent to which the victim was compelled to undertake the unlawful activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/3">Where the information concerning coercion is less certain, further details should be sought from the police and youth offender teams, so that the public interest in continuing a prosecution can be considered carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/4">Where the risks of harm to a trafficked child are serious, the accommodation for the child should minimise the risks of traffickers being able to re-involve the child in exploitative activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/5">Essential safeguards should be observed in all settings in which looked after children are placed. These include carers understanding the safeguarding needs of each child; be appropriately trained and supervised; be alert to children's vulnerabilities and risks of harm and know how to implement safeguarding procedures.</p>
