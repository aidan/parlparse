A higher public profile for the service through the wearing of uniform in public should have a positive effect on defence in the public eye. It is therefore incumbent upon all those wearing uniform whether collecting for charity or undertaking other activities to be aware that it is their duty not to bring the service into disrepute as a result of their demeanour or actions, or otherwise to impact adversely on the efficiency or reputation of the Armed Forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.9/1">My Lords, the reports made recommendations about the treatment of children in detention. This Government have already stated that they are committed to ending the detention of children for immigration purposes. My honourable friend, the Minister of State for Immigration, is leading a review to find a way forward which protects the welfare of children, while ensuring the removal of those who have no right to be in the UK. He will be setting out the way forward in the coming weeks.</p>

Information is not held on whether these clinics are owned or leased by MSI and the conditions of approval no longer cover numbers of approved beds in each clinic. The Secretary of State's approval does not specify whether medical, surgical or late terminations can be performed. Some clinics may however, under their conditions of registration from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), be only permitted to perform medical termination of pregnancy up to nine weeks' gestation. The CQC also assesses whether clinics are able to perform termination of pregnancy at gestations of 20 weeks and over. It is our understanding that three clinics currently undertake procedures at these gestations.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.5/1">The Marriage Act 1949 requires a record of marriage to be entered in a register book. The details to be entered in the register book are prescribed in regulations. The current regulations provide for the details of the fathers of the bride and groom to be entered, but not for details of the mothers.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/2">The requirement to include the fathers' details is historic. We would accept that the provision does not meet present-day needs; however, to amend the present situation would require legislative change.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/3">In addition, any change in the format of marriage registers would necessitate the closure of those currently in use and the issue of new marriage registers, not only to registrars but also to the clergy of the Church of England and Church in Wales, to authorised persons of other religious buildings registered for marriages, registering officers of the Society of Friends and secretaries of synagogues. This is an exercise that would amount to some 55,000 registers being replaced at an estimated cost of &#163;1.5 million, expenditure not justified in current circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">The coalition's programme for government includes proposals for future referendums and the introduction of a requirement for future referendums to be held in certain specified circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/2">We will bring forward legislation providing for a referendum on the alternative vote system for future elections to the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/3">Local people will be given the power to hold local referendums on any local issues to instigate change for the better in their local areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/4">To further our aim of increasing democratic and parliamentary control, scrutiny and accountability over EU decision-making, any proposed future treaty that transfers competences or areas of power will be subject to a referendum. In addition, the use of any major ratchet clause which amounted to the transfer of an area of power to the EU will also be subject to a referendum. However, we have agreed that there should be no further transfer of sovereignty or powers from the UK to the European Union over the course of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/5">The Government will set out further details of how they intend to take forward these commitments in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/6">There are also plans for a referendum in Wales on the powers of the National Assembly of Wales.</p>

Other factors, including some UN resolutions, may also be relevant.</p>
