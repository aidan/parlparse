	<p pid="d.193.8/1">From 2005, in keeping with national targets for ambulance response, the target response rates for ambulances attending potential patients in Northern Ireland are as follows:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="d.193.8/10">NIAS reports to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) on levels of activity and performance against that activity for each board area and for Northern Ireland as a whole. It also reports to each of the boards. NIAS uses its computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system to report on the different categories of calls.</p>

	<p pid="d.196.6/1">The British Government are not currently funding any programmes specifically focused on providing family planning services to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, family planning receives UK funding as part of our broader financing for the health sector. This is mostly channelled through NGO or UN programmes providing support at the level of health zones or hospitals, under either development or humanitarian budget lines. All implementing partners work as closely as possible with local health authorities and, as far as feasible under the circumstances, implement the Government's basic minimum package of services for each health facility. This package includes family planning services as part of the care available for mothers and infants.</p>
	<p pid="d.196.6/2">The Department for International Development is also currently co-funding a comprehensive demographic and health survey in the DRC, which will provide up-to-date information on the availability, demand for and uptake of family planning services throughout the country.

This policy facilitates the provision of partially self-contained accommodation for elderly or dependent relatives as an alternative to a separate house in the countryside.

The Smithsonian is being guided in its research on possible festival content by a broadly constituted, Northern Ireland-based curatorial group, made up of representatives from more than 35 different cultural and arts organisations from the public and voluntary sector. To date, more than 400 recommendations have been made to the Smithsonian by the curatorial group and others. Detailed research into festival content, based on their suggestions, is presently under way. No one has yet been formally invited to participate. An announcement on participants is expected in February 2007.

	<p pid="d.205.2/1">Causes of death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) but the current version does not have a specific code for MRSA. The latest data available are for the registration year 2005. MRSA was mentioned on 69 death certificates registered during 2005, of which 17 recorded MRSA as the primary cause of death.</p>
	<p pid="d.205.2/2">The department's <I>Changing the Culture</I> action plan on the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections was published in March 2006. It requires trusts to hold a hand hygiene campaign this winter and produce an annual infection reduction plan.</p>
	<p pid="d.205.2/3">Recent steps taken to combat healthcare-associated infections in Northern Ireland have included the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety's Ward Sisters Charter, launched in October 2006. Under the charter, and among its 10 commitments, ward sisters have the authority to create a cleanliness culture within their ward environment, and they will also encourage patients and visitors to monitor and report on standards of cleanliness.</p>

	<p pid="d.205.5/1">In making its recommendations, the review group considered the need to provide cost-effective pathology services that would meet anticipated demands. The group examined data concerning income, expenditure and activity within pathology services, and value for money was one of the criteria against which the group evaluated its proposals for the configuration of services. The report recognises that delivery of the group's vision for pathology services will require changes in the way the service uses existing resources.</p>
	<p pid="d.205.5/2">The report's recommendations, which aim to ensure the sustainability of high-quality laboratory services across Northern Ireland, are currently the subject of a public consultation, which runs until <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-28">28 February 2007</phrase>. Once the policy direction has been finalised, taking into account the responses to the consultation, a detailed implementation plan will be developed.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-12-13d.214.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="214"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61213w0005.htm#061213103000433">
	<p pid="d.214.5/1">Digital switchover does not require the disposal of any equipment. However, as the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) acknowledges, there may be a temporary acceleration in the disposal of some secondary television sets that people choose not to adapt after switchover. The RIA is available at: <a href="http://www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk/pdf_documents/consultations/ria_timingof_ds2.pdf">www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk/pdf_documents/consultations/ria_timingof_ds2.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.214.5/2">In the light of this, Defra and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) jointly commissioned the market transformation programme to establish and quantify any changes in patterns of disposal of consumer equipment, including televisions, due to digital switchover. The report is expected to be published in early 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.214.5/3">Television sets disposed of following digital switchover will be subject to regulations implementing the EU waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive. It aims to prevent electronic and electrical waste and promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery in order to reduce the amount of such waste going to landfill. The directive requires producers, or those acting on their behalf, to set up systems for treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE.</p>
	<p pid="d.214.5/4">Transposition of the majority of the WEEE directive is the responsibility of the DTI. However, Defra will be making regulations amending the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 to transpose the treatment-permitting requirements of Article 6 of the directive. Defra also intends to introduce exemptions from the need to obtain a waste management licence, including for those storing WEEE prior to its recovery and those repairing WEEE to promote its reuse. These regulations will help to ensure that less WEEE ends up in landfill and more of it is either reused or recycled in an environmentally sound manner.</p>
	<p pid="d.214.5/5">The DTI has completed its consultation on the draft regulations and accompanying guidance, and aims for them to come into force in early January 2007, with producer responsibility coming into force in July. The Defra regulations will be made shortly thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="d.216.0/1">The announcement made on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">Wednesday 25 October 2006</phrase> referred to the aim identified in the Russell commission report on youth action and engagement, published in March 2005, of involving 1 million more young people in volunteering within the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="d.216.0/2">The new independent youth-led charity V, which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-08">Monday 8 May 2006</phrase>, is working towards this aim. V has the lead in delivering a step change in the quality, quantity and diversity of volunteering opportunities available to young people aged 16 to 25 in England. More than 60,000 volunteering opportunities have been created since the charity's launch. Funding of &pound;100 million has been made available to implement the Russell commission recommendations, of which &pound;50 million is available through a match-funding scheme. Match-funding pledges from private sector funding partners has reached over &pound;17 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.216.0/3">Any necessary Criminal Records Bureau checks, which are free for most volunteers, will be carried out by the providers of the volunteering opportunities as required by current rules and regulations.</p>
