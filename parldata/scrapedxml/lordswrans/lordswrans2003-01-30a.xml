	<p pid="a.173.2/1">In the statement made by my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary (Mr Hoon) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-07">7 January</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 23&ndash;5) in another place we informed the House that we had made an order under Section 54(1) of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to enable the call-out of reservists for possible operations against Iraq. We explained that the overall scale of mobilisation would depend upon the continuing evolution of our contingency planning, that we envisaged initially sending out sufficient call-out notices to secure around 1,500 reservists, and that we would issue further notices as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/2">That process of calling out and mobilising reservists is under way. By <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>, the services had issued 2,063 notices. As was explained in the Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-07">7 January</phrase>, the number of notices issued has to be significantly larger than the number of reservists required to allow for the proportion who are likely to be genuinely unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/3">Further contingency planning has now clarified the likely size and shape of our additional requirements, in particular in the light of the decision we reached recently on the size and composition of land forces that we plan to deploy, which was described in the Statement made by my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary (Mr Hoon) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 34&ndash;5) in another place. Our latest assessment is that our overall requirement for reservists is likely to be up to 6,000, including those currently in the process of mobilisation. We will now issue further call-out notices over the coming weeks to enable us to meet this requirement. The size of the requirement will remain under review as our planning continues.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.2/1">The Government are aware of the emergence of glyphosate resistant weeds resulting from the continuous use of this herbicide on some genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMht) soya crops in Amercia. Over the past 30 years or more (before the advent of GM crop cultivation), continual use of herbicides has imposed selection pressure for increased resistance within weed species that were formally susceptible. There are several characteristics of herbicides and their use that are thought to contribute to a high risk for selection of resistance in weeds. Glyphosate meets these criteria and is one of the herbicides to which resistant weeds have evolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">An international survey of herbicide resistant weeds identified Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) as the main glyphosate resistant weed in America (in Delaware, Tennessee, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey and Ohio). The only other glyphosate resistance species identified in this survey was in California&mdash;rigid ryegrass (Lolium rigidum&mdash;please refer to <a href="http://www.weedscience.org/in.asp">http://www.weedscience.org/in.asp</a>). As Horseweed and rye grass are not sexually compatible with soya (Glycine max), glyphosate resistance was not acquired through the transfer of genes from the herbicide resistant soya.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/3">Part of the UK's pesticide regulatory regime requires pesticide approval holders to address the risk of resistance and, if applicable, produce a management strategy to avoid or manage resistance. This applies equally to GMht and conventional crops alike. In addition, under the GMO safety legislation (Directive 2001/18/EU), management strategies applied to GM crops are considered as part of a detailed risk assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.5/1">The definition of cruelty adopted by the Scott Henderson inquiry into cruelty to wild animals was the causing of unnecessary suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/2">The report recommended that all wild animals should be brought within the provisions of the Protection of Animals Acts, but:</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/3">&quot;nothing in the Act should apply to the commission or omission of any act in the course of hunting, pursuit, capture, destruction or attempted destruction of any wild animal unless such hunting etc., was accompanied by the infliction of unnecessary suffering&quot; (paragraph 419).</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/4">The Government agree with the definition of cruelty contained in the Scott Henderson report, which is well established in law. The key purpose of the Hunting Bill is to prevent the unnecessary suffering&mdash;that is, the cruelty&mdash;associated with hunting with dogs. The Bill recognises the need to deal with pests and to protect livestock and crops but would permit hunting for this purpose only where there is no other method reasonably available that would cause less suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/5">The Government set up their own inquiry, the Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs in England and Wales (the Burns report). The Burns report and related documents were published in 2000. My right honourable friend the Minister for Rural Affairs also undertook a wide-ranging consultation exercise which has been praised by both sides of the debate as uniquely open, transparent and fair, My right honourable friend met a large range of organisations and individuals to listen to their views. He also undertook three days of public hearings in Portcullis House in September. This work has informed the drafting of the Hunting Bill, published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-03">3 December 2002</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.5/2">The main health business of this Council related to tobacco. The Council reached qualified majority on a first reading deal on the Tobacco Advertising Directive. My right honourable friend emphasised that the UK supports European Union legislation on tobacco advertising, having strong domestic legislation in place. He made clear the Government's determination to ensure that the legal victories secured by the tobacco companies over previous European legislation would not be repeated with this directive. He therefore voted against the directive because he did not think that the drafting of some provisions was good enough or that it went as far as it could in some areas (for example, by not covering cigarette papers).</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/3">A Council recommendation on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to improve tobacco control was adopted by a qualified majority, with support from the UK. The Commission also gave an update on the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/4">Member states set out their positions on the pharmaceuticals reviews, with a discussion on three key outstanding issues in the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) Regulation. There was no vote on this item. On scope, the UK was among several member states who spoke out against extension of the centralised procedure for human medicines and in favour of a choice for companies. Others supported the Commission. Most felt that member states should appoint at least one member to the management board. Many were willing to consider also accepting representatives of patient groups or the European Parliament. A majority of member states and the Commission were able to accept the Presidency compromise of a single renewal of an authorisation after five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/5">Council adopted a recommendation on the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence. Council conclusions on action against obesity were adopted unanimously. The UK voted in favour of both of these items.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/6">The Presidency presented a progress report on negotiations on a directive setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human cells and tissues. The Commission said that it would look carefully at the changes in scope the Council was proposing in relation to the medicinal products and medical devices directives.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/7">The Commission updated the Council on the high level process of reflection on patient mobility and health care development and on the programme of co-operation on bioterrorism and health security. The Commission will be tabling a proposal to set up a network centre for disease control in May 2003, to be set up in 2005. The aim is to enhance the EU capacity to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, working closely with member states' own institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/8">The Commission reported that it had established a working group to consider the quality of information on Internet sites in the health sector. The group, consisting of representatives from government, non-government organisations and industry, has reported and agreed actions, including measures on transparency, privacy and accountability. The Commission will monitor work through the E-Europe 2005 Action Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/9">Items under any other business included an information paper from Ireland on post-polio syndrome. There was also a brief discussion on the follow-up to the G10 initiative on the pharmaceutical industry. A Commission communication was under preparation and should issue in May 2003. Italy announced it would have an informal ministerial meeting on this during its Presidency. Finally, there was a presentation from Belgium on its candidate for the director-generalship of the WHO, Peter Piot.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/10">The consumer part of the Council met with minimal discussion over a short agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/11">The Council adopted a resolution on Community consumer policy strategy 2002&ndash;06 without debate, endorsing the aims and objectives of the Commission's strategy as published in May 2002, namely a high common level of consumer protection, effective enforcement and the involvement of consumer organisations. The UK voted in favour, as did all other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/12">The Council and the Commission endorsed the Presidency's conclusions on a joint Commission-UK seminar held in November on using consumer statistics to inform and prioritise consumer policy. In accordance with the conclusions, the Commission will take forward technical work on definitions and the comparability of consumer statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/13">As an information point only, the Council took note of a Commission presentation on the preliminary results of the European Extra-Judicial Network (EEJ-Net), the EU network of clearing houses designed to facilitate and resolve cross-border, out-of-court consumer disputes.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.5/14">Finally, Greece informed the Council that it wanted to contribute to the consumer agenda during its forthcoming Presidency by strengthening its involvement in the internal market. It highlighted in particular a seminar on the Commission's Green Paper on consumer protection to be held with the Commission and Sweden on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-24">24 February 2003</phrase> and a ministerial conference on unfair trading to be held on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-07">7 May 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.0/1">I agree with the noble Lord that the interests of children need to be promoted across government. This is why the Children and Young People's Unit (CYPU) was set up, with a remit to ensure that issues concerning children and young people are represented and taken into consideration in government policy and to influence policy in the interest of children and young people. This role is further endorsed by the 2002 Spending Review settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">Children's interests are also co-ordinated and promoted through the Minister for Young People and the Cabinet Committee on Children and Young People's Services, which comprises Secretaries of State from 11 government departments with a key interest in policies and services for children and young people. The Government are currently exploring the pros and cons of establishing a children's commissioner.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.6/1">In response to concerns from users of the Parliamentary Network about the amount of unwanted and, in some cases, obscene e-mail being received, and with the agreement of the Information Committees of both Houses, the Parliamentary Communications Directorate (PCD) introduced a new service on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January</phrase> to block incoming e-mails from non-parliamentary addresses which contain inappropriate or offensive text. PCD recognises that, on occasion, correspondents may legitimately use strong language, and incoming e-mails that contain only a few mild expletives will be unaffected. Only those e-mails that contain a high proportion of the most offensive obscenities are blocked automatically. Futhermore, in order to prevent genuine e-mails from being lost, the sender of any e-mail that is blocked will be notified and invited to contact the intended recipient to arrange for the e-mail to be released.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.6/2">The service does not affect e-mails sent from addresses within the Parliamentary Network either to external or other internal addresses or e-mails sent by remote users of the Network via Citrix. The arrangements for incoming e-mails apply equally to Members and staff of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.2/1">We are pleased to be able to place in the Library a copy of the Police Complaints Authority's (PCA) Review of Shootings by Police in England and Wales between 1998 and 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/2">We commissioned this review under Section 79(1) of the Police Act 1996, which allows the Home Secretary to call for a report from the PCA on issues of concern. We announced the terms of reference to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-20">20 November 2001</phrase>. They were:</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/3">&quot;The review will consider what lessons can be learnt from the investigations into police shootings which have resulted in death or injury since January 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/4">In particular the review will look at:</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/5" class="indent">The planning, control and conduct of operations;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/6">The way in which the concerns of the bereaved families were addressed, and how they were kept informed of the progress of the investigation; and</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/7" class="indent">The training and skill needs of the police officers involved in such operations, particularly at command level.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/8">We are very grateful to the PCA, and in particular to Mr Alan Bailey, Dr David Best and the two deputy chairs for the hard work and expertise they have brought to this report.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/9">We welcome the report and its positive findings. It covers a very difficult and demanding area of police work, where great professionalism is needed. Rightly, it gives credit to police forces for the small number of shots discharged by police officers in armed responses and praises much policing practice. The overall picture is very positive and it gives clear guidance on how best to manage firearms operations to minimise threat to life.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/10">We commissioned the report in order to make sure that the lessons from each individual incident could be learned and shared by all forces. While there is always understandable public concern when someone who is shot turns out to be unarmed, we must recognise that armed police face enormously difficult decisions. Sometimes these decisions have tragic consequences, and it is nonetheless essential to ensure that operational procedures, training and support to officers minimises the number of avoidable deaths and injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/11">Our police officers are not routinely armed. The use of firearms is a rare last resort, considered only where there is a serious risk to public or police safety. When it is necessary for police officers to deploy firearms, it is vital that they are properly equipped and expertly trained to respond effectively to the serious situations they have to face. Police use of firearms is subject to stringent guidelines from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), which govern training, control and the conduct of operations. This is reflected in their excellent record against international standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/12">The PCA report makes a number of recommendations to further improve the management of firearms incidents. Many of these are already under way and we have published an action plan today, which we will also place in the Library, which sets out how we will work with the police service and other agencies to build on existing good work and take forward the recommendations in the report. We are determined to build on the good practice already in place by working closely with the police and others, including mental health professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/13">It is essential that our police have effective less lethal alternatives available to them. The search for suitable less lethal options is complex and requires in-depth consideration of a range of issues. After rigorous medical and operational trials, and at ACPO's request, we have agreed that pilots on taser use will go ahead. If any less lethal options are ultimately recommended to police these must provide real tactical solutions to disorder and violence.</p>
