	<p pid="a.176.3/3">In September, the Government introduced the One-in, One-out rule for new regulation so a new regulatory burden cannot be introduced without identifying another to be removed first. In December, we introduced a new approach to transposing EU directives, to end gold-plating and ensure they are not transposed in such a way that they disadvantage UK businesses relative to their EU competitors. In March we introduced sunset clauses in new regulations which impose a cost on businesses, to ensure they remain relevant and are fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.3/4">However, we recognise that badly designed regulation and red tape can have a particularly damaging effect on our smallest businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.3/5">In <I>T</I><I>he Plan for Growth</I>, published alongside the Budget 2011, as part of a package of measures to improve the UK's regulatory environment, the Government announced that micro-businesses (those with fewer than 10 employees) and start-ups would be exempt from all new domestic regulation for three years. We also decided not to extend the right to request time to train to SMEs, potentially saving SMEs approximately &#163;350 million and not to bring forward the dual discrimination provision, saving business up to &#163;3 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.3/6">Last month, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister launched the Red Tape Challenge website (<a href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk">www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>), which asks the public and businesses to identify regulations that need to be amended or removed. Every few weeks regulations affecting one specific sector or industry will be published on the website. There is also the opportunity to comment on cross-cutting areas of regulation, such as employment law.</p>

The Government have become aware of a very small number of applications to the county court in recent years concerning tin bounding, which is a very specific aspect of stannary law.

In addition, we have asked UCAS and higher education institutions to provide new data at course level showing the type and subjects of the qualifications held by previously successful applicants.

We have asked HEFCE to consult, immediately, on how to implement these approaches and to monitor the impact of the approach and its effect on supply and demand.

	<p pid="a.184.2/1">We expect to introduce the benefit cap in 2013. It will mean that people on benefit will face choices about housing costs similar to those faced by people in work. But it will not necessarily mean that they will need to move from their home. Even within the limits of this cap, households will still be able to receive significant amounts of financial assistance from state welfare payments and if a member of the household moves into work and becomes eligible for working tax credit they will be exempt from the impacts of the cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/2">There is a range of help local authorities can offer to households at risk of becoming homeless including the provision of discretionary housing payments. We have already made an additional &#163;190 million available over the spending review period for this purpose as a result of the changes we have made to housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/3">The Government published their impact assessment of the benefit cap in February alongside the introduction of the Welfare Reform Bill. This made clear that it is not possible to estimate the number of additional homelessness applications that might arise as a consequence of the overall benefit cap because this would have to be based on behavioural changes. The impact assessment can be found via the following link: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/household-benefit-cap-wr2011-ia.pdf">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/household-benefit-cap-wr2011-ia.pdf</a>.</p>

Most recently, our ambassador in Tel Aviv has raised the issue of Israel's treatment of Palestinian children with Education Minister Saar and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's Principal Legal Advisor Daniel Taub. My honourable friend Alistair Burt raised this during his recent visit to the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/2">The noble Baroness may be interested to hear that alongside our existing projects, our consulate-general in Jerusalem has recently secured funding to fund the UK Bar Committee for Human Rights to come to the Occupied Palestinian Territories in September 2011 to research a report about the treatment of children arrested and detained in the Israeli military court system.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/3">We will continue to monitor the situation with regard to all Palestinian prisoners, including parliamentarians, in Israeli prisons. We call on the Israeli Government to take immediate action to ensure that all cases are reviewed by a court in accordance with fair procedures, and that detainees' rights are upheld, particularly with regards to fair trial and family visits. All Palestinian prisoners should have access to a fair trial, and Israel should ensure that it acts always in accordance with international law. We shall continue to raise our concerns with the Israeli authorities and issue statements when appropriate.</p>

In the case of an allegation of mistreatment requiring further investigation by the police, the FCO will request a waiver of the diplomat's immunity from the diplomatic mission concerned on behalf of the police. Failure to provide a waiver may result in a request to the mission for withdrawal of the diplomat.
