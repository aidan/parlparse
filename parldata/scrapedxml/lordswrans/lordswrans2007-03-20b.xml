	<p pid="b.177.38/1">The Government are developing environmental reporting as an integral part of the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). This will require all fuel suppliers applying for renewable transport certificates under the scheme to report on the carbon savings and wider sustainability impacts of their biofuels. This will encourage companies to supply biofuels which deliver the maximum carbon savings with the minimum environmental impact. It will also ensure that we can monitor the impact of both imported and domestically sourced biofuels.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.38/2">Work to establish methodologies for measuring the carbon lifecycle performance, social and environmental impacts has been undertaken by the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership. These methodologies will be piloted and ready for use when the RTFO is introduced in 2008. In developing these initiatives, consultants have drawn upon international life cycle analysis and sustainability work, which is either already in place or being developed for a range of feedstocks, including those produced in the UK, such as rape seed and wheat.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.38/3">Reports on the RTFO and assurance scheme's performance will be submitted regularly to Ministers, setting out the estimated overall impact, including estimates of greenhouse gas savings achieved and the sustainability of the feedstock supplies being used.</p>

	<p pid="b.177.41/1">The Government remain committed to the renewables obligation (RO) as the main mechanism for supporting deployment of renewables. It was introduced to replace the previous support scheme, the non fossil fuels obligation (NFFO), which was a form of a feed-in tariff, in 2002. A review of the RO, carried out in 2005-06, confirmed the RO was a successful mechanism for encouraging greater deployment of renewables generation, maintaining investor confidence and increasing value for money for the customer. Since its introduction, eligible renewable electricity generated under the scheme has increased to 4.0 per cent of total electricity sales to UK consumers in 2005&mdash;up from 1.8 per cent in 2002. This makes it more successful than the NFFO, under which the proportion of renewables rose from 0.2 per cent of electricity sales in 1992 to 1.8 per cent in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.41/2">The Government have recently consulted on their proposals to reform the RO. A consultation document, <I>Reform of the Renewables Obligation and Statutory Consultation on the Renewables Obligation Order 2007</I>, was published <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October 2006</phrase> and 206 responses were received. The Government will be taking these responses fully into account in reaching decisions on the future structure of the RO, which will be announced in the Energy White Paper, due to be published in March or May this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.177.44/2">The Government's Review of Enforcement in Environmental Regulation, which reported in October 2006, suggested that a scheme for administrative sanctions, varied by the regulator, as an alternative to criminal prosecution, may have the potential to improve the fairness and effectiveness of the current system of environmental enforcement. One option for appeals under such a scheme would be to set up a specialist tribunal. The review also suggested that a more explicit framework of purposes may assist the criminal courts in sentencing in environmental cases, and provide necessary transparency under a possible administrative scheme. The Government are considering how to take forward work to explore these and other options for improving environmental enforcement.</p>
