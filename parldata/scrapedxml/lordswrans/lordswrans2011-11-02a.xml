	<p pid="a.259.1/1" qnum="HL12791">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have undertaken a cost assessment of the impact of the proposals regarding (a) nitrate-vulnerable zones, and (b) the water framework directive, on British dairy farmers; and, if so, what are the results.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-11-02a.259.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100908" speakername="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" colon=":" colnum="259"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/111102w0001.htm#11110299000003">
	<p pid="a.259.2/1">The implementation of the nitrates directive is a devolved matter, with the impact assessments carried out separately within each Administration. The last impact assessment accompanying the nitrates directive review for England was undertaken and published on the Defra website in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/2">This 2007 impact assessment considered the impact of the proposed amendments to the implementation of the nitrates directive in England. It estimated that the damage cost of water pollution from agriculture in England and Wales was in the region of &#163;445 million to &#163;872 million per year, of which around &#163;196 million to &#163;497 million was accounted for by the impact of agriculture on river and wetland ecosystems and natural habitats. The assessment included a 2004 Ofwat estimate that the cost to the water industry to reduce high nitrate levels caused by diffuse pollution in drinking water supplies would be &#163;288 million (capital expenditure) and &#163;6 million per annum (operating expenditure) for the 2005-10 period.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/3">The assessment identified that the main private sector group that would have been affected by revisions to the designations and action programme measures was farmers and, in particular, livestock farmers. These costs reveal that under each action programme option and designation coverage scenario, the dairy sector and arable sector were most likely to be the most significantly affected. Low-end cost estimates showed the dairy sector bearing almost two-thirds of the action programme costs, whilst high-end cost estimates showed both the arable and dairy sector bearing a third to almost half of the action programme cost. The cost to the dairy sector was estimated between &#163;32 million and &#163;42 million through the life of the action programme. The impact assessment included estimates of the potential savings arising if the Government sought a dairy derogation from the EU. For each scenario, the costs to the dairy sector were approximately half where the derogation was made compared to the situation where there was no derogation. The derogation was subsequently granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/4">The implementation of the water framework directive (WFD) is also a devolved matter. Impact assessments are also carried out separately within each Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/5">In England, no separate cost assessment of the impact of WFD on dairy farmers has been undertaken. The national WFD impact assessment in 2007 estimated overall potential costs of implementation for agriculture and rural land management of &#163;142.1 million per annum, at 2007 prices over a 43-year period. However, the process of determining what specific environmental improvement and protection measures are adopted involves an assessment of costs and benefits which may conclude that costs are disproportionate. Where this is the case, measures would not be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/6">The focus in the first river basin management plans, covering the period 2009-15, is on encouraging voluntary change in farming behaviour via the uptake of best practice advice and raising awareness of Codes of Practice through targeted information campaigns. From the impact assessments of the river basin management plans, it is estimated that the cost to the whole of the agriculture and rural land management sector during the first cycle of river basin management is &#163;209,000 (based on 2008 prices).</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/7">The Environment Agency is developing economic tools for the purpose of assessing costs and benefits of environmental improvement measures that will be able to provide information for the dairy industry in the future. The tools will be used in planning measures which will be subject to consultation and published in the next river basin management plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.266.9/1">The definition of autism set out in <I>Fulfilling and rewarding lives, the Strategy for adults with autism in England</I> (2010) follows the World Health Organisation's International Statistical Classification of Diseases-10 criteria which define autism as a lifelong condition that affects how a person communicates with, and relates to, other people, and how a person makes sense of the world around them. In line with the approach to terminology adopted by key autism representative organisations, including the National Autistic Society, as well as the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee, &quot;autism&quot; was used as an umbrella term for conditions such as Asperger's syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder, autistic spectrum condition, autistic spectrum difference and neuro-diversity.</p>

The Equality Act 2010 protects disabled people who have &quot;a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities&quot;.

	<p pid="a.269.2/1">The number of work permit variants issued to Bulgarian and Romanian (EU2) nationals is available on the Home Office website in the &quot;European Economic Area data tables&quot;. The most recent statistics available show that a total of 174,577 work permit variants were issued to EU2 nationals between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.2/3">The difference is not greater than expected and will not be investigated further. An individual worker will be issued with only one national insurance number, but some EU2 nationals will receive more than one work permit, as they are required to hold a new work permit in respect of each job they undertake. Some other EU2 workers will receive a work permit but not, in the end, take up employment in this country.</p>

They must also meet more rigorous immigration compliance requirements by becoming highly trusted sponsors (HTS).</p>
	<p pid="a.273.3/2">The introduction of a new system of robust educational oversight, by the bodies that already have a statutory role in the inspection of educational provision in the UK, replaces the previous accreditation regime by membership-based organisations. The rationale for this was the widespread evidence that the previous regime proved inadequate in tackling the low standards of educational provision and abuse of the immigration system encountered in the privately funded sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.3/3">The two requirements on sponsors (to meet minimum immigration compliance and educational oversight standards) are assessed separately due to the expertise and resource particular to each organisation. As the experts in immigration control, the UK Border Agency assesses immigration compliance (such as the usage of CAS or student compliance with the terms of their visa) through the sponsorship system (which now requires all sponsors to become HTS). As the education specialists, the educational oversight bodies (and formerly the five private accreditation bodies) inspect/review educational standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.2/1">There is no zero-rate VAT for the construction of memorials. However, the cost of VAT incurred by charities and faith groups in the construction, renovation and maintenance of memorials, can be reclaimed through the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's Memorial Grant Scheme, subject to the claims meeting the published eligibility criteria. From 2011-12 onwards, the Memorial Grant Scheme has a fixed annual budget of approximately &#163;0.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.5/12">(2) The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.5/13">(3) Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.</p>
