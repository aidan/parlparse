The Government of Cameroon are making good progress to fulfil a pledge made to computerise the electoral roll.

We are aware of the preference among some opposition politicians for a postponement of the forthcoming elections until ELECAM is in a position to run them. There is no sign that the Government will pursue the option of a postponement, which would present problems under the constitution.

	<p pid="a.42.0/1">The latest available information on the detention of tariff-expired life sentence prisoners remains as set out in Lord Falconer's reply to you on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-06">6 February 2003</phrase>. Unfortunately, data relating to the number of such prisoners currently being held beyond the tariff expiry date are no longer held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/2">The release of tariff-expired life sentence prisoners is a matter for the independent Parole Board. No life sentence prisoner can expect to be released unless and until the Parole Board is satisfied that continued detention is no longer necessary for the protection of the public. The main criterion governing the board's consideration is the risk of serious harm that the prisoner may pose to others.</p>

However, prisoners who need to be supervised within MAPPA on release from custody are assessed well in advance of their release date, in order that the MAPPA agencies may draw up risk management and supervision plans to take effect as soon as they are released.</p>
