	<p pid="a.127.5/1">At the beginning of October, I published a national strategy for recruitment to the magistracy, setting out my plans to increase the number of appointments as a justice of the peace, and to encourage applications from people with a wider range of backgrounds. In furtherance of the national strategy, I am now amending my directions to the committees which advise me on magisterial appointments. The committees are asked to achieve a Bench which is broadly representative of the community which they serve. Following advice from Royal Commissions in 1910 and 1948, political association has hitherto been used as an indicator of social class in seeking to achieve that balance. I am satisfied that the way people vote is no longer a reliable guide to social perspective and standing. I am therefore introducing a new system; applicants will identify themselves against occupational and industrial groupings, based on standard classifications used by the Office for National Statistics. I am also telling the committees that there need be no lower age limit for applicants who can show that they have the key qualities needed for appointment. Copies of the national strategy document and of the new application form, which sets out the occupation groupings categories, have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) employs temporary agency staff to cover short-term pressures in workloads and to cover vacant posts whilst recruitment campaigns are under way. For these reasons, there will be a continuing need for temporary staff though the CPS seeks to keep its use of agency staff to the minimum.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/2">CPS staff numbers have increased significantly since March 2001. As permanent staff numbers have increased, the need for agency staff has reduced. The total expenditure on agency staff represented 1.23 per cent of total CPS staff costs in 2001&ndash;02 and was reduced to 1.04 per cent in 2002&ndash;03. The CPS is continuously undergoing recruitment drives in order to recruit permanent staff and as a result reduce agency costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/3">In addition the CPS also employs lawyer agents to work as advocates for the CPS in the magistrates' courts. In 2001&ndash;02, lawyer agents covered 124,000 sessions in the magistrates' courts out of a total of 414,000 (30 per cent) and in 2002&ndash;03, 120,000 sessions out of a total of 412,000 (29 per cent). The cost of employing lawyer agents to act as advocates for the CPS has reduced from &pound;9.9 million in financial year 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;9.6 million in 2002&ndash;03. Lawyer agents represented 4.03 per cent of total CPS staff costs in 2002&ndash;03. These figures do not include the use of counsel in the Crown Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/4">The CPS is increasing the number of its own higher court advocates and designated caseworkers and providing opportunities for development of its own staff through new training programmes including the Law Scholarship Scheme.</p>

The right to registration as a British citizen under Section 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981, as inserted by Section 12 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, is a conditional one. The individual must make an application to the Secretary of State and demonstrate that he possesses certain qualifications as specified in the Act. The requirements are that the applicant is either a British Overseas citizen, a British subject under the 1981 Act or a British protected person, and has no nationality or citizenship apart from the qualifying British status, and has not, since <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-04">4 July 2002</phrase>, &quot;renounced, voluntarily relinquished or lost through action or inaction any citizenship or nationality&quot;.</p>

I assume this research programme is the study to which my noble friend refers. The purpose of this research is to establish whether combinations of vaccines, including anthrax, administered with and without pyridostigmine bromide, give rise to adverse health effects. The vaccinations Gulf veterans received, their timing, the environmental and other conditions pertaining at the time of administration varied and to replicate all of the different scenarios would be impractical. The research vaccination schedule attempts to reflect a valid &quot;worse case&quot;. This research does not address the numerous other factors that have been suggested as possible causes or contributors to Gulf veterans' illnesses. To do so would have increased the size of the research programme considerably and confounded the interpretation of the results. The independent panel is responsible for ensuring that this complex, carefully controlled scientific research programme, conducted under laboratory conditions, is carried out to the highest scientific standards and that the aims of the research programme are fully addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.2/1">We are pleased to announce that the Ministry of Defence has today signed a contract worth &pound;166 million (including VAT) with Alvis Vickers Ltd, for the manufacture of the Future Command and Liaison Vehicle (FCLV).</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">17 July</phrase> we announced that the FCLV would be deployed with the RAF Regiment and that the contract value would be worth over &pound;200 million. Ongoing work on armoured fighting vehicle rationalisation has led to a review of the initial requirement for vehicles. Consequently, we have revised the size of the initial procurement of FVLV whilst retaining the option to procure additional FCLV at a later date. The RAF Regiment will no longer receive vehicles from the initial fleet of FCLV and the contract value of the initial work has been revised.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">The FCLV will perform the command and liaison role and replace the ageing and disparate vehicle fleet within the manoeuvre support brigades comprising elements of the 430 Series, Saxon, Land Rover and Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) fleets. From its planned in-service date of 2006, the FCLV will provide levels of crew protection and mobility commensurate with their roles in an increasingly extended ground manoeuvre area. It will offer protection against small arms, blast and anti-personnel mines. Those in the direct fire zone will contain a self-defence weapon (SDW) that can be operated under armour to provide suppressive fire and surveillance and target acquisition (STA) system will be provided to enhance situational awareness, reconnaissance, targeting and reporting. The vehicle has been selected to deliver the solution to the Armed Forces' requirement for enhanced speed, reliability, flexibility and protection for a wide range of users in combat or peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/4">The award of this contract to Alvis Vickers Ltd is excellent news for both our Armed Forces and the defence industry. It will sustain approximately 35 highly skilled jobs at the Alvis Vickers Ltd facility at Telford, and a further 25 within other UK companies. This is the culmination of work conducted by both the MoD and industry, and is a good example of the principles of Smart Acquisition being put into practice. It is incumbent on the MoD and industry to work together to ensure that our Armed Forces have access to the right equipment, in the right quantities, at the right time and at the right price.</p>

These regulations come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>. But in any case the modification of any computer system without the owner's permission is likely to be covered by the Computer Misuse Act 1990. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is currently looking to update the CMA. For some years the DTI has sought to increase awareness of information security, particularly among smaller businesses. One particular initiative to help such companies was announced earlier this year by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.

	<p pid="a.146.3/1">The results of the latest actuarial valuation of the mineworkers' pension scheme (MPS) have revealed a deficit. However, under the terms of the current guarantee arrangements over &pound;350 million of government money has now been transferred from the investment reserve, a sub-fund in the scheme, to the main fund in the scheme to ensure members' guaranteed benefits are paid. The Government have also agreed to MPS members continuing to receive inflation linked increases to their total pension&mdash;basic pension plus bonuses&mdash;over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/2">The government guarantee ensures that miners' pensions as at privatisation will always rise in line with inflation and never fall in cash terms even if, as now, there is a significant deficit in the scheme. In exchange for the guarantee, the Government receive a 50 per cent share of any scheme investment surplus created by past valuations. The other 50 per cent of surpluses is available for the trustees to distribute to members and has meant that members have, over the years, received bonuses totalling around 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/3">Against the background of large falls in world stock markets, which have had a major effect on investment performance as highlighted by the deficit in the MPS, the trustees have been advised that the Government do not feel it would be right to change the current arrangements which provides such an unprecedented degree of security for scheme members.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.2/3">This revised definition takes account of responses to earlier consultations and Oftel's own consumer research which shows that people do not see real-time video content delivery and 256kbps as the defining feature of broadband (as previously set out in an earlier consultation by Oftel, published in April 2003). This is an economic definition for the purposes of the market review, which conforms to established principles of competition law methodology. It does not affect the range of services available to consumers at different bandwidths.</p>
