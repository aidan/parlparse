	<p pid="a.1.5/2">Constitutional propriety dictates that Her Majesty should be able to rely on the advice of a Minister in the exercise of Her Royal Prerogative. That includes appointments to the rank of Queen's Counsel. I am the appropriate Minister in this case. My responsibilities include policy on the regulation of the legal professions and the safeguarding of the public interest in the provision of legal services: the award of Silk assists in this since Silk is a quality mark for the consumer.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.2/1">Public funding has two distinct roles in clinical negligence claims: to investigate which potential claims are worth pursuing and to support those which are. Clinical negligence claims tend to be complex and investigation is needed to ascertain the merits of taking a case forward. More than half of all cases are not funded to proceed beyond the investigative stage. In 2001&ndash;02, 27 per cent of all cases that received some funding from the Legal Services Commission (LSC) were utimately successful in litigation. However, of cases which were allowed to proceed beyond the initial investigative stage, 57 per cent were successful. At all stages the case is subject to a merits test and the applicant to a means test.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">Success rates for publicly funded cases have no impact on other, ongoing claims for compensation; each application is considered on an individual basis. The LSC may discharge a funding certificate at any point when it has evidence that funding is no longer justified on ground of either means or merits.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.5/1">The United Kingdom did not require the United States to pay for support or make any direct financial payment to the UK during the Gulf conflict. The UK's contribution to the Gulf conflict was part of an international coalition force. As part of that international coalition force, coalition partners pooled resources and equipment and were able to share capabilities and facilities. This meant that the US, along with other coalition partners, loaned to the UK a certain amount of equipment. According to records held by the Ministry of Defence, the US loaned communications equipment, a number of high mobility load carriers and logistic support to UK Armed Forces.</p>

The successful bidder had to satisfy conditions with regard to financial ability to purchase and carry out restoration work and that the proposed development had to be sympathetic to the existing uses of the forest park.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">DARD granted the latter a short-term licence up to <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-11">11 January 2003</phrase> for the purpose of carrying out a survey of the building and to effect minor but essential repairs. The survey work will identify a schedule of repair work for agreement with DARD and for inclusion in the agreement for disposal.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.2/1">Following further consideration and consultation with faith groups, the Government have tabled an amendment to the Licensing Bill that would exempt secular entertainment provided in places of public religious worship and the provision of entertainment facilities in such places from the need to obtain a licence under the Bill when it is enacted. Music for the purposes of or incidental to a religious service or meeting is already exempt.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/2">The exemption reflects the current position outside Greater London. Within Greater London, the provision of secular entertainment at places of public worship has for many years been licensable. The amendment the Government have tabled will add further to the deregulatory measures already contained in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/3">The Government also wish to make plain their intention to exempt church halls, chapel halls or other similar buildings occupied in connection with a place of public religious worship, and village halls, parish or community halls or other similar buildings from the fees associated with the provision of entertainment or entertainment facilities under the licensing regime. Use of such premises to put on entertainment will still require a licence as such provision can and does give rise to issues of nuisance, public safety and crime and disorder. However, the Bill provides for a streamlined and straightforward licensing scheme with minimum bureaucracy. In addition, the guidance to be issued by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport under the Bill will make it clear that conditions attached to any licences for such premises be proportionate to the risks involved which are likely to be minimal in most cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/4">Where a premises licence authorises the sale of alcohol in premises of this nature, however, the normal licence fee will be payable. This is entirely in line with existing arrangements. In addition, those wishing to use village, church and parish halls, and other community buildings will all be able to take advantage of the simple and easy notification procedure that the Bill provides for temporary events.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/5">The precise details of the fee structure will be the subject of consultation with interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/6">The Government hope that religious institutions, music societies and other community groups will derive great benefit from the exemptions and that the initiative will further strengthen our drive to increase the diversity of cultural experience available to people and communities throughout England and Wales. Furthermore, the exemptions will bolster the measures already contained in the Bill that are designed to foster live music by opening up even further the opportunities for musicians to perform.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.2/1">No. Member countries of the World Trade Organisation are discussing, under a mandate in the GATS, whether &quot;any necessary disciplines&quot; need to be developed to ensure that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade and are not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service. Any such disciplines would not apply to national domestic regulatory regimes as a whole. No conclusions have yet been reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/2">The Government's Principles of Good Regulation encourage UK regulators to ensure that regulations are targeted to focus on the problem concerned, with minimal side effects.</p>

Any decision to contract out to the private sector would need to be consistent with European Union public procurement rules and those of the World Trade Organisation Government Procurement Agreement. There are as yet no GATS rules on public procurement. The Government are in touch with the Local Government Association about the implications of the GATS for local government services.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-02-03a.14.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="14"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030203/text/30203w04.htm#30203w04_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.14.2/1">The Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) research published in 1989 estimated that, overall, there were 110,000 severely disabled children under the age of 16 in Great Britian. This survey remains by far the largest exploration of childhood disability ever undertaken in the United Kingdom. There were a number of earlier smaller surveys undertaken in the 1970s, but none was sufficiently comprehensive to provide a baseline for subsequent comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">We do not collect statistics broken down by severity of impairment. The number of disabled children living in residential placements was estimated at <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> to be nearly 2,300. Of these 550 were in residential schools. There are about 6,600 pupils in maintained and non-maintained residential special schools, plus a further 4,400 in independent residential special schools. Nearly all these children have statements of special educational needs, but data are not collected about whether they are disabled or not. We do not collect central information about the number of institutions that provide care for disabled children. As at January 2002, there were some 1,400 special schools in the country, including 227 which provide residential placements.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/3">We do not centrally collect statistics on the average costs of maintaining disabled children in institutions, special schools or at home without full time residential carers. A reanalysis of the 1989 OPCS survey [Kavanagh and Opit 1998] showed that the weekly cost for children (0-16 years) resident in private households was &pound;330 per week at 1994&ndash;95 prices. For children in communal establishments, the average weekly cost of the placement and other services use was between &pound;554 (private residential homes) and &pound;1,128 in local authority residential homes. The average per capita budget cost of local authority maintained special school provision in England was &pound;11,210 in 2001&ndash;02. In independent and non-maintained special schools there is a wide range of fees as a result of individual tailored provision and it is not meaningful to provide an average figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/4">We are providing substantial financial support to families of disabled children. Tackling child poverty is a complex and multi-dimensional issue. It is not just about income; it is also about extra investment in healthcare and education services, and improvements in the sytem for children and teenagers who are vulnerable or disabled. The Government increased the disabled child premium in income-related benefits by &pound;7.40 a week more than the normal uprating in April 2001 and again in April 2002 by another &pound;5 more than inflation, to &pound;35.50 a week. This premium is benefiting the families of around 85,000 children with disabilities and currently, together with the enhanced disability premium paid to families with around 40,000 severely disabled children, costs some &pound;160 million in 2001&ndash;02. Spending of &pound;200 million is planned for 2002&ndash;03, of which about &pound;20 million is expected to be spent on the enhanced disability premium. In addition 232,000 in 2001&ndash;02, forecast of 247,000 in 2002&ndash;03, disabled children with care and/or mobility needs are helped by disability living allowance at an annual cost of &pound;674 million in 2001&ndash;02. Spending is forecast to rise to &pound;744 million in 2002&ndash;03. Benefit spending on children in addition to the spending on disability living allowance is &pound;13,081 million in 2001&ndash;02, and is forecast to rise to &pound;13,764 million in 2002&ndash;03. This figure includes benefit spending only and excludes tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/5">The disabled child tax credit element of the working families' tax credit was introduced in October 2000 for families with children getting disability living allowance or who are registered blind, or who have left the register in the last 28 weeks. This is currently worth a maximum of &pound;35.50. The child enhanced disability tax credit, currently worth &pound;46.75 a week, was introduced in April 2001 for severley disabled children getting the higher rate care component of DLA. From April 2003 the new child tax credit for families will include family elements and child elements. The child element for disabled children will be worth &pound;3,600 per year, while the child element for severely disabled children will be worth &pound;4,465 per year. The Government also provide funding to the Family Fund Trust which provides grants to help reduce the stress on families with severely disabled children. This increased from &pound;26.4 million in 2001 to &pound;27.4 million this year and will increase by a further &pound;1 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/6">Disabled children receive a range of care and support from social services departments. This includes advice and guidance; family support including short-term breaks; residential provision; selfcare and independent skills training; drop-in clubs and groups; activities at family centres; transition support sevices. The Children in Need survey 2001 shows that the average cost to social services of each disabled child in residential care during the survey week in September/October 2001, excluding those that received respite care alone, was &pound;1,400. The average cost to social services of each disabled child supported in their family or independently during the census week was &pound;130.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/7">As part of the Government's &pound;885 million Quality Protects programme, we set national objectives for children's social services and through inspections, monitoring and annual reviews the department's Social Services Inspectorate monitor progress towards their achievement. The objectives include specific sub-objectives for disabled children, which are a priority area in the programme. Last year's Quality Protects Management Action Plans (MAPs) show that local authorities are beginning to improve the services they provide to disabled children, including providing more family support services such as home based respite care and sitting services. For severely disabled children the draft national overview of the MAPs says, &quot;There are a number of examples of innovative partnerships with health to enable the appointment of health care assistants and developing roles for paediatric home care services. Services have also looked at the role of nursing support in special schools and the development of community services.&quot; Next year (2003&ndash;04) the earmarked funding for disabled children will double from &pound;15 million to &pound;30 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/8">The Children's National Service framework, which will be published later this year, will set national standards across health and social care for children's services. The external working group developing NSF standards for disabled children's services has set up a specific task group to consider the needs of severely disabled children. This is addressing the current support being provided to severely disabled children and their families and how they can be improved. It will make recommendations about the interventions needed to maximise life chance benefits from educational opportunities, healthcare and social care. We do not therefore feel that there is a need to set up an inquiry at this point.</p>
