	<p pid="a.147.8/1">The UK strongly supports the EU's commitment of 2004 to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and facilitate a Cyprus settlement. This commitment was reaffirmed in 2007. We are committed to seeing the Turkish Cypriots play a full and constructive role as EU citizens&mdash;this means sharing the benefits of EU membership, but also the responsibilities. Our aim is to increase contact between the two communities in Cyprus and make any future settlement easier to implement by raising the Turkish Cypriot community's capacity to meet the EU acquis.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.8/2">While efforts to ease the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community are important, ultimately this isolation will only be fully lifted in the context of a UN-brokered comprehensive settlement to reunite the island. A new opportunity has opened up to make decisive progress towards a comprehensive Cyprus settlement. It is important that energy is focused on capitalising on this opportunity and that obstacles are not placed in the way of any new negotiation.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.2/1">The fact that Turkish Cypriots are European citizens is just one of many reasons why the UK and the EU have sought to improve their economic well-being. This has been done by means of the aid regulation and by supporting their access to European markets on preferential terms. We want to put market forces at the service of a settlement, by integrating Turkish Cypriots into the economy of Europe, and promoting the economic integration of Cyprus. A recent conference held in Nicosia by the Peace Research Institute of Oslo found that each family in Cyprus would benefit by &euro;5,500 per year (on average) if the island was reunified. This underlines the importance of all parties engaging with the efforts of the UN to achieve a comprehensive settlement of benefit to all Cypriots.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.2/1">We welcome the report as an attempt to disseminate existing scientific evidence. Understanding the science of climate change is key to creating the political conditions for a global agreement on greenhouse gas reduction and allowing Governments and international organisations to better prepare for the consequences of climate change. The transition to a low-carbon, high-growth global economy is crucial to our security and prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/2">Climate change will hit the poorest countries hardest. While scientific models of the distribution of climate change effects are uncertain, as this report indicates, the Middle East is predicted to be at considerable risk over the next 60 to 90 years. As this report highlights, most models suggest water availability is likely to decline in the region and this could have serious consequences for food production.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/3">However, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (November 2007) concluded that even with the combined challenges of population growth and climate change, global capacity to produce staple food commodities is unlikely to be compromised. Certain regions may increasingly depend on imports from other countries but, at the global level, higher productivity is likely to compensate for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/4">We welcome the growing international debate linking climate change and security, such as the recent EU report presented to the spring Council. Food security is an important part of this debate and will increasingly become an issue, even if overall global capacity is not compromised. We are taking the security impacts of climate change very seriously, continuing to develop our evidence base and analysing its impacts on our own policies. We are also supporting the work of the World Bank and other international organisations to assist developing countries in preparing for the effects of climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.5/1">The Government share the noble Baroness's concerns about the Iraqi girls and women who have turned to prostitution in Syria. We are assisting these women through contributions to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), which is leading the international humanitarian response to the Iraqi refugee situation. In March, the Department for International Development announced an additional &pound;3 million contribution to the UNHCR's work with displaced Iraqis in Syria and other countries in the region. This takes its total contribution to the UNHCR to &pound;7.75 million and its overall humanitarian contributions for Iraq to &pound;147 million since 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/2">The UNHCR provides assistance to Iraqi refugees, including food aid and financial grants. The objective is to prevent destitution among the refugee population and avoid situations whereby young women feel forced to turn to prostitution to provide for themselves and their families. Furthermore, the UNHCR plans to expand the number and capacity of safe houses it already supports in Syria in 2008, to protect vulnerable women and children and prevent them turning to prostitution. The UNHCR is also currently exploring options for collaborating with women volunteers in areas where prostitution is particularly prevalent, to help women already in the industry.</p>

However, since <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase>, the United Kingdom has been required to implement EU directive 89/460/EC, which allows the use of road vehicles with 11.5-tonne axle loads and plated vehicle weights of 40 tonnes.

When the EU directive came into force, all bridges on the motorway and trunk road network were able to accommodate 40-tonne vehicles. Maintenance of other roads is a matter for the relevant local highway authority.</p>

All insurers consider such cases in accordance with the Financial Services Authority complaints procedure guidelines with, if merited, reimbursement of costs incurred.
