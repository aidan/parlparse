	<p pid="b.213.0/1">In phase I large electricity producers in the UK were provided with allocations below their business-as-usual projections. This meant that the sector would either have to reduce its emissions or purchase allowances from other operators. In 2005 and 2006, the large electricity producers purchased a total of 82.4 million allowances. Other UK industry sectors covered by the EU ETS surrendered 22 million allowances less than they were allocated. The net effect was that all UK installations covered by the scheme purchased 60.4 million allowances over 2005 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/2">These allowances represent emission reductions that were made outside the UK but were paid for by the UK, so can count towards UK domestic targets.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.3/1">In 2005, the latest year for which final estimates are available, the UK's greenhouse gas emissions were 654.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), more than 15 per cent below base year emissions. These reductions are all from domestic action.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.3/2">Our projections show that domestic action alone will ensure that emissions in the UK remain significantly below the level required for us to meet our Kyoto Protocol target to reduce emissions to 12.5 per cent below base year levels over the period 2008 to 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.3/3">In addition, any allowances and credits surrendered by UK installations through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for the 2008-12 phase will count when assessing compliance with our Kyoto target for the first commitment period.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.3/4">In 2006, the last year for which information is available, the net purchase of allowances by UK installations within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme totalled 33.3 million tonnes of CO2, or about 4.3 per cent of our base year emissions under Kyoto of 775.2 MtCO2e.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.3/5">For 2008-12, the Government have set the annual cap for UK companies within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme at 246.2 million tonnes of CO2. This is an annual reduction of 29.3 MtCO2 below projected need.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.2/1">Operators of plants subject to the Large Combustion Plants Directive (2001/80/EC&mdash;the &quot;LCPD&quot; hereinafter) have the option of participating in a national emissions reduction plan in accordance with Article 4(6) of the LCPD. Because the plan is long-term in nature, it is not considered conducive to its operation to allow plants whose operators exercise that option to be withdrawn from it at any time. Furthermore, even if a participating plant closes, it is necessary for its previous participation in it to remain recorded in the plan. This is so that it can be demonstrated that the closure does not result in an increase in the total annual emissions from the remaining plants covered by the plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.2/2">However, in the light of responses to Defra's February 2007 consultation on the operation of the plan, we decided to provide an option for plants to be withdrawn from participation with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2016-01-01">1 January 2016</phrase> or <phrase class="date" code="2018-01-01">1 January 2018</phrase>. These are the dates on which some of the emission limits set in the LCPD are tightened. Respondents pointed out that this may, in some cases, make it desirable for the plant to be withdrawn from the plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.2/3">Under the plan, each plant has an annual emission allowance for each of the three pollutants covered by the LCPD. This is calculated as prescribed in the LCPD and the operator has to manage emissions so as not to exceed that allowance or that allowance plus any unused allowance the operator has acquired from another participating plant. Withdrawal of a plant from the plan at either of those dates will not change that requirement in the years prior to withdrawal nor the attendant reporting requirements. After withdrawal, the plant would be subject to emission limit values set in accordance with the LCPD and also the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control Directive (96/61/EC). The latter directive applies to all plants subject to the LCPD, whether or not they are in the national emission reduction plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.2/4">The February 2007 consultation paper provides further detail on this rather complex issue. That and other pertinent information can be found on Defra's website.</p>

Notice of the application must be posted on site, and the Secretary of State has power under Regulations 6(4)(c) and 7(3) to direct that notice must be given to specified other persons.

This person worked on the surface transport strategy for Heathrow airport for a period of 10 months. There have been no secondees from BAA to the department during this period. The department runs an active programme of secondment opportunities. Individuals are frequently seconded both in and out of other governmental bodies and departments, Europe, and also commercial organisations.</p>

A woman cannot be paid for donating her eggs for research but egg-sharing arrangements are permitted by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. To prevent women from being coerced or misled into donating their eggs, or being misinformed about the extent to which their donation might impact on research, the authority's code of practice requires a number of safeguards before women give consent to the use of their eggs in a research project. These safeguards include a clear separation between the researchers and the people carrying out the woman's treatment, detailed information about the realistic outcomes of the research and the impact the donation would have, and a requirement that the person obtaining the woman's consent is independent from the research team.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.3/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill includes five purposes for which embryos can be tested. One of these relates to tissue typing&mdash;where embryos are tested to see whether they have histocompatible tissue where cord blood, bone marrow or other tissue could be used in the treatment of a sick older sibling where the sibling is suffering from a serious medical condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.3/2">The draft Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, then called the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill, was published for scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses. In the draft Bill, the provision required that the child be suffering from a life-threatening condition. The committee recommended that this be changed to a serious condition. The report from the Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryo Bill said:</p>
	<p pid="b.219.3/3" class="indent">&quot;We recognise that this is a delicate area. However, given the Government's apparent acceptance of the principle of selecting for saviour siblings' we do not understand why the practice is limited to 'life-threatening' conditions capable of treatment using umbilical cord blood cells. We recommend that the draft Bill be amended to substitute 'serious' for 'life-threatening'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.3/4">The Bill introduced into the House of Lords in November reflected that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.3/5">The 1990 Act does not specifically mention embryo testing, therefore there is no current definition in legislation about when tissue typing can be carried out. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority produce a code of practice which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.219.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Preimplantation tissue typing is expected to be available only to select embryos which, when transferred to the woman, may result in a child who may provide histocompatible tissue for the treatment of an existing child who is affected by a serious or life threatening condition. The seriousness of the condition should be a matter for discussion between the people seeking treatment and the clinical team&quot;.</p>

We consider that expert advice on schemes at the pre-planning stage can play an important role in driving better standards, and we currently fund the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) to provide a free service that reviews significant schemes at national level. CABE is also providing support for the establishment of design review panels at regional level.</p>

We have consistently made clear that if a physics or chemistry department closes at one institution, the Higher Education Funding Council for England should seek to maintain regional capacity elsewhere and report to us on how provision can be maintained in this way.</p>
