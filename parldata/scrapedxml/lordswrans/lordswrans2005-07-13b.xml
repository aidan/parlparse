These measures are intended to raise attainment at 16 and increase the number of students going on to study science post-16. We will keep under review their success in doing so and, if necessary, take further steps to boost participation and attainment in science post-16.</p>

	<p pid="b.152.5/1">The implementation of the new post-primary arrangements will continue as planned. Under the new arrangements all schools, including grammar schools, can exist. Grammar schools can maintain an academic ethos by providing an academic curricular emphasis for their pupils as part of the entitlement framework provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.152.5/2">The London School of Economics (LSE) research on intergenerational mobility in Europe and North America shows that opportunities for poor children have declined relative to those better off when comparing those born in 1970 to 1958. The research indicates that intergenerational mobility in Britain is substantially less than the Nordic countries, all four of which operate non-selective education systems. The Government have no plans to invite the academic team from the London School of Economics to conduct similar research in Northern Ireland.</p>

These are extensive and complex investigations that have required a considerable commitment in terms of time and resources. Serial numbers have been determined for &pound;16.5 million of notes.
