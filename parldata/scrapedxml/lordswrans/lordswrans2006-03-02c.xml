	<p pid="c.87.11/1">Since April 2002, England's regional development agencies have been financed through a single programme budget (the &quot;single pot&quot;). This replaced a range of funding programmes administered by the RDAs, such as the single regeneration budget, and through which each government department's funding contribution to the RDAs was made. However, RDAs are required to meet legacy commitments to SRB rounds one to six from within their single programme resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.11/2">Money from the contributing departments (DTI, ODPM, DfES, Defra, DCMS and UKTI) is pooled into one single budget (the single pot). Once allocated, funding is available to the RDAs to spend as they see fit, to achieve the regional priorities identified in regional economic strategies, and national priorities set out in the RDA tasking framework. One of the overarching PSA targets in the tasking framework is Defra's rural productivity and access to services target, which requires RDAs to address the needs of rural communities. To support this, Defra's contribution to the single pot has increased from &pound;46 million in 2004&ndash;05 to &pound;72 million in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.11/3">Given these arrangements, RDAs are not required to produce specific figures on the basis requested. However, RDAs do report on their achievements in delivering outputs on a six-monthly basis. From this year for the first time, outputs will also be disaggregated on a rural/urban/disadvantaged basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.11/4">How each RDA utilises its single pot allocation will vary according to regional need. Details of RDA priorities and planned spending can be found in individual RDA corporate plans, with six-monthly reports on performance setting out what has been achieved. These documents can be found on each RDA website.</p>

	<p pid="c.94.2/1">According to the Atlas of British Flora, ivy is virtually ubiquitous, showing no change in extent since 1962. Recent survey data show similar findings for a range of woodland habitats across, the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.2/2">We are well aware of the widespread view that ivy kills trees but there is no evidence apparent which would substantiate this. Where cases have been investigated in which ivy has been blamed for the death of a tree other problems have been found to account for the decline. Ivy is very valuable in providing roost sites and sometimes hibernation sites for birds, bats and invertebrates. It also provides valuable late nectar and berry sources and is a specialised dead wood resource in its own right.</p>

	<p pid="c.96.5/4">I have been asked to reply as the issue raised falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.5/5">By way of background, I should explain that Roads Service collects traffic volume data by means of 270 automatic census points strategically located throughout the Northern Ireland road network. The information is generally recorded for one week in each quarter during the year and an annual average daily traffic flow is calculated. There are a number of sites where traffic is counted continuously. The results are published in Roads Service's annual Traffic and Travel Information Report, which presents the traffic volumes in a variety of formats for each site.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.5/6">The locations of the automatic census points on the A1 between Lisburn and the border are given in Table A attached and cross referenced to parts (a) to (h) of your Question above. At census points 419 and 434 traffic is counted continuously at the other sites traffic is counted for one week in each quarter.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.5/7">The Annual Average Daily Traffic flows calculated for each site for the last available 5 years are given in Tables B and C.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.5/8">The 2005 figures are not yet available but will be published in the 2005 Traffic and Travel Information Report in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.99.2/1">The chief executive of Roads Service Dr Malcolm McKibbin has been asked to write to the noble Lord in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.2/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question about the average daily number of vehicles using the M1 motorway in Northern Ireland in both directions and for all measured points.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.2/4">I have been asked to reply as the issue raised falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.2/5">By way of background, I should explain that Roads Service collects traffic volume data by means of 270 automatic census points strategically located throughout the Northern Ireland road network. The information is generally recorded for one week in each quarter during the year and an annual average daily traffic flow is calculated. There are a number of sites where traffic is counted continuously. The results are published in Roads Service's annual Traffic and Travel Information Report, which presents the traffic volumes in a variety of formats for each site.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.2/6">The locations of the automatic census points on the M1 are given in Table A attached. At census point 403 traffic is counted continuously, at the other sites traffic is counted for one week in each quarter.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.2/7">The annual average daily traffic flows calculated for each site for the last available five years are given in Tables B and C.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.2/8">I hope this information is helpful.</p>
