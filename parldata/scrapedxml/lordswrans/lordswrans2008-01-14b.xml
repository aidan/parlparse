	<p pid="b.235.5/1">There are currently approximately 20,900 military and 2,200 UK civilian personnel based in Germany as part of the British force. Their presence in Germany is governed by the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) of <phrase class="date" code="1951-06-19">19 June 1951</phrase> and by the supplementary agreement relating to the status of foreign forces in Germany dated <phrase class="date" code="1959-08-03">3 August 1959</phrase>. The two principal British Army units in Germany are 1 (UK) Armoured Division and United Kingdom Support Command (Germany). 1 (UK) Armoured Division's primary task is to prepare force elements and individuals for operations. United Kingdom Support Command (Germany)'s mission is to provide the necessary range of operational, personnel, training and infrastructure support to enable and sustain military capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.5/2">These units continue to be based in Germany as the UK is committed to its contribution to NATO and co-operation with its allies in the alliance. The UK also benefits from the opportunity to train armoured units in Germany, and to make use of training areas in Eastern Europe, which are less accessible from the UK. With the approval of the German Government, we plan to continue to station two armoured brigades and their supporting units in Germany for the foreseeable future.</p>

Detailed plans are being drawn up for the moves, starting with HQ ARRC, which could move as early as 2009. The moves of the two brigades would be completed by 2014.

	<p pid="b.237.3/1">A number of blood samples were collected from UK service personnel being prepared for deployment to the Gulf in 1990-91 at various stages of the anti-biological warfare agent vaccination programme; these are currently stored at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Porton Down. The samples are stored at -20C and in theory could be subjected to additional testing as new techniques emerge. However, these samples are now over 16 years old and inevitably will deteriorate with time.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.3/2">The samples were analysed in 1991 with the aim of investigating the level of protection conferred by giving anthrax vaccine in combination with pertussis vaccine. The results of the study were set out in a paper &quot;Operation GRANBY: The effect of co-administration of the pertussis vaccine on specific antibody titre development to the anthrax vaccine in man&quot;, which was made available in October 1997 and is available in the Library of the House. The Ministry of Defence has no plans for additional banking of blood samples from veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, and has not collected samples from UK service personnel deployed to Iraq (Op TELIC) and Afghanistan (Op HERRICK).</p>

	<p pid="b.238.8/1">Belarus' human rights record remains poor. The Belarus Government continue to threaten and detain those exercising their right of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, and they harass and intimidate independent media, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society. These actions have created a climate of intimidation and fear. Despite strong appeals from the international community and its institutions, it is clear to us that the authorities have no intention of instituting reform and improve even the basic rights of its citizens.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.8/2">The UK and the EU take every opportunity in the UN Human Rights Council and the third committee of the UN General Assembly to express our concerns about Belarus' human rights record. In November 2007, EU members co-authored a resolution on Belarus in the third committee of the UN General Assembly. The resolution reiterated deep concern at the deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus, including Belarus' failure to co-operate with the UN human rights mechanisms; its failure to conduct free and fair elections, including the detention and arrest of political and civil society activists; and persistent reports of harassment and closure of NGOs, national minority groups, independent media outlets, religious groups, opposition political parties and independent trades unions as well as expressing its disappointment at the Government's failure to create conditions for the people of Belarus to freely express their will during the local elections in January 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.8/3">Our embassy in Minsk, with EU partners, continues to raise human rights concerns with the authorities. We maintain regular contacts with civil society organisations devoted to human and civil rights, and observe their public demonstrations as well as fund projects that focus on local grassroots democracy-building and youth participation in democracy activities.</p>
