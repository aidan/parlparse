	<p pid="a.185.5/1">Lynemouth&mdash;the large combustion plants directive requires operators of large combustion plants to reduce their emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust. The directive exempts those plants which make direct use of the products of combustion in manufacturing processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/2">Aluminium smelting is an electrochemical process which requires large and uninterrupted quantities of electricity. For that reason, Alcan's Lynemouth smelter has its own dedicated, coal-burning combustion plant. The European Commission takes the view that this plant should be subject to the directive. The Government, and the owners of the plant, Rio Tinto Alcan, take a different view, arguing that it falls within the directive's exemption regarding manufacturing processes. The correct interpretation of the relevant provisions of the directive is now a matter for the European Court of Justice, since the Commission has instigated infraction proceedings against the UK for not applying the directive to the Lynemouth plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/3">Anglesey Aluminium&mdash;the Anglesey aluminium plant takes its electricity from the Wylfa nuclear power station and is therefore not directly affected by the large combustion plant directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.5/1">The Government gave careful consideration to the scope for introducing specific controls on the activities of overseas subsidiaries of British companies during the 2007 review of export controls. As noted in their responses to the review consultation, the Government concluded that to do so would not be legally viable and that such controls would be impossible to enforce. Furthermore, effective controls already apply to the export and trade from the UK of controlled goods and technology that an overseas subsidiary is likely to require. The Government are also pursuing, via the EU, further powers which, while not specific to overseas subsidiaries, would enhance our ability to control the export of goods that do not normally require a licence when they leave the UK but might be routed via overseas subsidiaries for use by the military in destinations of concern.</p>
