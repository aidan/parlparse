	<p pid="a.5.8/1">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) has already mainstreamed cultural tourism as a key development and marketing priority and will continue to do so in coming years. The board, in conjunction with Tourism Ireland Ltd (TIL), is keen to exploit opportunities that are unique to Northern Ireland and to develop a visitor experience that is based on the region's cultural and natural attributes. The NITB recognises the Ulster Scots (known as Scots-Irish in the USA) heritage as an integral element of future tourism growth to Northern Ireland from several key markets including North America.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.8/2">TIL recognises the potential of Ulster Scots/Scots Irish segment to tourism in the island of Ireland. To that end, the company has commissioned research specifically on this segment by organising for the inclusion of a number of questions in the Menlo Study of Travel Behaviour, currently being undertaken in the US market, with preliminary results expected in August 2003. This study, in conjunction with a brand tracking study, which is also in the field, will assist TIL in identifying regions with best potential for this particular segment.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.8/3">TIL has also liaised with the Ulster-Scots Agency in Belfast and has requested copies of their publications for distribution to market staff and tour operators to allow key players to become more familiar with this crucial segment.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.8/4">TIL is currently in discussions with its advertising agency to design a segment-specific campaign to target specific groups through targeted publications and websites, with particular emphasis on the Ulster Scots/Scots Irish.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has changed its travel advice for Pakistan with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-07">7 July 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/2">We previously advised British nationals other than those of Pakistani origin: against all but essential travel to Pakistan for which there is a compelling reason and where they have confidence in the security arrangements for the entire visit; against holiday travel to Pakistan; and to leave Pakistan unless they have a compelling reason to stay and unless they also have confidence in their security arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/3">We are now advising British nationals: against holiday travel unless they have family contacts there; if they are travelling to Pakistan for professional or holiday reasons, they should be very careful about, and confident of, their personal security arrangements throughout their visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/4">Our previous advice was drafted against the backdrop of escalating tensions between India and Pakistan in 2002, a number of terrorist attacks against western targets (including Pakistani Christian institutions) in 2002 and unrest in Pakistan following coalition action in Afghanistan and, more recently, in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/5">We reviewed this advice taking into account the recent improvement in India/Pakistan relations, post-conflict stabilisation efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, the action taken by the Pakistani authorities against Al'Qaeda and other terrorist groups in Pakistan and the relative decrease in the number of terrorist attacks against western targets thus far this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/6">We believe that our advice needs to reflect these improvements, but without underplaying the risks to the British public. Our advice continues to underline that Pakistan remains a hostile environment for Western interests. It also underlines the serious risk of terrorism throughout Pakistan and the risk of indiscriminate attacks against western targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/7">Visibly Western targets and individuals are more vulnerable to attack than British citizens of Pakistani origin and our advice makes this clear. We are therefore advising British nationals against holiday travel unless they have family contacts in Pakistan. Our advice also highlights the need for all visitors travelling to Pakistan (for business, holiday, visiting family or other purposes) to be very careful about, and confident of, their personal security arrangements throughout their visit. lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.13.2/1">The Cabinet Office code of practice on written consultation sets a standard period of 12 weeks for UK national public consultations. We take the view that the consultation on the draft guidance and regulations on greater collaboration between, and federation of, maintained schools, is not a national consultation, but a more limited exercise consulting only local education authorities, dioceses, national bodies and those schools which have told us of their interest in federation. The content is largely technical, puts into place provisions discussed by Parliament during the passage of the Education Act 2002, and follows principles already consulted on widely in other recent governance consultations. The consultation period will give respondents the opportunity to make their views known before the summer holidays&mdash;our experience is that extending education consultations into the summer holidays is not particularly helpful&mdash;and enable the regulations and guidance to be put in place from September this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">The work goes beyond simply reinstating the grass. The ground has become compacted as a result of events and rallies that have been held there over a number of years and this has broken down the soil, affecting drainage and the ability of the grass to recover. The repairs involve removing the old soil, introducing new drainage and irrigation points, building up the surface with new soil to the required level as well as repairing damage to the footpaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">The amount spent by the promoters on reinstatement was quoted in the Official Report as &pound;10,000 in error. The figure should have been around &pound;100,000 and the Official Report has been corrected for the Bound Volume.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.2/1">Weeds displaying resistance to herbicide (as opposed to crop plants growing as weed-like volunteers) are a regular part of the arable landscape and a near unavoidable consequence of the use of herbicides. The problem is not specific to GM crops. World-wide over 250 biotypes of herbicide-resistant weeds are known (different resistances and/or different weeds) with over 30 in Canada alone, including such plants as wild mustard (sinapis arvensis) with known resistances to six commonly used herbicides of conventional crops.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/2">The Government are also aware of studies in Canada that have detected the occurrence of multiple-herbicide-resistant oil seed rape occurring as weed-like volunteers in fields that have previously grown herbicide-resistant oil seed rape crops. This includes volunteers with resistance to two herbicides associated with GM herbicide-tolerant oil seed rape varieties (glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium) and to one herbicide associated with a conventionally bred herbicide-tolerant oil seed rape variety (imidazlinone). If different varieties of herbicide-tolerant oil seed rape were grown in the UK we may want to take steps to prevent this occurring.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/3">The Government are also aware of evidence from North America that genes from genetically modified oil seed rape and maize can cross-pollinate with non-GM equivalent crops or sexually compatible wild relatives. Similar evidence has been collected in the UK and indeed the Government have commissioned studies into the frequency and extent of cross pollination between crops and wild relatives. Before any GM crop was approved for commercial cultivation in the UK the potential environmental impact of cross-pollination would be carefully assessed.</p>

This means that children from the Southport area will be taken to Ormskirk Hospital for treatment, which I know has raised concerns about the move. We were not involved in that decision, but assume the Trust proceeded with the move in consultation with the Ambulance Service, which will be aware of travelling times on the A570.</p>
