	<p pid="b.138.5/1">The UK has not made representations to authorities in the Czech Republic about the use of caged beds. Our embassy in Prague has worked closely with the Czech authorities to help exchange best practice with UK counterparts on restraint techniques in care facilities, which we believe contributed to the Czech decision to re-examine their use. The embassy continues to monitor the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.5/2">In January 2007, the Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs tightened legislation on the use of caged and netted beds, resulting in the use of caged beds only in exceptional cases and as a last resort (where the patient's or others' lives or health are in danger), only on a doctor's recommendation, on the notification of a legal representative and/or guardian, and for as short a period as possible. In July 2004, the Ministry of Health banned the use of caged bed in psychiatric institutions although netted beds are still in use.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.5/3">The Czech authorities have stated that they will investigate the issue again in the light of a recent BBC report on the use of caged beds.</p>

	<p pid="b.141.0/1">Between 2004-05 and 2006-07 the Youth Justice Board funded five youth offending teams (YOTs)&mdash;Gateshead, Newham, Southwark, Staffordshire and Swansea, to pilot family group conferencing as part of their youth inclusion and support panel (YISP) provision. Grants of up to &pound;225,000 per YOT were made available over the three-year period. From 2007-08 no additional funding was made available for family group conference schemes as YOTs had the option of investing in family group conferences as part of a YISP by using their overall YJB prevention grant. Currently, total YJB prevention funding to YOTs in England and Wales amounts to &pound;34 million per year. The Government have also announced ongoing funding of &pound;18 million over 2008-11 to fund family intervention projects which work intensively with whole families. Some of the projects use family group conferencing as a way of assessing the strengths and support needs of the families they work with.</p>

	<p pid="b.146.6/18" class="indent">1. A/AS level scores were used to assess candidates up to 2001-02 and UCAS tariff scores from 2002-03 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.6/19" class="indent">2.Candidates with more than three A-levels are scored for the best three; candidates with two or more A-levels are scored; candidates with fewer than two A-levels are excluded. AS-levels are scored as half an A-level. A grade A at A-level scored 10 points, a grade B 8 points, a grade C 6 points a grade D 4 points and a grade E 2 points.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.6/20" class="indent">3. UCAS introduced the tariff score to take account of Curriculum 2000; it was designed to make different qualifications comparable. It is based on a number of qualifications including A/AS levels and for example a grade A at A-level scores 120 points, a grade B scores 100 points, a grade C scores 80 points, a grade D scores 60 points and a grade E scores 40 points. Tariff scores cover those entrants for which data are collected. In addition there are numbers of entrants for which tariff score data are not collected, relating to qualifications including Access courses, OND/ONC, HND/HNC, GCE, A/SCE, Higher, GNVQ/GSVQ, NVQ/SVQ level 3</p>
