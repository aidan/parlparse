<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-04-24a.130.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="130"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70424w0002.htm#07042426000127">
	<p pid="a.130.2/1">Evidence from the Labour Force Survey 2004-06 shows that there are currently around 15,000 women and around 5,000 men who have two jobs each paying below the lower earnings limit but when aggregated their earnings are at least equal to the lower earnings limit, who do not otherwise qualify for the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/2">These are point-in-time data and people may not remain in this position for lengthy periods and may well have other opportunities to build up qualifying years during their working lives. The reforms proposed in the Pensions Bill, including the reduction in the number of qualifying years to 30 for a basic state pension, mean that people reaching pensionage from 2010 will have far greater opportunity to build improved state pension entitlement over theirworking life.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/3">Table 1 below shows the estimated cost of providing a national insurance credit, from 2010, to people whose earnings would exceed the LEL if aggregated. Estimated numbers of people who would be eligible for such a credit are based on the above figures, and also take into account, for example, the projected increase in the working age population.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/4">However, such a national insurance credit would not be awarded on any form of self-certification basis without any evidence. All national insurance credits (and the proposed new carer's credit) are awardedon the basis of evidence. To satisfy the evidence requirement it would fall to employers to collectand aggregate earnings information to provide that evidence base&mdash;and we have ruled out aggregating earnings information in this way because of the burdens on business.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/5">If earnings information were to be collected on an aggregate basis by a collective of relevant employers and earnings exceeded the national insurance thresholds then national insurance contributions would be payable. It would be only right and fair to expect individuals and employers to pay national insurance on those earnings where a liability arises. It would be unfair to give people a free pass for pension purposes but exempt them from their national insurance liability.</p>

Information relating to third or fourth jobs is not collected in the Labour Force Survey. Consequently estimates may exclude people whose total earnings from their first and second jobs are below the lower earnings limit, but total earnings including any additional jobs are above the lower earnings limit. Similarly, information in the Labour Force Survey does not permit precise identification of people who are already qualifying for state pension, and so proxies have been used. For example, women with dependant children below 12 years are assumed to be qualifying through contributions credits for those caring for children.</td> </tr>
