	<p pid="b.227.6/1">A preliminary evaluation of the Cross-Regional Information Sharing Project (CRISP) product was carried out during August and September 2005 using independent advisers. This evaluation found that the CRISP product was inherently capable of providing the basis for a cross-border information-sharing system, deployed more widely, subject to some further development. More detailed work on assessment, testing and stabilisation began in November 2005 and is continuing. The IMPACT programme business case identifies the CRISP product as a means of providing an interim local and cross-border information-sharing capability and confirms the value of continuing work to introduce a common national data standard, based on the CRISP data schema.</p>

	<p pid="b.231.3/1">New measures on driving licences are proposed as part of a new European Union directive, which has yet to be adopted by the European Union institutions. One such new measure is to require member states to issue all new full (that is, non-provisional) driving licences in photocard format in accordance with an agreed European Union model, which reflects existing practice in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Another new measure would require member states to withdraw all old model licences, to replace them with such a European Union format photocard licence, and to do so within 20 years of the date of implementation of the new measures in the member states. On current indications that would mean by 2032.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.3/2">Regardless of the prospective new European Union requirements but wholly in accordance with what is proposed, we wish to be able to decide to withdraw and replace our pre-photocard driving licences, and we are seeking powers in the Road Safety Bill to enable this. Such a decision would be taken largely on grounds of the need to strengthen the security of the driving licence system against fraud. Although no such decision has yet been taken, it is very likely that we would wish to do so much sooner than required by the proposed new directive.</p>

	<p pid="b.232.2/1">The impact assessment which was carried out concluded that retailers who are already registered as firearms dealers (RFDs) will incur no extra costs. Other retailers will have to pay &pound;150 to register for three years. They will also incur some extra costs if they need to install additional security measures, although this should be minimal. We understand that around 200,000 new air weapons are sold each year through RFDs, sports shops, hardware stores, tackle shops, camping shops and the like. Around 9 per cent are estimated to be sold through mail order, although this is thought to be rising. It is not possible to estimate the number of second-hand air weapons sold each year.</p>

However, there were still 11,825 offences resulting in over 1,500 injuries and we believe that an increase in the age limit to 18 will assist in further reducing this unacceptably high level of offending. We have received a range of representations about the impact on young shooters generally. They will still be able to use air weapons under controlled conditions&mdash;eg, under adult supervision, at approved shooting clubs or, if they are over 14, on private premises with the owner's consent.</p>

It is not possible to say how many of these offences will be prevented by the measures in the Bill, but we believe that restricting the points of sale and increasing the age limit for buying an airgun from 17 to 18 will help to tackle the problem at source.</p>

	<p pid="b.240.5/1">The National Security Infrastructure Co-ordination Centre (NISCC) has developed and run four exercises during the past two years with the overall aim of improving the protection of the UK's critical national infrastructure against electronic attack. The government departments and agencies involved were those that collectively have a day-to-day interest in NISCC operations, including the Cabinet Office, the Home Office, MoD, DTI, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) (formerly the National High Tech Crime Unit), the Government Communications Head Quarters (GCHQ) (especially the Communications Electronics Security Group (CESG) and the Security Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.5/2">Private sector companies were invited to take part in some of the exercises, depending on the theme of the exercise. For confidentiality and security reasons I am not able to divulge details of those companies involved. The exercises tested a number of elements of the response to an electronic attack and many lessons have been learnt. These have ranged from ensuring that the central government departments involved understand their roles in the response to an attack; liaison with the private sector; media handling; briefing Ministers; investigational lead, issuing warnings; responding out of normal hours; and ensuring confidentiality. NISCC has also taken part in a number of international exercises including Exercise Cyber Storm, which incidentally a delegation from the All-Party Group on the Internet was given a briefing on as well as visiting the exercise control during play, and a G8 table-top exercise in May 2005 which was designed to test international co-operation in investigating an electronic attack against a member state.</p>

As with National Statistics's estimates of eligibility for pension credit in 2003&ndash;04, estimates are given as ranges to account for possible biases in Family Resource Survey data. They also take account of the effects of sampling variation. It is assumed that the size of this range remains constant in future years relative to the decreasing proportion of non-eligible pensioner households.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.2/12">3. Estimates cover all those aged above women's state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.2/13">4. The projections assume the continuation of the current uprating of the standard minimum guarantee by earnings, although the Government have not yet announced how it will be uprated beyond 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.2/14">5. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. It is assumed that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women's state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.2/15">6. Estimates are calibrated to the 2003&ndash;04 National Statistics estimates of non-eligibility for pension credit, which adjust 2003&ndash;04 Family Resource Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting.</p>

	<p pid="b.247.5/1">Officials worked very hard to get the regulations and guidance in place. The appeal service is for the local authorities to establish. We understand from the National Parking Adjudication Service that eight councils in England (outside London) hope to have completed all the necessary steps to commence bus lane enforcement this autumn, which will include establishing the appeals service and appointing bus lane adjudicators, subject to the consent of the Lord Chancellor.</p>

	<p pid="b.248.1/2" qnum="HL4951">Further to the Written Answer by the Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean on 3 November 2004 (<i>WA 34&ndash;35</i>), whether they have received any information from United Kingdom embassies in Ankara, Damascus and Baghdad about a dialogue between Iraq, Turkey and Syria on the equitable sharing of trans-boundary water resources; and, if not, whether they will make representations to the United Nations Secretary-General regarding the appointment of a special envoy to facilitate such a dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="b.248.2/1">We do not believe there have been any subsequent trilateral meetings between Iraq, Turkey and Syria on the equitable sharing of trans-boundary water resources. Trans-boundary water resources are discussed as part of ongoing bilateral dialogue between Iraq, Turkey and Syria. We have received no reports on the specific nature of these discussions from the countries concerned. It is the Government's view that it is for the countries concerned to find a lasting way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.2/2">The Government have no plans to press for the UN Secretary-General to appoint a special envoy to facilitate a dialogue between these three countries. If called on, the World Bank has a high level of expertise in developing solutions to enable the equitable distribution of trans-boundary water resources. We support the bank's work in the Middle East and other regions.</p>
