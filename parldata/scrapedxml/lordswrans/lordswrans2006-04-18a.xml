	<p pid="a.159.4/2" qnum="HL4573">Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Bach on 2 March (<i>WA 86</i>), how the 11.56 per cent. reduction in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' funding for sustainable farming and food research for 2006&ndash;07 compares in percentage terms with funding available for (a) climate change and energy; (b) natural resource protection; (c) sustainable consumption and production; (d) sustainable rural communities; and (e) sustainable farming and food in that financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.5/1">Spend on sustainable food and farming research in the financial year 2006&ndash;07 will be around &pound;34 million, a cut of approximately 11.5 per cent. on the financial year 2005&ndash;06. This spend forms part of the &pound;80.7 million allocated to Defra's &quot;Sustainable Food and Farming and Animal Health and Welfare&quot; strategic priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/2">The &pound;80.7 million spend on this strategic priority forms 49 per cent. of Defra's total research spend. In comparison, 19 per cent. of research spend is on the climate change and energy strategic priority, 13 per cent. is spent on the Natural Resource Protection strategic priority, 6.4 per cent. on the Sustainable Consumption and Production strategic priority and 1.4 per cent. on the Sustainable Rural Communities strategic priority. The remaining funds are allocated elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/3">While this refocusing of Defra's research programmes will mean a reduction in our level of investment in farming and land-based research, we will continue to be a major investor in biological research on sustainable agriculture in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.2/1">Defra procures research to support Defra and the Welsh Assembly Government policies relevant to sustainable agriculture at a range of research establishments including the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER). As IGER is a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) research institute, its future is a matter for the BBSRC and the institute.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/2">However, as a customer for the services provided by IGER, Defra has an interest in the maintenance of areas of expertise and service provision that relate to our present and developing needs. IGER continues to be an important research partner for Defra. This is reflected in my department's continuing significant investment; we are committed to investing over &pound;5 million in research programmes at IGER in 2006&ndash;07. No existing research programmes have been terminated early.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/3">Defra's needs for scientific evidence and, therefore, the expertise required within the scientific community to service these needs, are changing. This has been documented in our <i>Science Forward Look <sup>1</sup> </i> and our recent consultation document<i>Evidence and Innovation Strategy<sup>2</sup></i> . We look to the UK science and engineering base as a whole, including public sector research institutes, the higher education institutions and the private sector, to provide the expertise required to support the delivery of our strategic priorities. <sup>1</sup> Evidence and innovation: Defra's needs from the sciences over the next 10 years, July 2004 <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/publications/documents/ScienceForwardLook3rd.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/science/publications/documents/ScienceForwardLook3rd.pdf</a>. <sup>2</sup> Evidence and Innovation Strategy 2005&ndash;08: consultation document issued October 2005; <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/ei-straiecty/eis-consultdoc.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/ei-straiecty/eis-consultdoc.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.2/1">Legal cost structures were largely negotiated at a time when the anticipated volumes of cases under the schemes were considerably lower than has proved to be the case. Higher than anticipated volumes of cases undoubtedly bring opportunities for batch processing and reduced costs per case. This is an issue the department is already actively pursuing.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/2">In particular, we consider that the level of solicitor fees set for the new &quot;fast-track&quot; approach we have implemented for the respiratory disease scheme should require significantly less input by solicitors and should therefore incur considerably reduced costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/3">We appealed the judge's initial ruling on this. The Court of Appeal upheld our action and the issue has been referred back to the scheme judge to reconsider in the light of the Court of Appeal's judgement.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/4">There are also other areas where we have yet to reach agreement with the claimants' solicitors on costs and we will be pursuing these equally vigorously to ensure they reflect work done and a reasonable level of return.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/5">Solicitors' costs are paid under the claims handling agreements within the framework of the group litigation for the two coal schemes. It is not an issue of whether the money could be better spent elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.3/2">Bevacizumab (Avastin), in combination with irinotecan, is currently licensed for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic bowel cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.3/3">Bevacizumab has been referred to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for appraisal. In the interim, there are no national restrictions on, or guidelines for, prescribing Bevacizumab on the National Health Service for patients who fit the licensed indication.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.3/4">Funding for licensed treatments should not be withheld because guidance from NICE is unavailable. In these circumstances, we expect primary care trusts to take full account of available evidence when reaching funding decisions. This is confirmed in <i>Health Service Circular 1999/176</i>, which asks NHS bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from NICE is not available at the time the treatment or technology first became available.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.5/1">The performance of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM), which grants trade mark and Community design rights, is reported on that organisation's website. It has achieved noticeable improvements on a number of indicators recently. OHIM is overseen by an administrative board and budget committee on which the United Kingdom sits, alongside representatives from all the member states of the European Union and from the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/2">Currently OHIM directly employs a number of United Kingdom nationals together with five members of staff on secondment from the United Kingdom Patent Office. In 2005 some 6,661 applications were filed by applicants from the United Kingdom, which accounted for 11.3 per cent. of the total number of trade marks filed in that year at OHIM. Since 1996 British businesses have registered 37,299 trade marks with OHIM, or 12 per cent. of the total registered. In each case, the registration constitutes a unitary right covering the whole of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.2/1">The Flag Regulations govern the flying of the Union flag from government buildings in Northern Ireland, which are defined as buildings wholly or mainly occupied by members of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. The flag must be flown on designated days at government buildings where it was the practice to fly the flag on designated days in the 12 months ending on <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-30">30 November 1999</phrase>. Other government buildings have discretion to fly the flag on designated days. The flying of flags from other buildings is unregulated, although in practice many public and civic authorities choose to fly the Union flag at their buildings on the same days as government buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">Of the buildings listed in the question, five are government buildings and five are public buildings. It was the practice for all five government buildings to fly the Union flag on designated days in the 12 months before <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-30">30 November 1999</phrase> and they are therefore obliged to fly the flag on designated days, in accordance with the Flags Regulations. Unfortunately on this occasion, due to an oversight, the flag was not flown on St Patrick's Day at DVTA, Hamiltonsbawn Road. Of the five public buildings, three choose to fly the flag on the same days as government buildings and two do not. The table below sets out the specific individual responses to the questions raised, as well as specifying whether a building is classed as a government or public building.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.2/1">The Human Rights Act 1998 contains no provision expressly excluding it from the concept of implied repeal. However, Section 3 of the Act requires that all legislation, when enacted, should be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights. If this is not possible in respect of primary legislation, a court may make a declaration of incompatibility under Section 4 of the Act. This may limit the extent to which later legislation can effect implied repeal of the provisions of the Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.5/1">Incidences of self-harm in the removal estate range from the very minor to those more serious attempts which require medical treatment. Detainees who self-harm may be treated within the centre or externally in hospital as appropriate. Most incidences, fortunately, occur at the lower end of the scale. There may be many reasons for the variation in incidences of self-harm between centres&mdash;length of stay, size and location of centre, fear of imminent removal and frustration of the removal process. All Detainee Custody Officers in removal centres are trained to the standard delivered within the Prison Service to help identify and prevent suicide and self-harm. They are also trained in accordance with their particular centre's own suicide and self-harm prevention strategy and procedures. Additionally, notices in various languages are displayed in all centres setting out that, where a detainee has a concern about a fellow detainee, this should be brought to the attention of a member of staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.2/4">We also have 15 Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRUs) in the UK and Germany to provide assessment and treatment of musculo-skeletal disorders. Patients are referred from unit medical facilities where the simpler injuries would be diagnosed and treated. A Multidisciplinary Injury Assessment Clinic (MIAC) team within each RRU is responsible for providing an assessment and diagnostic service. The MIAC has rapid access to MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanning or other imaging if required. It then determines the most appropriate rehabilitation plan for the patient. This includes rapid access to orthopaedic surgery when clinically indicated, with every patient having a post-operative rehabilitation plan before surgery.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/5">Where appropriate, personnel may be referred for further treatment to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court, which provides high-quality medical care, rehabilitation, prosthetics and adaptations for service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/6">The MoD is also committed to providing appropriate healthcare to those servicemen and women suffering from mental health problems. This is based on a community-based approach so as to ensure that personnel have better, more timely and more convenient access to mental healthcare. To meet this commitment we have 15 Defence Community Mental Health teams across the UK, plus other satellite centres overseas. In-patient care, if required, is provided by the Priory Group. In addition to this, while personnel are in theatre, we provide appropriate levels of support from trained mental health staff either based in the UK or in theatre.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/7">The MoD is also working on a number of further initiatives, relating for example to the prevention and management of problems arising from operational stress and to the need to address issues of stigma and discrimination. We have work in hand to ensure that those leaving the services can recognise the signs of stress and know where to go for help.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/8">The MoD also has the discretion to meet the costs of treatment related to injuries of illnesses for which a war pension is paid, but not where that treatment is provided free under the UK legislation, such as through the NHS. In 2004&ndash;05, the charity Combat Stress received &pound;2.8 million in respect of such treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/9">Although I cannot comment on the individual case of Corporal Corrigan for reasons of medical confidentiality, I can confirm that his claims about the circumstances surrounding his treatment have been the subject of full investigations, and the MoD continues to be in regular contact with him, to ensure that he receives the full benefits to which he is entitled.</p>

As part of its evidence to the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee's inquiry it provided a detailed analysis of the instruments made during 2005 which were laid before Parliament (or the House of Commons) showing by department those where 21 days was not allowed between the date of laying and the instrument coming into force. The Committee published this analysis on pages 35 to 79 of volume two of its report (HL Paper 149-II). No central record is kept of the reasons for breaching the 21-day rule and this information could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/3">Your recent Parliamentary Question has been referred to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/4">You asked why the inspection function of Ofsted is outside the scope of the general duty of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, as outlined in Ofsted's race equality scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/5">Ofsted devised its first race equality scheme (RES), in keeping with its duties under the Act, in May 2002. This contained limited information beyond a review of Ofsted's functions as, at that time, it was assessed that the function of inspection itself did not differentially affect ethnic groups. This position has changed substantially as evidenced in the consultation documents regarding the development of our RES published on our website this year. The consultation document now clearly states that all our education inspection functions have high relevance to our general duty under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/6">I am pleased to say that we have been in regular contact with the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) on a range of matters to do with the development of our RES and our duties under the Act and are working with them on a memorandum of understanding. We undertook a review of our race equality functions in spring 2005 and we intend to publish our newly revised RES in late summer 2006 following external consultation which ends in May. The draft version for consultation is available on our website. Impact assessments as part of action planning, training for Ofsted staff and inspectors and the intention to publish our findings widely are features of note.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/7">Please be assured that we take our statutory duties very seriously and are determined to work with the CRE and other bodies to renew our commitment to race equality.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.11/2">The first three days of induction are spent on a residential training course to explore, in a safe environment, issues around sectarianism, cultural and religious differences, empowerment, social history and reconciliation. This training also takes cognisance of wider cultural diversity issues which are explored more fully in the Police College programme. This specific equality and diversity training focuses on issues around, among other things, prejudices, stereotypes, assumptions based on people's race, religion, community background, political belief, age, disability, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, nationality etc. There is no singularised instruction for Ulster-Scots, Irish or Mandarin culture rather all strands of diversity are core themed throughout the 21 week training programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.11/3">Other external speakers attend the college to deliver specific equality and cultural diversity training. In addition to these initiatives the Police College also hosts a cultural traditions evening where recruits can meet and speak to representatives from various community groups. The cultural awareness evening provides an opportunity for different traditions to give a presentation to police trainees for about 10 minutes each. Current contributors to the awareness evening are the Orange Order, The Royal Black Institution, The GAA and the Irish language Society.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">The Government consider the recent comments made by the Russian Federation unhelpful. The UK attaches great importance to the customs agreement between Moldova and Ukraine and its contribution to the future success and integrity of the 5+2 (Moldova, Ukraine, Russia, Transnistria, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe plus the EU and US) talks on the frozen conflict with Transnistria. The agreement is vital to transparency and better control of the external border of a country that will soon be a direct neighbour of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/2">The UK deeply regrets the current blockade that Transnistria has imposed along the border with Ukraine, and sincerely hopes that this disagreement can be resolved swiftly. Together with the US and EU partners, we remain committed to resolving the conflict and look forward to the resumption of talks with all participants on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-05">5 April</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/33">2 Including attempts and achievement in previous academic years. 3 Figures for 2004&ndash;05 are revised, figures for 2003&ndash;04 are revised as this is what was used in the statistical first release.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/34">All pupils both with and without SEN are assessed at the end of key stages of learning. In addition, pupils with SEN may have an individual education plan setting out three or four short-term targets focusing on one or more of the following key areas: communication, literacy, mathematics and behaviour and social skills. Pupils with a statement of SEN have their needs reviewed annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/35">With regard to provision for deaf children in mainstream school, the SEN statutory framework and the SEN code of practice should ensure that all children with special needs have those needs identified and assessed and receive appropriate support. The code makes clear the importance of early identification, assessment and provision for any child who may have SEN, including deaf children. In individual cases, assessments are carried out and decisions on provision are made locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/36">The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 extended the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) to cover access to education. As a result disabled children, including deaf children, seeking access to education now have rights against discrimination under Part 4 of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/37">With regard to special schools for deaf children, under arrangements introduced in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, the consideration of proposals for establishing, altering, or discontinuing maintained special schools are a matter for local decision-making. Local authorities are best placed to respond to the needs of pupils in their particular areas. That is why the Government strengthened local participation in decisions about patterns of provision, and removed Ministers from direct involvement in the decision-making process.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.2/1">I refer the noble Lord to the reply given in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, col. 2206W.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/2">The Government do not collect information centrally on numbers of special teachers of the deaf or numbers of teachers with specialist training. There is a requirement under regulations that where qualified teachers wish to specialise in teaching children with a hearing impairment they must obtain a mandatory qualification. The department approves the providing institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/3">The General Teaching Council is in the process of updating its records of numbers of teachers with specialist training, which are currently incomplete.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/4">The Special Educational Needs (SEN) code of practice provides advice to local authorities and schools on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children who have special educational needs, including children who are deaf. The code sets out a graduated approach to providing support. Many children who are deaf will have statements of SEN. All statements must be reviewed at least annually. The purpose of the review is to consider children's progress, to ensure they are achieving desired outcomes and, if necessary, to amend their statements to reflect newly identified needs and provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/5">In addition, the development of the New Relationship with Schools brings a focus on how well schools meet the needs of all their pupils. All schools will carry out an annual self-evaluation and publish a single plan setting out their priorities for improvement in which they will need to show how all their pupils are achieving. This process will highlight any gaps in achievement between different groups of children, which will then be discussed with a locally appointed school improvement partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/6">Our White Paper <i>Higher Standards, Better Schools for all</i> published in October 2005, which builds on <i>Removing Barriers to Achievement</i> published in February 2004, promotes a more effectively tailored education for all children with special education needs by increasing the sharing of expertise between special and mainstream schools; equipping the workforce with appropriate skills, knowledge, awareness and confidence; and promoting more effective measurement of, and accountability for, the progress made by pupils with SEN across a wide range of abilities. The White Paper also set out our plans for personalised learning. These include providing targeted support for groups of children who are at risk of underachieving, including those with SEN. We will spend an additional &pound;565 million by 2007&ndash;08 to support schools to tailor teaching to the needs of all their pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">While current evidence indicates that there are no major difficulties in the supply of science and technology teachers to Northern Ireland schools, the Department of Education has none the less asked the teacher-training providers to have regard to the need to increase the number of student teachers in science and technology subjects from within their approved intakes allocations. In addition, the department has recently granted its approval for Stranmillis and St Mary's University Colleges to offer a BEd (Hops) secondary pathway in science from September 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/2" class="italic">Letter to Lord Steinberg from the National Statistician, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question to Her Majesty's Government whether they have made an assessment of how much on average, out of every &pound;100, a basic rate taxpayer pays in tax, taking into account VAT, excise duties, national insurance and income tax. (HL5088)</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/4">Estimates of the tax burden on households are based on the ONS analyses <i>The effects of taxes and benefits on household income</i>, which is published annually. The published figures do not provide estimates of the total tax paid (including indirect taxes) at the individual level. Nor is it practical for the analyses to give estimates solely for basic rate taxpayers. However, this analysis does provide an estimate of the share of gross household income paid in tax, by different types of household. Estimates are provided for income quintile groups: the bottom 20 per cent. of households, the second, third and fourth quintile groups and the top 20 per cent. of households. These income quintile groups are based on a ranking of households by equivalised disposable income&mdash;a widely used measure of living standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/5">The latest analysis for 2003&ndash;04 was published on the National Statistics website on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase> at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/6">The analyses are based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (the Family Expenditure Survey before 2001&ndash;02).</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/7">Table 3 from this analysis has been attached below. It shows the total tax paid as a percentage of gross income for all households by income quintile groups. In general households with higher income pay a higher proportion of their income in direct taxes, but a lower proportion in indirect taxes.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/8">Estimates of indirect taxes are imputed based on household expenditure. When comparing the incidence of indirect taxes on households at different levels of income, it should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. On average, measured expenditure exceeds measured income for households in the lower half of the distribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/9">To give a more complete picture of the impact of indirect taxes, they are shown in Table 3 separately as a proportion of gross income, disposable income and expenditure. Table 3 shows taxes as a percentage of gross income, disposable income and expenditure for all households by quintile groups', 2003&ndash;04:</p>

	<p pid="a.220.2/6">I have been asked to reply as the issues raised fall within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/7">I should perhaps explain that in the Government's transport policy statement entitled &quot;Moving Forward&quot; published in 1998, and the subsequent regional transportation strategy, published in 2002, the department undertook to encourage modes of travel other than private car and to explore the role of taxis in an integrated transportation system.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/8">In 1999, the former Minister Lord Dubs decided that the Belfast public hire taxis and taxis that operate under a road service licence, should be admitted to bus lanes on routes where they are licensed to operate. He also asked that the suitability of allowing motorcycles and all other taxis using bus lanes be investigated. This decision has largely directed bus lane policy development since.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/9">The Belfast Transport Model (BTM), which was used as part of the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan assessment process, is a multi-modal transport model of the Belfast metropolitan area, and provides a detailed representation of all motorised modes of transport in the Belfast area. The model takes account of the main highway, rail and bus networks and has a 2001 base year model and a 2015 forecast model, which are based on actual or future estimates of population and employment planning data.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/10">While the BTM incorporates bus and public hire taxis vehicle movements it was not considered an appropriate tool to inform the decision-making process in relation to bus lane policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/11">As regards the impacts of public and private hire taxis' use of Belfast's bus lane infrastructure on travelling passenger and general traffic flow, I can advise that following the introduction of public hire taxis into bus lanes in June 2002, surveys subsequently carried out on main arterial routes between October 2002 and March 2003 showed that the level of usage by public hire taxis during the hours of bus lane operation was extremely small and not sufficient to cause any adverse impact to the operation of the bus services.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/12">Translink confirmed that it had not experienced any problems on its bus operations and the West Belfast Taxi Association has also said that having use of the bus lanes has enhanced the efficiency of its service by enabling customers to progress to their destination in a more timely manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/13">Private hire taxis are currently not permitted into bus lanes and, as such, no assessment has been made of the impact this might have on bus lane operation or traffic flow. However, I can advise that the department plans to carry out further investigations later this year. These are expected to include a review of findings from elsewhere in the UK and Ireland, a review of any relevant research, traffic surveys and analysis and consultation.</p>
