	<p pid="a.175.5/2">DfID is helping formulate guidance on the principles of sustainable development planning, together with other donors and a number of developing countries, through the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. A draft is due to be considered by the DAC High Level Ministerial meeting on 25/<phrase class="date" code="2001-04-26">26 April</phrase> and fed into the preparatory process for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Jo'burg, 2002).

	<p pid="a.175.5/3">DfID's Public Service Agreement for 2001-04 is based on achieving the IDTs. Objective II is to promote sustainable development through co-ordinated UK and international action, including by gaining international agreement on the integration of social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development into poverty reduction programmes. The new Service Delivery Agreement says how we intend to deliver this objective: by developing, and securing wide international agreement to, guidance on the principles of strategic planning for sustainable development by end-2001; and successfully integrating these principles into government, multilateral and DfID policies and programmes in 10 key DfID partner countries by early 2004, including agreed approaches to water resources management and capacity building for environmental management.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.2/1">This has been under consideration for some time as a means of ensuring the efficient and effective implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which provides for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. We are pleased to announce that the existing complement of 21 inspectors will be increased to 33 over the next three financial years.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">The extra 12 inspectors will result in a substantial and unprecedented level of inspectorate staffing. This will lead to more inspections to ensure compliance with licence conditions and will enable applications for authorities under the 1986 Act to be dealt with more efficiently, without compromising the quality of advice offered by the inspectorate. Furthermore, the Home Office will be able to become more proactive in raising standards of animal care and welfare, and to play a greater role in developing and promoting strategies of &quot;replacement, reduction and refinement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/3">The cost of the additional inspectors will in due course have to be reflected in licence fees paid by those conducting animal research.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/4">We hope that the scientific community and animal welfare organisations, and the general public, will welcome this important announcement. It is a practical demonstration of the Government's commitment to ensure that, for as long as there is a need to use animals in scientific research, the legislation to protect them is applied to maximum effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">Relaxing the existing requirement to purchase an annuity would provide an incentive for some to use pension schemes for purposes other than providing a secure income throughout retirement. Costs will vary depending on the nature of any reforms, including what level of income must first be secured and what tax charge is applied to withdrawals above that level.

	<p pid="a.177.8/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.177.8/2" qnum="HL1013">Whether they consider that public bodies which distribute funds to the governing bodies of sporting organisations which cover a number of separate disciplines should treat each discipline separately, especially where one or more of the disciplines is significantly more prosperous and appealing to spectators.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.9/1">The delivery of the Government's financial support to sport and active recreation is primarily channelled through the sports councils, Sport England and UK Sport, which are both sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and through the Sports Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which are sponsored by the Home Departments of the Scottish Executive and National Assemblies of Wales and Northern Ireland. The councils in turn dispense these funds according to their own individual policies and priorities to many governing bodies of sport and a number of other representative bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.9/2">Applications for support from both the Exchequer and from the lottery are carefully considered by the sports councils on a case by case basis. Where an application is received from a governing body which covers a number of different disciplines, the sports councils give consideration to treating disciplines within the same sport (or under the jurisdiction of the one governing body) differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.9/3">As part of the application process, one of the criteria the sports councils will consider is the wealth and financial position of the sport, and the capabilities of different disciplines within a sport to raise revenue based upon profile and opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.5/1">The Development of Tourism Act 1969 gave the then English Tourist Board the function of encouraging people to visit England and people living in England to take their holidays there. This Government did not remove that marketing role when we set up the English Tourism Council in 1999. We changed its remit so that it can now focus on being a strategic centre of excellence and is no longer charged with delivering services directly. It continues to carry out its legal function by retaining a strategic policy overview of marketing, providing market research and advising on best practice. It has, for instance, introduced a new England tourism brand, following extensive consultation with the industry, and published a related brand guide.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.5/2">However, the English Tourism Council has neither been asked nor funded to carry out promotion campaigns. To do so would substantially alter the role assigned to England's national tourism body after the Comprehensive Spending Review and the publication of Tomorrow's Tourism in February 1999. The British Tourist Authority markets England very effectively abroad and domestic marketing is carried out by the regional tourist boards, local authorities and other destination management organisations, as well as by the industry itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.2/1">The Social Exclusion Unit has published a report, Preventing Social Exclusion, which sets out the Government's approach to tackling social exclusion and the results that have been delivered so far in preventing social exclusion, reintegrating those who become excluded, and delivering basic minimum standards. It is a long-term approach, but clear results are now coming through:</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/2" class="indent">1 million more people are in work and claimant unemployment has fallen to below 1 million for the first time since 1975. Unemployment has fallen fastest in the most deprived areas;</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/3" class="indent">educational achievement is improving--higher standards than ever before for 11 year-olds in English and maths, with a 10 and 13 per cent improvement in each subject respectively between 1998 and 2000;</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/4" class="indent">More than a million children have been lifted out of poverty;</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/5" class="indent">Overall crime is falling and burglary is down by a quarter since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/6">Clear results are also coming through on the specific topics tackled by the Social Exclusion Unit:</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/7" class="indent">a fall in the numbers of rough sleepers of over a third between June 1998 and June 2000;</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/8" class="indent">a drop in school exclusions of nearly a fifth between 1997 and 1999. A third of all local education authorities provided full-time education for excluded pupils in 2000 and two-thirds plan to do so in 2001;</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/9" class="indent">a fall of over 15 per cent between 1988 and 1999 in the numbers of 16 to 18 year-olds not in education, employment and training;</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/10" class="indent">a clear downward trend in teenage conceptions and an increase in the proportion of teenage parents in training, education or employment, from 16 per cent in 1997 to 31 per cent in 2000;</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/11" class="indent">progress in reducing the national truancy rate has been disppointing. Although some local areas have reduced truancy rates, the national rate has remained static since 1997. This is being urgently addressed;</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/12" class="indent">the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal was finalised in January this year. This is an unashamedly long-term plan, laying the foundations to ensure that within 10 to 20 years no-one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/13">The Social Exclusion Unit's future priorities are going to be: to complete the current project on reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners; to follow up initial work on young runaways, on which a background paper has been published; and to start two new projects on the educational attainment of children in care and transport and social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/14">An overall strategy for working with children and young people is being developed by the Children and Young People's Unit. As a first step, it has published Tomorrow's Future: Building a Strategy for Children and Young People, which sets out the Government's intent to work with children and young people and a wide range of stakeholders in developing the strategy.</p>
