	<p pid="a.177.2/1">To meet the responsibilities placed on departments in government accounting 2000, the Victims Liaison Unit, in August 2002, commissioned independent auditors to carry out an audit of 15 per cent of victims' groups in receipt of core funding under the core funding scheme 2000&ndash;02. Eight groups were selected for review&mdash;FACT, FAIR, Firinne, HURT, Koram Centre, VAST, WAVE and West Tyrone Voice.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/2">One group was selected for audit on the basis that its allocation was higher than the average allocation from the scheme. Another group was selected because of concerns about the management of its allocation. The remaining groups were divided into two categories&mdash;those serving a mainly Protestant community and those serving a mainly Catholic community. These categories were further sub-divided into groups operating east of the Bann and groups operating west of the Bann. Groups were then selected at random from these categories.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">It would be better for me to answer the noble Lord's Questions in one extended Answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/2">The difference in the dates between the closing dates on the advertisement and the information pack was down to an out-dated document accidentally being posted onto the NIO website indicating that the closing date was <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-09">9 July</phrase>. We rectified this as soon as we discovered the error. All advertisements in the press and other correspondence stated the (original) correct closing date of <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-16">16 July</phrase>. The closing date was later extended to <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-28">28 July</phrase>. Following requests from a number of people, we judged that an extension would be in the best interests of the commission. We are confident that a broad cross-section of the community has applied and are encouraged by the number of applicants; 14 for chief commissioner and 162 for commissioner posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/3">The term &quot;bodies nominating individuals&quot; was used to indicate political parties and other organisations who wished to nominate people to apply for appointments to the commission. Any individual or organisation was eligible to make nominations if they wanted. The information pack made clear that any nominees who applied would be tested in the same way as every other applicant with regard to the criteria. The fact that they had been nominated by an organisation would not be a discriminating or plus factor in their application.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/4">Appointments to the commission are conducted in accordance with the Code of Practice of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. This code of practice sets out the regulatory framework for an appointments process. All public appointments are governed by the overriding principle of selection based on merit, individuals who through their abilities, experience and qualities match the need of the public body in question. This means that all applicants to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission must go through the same application and interview process.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/5">Under Section 68(3) of the Northern Ireland Act, the Secretary of State is obliged to ensure that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is broadly representative of the community in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/6">The Government take the issue of representativeness seriously and will do their best to ensure that the commission has the confidence of all parts of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/7">The independent assessor throughout the process and on the interview panel will be John Keanie. Mr Keanie is on the OCPA accredited list of assessors.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.8/1">Many of the African countries worst affected by AIDS are among the Department for International Development's (DfID's) 16 focus countries: Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Over 80 per cent of AIDS deaths occur in these countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/2">Several DfID African bilateral country programmes have recently stepped up expenditure in support of programmes to help combat AIDS. In addition, DfID will make AIDS a priority for the extra &pound;320 million that the UK will be devoting to Africa in 2006. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-20">20 July</phrase> the Prime Minister launched the new UK Strategy on HIV and AIDS. The strategy provides the framework for how the UK Government will spend an additional &pound;1.5 billion to combat AIDS globally. At least &pound;150 million will be spent helping children whose parents have died from AIDS and other children made vulnerable by AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/3">However, if the millennium development goals are to be met we need to do more than scale up HIV and AIDS specific programmes. The socio-economic impact of AIDS and the vulnerability of poor people in Africa to AIDS mean that we also need to target assistance at broader development programmes, including in the health and education sectors in the countries most at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/4">This is already happening. In 2002&ndash;03 the sixteen African target countries received 88 per cent of DfID funds for Africa. In most of DfID's focus countries in Africa we provide significant support for education programmes, (into which HIV/AIDS issues are integrated). In Malawi, DfID supports the education sector to increase children's access to equitable primary education of improved quality. This includes support for life skills education where all children from grade 4 learn about HIV/AIDS. On health, more broadly, DfID recognises that most African partner countries have extremely weak health systems. Since 1997, DfID has committed over &pound;1.5 billion to strengthening health systems globally.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.3/1" class="indent">(a) In order to allow further testing to take place and also to gauge initial user feedback, Transport Direct is currently running a trial version of the website. As a result, publicity, including links from other sites, is being limited until the first full version is officially launched. This official launch is expected to take place within the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/2" class="indent">(b) The functions available on the Transport Direct website are divided into three principal categories: &quot;Journey Planner&quot;, &quot;Mapping&quot; and &quot;Live Travel&quot;, all of which are very easy to access from the site's homepage.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/3">The &quot;Live Travel&quot; category gives information on real-time information for all rail stations in Great Britain, live travel news that shows incidents that occur and a service that notifies users of disruptions to their journey. The &quot;Journey Planner&quot; category allows the user to plan their journey. Every answer shown for car journey searches will take into account historical congestion data for the given route.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.2/1">The European Commission has mandated Eurocontrol to draft an Implementing Rule on a Common Charging Scheme for Air Navigation Services. Eurocontrol is required to consult with all stakeholders in developing the implementing rule and present its final draft together with the results of the consultation exercise to the European Commission. This is a European Commission process and not a UK Government initiative. However, we are encouraging the European Commission to make available the results of the consultation to all stakeholders.</p>
