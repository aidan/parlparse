	<p pid="a.153.2/1">For confidentiality reasons, there are no plans to make it a requirement for the Prison Service to inform a prisoner's next of kin when a transfer takes place. Subject to security considerations, prisoners are normally notified of their transfer in advance.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2">It is a mandatory requirement for prisoners to be allowed to make telephone calls immediately on reception to a new establishment so that they can inform their next of kin of their new location if they wish to do so. They also have access to telephones on each association period and may also ask prison staff to contact their next of kin on their behalf. In addition, there is provision for prisoners to be issued with special letters, over and above any statutory entitlement, which may be sent at public expense, either before or immediately after the transfer takes place.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the National Statistician, Len Cook, dated July 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question on the most significant differences between the calculation of the continental inflation index and the Retail Prices Index excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX). [HL5170]</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/4">Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Commission calculates the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the European Union as a whole, and for the Member States of the Euro area. It is compiled from individual HICPs calculated by each EU Member State. The HICP is the measure of inflation used by the European Central Bank for monitoring price stability within the Euro area.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/5">The rules underlying the construction of the HICP are specified in a series of European Regulations. While the methodology of the HICP is similar to that of RPIX in a number of respects, it differs in the following ways:</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/6" class="indent">Method of Aggregation: The HICP uses the geometric mean to aggregate prices at the most basic level whereas RPIX uses arithmetic means.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/7" class="indent">Weights: the weights underlying the HICP are based on the expenditure of all private households in the UK, foreign visitors to the UK, and residents of institutional households. RPIX weights are restricted to the expenditure of private households, excluding the richest four per cent, and pensioner households largely dependent on state benefits. Also expenditure on insurance is treated differently when constructing weights. For construction of the RPIX weights, expenditure is assigned to the relevant insurance heading. However, for the HICP weights, the amount paid out in insurance claims is distributed amongst the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) headings according to the nature of the claims expenditure, with the residual (service charge) being allocated to the relevant insurance heading.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/8" class="indent">Classification: The coverage of the HICP is based on the international classification system, COICOP. RPIX uses a bespoke classification system developed for the RPI.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/9" class="indent">Coverage of items: A number of series used for RPIX are excluded from the HICP, most notably those mainly relating to owner-occupiers' housing costs e.g. Council Tax, depreciation, buildings insurance. In addition the HICP includes series which are not currently included in RPIX. These include, air fares, university accommodation fees and unit trust and stockbrokers charges. In addition, the index for new cars in RPIX is imputed from movements in second hand car prices, whereas the HICP uses a quality adjusted index based on published prices of new cars.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/10">Further details of the HICP are given in a series of Economic Trends articles available on the National Statistics Website: <a href="http://www.statistic.gov.uk/HICP">www.statistic.gov.uk/HICP</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/11">Each month, the ONX publishes in the Consumer Prices First release a numerical breakdown of the differences between the HICP and RPIX. Below is the breakdown of differences as published in the May First release.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.6/2">The review will proceed in two further phases, under the sponsorship of the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Personnel).

For the UK, while there are no accurate means of estimating the numbers involved, the most reliable indicators suggest that they could run into hundreds of thousands.

Defra made extensive use of a computer simulation model, Interspread, originally developed in New Zealand. For the control policies in operation in late March, the model predicted an epidemic of 1,800 to 1,900 affected farms and estimated that the epidemic would be eradicated by between July and October 2001, with a low probability of continuing beyond October 2001.</p>
