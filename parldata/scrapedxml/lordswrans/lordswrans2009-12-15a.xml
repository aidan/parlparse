	<p pid="a.191.2/1">Under regulation 4 of the Control of Asbestos Regulations (CAR) 2006, 'duty holders' have a responsibility, to manage the risks arising from asbestos in buildings under their control. For the majority of educational establishments, the duty holder will be the employer which for community schools, community special schools, voluntary controlled schools, maintained nursery schools and pupil referral units is the local authority (LA). For voluntary aided and foundation schools it will be the school governors. Usually duty holders carry out asbestos surveys to record the presence of asbestos containing materials (ACMs). These records must then be made available to contractors so that they know where ACMs are located. If necessary following visual inspections, an intrusive survey may be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/2">Asbestos which is in poor condition, or which is likely to be damaged or disturbed should be sealed, enclosed or removed. Asbestos that is in good condition and unlikely to be damaged is normally left in place and the risks from it managed until the building reaches the end of its useful life. Asbestos does not pose a serious risk if it is managed properly in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations. All major refurbishments carried out under Building Schools for the Future (BSF) would normally include removal of all asbestos and in minor refurbishment work any asbestos that is likely to deteriorate or to be damaged or disturbed would be removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/3">The majority of local authorities have adequate asbestos management procedures in place but we are working with the Health and Safety Executive to further improve asbestos management in schools and we will be producing training and guidance on asbestos management for head teachers, governors and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/4">This year the Prime Minister and the Schools Minister Diana Johnson met the Asbestos in Schools Group of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Occupational Safety and Health and agreed to set up a steering group to improve the management of asbestos in schools. This is part of the wider work by DCSF and HSE to promote best practice in the leadership and management of health and safety issues in schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.2/1">Statistics for asbestos related diseases for specific occupational groups are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/2">However, HSE has published analyses of national mesothelioma deaths (one of the main and most serious asbestos related diseases) by last recorded occupation of the deceased. These statistics do not tell us about how many teachers have died from mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in schools. They are limited because they are based on the last recorded occupation, which may not be the one in which asbestos exposure took place.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/3">The statistics do show that teachers do not stand out as a high risk group: they are among a group of occupations with numbers of deaths from mesothelioma that are broadly in line with the average for all occupations.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.5/1">A centrally recorded robust mechanism for identifying unsuccessful removals was not in place until 2008; therefore, figures for the number of removals which failed before the point of departure are only available for the last two financial years, as set out in the table below. Figures prior to that would only be available through the examination of individual records at disproportionate cost.</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.192.5/8">There are a number of reasons why a removal might be unsuccessful-for example, last-minute legal challenges or the disruptive behaviour of the individual. It should be noted that in many cases, the circumstances that led to the failure of the original attempt to remove will have been quickly resolved and a subsequent removal attempt been successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/9">The Home Office publishes statistics on the number of persons removed and departed voluntarily from the UK on a quarterly and annual basis. National statistics on immigration and asylum are placed in the Library of the House and are available from the Home Office's Research, Development and Statistics website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-stats.html">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-stats.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.9/1">The UK is deeply concerned about ongoing hostilities in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Kimia II military operation, launched early in 2009, has provided mixed results. Limited progress has been made against Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), for instance reducing FDLR control of major regions, and its access to both markets and mines that have financed its activities. This has had a destabilising affect on the FDLR, with a subsequent increase in the number of FDLR personnel voluntarily going through the disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration (DDRRR) process (close to 1400 have done so this year, far more than in 2008).</p>
	<p pid="a.200.9/2">The downside to the activities of Kimia II has been the significant humanitarian costs, as the FDLR have carried out reprisals against civilian populations. According to a report by Human Rights Watch this month, 1400 civilians have been killed in military operations this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.9/4">The UK has been promoting a comprehensive approach to ending the conflict in eastern DRC. This approach has included non-military activity, such as providing support to the UN DDRRR process (for example, through providing communications equipment). We continue to lobby the Governments of DRC and Rwanda to implement the peace process fully. We are encouraged by-and fully supportive of-the recent rapprochement between DRC and Rwanda, and see this as an important step towards tackling the instability in the Kivus.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.9/5">The UK has also been active in addressing the underlying causes of instability in the region, including action against the illegal trading of minerals. Our development programmes in the region aim to support national reconciliation, tackle poverty, build economic prosperity and foster respect for human rights.</p>

This was followed by independent appraisal and consultation with key stakeholders on the review recommendations. A key finding of the review was that, while some bad authorities were performing well, the level of service was variable. It was concluded that a step change could only be achieved by making a single organisation responsible for both the assessment and payment of HE students' grants and loans coupled with other process and technological improvements. That decision was announced in a Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.6/1">We are determined to ensure that every young person who is not in education, employment or training (NEET) is given an opportunity to engage in learning so that they can develop the skills they will need for the upturn. We will be publishing shortly our strategy to increase the proportion of 16 to 24 year-olds in education, employment or training. <I>Investing in Potential</I> sets out the decisive action we have already taken to strengthen existing provision and new support to help young people engage in learning and work.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.6/2">The January Guarantee is one element of this, and will ensure that all 16 and 17 year-olds who are NEET in January 2010 have the offer of an Entry to Employment place. The Department for Children, Schools and Families will lead this initiative for young people in England. Education and training matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been devolved to the relevant administrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.6/3">The September Guarantee, of an offer of a suitable place in education or training, was implemented for 16 year-old school leavers in 2007 and extended to 17 year-olds in 2008. This has helped to support record levels of participation by both age groups. But, young people may become NEET throughout the year, with January a month when seasonal employment and short courses come to an end, and when young people realise that their initial choice was not right for them. Ongoing consultation with local authorities, Connexions providers and the Learning and Skills Council has highlighted the difficulty that young people can have in re-engaging in learning at this time and the department has already asked the Learning and Skills Council to make more courses available for young people becoming NEET in January.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.6/4">That is why we are extending the September Guarantee approach to 16 and 17 year-olds who are NEET in January to allow these young people to re-engage quickly in positive and productive learning, remaining motivated and engaged and reducing the risk of long-term disengagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.6/5">Information provided by Connexions shows that there were around 60,000 16 and 17 year-olds NEET in January 2009. Many of these young people will already have job or a place in learning to start in January, but we have estimated that the guarantee will draw an additional 10,000 16 and 17 year-olds into learning. Young people who are otherwise eligible will be offered education maintenance allowance to incentivise participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.6/6">A funding package of &#163;40 million is being made available to provide the additional 10,000 places, support for young people from Connexions Services, and education maintenance allowance. We will continue to monitor the economic and employment situation to ensure that we respond constructively to the needs of young people in the current economic climate.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.0/1">The department's policy is not to release any information that might lead to individual children being identified where data released could be combined with other data. As 74 local authorities identified a total of 51 home-educated children that were subject to child protection plans we are not able to release a breakdown of this data by local authority as the numbers for each individual authority would be very small and individual children might be identified. However, the department has provided a histogram setting out the spread of child protection plans by local authority and this can be found at (<a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/ete/independentreviewofhomeeducation/irhome">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/ete/independentreviewofhomeeducation/irhome</a> education/).</p>

	<p pid="a.212.2/1">We will continue to work with industry and the National Health Service to promote patient access to new technologies, but it is important to realise that not all technologies are appropriate for everyone-it is up to clinicians to make a decision in discussion with patients, about the most suitable treatment in each case.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/2">The Centre for Evidence-based Purchasing (CEP) provides independent, evidence-based information about innovative technologies across the entire range of medical devices available in health and social care today. It concentrates on projects where it is possible to make an impact upon the uptake of new technology or those cases where existing technology can be used in an innovative manner. In April 2009, they published an Evidence Review on implantable cardiac devices with remote monitoring facilities. One of their findings was that there was insufficient evidence to conclude whether or not investment in remote monitoring would yield direct cost savings for hospitals. A copy of this has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/3">In addition, in 2007 we established the NHS Technology Adoption Centre (NTAC), which works to identify and overcome the barriers to the uptake of innovative technologies that will improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. One of the projects that they are currently working on is cardiac resynchronisation therapy with remote patient monitoring. This project is about increasing the availability of advanced treatments, which can restore the normal co-ordinated pumping action of the heart, improving cardiac function in suitable people with moderate and severe heart failure. The role of remote monitoring technologies in the early detection of arrhythmias and its impact on follow up care are key components of this project. The findings from this project will be published by NTAC in May 2010 and disseminated across the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.5/2">Contracts with overseas companies would be drawn up under the appropriate national laws of contract and any business regulations that apply, and determining which country's legal/regulatory framework would take primacy would be a matter for the parties to the contract.

	<p pid="a.217.5/3">On UK retailers' contracts with domestic suppliers, the Competition Commission recently put in place a new Grocery Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP), which comes into effect in February 2010. This is part of the Competition Commission's recommended remedies to address problems identified in the UK groceries market concerning large grocery retailers passing on excessive risks and unexpected costs to suppliers. The GSCOP, which applies to large UK grocery retailers, requires that retailers keep better records of contracts with suppliers and incorporate the code into supply agreements which will be made available in writing to their suppliers. The code aims to prevent retrospective changes to agreed terms of supply and will extend to agreements between retailers and those who deal with them direct.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.6/1">VAT is a broad-based tax upon consumption, which operates within a framework of rules, which are agreed by unanimity within the European Union. This framework does not permit reduced rates of VAT to be charged for the repair or construction of all types of buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.2/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what percentage of people under the age of 25 are unemployed. (HL 502)</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/4">Estimates for unemployment are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). For the period July-September 2009 it was estimated that 12.8 percent of all persons under the age of 25 were unemployed. The rate of unemployment for people under the age of 25 as published in the <I>Labour Market Statistical Bulletin</I> is 19.8 percent. This estimate is based on the number of people who are unemployed divided by the number of people who are economically active, i.e. in employment or unemployed, in accordance with the International Labour Organization (ILO) convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/5">People aged 16 and over are classed as unemployed by the LFS if they are: without a job, want a job, and have actively sought work in the last four weeks; or, out of work, have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/6">As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>
