Higher-level training (for professional and expert qualifications) enables trusted translation; lower-level training enables linguists to undertake basic military business.

We frequently raise these issues with the Government of Cuba, both bilaterally and through the EU. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-23">23 February</phrase> the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs made a statement through her spokesperson expressing regret at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo. We strongly support this. In addition we continue to urge the Cuban Government to follow up on their invitation to Manfred Nowak, the UN special rapporteur on torture and cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment, by quickly setting dates for his visit and allowing him access to all detention facilities.</p>

President Kabila agreed and reaffirmed his stance on zero tolerance. I also discussed the application of conditionality in Amani Leo with the military of the DRC (FARDC) and UN mission in the DRC (MONUC) troops. I delivered our message in no uncertain terms that human rights abuses by FARDC will not be tolerated and that we will press hard for conditionality to be applied wherever necessary. I was assured by MONUC and FARDC commanders that this message is being delivered and that Amani Leo will be conducted differently to Kimia II. I heard how operations have been delayed in Bunyakari to allow MONUC to complete vetting of FARDC commanders to prevent similar cases occurring. However we will remain vigilant and will keep a close eye on the situation.</p>

Since those cases concluded, the civil legal aid funding code guidance has been revised, and there are now more stringent criteria for funding high-cost cases, as well as a presumption that legal aid will not be used to fund new scientific research.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.5/1">Teaching is a graduate-level profession and all new teacher trainees in most subjects since 1980-01, and all subjects from 1983-84, have had to have a degree. Records of teacher qualifications are not currently held centrally, although a new annual school workforce census has been introduced which will help to improve the quality of data in this area. The census will collect information on the level and subject of all post-A-level qualifications held by teachers in primary and secondary schools. The qualifications module of the census was piloted in autumn 2009 and the full roll out of the census is scheduled for autumn 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/2">Although comprehensive data about the qualifications of serving teachers are not currently collected, the department has a range of information available:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/3">the Secondary Schools Curriculum and Staffing Survey (SSCSS) provides information on the levels and subjects of qualification of secondary teachers. This is an occasional sample survey that is used to provide national estimates of the number of teachers by subject area. The survey was carried out in 1988, 1992, 2002 and most recently in 2007;in addition, the proportion of first year entrants holding a UK degree of classification 2:1 or higher forms part of the performance profiles dataset held by the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA); and the General Teaching Councils for England and Wales record information on teachers' qualifications upon entry into the profession, including degree subject and the level obtained. This information is not complete, however, particularly for all teachers qualified before 1986 and for a proportion since then (amounting to around 40 per cent of teachers in service). Qualifications achieved after the attaining of QTS are also missing. Consequently, an accurate assessment of teachers' qualifications is not considered reliable from these sources alone.</p>

The V&amp;A intends to display some of its musical instruments in their British galleries, the medieval and renaissance galleries and the new furniture gallery (due to open in 2012) and the new Europe 1600-1800 galleries (due to open in 2014). The museum is in discussion with other institutions to enter into partnerships to loan out parts of its musical instruments collection to keep them publicly available. The Horniman Museum is working closely with the V&amp;A to display some of the collection alongside its existing collection</p>
