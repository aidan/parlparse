Initially, we intend to set a threshold which broadly equates to that which applies under the current benefit system. Once universal credit is established, however, we will be able to vary that threshold such that some people are required to work longer hours, or earn more, than under current arrangements, reflecting a greater degree of individualisation that is possible under universal credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.5/1">The Ministry of Justice (which includes the National Offender Management Service) is working with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to consider options for introducing government buying standards (GBS) for food. This is intended to encourage the public sector to procure food in a manner that promotes sustainable development and does not discriminate against local and UK suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/2">The department and its contractors continue to look for opportunities to enable domestic producers to compete for supply contracts while seeking to achieve value for money for the taxpayer and for those using the services provided. For example, 46 per cent of all beef products and 65 per cent of mutton and lamb products purchased by NOMS are UK-reared.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/3">All products supplied to the MoJ must comply with all current and subsequent relevant UK and EU legislation, regulations and directives. The suppliers are required to provide products that are sourced in compliance with EC regulations and from assured providers under animal welfare conditions that are compatible with the UK animal welfare regulations. There are several reasons that the ministry, in particular NOMS does purchase products from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/4">First, EU rules require suppliers to meet a specification, and so long as this is met, the authority cannot stipulate where goods are purchased as this conflicts with one of the EU's stated purposes which is to ensure the free movement of goods between member states under normal conditions of competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/5">Secondly, the suppliers to NOMS Prison Service (for which there is the highest value of food spend within the ministry) source from a variety of countries to ensure consistent supply that complies with specifications, switching between these suppliers to ensure that goods are supplied in a cost-effective manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/6">Thirdly the domestic market does not always produce the required volume to the specification required. Bacon in the UK is primarily chilled and supplied to supermarkets. NOMS engaged in a costing exercise to understand the cost differential between UK-sourced bacon compared to the current product purchased in the volumes required to meet our demand. NOMS determined that the additional cost to the taxpayer would be in the region of &#163;245,000 per annum which is a 57 per cent increase in costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/7">The MoJ is committed to ensuring food procured meets British standards of production or their equivalent, wherever this can be achieved without increasing overall costs. The department is working closely with the supply base further to increase the volume of home-grown food used within prisons when compliant with specifications and within budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/8">MoJ does not hold information on the procurement arrangements for private prisons. A request for this information will need to be made directly with Defra to confirm where the information originated and contact made directly with the source.</p>

These allegations, while unproven, are damaging and tarnish the reputation of the UK as a country that believes in human rights, justice, fairness and the rule of law. As a part of those measures, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister commissioned an independent inquiry into UK involvement in the improper treatment of detainees held overseas in order to establish the facts behind those allegations and draw a line under the issues of the past.</p>

He outlined that the focus of the inquiry should be whether, and to what extent, the UK Government and their intelligence agencies were involved in improper treatment of detainees held by other countries in counterterrorism operations overseas. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister asked that the inquiry focus in particular on the aftermath of the attacks of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> and particularly cases involving the detention of UK nationals and residents in Guantanamo Bay.
