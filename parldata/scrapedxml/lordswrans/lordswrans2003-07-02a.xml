	<p pid="a.100.5/2">The agreement was signed on behalf of the ISAF rather than in a national capacity. Other European states contributing personnel to the ISAF both at the time and since are covered by the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/3">The agreement provides that &quot;ISAF and supporting personnel, including associated liaison personnel, may not be surrendered to or transferred to the custody of an international tribunal or other entity or state without the express consent of the contributing state&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/4">This is not inconsistent with the UK's commitment to co-operate with the ICC. The ICC's jurisdiction complements that of the states parties to the Rome Statute which set up the ICC. The UK is conscientious in enforcing respect for international humanitarian law among its service personnel. It is inconceivable that the UK would be unable or unwilling (as defined in Article 17 of the Rome Statute) to make its own investigation of an alleged offence within Afghanistan by a British member of ISAF, which might otherwise fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-07-02a.103.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="103"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030702/text/30702w02.htm#30702w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.103.3/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister carried out an internal review to assess how we could more closely involve the property sector in developing and taking forward our sustainable communities agenda. We also wanted to see how we could more effectively fulfil our role in liaising with the property and development industries, taking account of recent consultation about how best to consult across government on property issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/2">Among the major considerations in the review was the need to listen to the concerns of the property sector, to ensure that policy development takes account of market realities and to engage more fully with those able to deliver on our policy agenda. We decided that we need to overhaul our present machinery for consultation with the commercial property sector and to bring in those reponsible for funding and building new housing development, to ensure that we can address all aspects of our major plans for physical regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/3">This led us to the conclusion that we should replace our two existing bodies for consulting the commercial property sector, the Property Advisory Group and the Property Industry Forum, with a single new group, the Property Consultative Group. The Property Consultative Group will consist of representatives of the existing bodies on the Property Industry Forum, together with those from several other bodies, including house builders and funders. The group will meet regularly, with a Minister in the chair.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/4">The Property Consultative Group will be supplemented by working groups, which we will set up ad hoc to address particular issues in greater depth. The working groups will include other experts where this would be helpful as well as some of the members of the main group. They will give us continued access to high quality independent expert external advice, of the type that the Property Advisory Group has provided over a number of years. The scope to set up ad hoc working groups with a limited life span, and a membership specifically selected to address the remit of the group concerned, will give us more flexibility in obtaining advice on particular issues, especially those to do with the building of sustainable communities. Initially, we will be setting up working groups on funding and delivery mechanisms and on commercial property markets and leases.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/5">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Housing and Planning has paid tribute to members of the Property Advisory Group for their considerable help to the office. In particular, he has thanked Robin Broadhurst for chairing the group over the past five years. Mr Broadhurst's second period of appointment is now ending, and we considered this would be an appropriate time to make these changes. The Property Advisory Group has played an important part in telling us about developments in the property market and in helping to ensure that new policy takes account of market practice. Ministers are very grateful to members for all their hard work and commitment. We will want to include some individual members of the group on the new ad hoc groups we are establishing, and we look forward to working with them. The group's final meeting will take place on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-08">8 July</phrase> and we will shortly publish its final annual report.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/6">The new Property Consultative Group will begin work on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-15">Monday 15 September</phrase>, and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning looks forward to welcoming members to its first meeting. bjc</p>

	<p pid="a.108.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-24">24 June</phrase> last week, in another place, my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary informed the House that six Royal Military Police soldiers had been killed, and eight other United Kingdom service personnel had been wounded in incidents in Iraq earlier that day. Since then, we have been working hard to establish what took place. It may be some time before we have a full picture; indeed, we may never know with absolute certainty precisely what happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/2">However, we will do all we can to establish the facts, and to hold to account those responsible. Accordingly, we have launched an investigation, and the Special Investigation Branch has appointed a senior investigating officer. We are also looking at the wider, operational aspects of what took place, to determine whether there are any lessons we need to learn. It may be some time before this work is complete, and we do not therefore intend to respond to every piece of media speculation or conjecture in the interim.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/3">It would, however, be right for us to set out our current understanding of events leading up to, and on the day of the incidents themselves. In doing so we should point out that our understanding may change as new information comes to light.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/4">The RMP were engaged in assisting with the regeneration of the local Iraqi police service by ensuring that they had proper training, equipment and infrastructure to operate as professionally as possible. This task included routine visits to police stations in the area. The police station in Al Majarr Al Kabir is one of a number that the RMP planned to visit last Tuesday.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/5">Al Majarr Al Kabir is a town of approximately 60,000 people, situated to the south of Al Amarah, in Maysan province. The town has always been fiercely independent and was free of Saddam's regime by the time coalition forces reached it. The main focus of military operations in the area in recent weeks had been the implementation of a weapons amnesty, and thereafter, the recovery of illegal weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/6">These weapons searches were unpopular with the local population, although none had been conducted in the town itself. Local religious leaders had called for further searches to be resisted, and on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-22">22 June</phrase>, a 1 Para patrol in the town were faced with a hostile crowd of some 500 people. The soldiers fired baton rounds in order to enable them to be able to withdraw from the town. At a meeting the next day, officers from 1 Para agreed with the town council that weapons searches would be suspended, and that the council would itself take responsibility for recovering &quot;heavy&quot; weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/7">With this agreement in place, the following day the RMP section &quot;booked out&quot; at around 0910, planning to visit three towns in the area&mdash;Al Majarr Al Kabir being the first. Routine force protection measures in place required that they should all be armed, should have their body armour and helmets with them, should have working communications, and that there should be at least two vehicles&mdash;in fact they had three.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/8">We judge that they would have reached the town at around 0940&ndash;0955, shortly before a 1 Para patrol also entered the town. We cannot yet be certain, but it may be that the attack on the Para patrol took place before the attack on the RMP. The attack on 1 Para commenced at around 1030, when the patrol was stoned by a large crowd. At some point a crowd also appears to have massed outside the police station. While attempting to move their vehicles inside the police compound, the RMP came under fire, and it seems at least one of them was killed at that point. The crowd evidently then stormed the police station. British forces were informed a short while later by local Iraqis that all six of the RMP personnel had been killed.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/9">We understand that attempts were made to contact the RMP section as events unfolded. This is one of the details we will be trying to establish as part of the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/10">In the follow-up to these incidents, Iraqi leaders in the province are continuing to work closely with us. We will not lose sight of our overall aim to support a better Iraq, and an Iraq that is for the Iraqi people. British forces in Iraq continue to do an excellent job in taking this important work forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/11">As they do so, our thoughts remain with those that have lost their lives, and their loved ones who mourn them. Bill</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">The UK with eight other countries joined the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) in July 2001. The initiative foresaw a need for advanced nuclear energy systems in the future to help meet growing international demands for carbon free energy; and that to meet public concerns, future systems wherever deployed must meet exceptionally high standards of safety, sustainability and proliferation resistance, while operating economically in liberalised markets. The aim is to develop a framework for collaborative R&amp;D on Generation IV reactor systems that could be deployed from around 2030.

	<p pid="a.113.0/1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is currently developing a guideline on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary and secondary care. It is due to publish the guideline in 2004. In January 2003 the Respiratory Alliance published its guidance Bridging the Gap which aims to help primary care trusts to commission and deliver high quality allergy and respiratory care.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2">A wide range of patients can benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation. These include those with chronic lung diseases such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, or lung tumours. Most pulmonary rehabilitation programmes include medical management, education, emotional support, exercise, breathing retraining, and nutritional counselling. The objective is to help people to gain the highest level of function and independence possible, and to improve overall quality of life. Local British Lung Foundation Breathe Easy groups often reinforce pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. There is now research evidence showing pulmonary rehabilitation programmes improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/3">Information is not held centrally regarding the proportion of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who can access pulmonary rehabilitation. However, a recent survey by the British Lung Foundation and British Thoracic Society found that 160 out of 266 hospitals across the country provide some form of pulmonary rehabilitation to lung patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/4">Substantial new investment in both health and social care services were announced in the 2002 Budget. This amounts to the largest sustained increase in funding of any five-year period in the history of the National Health Service. Over the years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08, these plans mean that expenditure on the NHS in England will increase on average by 7.4 per cent a year over and above inflation&mdash;a total increase over the period of 43 per cent in real terms. This means that over the same five-year period, there will be an increase of &pound;34 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/5">It is the role of strategic health authorities, in partnership with primary care trusts, to decide what services to provide for their populations, including those with respiratory conditions. They are best placed to understand local health needs and commission services to meet them. bjc</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/1">The Government made a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-23">23 January 2003</phrase> Official Report, cols WS21&ndash;23, on the risk assessment work carried out following the two independent inquiries into the FMD outbreak, setting out the future work on bio-security and other issues they proposed and announcing their conclusions on the livestock movement regime to be put in place for the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/2">On the condition that the farming industry worked towards improved disease protection and control, the Government announced a move to a six-day standstill for cattle, sheep and goats from March. However, key elements of the regime lapse on <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-01">1 August</phrase>. The future standing arrangements therefore need to be determined now, in the light of the work done since that earlier decision, and other factors. The Risk Assessment</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/3">The Government now have two epidemiological reports based on different modelling techniques, an analysis of the costs of an outbreak and an integration report bringing these elements together in a formal cost benefit analysis. These are all independent reports which have been peer reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/4">The key lessons from this work are:</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/5" class="indent">the most significant single factor in reducing the size of an outbreak is early detection of disease;</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/6" class="indent">a 20-day standstill regime does not appear justified on cost benefit grounds unless more than one large outbreak every five years can be expected;</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/7" class="indent">a six-day standstill cannot be justified on cost benefit grounds alone unless outbreaks are expected more frequently than around one in 12 years (and on some assumptions they would need to be even more frequent);</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/8" class="indent">however, even if outbreaks occurred only once in 20 years, the six-day standstill is not greatly more expensive than a zero standstill policy; and standstill regimes do effectively reduce the size (and therefore the cost) of outbreaks, especially the more extreme outbreaks such as that in 2001. Other Factors</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/9">The Government do not believe that they can determine future arrangements solely on the basis of this cost/benefit analysis. There is a strong case for a standstill as part of the livestock movements regime on precautionary grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/10">The Government's veterinary advisors are clear that a longer standstill is more effective in capping disease outbreaks but a six-day standstill is better than zero days because it reduces the spread of disease and increases the chances of early detection. Any standstill regime would also help protect against the spread of other diseases and foster improved animal welfare more generally. The Decision</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/11">The Government therefore support a standstill period as a valuable long-term element in the movement regime. However, the cost/benefit analysis clearly shows that a return to the 20-day standstill for cattle, sheep and goats could only be justified under very unlikely scenarios. The Government have therefore decided that the standing regime from <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-01">1 August</phrase> should be based on a six-day standstill.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/12">The existing arrangements for pigs will continue, except that the arrival of a pig on a mixed holding will impose a 20-day standstill on any other pig on the holding, but only a six-day standstill on any cattle, sheep or goats there. Exceptions</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/13">The Government have listened carefully to arguments for specific exceptions to the general arrangements and have made some provisions where necessary. For this reason, an exemption was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-30">30 May</phrase> for show animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/14">The Government now propose to introduce a further specific modification to the regime to facilitate the autumn sale and trading of male breeding livestock. In future, male breeding rams and bulls may move onto a farm during the period August to November without triggering a general six-day standstill for the farm, so long as it goes into a Defra-approved isolation facility, provided that a six-day standstill applies to all livestock in that facility. Similarly they will be allowed to move from a farm under standstill to a market if placed in a Defra-approved isolation facility for six days beforehand. Similar arrangements will be put in place for goats. The Government believe that this new arrangement strikes the right balance between ensuring that farmers can trade successfully and ensuring that autumn breeder markets do not become a centre of disease spread. Detection and Biosecurity</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/15">The Government have made it clear that progress needs to be made to improve detection and biosecurity. They consulted recently on how to achieve this. As a result, from <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-01">1 August</phrase>, there will be a limit of 48 hours for animals staying on market premises. There will also be some minor changes to the legislation on empty vehicles leaving markets without first cleansing and disinfecting.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/16">Work on veterinary farm inspections, the presence of vets at markets, cleaning and disinfection at markets, the role of dealers and distance limits will continue over the coming months in the context of the Government's animal health and welfare strategy. In particular, we will investigate the proposals for a veterinary presence at markets and the possibility of annual veterinary visits to farms, as part of our draft action plan to take forward animal disease prevention and control in partnership with industry and other key stakeholders. We hope to consult on a draft plan in July 2003.</p>
