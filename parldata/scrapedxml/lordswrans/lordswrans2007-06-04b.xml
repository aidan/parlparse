In the last year, Animal Health has converted some 70 temporary veterinary positions into permanent posts, to bring the current veterinary staff complement to almost 300 full-time equivalents. A set baseline number for the agency may not be helpful at this time, given that the responsibilities of the agency will continue to change.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.14/1">The recently concluded court martial of Payne and others lasted for 94 days. Evidence was heard from many witnesses, a number of whom referred to conditioning for interrogation, hooding, stress positions and sleep deprivation. Some evidence was heard in camera. The use of hooding, stress positions or sleep deprivation for conditioning prior to interrogation is unlawful as contrary to the Geneva Conventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.14/2">These were issues of fact and law that would properly fall to be argued and determined as necessary in the court martial proceedings. In his summing up to the panel in the court martial on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-12">12 March 2007</phrase>, the Judge Advocate, Mr Justice McKinnon, said: &quot;It is not necessary to discuss the lawfulness of hooding and stress positions save to this extent: stress positions are generally accepted to be unlawful as contrary to the Geneva Conventions and the laws of armed conflict&quot;. He continued: &quot;It is common ground that hooding was acceptable at the material time for good security reasons but questions of its general acceptability would or might arise if it was used for long periods in the heat of Iraq or if it was used for the purposes of sensory deprivation. This case does not stand or fall on a consideration of hooding. The real issue relates to stress positions&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.17/2">In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, animal disease controls are put in place to prevent the spread of the infection to birds and to prevent potentially infected poultry meat from entering the food chain. This is to avoid the risk that such meat might present an animal health risk of spreading the disease. The Food Standard Agency's advice is that avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk to the United Kingdom consumer. Processing plants are permitted to obtain meat from areas outside animal disease control zones. Clear requirements for the handling and disposal of waste in meat processing plants are set out in existing hygiene and animal by-product legislation and are enforced by the Meat Hygiene Service and local authorities.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-06-04b.145.26" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="145"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70604w0001.htm#07060415000071">
	<p pid="b.145.26/1">The Government support offsetting as part of a hierarchy of actions, the most important being to reduce emissions. We acknowledge that carbon offsetting is not a cure for climate change, but it can help to raise awareness and to reduce the impact of our actions.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.26/2">The Government support the use of offsets generated by robust and verifiable mechanisms bound by international regulation. The Government's own offsetting schemes use the clean development mechanism (CDM), which can also be accessed by consumers through a variety of providers. We have also proposed that the CDM and other regulatory market offset mechanisms form the core of Defra's voluntary code of best practice for the provision of offsetting to UK customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.26/3">The CDM is supervised by an executive board, established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is responsible for full oversight and the release of certified emission reductions (CERs) to projects that have met the requirements of the CDM process. That process is multi-stage, employing stringent verification procedures to ensure the real value of the emission reductions generated.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.26/4">The carbon market is an essential part of the package to tackle climate change globally and is a crucial mechanism to help to drive the investment needed to reduce emissions cost-effectively. The market is growing rapidly and faces development issues, as any emerging market does. For example, there is a need for more investment, via the carbon market, in Africa. At the second meeting of parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP2) in Nairobi, there was a particular focus on enabling wider uptake of CDM projects&mdash;a &quot;Nairobi framework&quot; was agreed to facilitate investment in Africa. The UK, as the major focus of the carbon market, wants to work to connect market experts here with project developers in Africa as a contribution to this work.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.26/5">COP/MOP2 also encouraged further initiatives to help to build capacity to carry out projects and agreed measures aimed, for instance, at aiding easier development of small-scale CDM projects. We are also co-operating with colleagues in other countries to consider how we might link the EU-ETS, which is currently at the heart of the carbon market, to other emerging schemes and so work towards a truly global market for carbon.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.26/6">There is currently no regulation of businesses that sell carbon offsetting mechanisms. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-18">18 January</phrase>, Defra launched a consultation on a voluntary code of best practice for the provision of carbon offsetting to customers. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-13">13 April 2007</phrase> and the code of best practice is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.26/7">The purpose of establishing a code is to ensure consumer confidence in an emerging market and continued growth of that market through that confidence. The code will be voluntary and offset providers can choose whether to seek accreditation for all, or some, of their offsetting products.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.26/8">The code proposes that offset providers supply consumers with clear information and transparent prices. It is not for the Government to dictate prices for CO2 offsets, but there is a market price for carbon, established by the EU-ETS, which is available to the public as a point of reference.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.26/9">Defra plans to support the standard by providing guidance to consumers on offsetting, which will also help consumers to make informed decisions about their actions.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.29/1">The UKCIP02 national climate scenarios, published in 2002, were based on projections of future climate change using the Met Office Hadley Centre climate model. There are no plans to re-examine the range of climate models used by the Met Office for assessing UKCIP02. However, the next set of scenarios, UKCIP08, due to be published in 2008, will be based on projections from the Met Office model, augmented by results from other models around the world, including Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.32/1">The United Kingdom makes its contributions to the EC budget as a whole and not to individual spending programmes within it. There is not therefore a specific United Kingdom contribution to common agricultural policy spending. However, as has been done in the past, we can provide notional estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.32/2">We can estimate the UK consumer cost of the CAP by comparing the difference between UK and world prices for agricultural products and applying that difference to the volume of UK consumption. Our latest provisional estimate for 2005 is a consumer cost of approximately &pound;3.5 billion. Based on information contained in EC amending budget No. 6/2006, the notional United Kingdom taxpayer contribution to common agricultural spending in 2006 is &pound;4.2 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.32/3">Total expenditure on United Kingdom agriculture in 2006-07 from the EC budget was &pound;2.9 billion, and can be divided into the following categories:</p>
	<p pid="b.145.32/4">Market support&mdash;&pound;366 millionDirect aids&mdash;&pound;2.4 billion Rural development&mdash;&pound;163 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.32/5">On top of that, approximately &pound;763 million was spent on English agriculture by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.32/6">Responsibility for domestic agricultural spending is a devolved matter and advice on such expenditure needs to be sought from each of the devolved Administrations.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.35/1">There are no plans to set a national definition of business crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.35/2">Crimes against business are already recorded in crime statistics but are often grouped together with other, unrelated crimes. The aim is to measure these with consistency and accuracy. Crimes such as robbery of business property, theft from a shop, theft by an employee and different types of fraud are already counted separately in recorded crime statistics and work will continue to expand the range of these. Once a definition of commercial burglary has been agreed during 2007-08, this can be adopted by all police forces in their crime recording systems and in returns to the Home Office. The new commercial burglary definition will then be piloted in 2008-09 as part of the Home Office annual data requirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.38/1">A key aspect of regional business crime and fraud forums is that they are locally driven by those in the business community who wish to have them and are willing to support them.

	<p pid="b.145.98/1">Defra is leading government efforts to develop means of assessing the state and trends of ecosystem services and of taking the value of ecosystem services into account in decision-making. The department will publish an action plan by the end of 2007 for embedding an &quot;ecosystems approach&quot; to policy and decision-making on the natural environment in England, which will set out how Defra and partners will work towards more integrated management of the natural environment to deliver healthy ecosystems and a sustainable supply of ecosystem goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.98/2">Valuation of ecosystem services will be key to the success of this approach, and Defra will be publishing an introductory guide to valuation of ecosystem services in policy and project appraisals later this year to engage other government departments and agencies with this agenda. This is seen as a first step towards development of more specific guidance on the appraisal and valuation of ecosystem services, and further actions for appraisal and valuation guidance will be identified in the ecosystems approach action plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.116/159">Data from the United States had suggested that there was a link between ethnicity and prostate cancer, with black men more likely to develop prostate cancer. To investigate whether this was the same for England, we funded the PROCESS study (prostate cancer in ethnic subgroup) in 2002. This study has now been completed and shows that black men are three times more likely to develop prostate cancer compared with white men, but that they do not have worse outcomes. Follow-up studies are currently being devised and will help to advise how best to take this issue forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.176/2">The Government do not hold data on how much of this waste stream is collected by London boroughs. However, the City of London operates a hazardous waste collection service on behalf of 32 of the 33 boroughs. In addition, each waste disposal authority is required to provide facilities for the separate collection of all household waste. In terms of specific hazardous waste streams, industry estimates that in England above 90 per cent of lead acid batteries are separately collected, and approximately 85 per cent of waste oil is recorded as being separately collected. The remaining oil is believed to be used in small space heaters. Fridges, freezers and televisions are generally deposited at household waste recycling centres and consigned for treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.179/1">Sir Peter Gershon's review of public sector efficiency, published in July 2004, identified the opportunity for local government in England to achieve at least &pound;6.45 billion per annum of sustainable efficiency gains by 2007-08. This is equivalent to 7.5 per cent of its 2004-05 baseline expenditure. The spending review 2004 translated the outcome of the report into an efficiency target of 2.5 per cent a year over the next three financial years across the public sector. Every local authority will be expected to meet this target and is free to choose how best to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.179/2">There is no set requirement for efficiency gains in London's waste services as targets have not been set for individual local services. This recognises the fact that individual authorities will have made more progress in achieving efficiency gains in certain sectors than others.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.179/3">Information on gains achieved by councils in 2006-07 will not be reported until the autumn. However, London boroughs have confirmed that they achieved &pound;33 million of efficiency gains each year in environmental services by the end of 2005-06 and have forecasted that &pound;54 million will have been achieved by the end of 2006-07. This represents 22 per cent of the total efficiencies posted in environmental services&mdash;3 per cent greater than London's 19 per cent share of English authorities' total waste management and street cleansing expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.181/2" qnum="HL3808">Whether, in pursuance of their objectives to encourage the conservation of energy and to reduce the incidence of carbon emissions and the weight and volume of domestic refuse, they will open discussions with newspaper and magazine publishers to achieve a reduction in the number of newspaper supplements, free newspapers and magazines and the frequency of their delivery.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-06-04b.145.182" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="145"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70604w0006.htm#07060415001112">
	<p pid="b.145.182/1">The Government have voluntary agreements with the newspaper, periodical publishing and direct marketing industries, which are intended to lessen their contribution to carbon emissions and waste. The agreements are designed to improve recycling rates and recycled content of such media and to allow more effective &quot;opt-out&quot; services for the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.182/2">The Government and the Newspaper Publishers Association (NPA) reached a voluntary agreement in April 2000 to increase the recycled content of newsprint, signing up to targets to reach 60 per cent by the end of 2001, 65 per cent by the end of 2003 and 70 per cent by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.182/3">The industry has exceeded these targets year on year, achieving 63.5 per cent by the end of 2001, 68.6 per cent by the end of 2003 and an industry estimated rate of 80.6 per cent in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.182/4">The Government also signed a voluntary agreement with the Periodical Publishers Association (PPA) in November 2005, to increase the rate of magazine recycling through a number of initiatives. The PPA, which represents around 90 per cent of publishers in the UK, agreed to raise recycling levels to 50 per cent by 2007, 60 per cent by 2010 and 70 per cent by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.182/5">As part of the agreement, the PPA will work with local authorities with the aim of increasing the rate of magazine recycling and providing advertising and editorial space for promoting magazine recycling initiatives. It will also use the Waste and Resources Action Programme's (WRAP) recycling logo in a prominent place in its magazines (the target coverage for this logo is 95 per cent of PPA membership by the end of 2006) and will work with WRAP on a study into barriers to using recycled content in magazines.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.182/6">The recycling rate of magazines was estimated to be 40 per cent (270,000 tonnes) in 2003. A recent report by the PPA estimated the recycling rate to be 45 per cent in 2005, which equates to around 302,000 tonnes.</p>
	<p pid="b.145.182/7">To reduce the volume of direct mail, the Government signed a voluntary agreement with the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) in July 2003, which set recycling targets to increase the recycling of direct mail to 70 per cent by 2013. The agreement also encourages producers of direct mail to avoid using materials that contaminate the recycling process. In addition, the agreement aims to improve the targeting of direct mail, thereby reducing the volume of mail distributed in the first place by encouraging the use of suppression files. These files list people who have opted out of receiving direct mail.</p>
