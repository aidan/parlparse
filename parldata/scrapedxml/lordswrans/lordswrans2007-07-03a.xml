	<p pid="a.173.8/1">A number of women (92) refused their evening meal on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May</phrase> as a result of unfounded rumours regarding the new contractor, Serco Ltd, which was awarded the contract to operate Yarl's Wood on behalf of BIA. The contract director communicated widely with detainees and the majority resumed eating the following day. There have been no large-scale refusals to take meals at Yarl's Wood since <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/2">Procedures are in place at all removal centres for case holders to be informed of any allegations of rape and/or torture that are made by detainees. We would not be able to confirm the percentage figure of those women who had reported previous rape as this would involve checking each individual case at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/3">Both the Legal Services Commission and Bail for Immigration Detainees hold regular workshops for detainees at Yarl's Wood and the centre library has information on legal representation which can be accessed by detainees.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/4">The contract that exists between the Home Office and Serco outlines the Border and Immigration Agency's requirements in regard to the services provided to detainees. The contract is underpinned by an ethos of improving services to the detainees both in terms of care and safety. A bi-weekly meeting is in place to support direct communication between detainees and the managers of the centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/5">Of those leaving detention in May, the average length of stay was between seven and 10 days. People are detained only for as long as is necessary and for the shortest period possible. Those detained immediately prior to removal would usually be held for no more than a few days. However, on occasions people are detained for longer periods, usually while awaiting travel documentation from their respective embassies or where a removal has failed and a subsequent removal is being organised.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.5/1">The School Governance (Parent Council) (England) Regulations 2007 apply only to majority governance trust schools because in these schools there is a reduction in the number of elected parent governors. It is for the governing bodies of the schools concerned to decide if they wish to have such a trust. All other maintained schools are free to establish a parent council in any way that they choose, or not to do so, if they so wish. Generally, schools have systems in place to consult parents but a parent council provides an additional route for parents to put forward their views. We do not believe that the regulations will result in a greater workload for schools' governing bodies.</p>
