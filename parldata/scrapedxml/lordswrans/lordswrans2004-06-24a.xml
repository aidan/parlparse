In England and Wales the police funding formula, by which police grant is allocated, reflects the relative needs of all police authorities. There is no component of the funding formula directly related to mountainous geography of any police force area. The funding formula is established and maintained in consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Association of Police Authorities (APA) and any significant issues are taken into account when the funding formula is reviewed. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is always prepared to consider requests for a special grant payment when a police authority is faced with a particularly extraordinary funding pressure on a specific issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.3/1">Management information indicates that on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-27">27 March 2004</phrase>, 30 children were in detention who were detained solely under Immigration Act powers. Twenty-five (83 per cent) of those had been in detention for 14 days or less and the remainder had been detained for less than six months. These individuals were all detained as part of families whose detention as a group was considered necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/2">Records show that all children held in detention under immigration law for a period greater than 28 days since <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-16">16 December 2003</phrase> have been subject to ministerial authorisation. Outcomes of the cases detained for a period greater than 28 days vary according to the circumstances of individual cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/3">Detention of families with children is used sparingly, usually to effect removal, and only where this is judged to be necessary on the basis of the individual circumstances of the case. Close scrutiny of cases involving families with children ensures that removal is effected as early as possible or, where this is not feasible, that the family is released from the removal centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.5/1">Information on individual cases is confidential and cannot be divulged without the expressed consent of the individuals concerned. This is due to the Home Office's legal obligation under common law, human rights and data protection legislation, and the treatment of private and personal information under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (paragraph 2 of Part II).</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/2">Government policy on the use of detention is that it may normally be appropriate:</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/3" class="indent">to effect removal;</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/4" class="indent">initially to establish a person's identity or basis of claim; or</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/5" class="indent">where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with any conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/6">In addition, asylum applicants may be detained as part of the fast-track asylum process if it appears that their applications are straightforward and capable of being decided quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/7">As with any case, there is a presumption in favour of granting temporary admission or temporary release to families with children wherever possible. There will be occasions when temporary release is not considered appropriate. In these cases detention is necessary in the interests of maintained effective immigration control.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/8">Cases involving families with children in detention are dealt with as expeditiously as possible to ensure that the period of detention is kept to a minimum. Cases of families with children detained for more than 28 days are subject to ministerial authorisation. Such cases are small in number and by their nature tend to be exceptional.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/9">Unfortunately in some cases, the detention of families with children is prolonged as removal is deliberately disrupted by resistive behaviour by some family members or through deliberately belated legal challenges.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.2/1">To support the top-to-bottom review of the immigration system called for by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary set up managed migration taskforces.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">The taskforces work across the whole of Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) and with other departments and stakeholders to identify and address any areas of abuse of managed migration routes, drawing on intelligence, the experience of front-line staff and management information from across the system. In this way, the department is building on what worked to reduce abuse of the asylum system in a comprehensive monitoring and reporting framework. This will allow resources to be properly directed to target potential abuse even before problems arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">Based on the work to date, we have already announced a number of steps to tackle abuses of the marriage, students and employment routes. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4" class="indent">To date the student taskforce has visited 401 colleges about which we had suspicions and applications to those institutions clearly found to be bogus are now being refused. A registration scheme is being established for genuine colleges and will be operational by the turn of the year. Once this has been done, student visas will not be issued in respect of colleges not on the register.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/5" class="indent">To tackle the increasing problem of sham marriages being used to circumvent immigration controls, the Government are bringing forward legislation to establish powers to restrict the authorisation of marriages involving foreign nationals from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to designated register offices and to introduce a pre-marriage eligibility requirement for such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/6" class="indent">Based on the analysis and recommendations of the employment and business taskforce, the sectors-based scheme quota has been cut for the year beginning <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-01">1 June 2004</phrase>. The scheme has been reduced from a total of 20,000 to 6,000 in food processing and 9,000 in hospitality. The Government have also announced that the seasonal agricultural workers scheme quota will be reduced in 2005 by 35 per cent. These cuts reflect the proportion of the previous year's quotas taken up by workers from the accession countries, who are now entitled to come and work in the UK under the worker registration scheme. The taskforce is currently consulting on introducing country-specific quotas which will be dependent on countries having satisfactory returns agreements with the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/7">We are consulting with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) at the NGO quarterly meetings, which discuss developments in European and international asylum policy. This group is made up of representatives from bodies including UNHCR, the Refugee Council, the Scottish Refugee Council, Amnesty International, Oxfam and Refugee Action. Ministers also have regular meetings with the chief executive of the Refugee Council and UNHCR to discuss issues of concern relating to immigration and asylum.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/8">Further, the marriage taskforce has formed a cross-governmental joint working group made up of officials from the offices of the registrars general for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, the Church of England, LACORS, and registrars from across the UK. The group is working on identifying strengths and weaknesses of current systems and will facilitate the introduction of the aforementioned designated centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/9">The student taskforce has held key meetings with stakeholders in the education sector, including Lord Tomlinson's group of blue chip private colleges. Workshops have been organised with the sector to discuss how best to implement arrangements for notifying us of overseas students who fail to turn up for, or drop out of, a course, as well as for strengthening the fees requirement for applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.5/1">The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended).

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the interpretation of the definition of waste and the meaning of &quot;discard&quot;. It rests in the first place with the producer of a substance to decide whether it is being discarded as waste.

However, whether it is in fact waste within the meaning of the directive must be determined in the light of all the circumstances, regard being had to the aim of the directive and the need to ensure that its effectiveness is not undermined.&quot;</p>
