	<p pid="a.158.0/5">GAD estimates that if backdating to 1988 were granted for calculating pensions for surviving civil partners of members of public service schemes the cost would be a capital addition of &pound;125 million to the liabilities of those schemes on the high take-up assumptions in the RIA, which assumes that same-gender couples form civil partnerships at one-tenth of the rate that opposite gender couples form marriages.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/6">If the propensity to form civil partnerships were the same as the propensity to form marriages amongst opposite gender couples, which was the high take-up assumption in the June 2003 consultation document, the cost would be a capital addition of &pound;1.25 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">In practice, decisions by executive directors in both the World Bank and IMF are rarely taken through recourse to formal voting, with the emphasis being placed instead on reaching an informal consensus; and this approach is particularly common for project and programme loans. Nevertheless, in line with the UK Government's wider commitment to transparency in international financial institutions the Government are taking action to make the positions taken by the UK at these meetings more public. HM Treasury already provides broad details of the positions taken in IMF board discussions in its annual report to Parliament on the IMF. However, such information is not currently available for the World Bank, and the Secretary of State for International Development has therefore asked officials to provide a short annual statement to Parliament on UK positions in the World Bank Board, starting with those taken in the bank's financial year 2004 (ending on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="a.159.5/1">The UK has stressed that support to low-income countries must be linked to poverty reduction and we have strongly supported the development of the poverty reduction strategy (PRS) process. Poverty reduction strategies have become central to the international development agenda, setting out a clear, country-led strategy upon which donor support can be built. They set key policy priorities for low-income countries in the medium term, and make linkages to budgets and spending. This ensures that government revenue, aid, and debt relief from the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative are directed towards poverty reduction. The PRS approach has involved substantial changes in World Bank and IMF operations, with their programmes being framed by, and providing support to, these nationally led development plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/2">The basic principle of the PRS approach is national ownership, as a government will only implement policies that they believe in. The PRS therefore has to be written in country, by its government, with the full involvement of civil society, the private sector and the international community. Taken together, this should ensure that these strategies have the widest possible support in country. This participatory nature of a PRS is one of the requirements for it to be approved by the boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as a basis for their lending. Some governments have included participation of national parliaments as well as civil society in their PRS process. In cases such as Tanzania where the PRS has ensured a significant role for Parliament, the part it has played is considered an important investment in the country's democratic process. There can however be a tension between the sovereign right of a government to set the policy agenda in line with the constitutional procedures in place in that country, and external parties insisting on participatory policy processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/3">While we have no doubt that the PRS approach is a major step forward in the relationship between the international financial institutions and low-income countries, we recognise that the process is still at a relatively early stage of implementation and may require further improvements in its design and application. We therefore look forward to the results due later this year of the reviews of the PRS process by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office and the World Bank's Operations Evaluations Department. The UK will play a full part in discussions on these issues and will continue to monitor the practice of the IMF and World Bank to ensure their guidelines are effective and also adhered to in practice. The UK Government are committed to maximising country ownership of PRSs and ensuring that World Bank and IMF programmes are fully aligned behind them.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.2/1">The RCEP's report <i>The Environmental Effects of Civil Aircraft in Flight</i> was its response to the Government's 2002 consultation on the future development of air transport in the UK. The Secretary of State for Transport met the chairman of the RCEP, Sir Tom Blundell, in March 2003 to discuss the report. The report was one of over 500,000 responses to the consultation, which informed decisions on <i>The Future of Air Transport</i> White Paper published in December 2003.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-06-25a.168.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="168"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040625/text/40625w03.htm#40625w03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.168.0/1">Cameras operated by Safety Camera Partnerships are used solely for the detection of excess speed at accident hotspots. They are not used to detect other driver or vehicle related offences. Consequently there is no information on the number of vehicles untaxed, with no current MOT or insurance detected by these cameras.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/2">We have no plans to ask Safety Camera Partnerships to check with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), or the Motor Insurance Database to confirm that vehicles detected by their cameras are properly taxed and insured. The Government introduced continuous registration on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>, which allows the DVLA to detect and enforce vehicle excise duty (VED) offences direct from the computerised vehicle record. It is no longer necessary to observe or record a vehicle on the road in order to take action. We are looking at the possibility of enforcing the law on motor insurance in a similar way, and will make an announcement in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/3">Local authorities normally seek information from DVLA on registered vehicle keepers in order to enforce parking offences. In return, traffic wardens and local authority parking attendants inform DVLA of suspected cases of VED evasion observed in the normal course of their duties. Moreover, 304,927 such offences were reported to DVLA in 2003&ndash;04. These reports are used to supplement the enforcement of continuous registration and allow the DVLA to pursue offenders for unpaid back duty.</p>
