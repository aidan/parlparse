	<p pid="a.116.6/2">Following a crackdown on the peaceful opposition in March 2003, the EU&mdash;in line with the common position&mdash;condemned Cuba's actions and adopted a series of measures that reflected our human rights concerns. The Cuban response to these measures was to reject all EU development aid, and to freeze contact with EU embassies in Havana. Despite this, British-funded programmes and projects with Cuba remain very active.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.3/1">The UK, along with EU partners, adopted a common position on Cuba in 1996. This is a clear statement of the existing EU policy of constructive engagement to achieve political and economic reform; progress on which is the key to improved EU/Cuba relations. The common position has stood unchanged since 1996, and was re-evaluated on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-15">15 June 2004</phrase>. The common position identifies that:</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/2" class="indent">&quot;the main objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/3">We see a relationship based on constructive engagement as the best way to achieve this. EU member states are the biggest investors in Cuba and its major partners in trade and tourism. The UK and other member states have shown strong commitment to such engagement.</p>

But the BBC does receive some EU funding for some specialised educational and support material (such as basic literacy and IT skills training for adults). For the period 2000&ndash;03, the BBC expected to be paid &pound;375,828 by the European Social Fund to help to pay for community outreach work (workshops, publicity, telephone support, databases) among learners and tutors using the BBC's online Skillswise and WebWise sites, which provide literacy, numeracy and IT skills resources. For the period 2003&ndash;04, the BBC is expecting to receive a sum of between &pound;130,961 and &pound;139,959 in support of a pilot project which provides specially versioned online resources (basic skills and English as a second language) which are being used in community centres, learning centres (including UK online centres) and colleges.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.2/1">The information requested is not held centrally. However, a trawl of departments has produced the following information. Documents are also issued for internal departmental use only. However there may be circumstances where outside organisations have accepted these as proof of identity. Individual departments should be able to provide more information if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/2">The United Kingdom Passport Service, an executive agency of the Home Office, issues passports to British nationals in the UK. British passports are issued at the discretion of the Secretary of State by exercise of Royal prerogative, in line with the British Nationality Acts. A passport is issued only after an applicant's nationality status and identity has been confirmed, and is accepted throughout the world as proof of these.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/3">In the UK, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office issues diplomatic identity cards, which prove that the holder is a serving foreign diplomat in the UK. Overseas, the FCO issues the following documents: passport; birth certificate; death certificate; certificate of British nationality&mdash;issued to a host government when a British citizen in that country has no acceptable ID; declaration of identity (GV3)&mdash;issued to a foreign national travelling to the UK who cannot hold a recognised passport.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/4">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), an executive agency of the Department for Transport, and part of its Driver Vehicle and Operations (DVO) group, issues provisional and full driving licences. The Driving Standards Agency requires the licence to be produced to show entitlement to undertake a test of competency to drive. Other organisations, in both the public and private sector, accept a driving licence as proof of identity.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/5">Within the Department for Transport, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issues a warrant pass to all inspectors of air accidents. These are used as proof of identity and detail the inspector's powers. The Marine Accidents Investigation Branch also issues identity cards to all its inspectors, which list their powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/6">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency, an executive agency of DfT, issues the following documents that refer to a seafarer's identity: British seaman's card; discharge book; certificate of competency. Currently none is officially an identity document, but may be accepted as a form of identification in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/7">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs issues it own identity card to those officers who exercise statutory powers, for example inspectorates and veterinary officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/8">In the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 11 fire inspectors are issued with identity cards as are 350 planning inspectors. In both cases the cards are for identification purposes and give no right of access.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/9">The Department for Work and Pensions has issued guidance to help people to prove their identity for social security purposes. They list the following as papers which can be used to help to prove identity.</p>
