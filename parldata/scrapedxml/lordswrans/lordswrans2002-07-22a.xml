The SAR Government have committed themselves to undertake wide public consultation on the content of possible legislation, but have yet to announce any timetable for the consultation exercise or for the introduction of legislation. Her Majesty's Government welcome the commitment by the SAR Government to consult widely and consider it essential that any legislation is consistent with international human rights treaties.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">No individual will be dealt with under the proposed legislation who does not meet all the conditions set out in Clause 6 of the draft Mental Health Bill. It is not a matter of different people being caught under different conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/2">The clause relates to the use of compulsory powers. Subsections (2) to (5) set out the four conditions which must be satisfied in all respects before any power to impose compulsory examination, assessment or treatment can be used. So these conditions and this clause relates to all those who come under compulsory powers, not just mentally disordered offenders or those who are a risk to others.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/3">It is estimated that, in total 26,774 persons per annum could fall within Clause 6 of the draft Bill. The best evidence for this estimate comes from the operation of the Mental Health Act 1983 in relation to the 26,650 formal admissions to hospital recorded in 2000&ndash;01. In addition, however, forecasts derived from the Office for National Statistics Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of Prisoners indicate that 124 persons per annum could fall within Clause 6 as a result of being at substantial risk of serious harm to other persons due to a severe personality disorder. The latter group could fall outside the 1983 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/4">Central statistical databases do not hold information on the criminal convictions of all people admitted under the Mental Health Act 1983, other than for restricted patients and persons given unrestricted hospital orders by the courts. This additional information could be collected only at disproportionate cost. It is therefore not possible to estimate the total number of persons subject to Clause 6 of the draft Bill who do not have a criminal conviction for a serious offence. However, it is estimated that, of restricted patients and persons given unrestricted hospital orders admitted to hospital in 2000 under the 1983 Act, 664 were admitted for non-sexual or non-violent offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/5">As indicated above, 124 persons per annum could fall within Clause 6 as a result of being at substantial risk of serious harm to other persons due to a severe personality disorder and could fall outside the 1983 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/6">In relation to the number of serious crimes commited each year it is not possible to determine the number of crimes committed by those falling within the draft Bill because some crimes are undetected by the authorities. Central statistical databases also do not record the criminal convictions of all persons subject to the 1983 Act. However, of the restricted patients admitted and the number of persons given unrestricted hospital orders by the courts under the 1983 Act, in 2000 a total of 929 had been charged or convicted of a sexual or violent offence (including arson). It is not possible to determine the number of serious crimes committed by those who have no criminal conviction for a serious offence for the reasons stated above. Two hundred sexual or violent convictions are estimated to be recorded per annum by those at substantial risk of serious harm to other persons due to a severe personality disorder. The latter group could fall outside the 1983 Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.5/1">Where the error in prosecution disclosure comes to light before or during the trial, the court will usually seek to rectify this by ordering the prosecution to disclose to the defence the relevant unused prosecution material. It is also open to the court to accept an abuse of process argument raised by the defence and stay the proceedings. The court also has power to order costs against the prosecution for any time wasted if prosecution disclosure was delayed. In addition, where the prosecution fails to comply with its primary disclosure requirements, the defence is released from the duty to make defence disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/2">Where the error comes to notice following conviction, this may be raised by the defence as part of an appeal. In these circumstances, if the Court of Appeal considers that the effect of the failure in prosecution disclosure is to render the conviction unsafe, it may quash the conviction and may also order a retrial.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/3">If an error in prosecution disclosure was attributable to an individual police officer, it would be open to the chief constable to institute disciplinary proceedings against the officer concerned. If the prosecution disclosure failure was the subject of a formal complaint against the police, it would be open to the Police Complaints Authority to recommend initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the officer concerned if appropriate.</p>

They will also make it possible for community support officers and accredited persons to have a limited power to stop and direct traffic specifically for this purpose.

That is why the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 requires each area to publish a report detailing the work it has done in the past year.

	<p pid="a.8.2/1">The following responses are listed by department.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/2">The Home Office:</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/3">Since August 1997 the Research, Development and Statistics Directorate of Home Office has commissioned the following data series (including further exercises of regular on-going surveys):</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/4" class="indent">(i) The 2001 Home Office Citizenship Survey collects information on sex, race, disability and age. Reports on the Citizenship Survey planned for 2002 will analyse the data by sex, race and ethnicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/5" class="indent">(ii) The 2000 sweeps of the British Crime Survey incorporated ethnic &quot;booster samples&quot;. This has allowed the experience of ethnic minorities with respect to both crime victimisation risk and other experience and views regarding the police and other parts of the CJS. From January 2001 the BCS has moved to an annual cycle with a permanent ethnic boost.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/6" class="indent">(iii) From <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase> the information collected by the Home Office on police arrests was extended to provide information for persons arrested for notifiable offences by ethnic appearance of suspect gender, age group and offence group.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/7" class="indent">(iv) From <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> police forces have been asked to provide returns on the number of racist crimes recorded by ethnic appearance of victim, offence group, age group and gender of victim and detection rate. Currently this return is voluntary and it is currently proposed that it will become mandatory from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/8">In addition to new data series the Government, through various departments, have commissioned, conducted themselves or contributed to a number of one-off or time-limited exercises, yielding information including one or more of these dimensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/9">Department for Education and Skills:</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/10">Statistics published by the Department for Education and Skills routinely include breakdowns by gender and age, except (in the latter case) where they relate to programmes for children or young people of a specific age (for example national curriculum assessments).</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/11">In the early years and childcare field, a number of survey series have been introduced since 1997. The topics covered include parents of three and four year-old children and their use of early years services, parents' demand for childcare and the childcare workforce. The data collected include gender, age, ethnicity and disability, and analyses are published accordingly where sample sizes allow.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/12">Since 1997 the department has developed and implemented a Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC), collecting far more detailed data than hitherto from maintained schools. Data were collected for all maintained school pupils for the first time in January 2002 and are being linked with their key stage and examination achievements as they occur. These data will allow far more detailed investigation of the impact of gender, ethnicity, special educational needs and other factors on the experiences and achievements of school pupils and new analyses or series will be published from this source in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/13">Since 1997 the department has introduced several new statistical series on young people and adults embarking on government-supported training, their qualification achievements and subsequent destinations. These include breakdowns by some or all of gender, ethnicity, disability and literacy/numeracy need.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/14">In 2000 a new series was introduced on the level of highest qualification held by young people and adults of working age, including breakdowns by gender, age and ethnicity. This was a new analysis of data from the long-standing Labour Force Survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/15">The department, in collaboration with the Office for National Statistics and the Department for Work and Pensions, introduced the English Local Labour Force Survey in 2000, a new annual exercise expanding on the Labour Force Survey. First results from the enlarged survey were published in 2001, including a wide range of qualifications and labour market analyses with breakdowns by gender, age, ethnicity and disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/16">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs:</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/17">The June Agriculural Census collects data on employment in agriculture and horticulture broken down by gender, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) also runs a survey which collects information on the earnings of these workers by gender. However, no new questions were introduced with the creation of Defra. In 2003 a labour survey will be conducted as part of the EC farm structure surveys. This will ask questions broken down by age and gender.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/18">Defra's draft Equality Scheme, required under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act, sets out the actions required to meet the duty, and over time it is possible that this will lead to the commissioning of new data series on ethnicity if this is identified as being necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/19">Internally, data are collected on gender, disability, age and race. Personnel procedures which may have an impact on applicants and staff are monitored, broken down by gender race, and disability and sometimes also by age. A new monitoring programme is being finalised which will take account of the requirements of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act and, as far as possible, forthcoming legislation on sexual orientation, religion and age.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.5/1">The policy on the exercise of discretion in safe third country cases where family ties to the United Kingdom are claimed is that potential third country cases would normally have their asylum claims considered substantively in this country where:</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/2" class="indent">(a) an applicant's spouse is in the United Kingdom;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/3" class="indent">(b) the applicant is an unmarried minor and a parent is in the United Kingdom;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/4" class="indent">(c) the applicant has an unmarried minor child in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/5">The policy in (a) would not be applied in cases where a marriage was contracted after the applicant's arrival in the United Kingdom. In all cases &quot;in the United Kingdom&quot; is to be taken as meaning with leave to enter or remain or on temporary admission to this country as an asylum seeker prior to an initial decision on their application.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/6">Discretion may be exercised according to the merits of the case where:</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/7" class="indent">(d) a married minor was involved but the criteria in (b) or (c) above were otherwise fulfilled. (We would be less likely to consider cases under (c) than (b) under these circumstances);</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/8" class="indent">(e) the applicant was an elderly or otherwise dependent parent;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/9" class="indent">(f) the family link was not one which would normally be considered but there was clear evidence that the applicant was wholly or mainly dependent on the relative in the United Kingdom and that there was an absence of similar support elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/10">We would expect cases falling into this latter category to be rare.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/11">Factors which might influence the exercise of discretion in these cases such as language, cultural links or the number of family members in the United Kingdom may have a bearing, but there would need to be a compelling combination of such factors to ensure the exercise of discretion in favour of an applicant.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/12">Cases citing family ties which would not normally be considered and which did not display any of the features which engaged the exercise of discretion would not normally be considered substantively. This means that a brother who was not dependent on his sibling(s) would not normally have his case considered here, no matter how strong his cultural or linguistic links with the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/13">The intention of the policy is to re-unite members of an existing family unit who, through circumstances outside of their control, had become fragmented. However, we emphasise that where the relationship did not exist prior to the person's arrival to the United Kingdom, the policy would be applied only in the most exceptionally compelling cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/14">We are satisfied that this policy complies with the United Kingdom's obligations as regards the European Convention on Human Rights and that it is consistent with our obligations under the Dublin Convention, as set out in Article 1 of Decision 1/2000 of the committee set up by Article 18 of the Dublin Convention concerning the transfer of responsibility for family members in accordance with Article 3(4) and Article 9 of the convention.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">The enhanced highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative agreed at Cologne in 1999 makes provision for the cancellation of around 100 billion US dollars of debt, of which 28 billion dollars is provided through traditional debt relief mechanisms and 11 billion dollars through additional bilateral debt relief over and beyond HIPC terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">Under the HIPC initative, a country receives interim debt relief on payments due when it reaches decision point, and subsequently the debt is irrevocably cancelled at completion point. Of the 42 countries classified as HIPCs, four are currently expected to have a sustainable burden of debt after traditional debt relief and one has so far not opted to apply for debt relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/3">Of the remaining 37 countries, 26 have now reached decision point with 62 billion dollars in debt relief committed compared with the 100 billion dollars total. Six of these countries, Bolivia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Burkina Faso and Mauritania, have reached completion point and have had total debts of around 13 billion dollars cancelled, excluding traditional debt relief and additional bilateral voluntary debt relief. Out of 11 countries yet to reach decision point, eight are affected by conflict and this makes their progress in the HIPC initiative difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/4">In April 2002 the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank estimated that, subject to progress under their poverty reduction strategy process and IMF programme, over the next 12 months (ie by mid-2003) 12 countries could reach completion point: Benin, Cameroon, Chad, The Gambia, Guinea, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger and Rwanda. At completion point these countries could have total debts of around 14 billion dollars cancelled, excluding traditional debt relief and additonal bilateral voluntary debt relief.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.8/1">We welcome the Audit Commission's report on housing benefit (HB) administration. Its emphasis on partnership and simplification is very much in tune with our current policy initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/2">We are determined to work with local authorities to drive up standards of service, tackle fraud and error, reduce barriers to work and tackle social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/3">In March last year we established a help team to work in partnership with local authorities to support them in improving the administration of HB. We are already seeing real improvements resulting from the team's work.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/4">In addition, we have set up a help fund to support local authorities by providing funding for locally-led initiatives to improve the administration of HB. For the financial year 2001&ndash;02, a total of &pound;1,637,570 was awarded, which benefited over 200 authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/5">We also want to help more authorities deliver a high standard of HB service by sharing good practice. We have now introduced a dedicated website for local authorities and have also distributed on CD a housing benefit manager's service improvement &quot;toolkit&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/6">In April this year we published for the first time performance standards for the full range of HB administration. These standards provide authorities with a definition of what they should be delivering.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/7">The spending review announced by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on <phrase class="date" code="">15 July</phrase> includes the biggest investment in HB administration since the scheme began in 1988. Starting with &pound;40 million this year, we are investing an extra &pound;200 million over three years to help local authorities meet the performance standards in delivery of HB.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/8">From April 2003 all local authorities currently complying with the verification framework will receive a 50 per cent increase in their funding allocation for this work. In addition, any authority seeking to become compliant now or in the near future will also receive 50 per cent more than they otherwise would have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/9">We will continue to review local authorities core administration subsidy each year and we will fund the set-up and ongoing costs of implementing the changes needed to bring in the new tax credits and the pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.6/1">We recognise that there is particular concern about the position of people with learning disabilities living with older carers aged 70 and over. They and their families must be able to plan for the future in good time. Promoting supported living for older people with learning disabilities is one of the priorities for both the revenue and capital elements of the &pound;42 million Learning Disability Development Fund, announced in the white paper Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century published in March 2001.

	<p pid="a.33.8/1">The Public service agreement announced on <phrase class="date" code="">15 July</phrase>, which seeks a 50 per cent increase in rail use in Great Britain from 2000 to 2010, will be measured in terms of passenger kilometres, and therefore does not refer to freight traffic. The Department for Transport retains the target, as set out in the 10 year plan for transport, for a significant increase in rail freight's share of the freight market by 2010.</p>

	Network Rail: Contingent Liabilities

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-22a.34.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100395" speakername="Lord Macdonald of Tradeston" colon=":" colnum="34"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020722/text/20722w08.htm#20722w08_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.34.2/1">In our statement on <phrase class="date" code="">27 June</phrase> on Network Rail, we informed the House of two minutes laid that day setting out the contingent liabilities the Secretary of State for Transport proposed to incur on behalf of the Government to enable Railtrack plc to be acquired by Network Rail.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/2">This classification of Network Rail was a decision taken, not by the Government but by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS takes independent decisions in matters concerning the classification, preparation and publication of statistics. It was its view that Network Rail would be classified as a private sector corporation&mdash;once its board has been ratified by its membership&mdash;and that the company's borrowing could be classified as private sector borrowing in the national accounts. In reaching this conclusion the ONS has, I understand, based its considerations upon the European system of accounts 1995 (ESA95).</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/3">As we explained to the House in our Statement on <phrase class="date" code="">27 June</phrase>, the SRA is providing Network Rail with standby credit facilities. It is the commercial debt markets that will provide the required borrowing for Network Rail, with the credit facilities called upon in identified, though unlikely, circumstances. On this basis the SRA's standby credit facilities are considered to be contingent liabilities and would only score as public expenditure in the extremely unlikely event of them being called upon.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/4">The Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office has, in his capacity as auditor of the SRA, concluded that Network Rail should be accounted for as a subsidiary of the SRA. This judgment is based on the application of UK generally accepted accounting practice (UK-GAAP). As such the expenditure and liabilities of Network Rail will be accounted for in an open and transparent way&mdash;a very welcome step.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/5">The provision of any funds necessary to meet the SRA's financial obligations could be made by way of grant under paragraph 7 of Schedule 14 to the Transport Act 2000 or by permitting the SRA to borrow in accordance with paragraph 8 of that schedule. Whether the SRA's financial obligations (subject to normal supply procedures) would be met by a grant, by allowing it to borrow, or a mixture of both, would be determined if the need arose. It therefore remains the Secretary of State's intention to proceed as proposed and incur the liabilities set out in the minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/6">The Government judge that the contingent liabilities set out in the minutes laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="">27 June</phrase> provide robust means of quickly setting up a strong and well-managed company to take over the responsibilities of Railtrack as network operator; and to do so by uniting the rail industry to work together under the strategic guidance of the SRA with government with the overall aim of delivering the efficient, safe and reliable railway network that customers want.</p>
