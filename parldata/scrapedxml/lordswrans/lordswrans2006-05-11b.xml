	<p pid="b.149.4/2" qnum="HL5401">Which medical and consultative groups have been convened to consider the mental health component of the personal capability assessment; who are the members of these groups; and what are the terms of reference for each group.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-05-11b.149.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="149"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060511/text/60511w01.htm#60511w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.149.5/1">The mental health component of the personal capability assessment (PCA) was developed over 10 years ago on the recommendations of an expert working group. In the intervening period changes have occurred to the pattern of mental health problems. For example, there is now a much higher incidence of common mental health problems relative to severe mental health problems and a much higher proportion of incapacity benefits claimants state a mental health problem as the reason for their unfitness for work.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/2">On this basis, and after 10 years' experience of carrying out the PCA, it is now appropriate to review the mental health assessment to ensure that it meets today's pattern of illness presentation and the available treatment options.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/3">The remit of the review is to:</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/4" class="indent">consider the impact of the changing pattern of mental health problems and treatment options on the effectiveness of the mental health component of the assessment; review the relevance of current assessment descriptors and identify aspects not covered by current descriptors;</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/5" class="indent">review the interaction between mental and physical health problems and the way they are handled by the current scoring system; and</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/6" class="indent">make recommendations for a revised mental health assessment which will ensure that those who are currently unfit for work are identified; identify accurately those who in spite of their condition are fit to continue in work; and, for those who are unfit for work, identify interventions that would help to support recovery such that return to work would again become an option.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/7">We have set up two groups to carry out the review: first, a technical working group comprising technical or medical experts from the field of mental health and learning difficulties; and secondly a consultative group made up of lay experts representing key stakeholder groups. The two groups will work together to review the component, ensuring that there is a balance between academic robustness, user acceptability and operational deliverability.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/8">The following people are on the Mental Health Technical Group. They all have medical or occupational health experience of managing mental health conditions and of the relationship between mental health and work:</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/9" class="indent">Professor Geoff Shepherd</p>

	<p pid="b.149.5/32">In addition, Lord Layard and Judy Scott from Judy Scott Consulting have been invited to attend.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.5/33">The two groups will work together at all stages of the review, considering the issues and developing recommendations for Ministers. To ensure that the groups are fully integrated, each group will nominate members to attend meetings of their partner group. Where appropriate there will be joint meetings of the two groups, but particularly before the groups present their joint recommendations to Ministers in September.</p>

	<p pid="b.153.5/1">Overall caller volumes have grown considerably in 2005&ndash;06 and will have contributed to the increase observed in engaged tones. Apparently high numbers of engaged tones can however be very misleading. They occur mainly at the busiest periods when callers constantly hit the redial button on modern telephone handsets. The vast majority of callers to HMRC contact centres do get through even though they may have to try more than once at the busiest times.</p>
