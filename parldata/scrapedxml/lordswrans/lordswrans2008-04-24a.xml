	<p pid="a.313.0/1">The Government are not planning any such public inquiry into the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vibration white finger scheme in respect of the Coal Health Compensation Schemes. However, the Government welcome the report by the National Audit Office published in July 2007 and the recent Public Accounts Committee report examining the coal health compensation schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/2">The legal profession is independent and as such complaints about solicitors are a matter for the Legal Complaints Service (LCS) and Solicitors Regulatory Authority rather than government. However the Government believe that it is important that miners who complain to the LCS about their claims under the coal health compensation schemes get the level of service and compensation that they deserve. The Government therefore seek regular updates from the LCS to ensure that progress is being made in continually improving the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.313.3/1">The Government continue to challenge the fees paid to solicitors where it is right to do so and is consistent with our contractual obligations with respect to coal health compensation schemes. However, it was not the Government's role to choose a solicitor for a claimant&mdash;claimants appoint their own representatives. Under the schemes solicitors were paid for their work under an agreed tariff.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.3/2">The Government have pursued reductions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease &quot;fast track&quot; tariff paid to solicitors for handling claims and achieved savings of around &pound;100 million. Savings of approximately a further &pound;20 million have been achieved for the fees paid to solicitors for handling vibration white finger services claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.3/3">The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Ministry of Justice are working closely to support the Legal Complaints Service (LCS) and Solicitors Regulatory Authority (SRA) in their pursuit of those firms that have unfairly deducted sums from compensation. In particular the LCS is working on a plan to roll out nationally elements of their successful Rother Valley pilot which provided assistance and advice to claimants in seeking to recover deductions made from compensation unfairly.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.0/1">The Government do not predict energy prices, and it is for the market to decide how to respond to external pressures such as the recent rise in wholesale costs. However, BERR does regularly publish assumptions about the future trends of oil, gas, and coal prices. The most recent set can be found at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/environment/projections/index.html">www.berr.gov.uk/energy/environment/projections/index.html</a>. Work on updating the fossil fuel assumptions is currently under way to help inform the decisions relating to the carbon budgets, as set out in the recent Climate Change Bill. In addition BERR, for its internal modelling, regularly explores possible future retail prices. The next update is expected in summer 2008.</p>
