In particular, it does not make clear whether &quot;rights set forth by law&quot; include international as well as national law; it does not make provision for positive measures; and it does not follow the case law of the European Court of Human Rights in allowing objective and reasonably justified distinctions.</p>

The code also properly reflects the interests of witnesses, and in this respect has been amended in accordance with Recommendation 8 of Sir Iain Glidewell's report on the CPS. To ensure the code's accessibility, it will be published in all of the most commonly spoken ethnic-minority languages.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.0/1">The criteria governing the free distribution of fruit and vegetables are prescribed by EC regulation. There have been regulatory changes to the treatment of packaging and transport costs which have enabled the Intervention Board to adopt a more flexible approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/2">The Intervention Board has been proactive in working with local authorities, councils and charitable organisations to improve the distribution of available produce. The aim is to enable larger quantities of produce to be transported to convenient regional points for collection by a network of smaller organisations. Uptake is however dependent upon the volumes of product withdrawn from the market and the willingness and ability of potential recipients to accept it.</p>
