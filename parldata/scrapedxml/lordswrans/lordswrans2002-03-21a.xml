	<p pid="a.161.5/1">In accordance with Section 91 of the Police Act 1997, after consultation with the Scottish Ministers, the Prime Minister has agreed to appoint and re-appoint the following Surveillance Commissioners to assist Sir Andrew Leggatt, the Chief Surveillance Commissioner. There are three commissioners for England and Wales, two for Scotland and one for Northern Ireland. However, the remit of each commissioner covers the whole of the United Kingdom so that any commissioner can act in jurisdictions other than his own.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/2">The Prime Minister has appointed, from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>, as a Commissioner the right honourable Lord Sutherland, who served as a judge of the Court of Session from 1985 to 2001, for a period of three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/3">He has also reappointed as commissioners:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/4">Sir Charles McCullough who was appointed as Surveillance Commissioner in 1998 and is reappointed for a further three years from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>. He served as a High Court judge of the Queen's Bench Division from 1981 to 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/5">The right honourable Sir Michael Hutchison who was appointed as Surveillance Commissioner in 1998 and is reappointed for a further three years from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>. He served as a Lord Justice of Appeal from 1995 to 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/6">Lord Bonomy who was appointed as Surveillance Commissioner in 1998 and is reappointed for a further three years from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>. He has been a judge of the Court of Session since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/7">The right honourable Sir John MacDermott who was appointed as Surveillance Commissioner in 1998 and is reappointed, <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>, until <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-01">1 October 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/8">The commissioners are appointed under the provisions of Part III of the Police Act 1997. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 extended the commissioners' remit. Since the authorisation of intrusive surveillance operations forms a key component of the Government's response to serious and organised crime, I attach considerable importance to these appointments and I am delighted that the commissioners have accepted their appointments. In conjunction with Sir Andrew Leggatt, their substantial judicial experience, particularly of the criminal justice system, will provide independent oversight of surveillance operations, which, although operationally important, must also be subject to stringent safeguards.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.0/1">The Government's initial assessment of the implications for UK personnel of the Khamisiyah demolitions was published in December 1999 in a Ministry of Defence paper entitled Review of Events concerning 32 Field Hospital and the Release of Nerve Agent Arising From US Demolition of Iraqi Munitions at the Khamisiyah Depot In March 1991. The paper is available in the Library of the House and on the Internet at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/khamisiyah.htm">http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/khamisiyah.htm</a>. The paper's main conclusion was that the possible level of nerve agent exposure would have no detectable effect on human health, either in the short or long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/2">The statistics recently released by the US Veterans Benefits Administration are believed to be based on remodelling of the theoretical plume of nerve agent which may have been released by the demolitions carried out subsequently. The MoD is seeking to establish from the US authorities the full scientific basis for the remodelling. Once this has been obtained and analysed, I will write to the noble Lord and place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.3/1">It is generally accepted by United Kingdom clinicians that recombinant and plasma derived clotting factors are equally effective in treating clotting disorders. In guidelines produced by the United Kingdom Haemophilia Doctors Organisations, comparisons between the two types of product revolve around their relative safety, bearing in mind that no medicinal product can ever be completely free from risk. An advantage of recombinant products, where they are entirely free of human albumin, is that they eliminate the risk from blood borne viruses and the theoretical risk from vCJD. However, plasma derived clotting factors are tightly regulated by European and United States authorities to minimise the risk of viral transmission. This is achieved by the screening of donor blood and the anti-viral measures taken during manufacture. By ceasing to use UK plasma in the manufacture of blood products, the Government have already taken steps to reduce the unknown risks from vCJD.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.3/2">The Government will make a full statement once we have completed our consideration of the Haemophilia Society's call to extend the provision of recombinant clotting factors to all haemophilia patients in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">From April 2001 all local authorities in England have been required to include data about the numbers of children in their care who go missing for 24 hours or more in their annual statistical return to the Department of Health. Prior to 2001, councils had to return data on numbers of children who were missing for more than seven days. Data concerning this issue were not available in 1965.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/2">West Sussex Council has provided the following information to the department about young people in its care who have gone missing without trace since 1995. These were predominantly asylum-seeking young women from West Africa. In 1995 one person went missing; this figure was two in 1996; seven in 1997; 11 in 1998; 23 in 1999 and 21 in 2000. By 2001, the council had developed procedures to identify and support young people from abroad who were particularly vulnerable; by January 2002 six had gone missing. While other young people in the council's care do go missing temporarily from their placements, it would be extremely rare for a young person to go missing without trace.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/3">Research about young runaways sponsored by the department and by voluntary organisations, suggests that looked after children missing from residential or foster care are more likely to run away than those living at home. The majority of these young people are found within 48 hours. According to the Department of Health's statistical return of the young people missing from their care placements during the course of 1999&ndash;2000 approximately 140 were absent for over six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/4">The Department of Health is working closely with the Social Exclusion Unit and is preparing guidance for local authorities, the police, health agencies and the voluntary sector concerning good practice and procedures on children missing from care.</p>
