	<p pid="a.1.5/1">In an enlarged EU it is not reasonable for one member state to hold up all the others wishing to proceed with enhanced co-operation, provided that the rigorous conditions for enhanced co-operation have been met. These provide that enhanced co-operation is open to all and that the single market is protected; and will help ensure that there is no development of an inner core.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">In addition, the appeal clause we secured allows a member state to seek discussions by the European Council of a proposal for enhanced co-operation before any decision is taken. This is the right balance between the interests of member states and the benefits of greater flexibility in an enlarged EU.</p>

However, the appointment of judges and Queen's Counsel is purely on the basis of merit, and there are many safeguards built into the system, not least the recent appointment of the First Judicial Appointments Commissioner, who has access to every interview, every piece of paper and every meeting in the appointments process.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.8/1">The Government recognise the major contribution which the equine industry makes in generating economic activity in the countryside. Although the scope for expansion may be limited in some sectors of the industry, there are likely to be significant opportunities in particular areas such as the breeding of high performance horses. Steps have been taken to facilitate diversification into horse enterprise on farms, and the horse sector can benefit from measures operated under the England Rural Development Programme, for which funding of &pound;1.6 billion has been provided over seven years. The Government's policies for rural development were set out fully in the Rural White Paper in November 2000 and many of these will benefit, directly or indirectly, the equine industry and horse users.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.0/1">The viability of foot and mouth disease virus depends on pH and temperature. The virus is most stable at neutral pH levels, but will not survive indifinitely. Acidic or basic pH levels decrease the survival time, as do high temperatures. As an example, in laboratory conditions, foot and mouth disease virus survives at pH 6.0 for only two minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">As pH is a measurement of the acidity or basicity of aqueous or other liquid solutions, it is not possible to give the pH range of air. We assume that the question refers to airborne spread of the virus. The factors that affect airborne spread include wind direction, wind speed, wind veer, ambient temperature and relative humidity.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.3/1">The normal pH of living animal tissues is approximately neutral. During rigor mortis, the pH in skeletal muscle falls below 6.0, which is sufficient to inactivate foot and mouth disease virus. The exact value depends on the species of animal and type of muscle. Viable virus can still be isolated, however, from the bone marrow and lymph nodes of carcasses. The pH levels during decay depend on many factors and may rise after rigor mortis; however the virus cannot be reactivated by a rise in pH levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.6/1">To inactivate the virus in meat, it is essential that a pH level below 6.0 has been reached before deboning. This can be achieved by chilling at 2 degrees C for 24 hours or by electrical stimulation. If the meat is frozen before the pH levels drop during rigor mortis, then the foot and mouth virus can survive for long periods, but may be inactivated during the thawing process.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.5/1">Information over the 12 months since February 2000 to January 2001 (the most recently published set of monthly statistics) shows that almost 174,000 young people started on the programme and 104,000 jobs have been taken up, of which more than 80,000 have been sustained. In Yorkshire and Humberside, nearly 19,000 young people have joined the New Deal and nearly 12,000 jobs have been taken up, of which 9,000 have been sustained. On average around &pound;2,000 is spent on each participant on the New Deal for young people and the cost per sustained job is around &pound;5,000 both nationally and in Yorkshire and Humberside. Statistics are published each month that show the numbers of young people who find a job through New Deal: these do not distinguish between self-employed and employed earners.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">In today's youth labour market, it can take young people one or two starts before they settle in a job. Because of this, the Government's approach is to calculate the cost per job figure including both sustained and unsustained jobs. Any job can offer considerable benefits to the participant through increased self-confidence and useful work experience, even if the job does not last. Calculated on this basis, the cost per job figure is around &pound;4,000. People who leave for a job that does not last and return to claim the Jobseeker's Allowance will be offered further help from the New Deal.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.2/1">The answer is as follows--</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/2" class="indent">(a) the existing rules governing the allocation of airport take-off and landing slots are set out in EC Regulation 95/93, given force in UK law by the Airports Slot Allocation Regulations 1993 (SI 1993 No. 595) (as amended). In brief, the regulation enables member states, where demand for slots at an airport exceeds supply and there is no prospect of the imbalance being redressed in the short term, to appoint a slot co-ordinator to undertake slot allocation. He is required to act in an independent manner, and to perform his duties in a neutral, transparent and non-discriminatory way. Slots are allocated on the basis of priority criteria set out in the regulation, in international guidelines, and in any airport-specific local rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/3" class="indent">(b) EC 95/93 placed a duty on the Commission to report to the European Parliament and the Council on the effects of the regulation three years after its entry into force, and to place a proposal for the continuation or revision of the regulation before the Council by <phrase class="date" code="1996-01-01">1 January 1996</phrase>. This deadline was comprehensively missed. But the additional time has enabled further consideration of the impact of the regulation, particularly as regards its declared objectives of encouraging market entry and facilitating competition. Her Majesty's Government welcome the proposal that there should be comprehensive reform. It has put forward to the Commission the argument that a revised system should adopt a market-based approach to slot allocation, with the auctioning of newly created and recycled slots, and legitimised and transparent trading of slots between air carriers.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/4" class="indent">(c) The rules explained above do not form part of the Single European Sky.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.8/1">Major local transport plans such as the proposed guided busway between Luton and Dunstable, known as Translink, are considered by the department as part of the overall strategy in the authority's local transport plan. More work is needed by the authority on the economic appraisal of Translink before the department can reach a provisional view on whether it passes the tests that have been established to determine eligibility for government funding. A revised appraisal is expected shortly. Should the department's provisional view be that it passes these tests, the authority would then apply for powers to build the scheme under the Transport and Works Act.</p>
