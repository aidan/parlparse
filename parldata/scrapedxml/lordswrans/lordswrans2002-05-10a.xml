	<p pid="a.203.1/2" qnum="HL4030">Why there have been no prosecutions of air passengers at Heathrow in the last three years for bringing illegal meat such as &quot;bushmeat&quot; into the United Kingdom; and</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">A decision to bring a prosecution before the courts is a matter for the enforcement authority. They would take into account a number of factors, including the weight of evidence to prove intent to break the laws in question and the ability to bring the offender before the British courts. These criteria may not be easy to satisfy in the case of air passengers bringing in illegal meat, especially where small quantities are seized.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/2">In 2001, HM Customs and Excise prosecuted three people for offences relating to imports of meat covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES) involving &quot;bushmeat&quot;. Two were convicted of CITES offences and one was acquitted but convicted under a separate animal health charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/3">The level and focus of future controls to address the threat from imported meat will be directed by the risk assessment work which is already under way. We are committed in the light of that risk assessment to strengthen our efforts to tackle the problem of illegally imported meat.</p>

Section 7 of the Act provides a defence for occupiers of land etc who use a shotgun where free ranging wild deer cause damage, further damage is likely and the action is necessary to prevent further damage. The minimum calibre permitted is 12 bore, using a single non-spherical projectile weighing not less than 22.68g (350 grains) or a cartridge purporting to contain shot which is 0.203 inches (5.16mm) in diameter (size AAA) (Section 7(2) of the Act).</p>

	<p pid="a.205.6/2">However, the Market Transformation Programme, which is jointly sponsored by Defra and the DTI, has also carried out a number of spot checks on domestic appliances. This is to provide information relating to the operation and effectiveness of the UK energy labelling regulations and to inform discussions on related policy issues. The enforcement authorities are aware of the Defra monitoring activity and have access to the individual results. We are discussing the individual results, analysis and issues arising with suppliers of the tested products and with AMDEA (the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances) with the intention that the Government will routinely place such information in the public domain.</p>

Section C1 of Part II of Schedule 5 reserves business associations but specifically exempts from this reservation &quot;the creation, operation, regulation and dissolution of charities&quot;.
