There are significant risks to working in Afghanistan, as recent tragic events have demonstrated. The travel advice provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is regularly updated and gives our best general assessment of conditions on the ground. We regularly update NGOs that have registered with our embassy in Kabul on threats to security. It is then up to them to make their own judgments regarding their operations, often in consultation with the security umbrella organisation, the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.5/1">The Government are replacing the hill farm allowance with an uplands strand of the entry-level environmental stewardship scheme in 2010, which will reward upland land managers and farmers for delivering environmental and landscape benefits. An assessment of the social, environmental and economic impacts of this was prepared in 2006, which supported this decision. Testing has shown that our early proposals are accessible and workable for the vast majority of hill farmers. The Government recognise the importance of hill farming, and are committed to helping ensure that upland communities have a sustainable future. However, uplands entry-level stewardship (ELS) cannot be considered in isolation, comprising only one part of the support available to upland land managers and farmers&mdash;which also includes the single payment scheme and other schemes under the Rural Development Programme for England&mdash;and is not intended by itself to secure the future of sustainable hill farming. The Government assist by providing support for public goods that the market does not, and regional and local initiatives also have a role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/2">The Government believe that CAP expenditure through Pillar 2 offers better value for money than Pillar 1 because it rewards farmers for the delivery of public benefits, particularly environmental outcomes. By supporting market prices, CAP payments that are coupled to production and other price support mechanisms maintain artificially high prices for EU consumers. Coupling also distorts the world market and, therefore, ability of farmers in developing countries to benefit from the market. There should be full decoupling for all sectors across the EU (no partially coupled support should remain) in order to remove trade distortion and ensure a level playing field for all EU farmers. Fully decoupled payments free farmers to determine their business activities on the basis of market and consumer demand.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.6/1">Evidence of the risk to health for children and adults from exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) is well established. In 2004, the Government's independent Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) advised in their publication <I>Secondhand Smoke: Review of </I><I>E</I><I>vidence </I><I>S</I><I>ince 1998 </I>that:</p>
	<p pid="a.57.6/2">Children are at greatest risk in their homes and the evidence strongly links SHS with an increased risk of pneumonia and bronchitis, asthma attacks, middle ear disease, decreased lung function and sudden infant death syndrome. It has also been shown that babies born to mothers who come into contact with SHS have lower birth weights.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.6/3">Further evidence around the health risks from SHS exposure, including to children, was set out by the United States surgeon-general in his 2006 report The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.6/4">Provisions within the Health Act 2006 (c.28) and subsequent regulations made under powers within the Act require virtually all enclosed work and public places, as well as public transport, to be smoke-free.

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">I am not aware of a department or agency responsible for testing new sustainable products used in construction and other industries for longevity.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">Many methods and sets of criteria for assessing and comparing the sustainability of products are used by government, businesses and others. These criteria vary depending on the product and the assessment being made, and there is no generic requirement for a product to have a guaranteed minimum lifetime.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/3">Whilst a requirement for an extended product lifetime has the potential to reduce the use of resources in production and the generation of waste, extending product longevity would not necessarily lead to an overall benefit. There would be trade-offs between resource savings from longer life-spans and higher standards (such as greater energy efficiency, improved function, or higher safety standards) associated with newer products.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/4">Regulation 7 of the England and Wales Building Regulations covers materials and workmanship, and requires that relevant building works must be carried out with proper materials in a workmanlike manner. Neither the regulation nor the associated approved document guidance set out any specific criteria relating to guaranteed levels of longevity.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/5">The code for sustainable homes, which measures the sustainability of a new home against categories of sustainable design, includes a materials category. Points are awarded for products with lower life cycle (from manufacture to disposal) environmental impact, based on ratings from the Building Research Establishment green guide to specification for specific products or types of construction. One element of the methodology in the green guide is an estimated replacement interval for the product/system being assessed.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.0/1">For the most part, cross compliance is not new. The measures largely re-enforce existing legislation aimed at addressing some of the externalities of the farming industry that farmers should already be meeting. The cost of cross-compliance to farmers is estimated at 1.5 to 2 per cent, on average, of the value of the approximately &pound;1.5 billion single payment. It is an efficient and proportionate way of getting compliance with basic environmental and other law without prosecution and criminalisation</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/2">There are three aspects to cross-compliance:</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/3">specific requirements known as statutory management requirements (SMRs);more general requirements requiring the land to be kept in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC); anda requirement to maintain a level of permanent pasture, not included in the crop rotation, for five years or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/4">The requirement to maintain a level of permanent pasture is not currently a cross compliance requirement for individual farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/5">SMRs were phased in over a three year period, the final tranche&mdash;animal welfare&mdash;coming into force in January 2007. They comprise a number of articles from 19 EU directives and regulations and all member states must apply the same specific standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/6">The EU regulations allow member states discretion to set GAEC standards that reflect the specific character of the regional or national area concerned, meaning that some GAEC standards will not only differ between member states, but between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, reflecting differing concerns and priorities, or farming practices and geography.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/7">In order to reduce the burden of compliance with GAEC standards in England, Defra recently reviewed and updated guidance to farmers and as a result produced a substantially simplified handbook that gives detailed requirements and summary information on the standards, which are now grouped and colour coded according to the activities to which they relate. This improved guidance is estimated to have saved farmers around &pound;1 million annually.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">The UK is committed to the EU General and Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of April 2004, reconfirmed in January 2007, aimed at supporting the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and facilitating a settlement. In this context, the UK will continue to work closely with the EU Commission and presidency to ensure that, through financial aid and trade liberalisation, Turkish Cypriots are brought closer to Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/2">Ultimately, the Government believe that Turkish Cypriot isolation will only be fully lifted with the achievement of a comprehensive Cyprus settlement to re-unite the island, acceptable to all Cypriots. The current settlement process represents the best chance Cypriots may ever have to solve this long-running problem. We urge both leaders to seize this opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.8/1">Defra fully supports the work of all our staff networks. Successful, business-focused staff networks are essential to the successful delivery of our diversity action plans.

	<p pid="a.60.8/2">Part of this support includes allowing staff to attend network events in work time. Each staff network is allocated an annual budget. They agree with their committees how much money is assigned to support agreed events. All networks have to produce business plans which detail their expenditure (this excludes their members travel costs). Staff can join a network of their choice.</p>

The SDC report identified the potential for a scheme in the Severn estuary to generate some 5 per cent of the UK's electricity. Following this the Government are now conducting a feasibility study of a tidal power scheme, including the possibility of a tidal lagoon or barrage, in the Severn estuary.

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">The 5 A DAY message, to eat at least five portions (400g) of a variety of fruit and vegetables each day, was developed based on a recommendation from the World Health Organisation (WHO), following evidence that populations consuming at least 400g of fruit and vegetables per day can reduce the risk of deaths from chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and some cancers by up to 20 per cent. In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health's Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy and Nutrition (COMA) (now called the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN)) also reviewed the evidence and in 1998 endorsed the above recommendation.

	<p pid="a.65.5/1">Finding innovative, cost effective and attractive ways of insulating hard to treat homes will be core to both our carbon saving and fuel poverty alleviation ambitions. The carbon emissions reduction target (CERT), although specifically designed to deliver carbon savings as cost effectively as possible, includes incentives to encourage suppliers to promote more costly measures appropriate for hard-to-treat homes, such as solid wall insulation. This has resulted in some 40,000 solid-wall homes benefiting from insulation in the past three years, with a further 100,000 expected to be treated by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/2">There will also be a focus on improving the energy efficiency of hard-to-treat properties, including via solid wall insulation, through the green neighbourhoods scheme, announced by Hilary Benn in April; and the new &pound;350 million community energy saving obligation on energy suppliers and electricity generators announced by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/3">We are working closely with energy suppliers and the insulation industry to maximise insulation activity under CERT this winter. There are now some 4,000 people able to carry out insulation work, plus support staff&mdash;an increase of almost 500 staff since April 2008. The Prime Minister's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September</phrase> for a &pound;1 billion homes energy saving programme will also increase the need for people employed in energy conservation work. The new energy efficiency employment (EEE) initiative, also announced in September, will match people made redundant from the contracting house building industry with employment opportunities in insulating homes and businesses and improving energy efficiency across the country. The first stage of the initiative, when it is launched at the end of November, will provide access to information and training that will help more people to secure insulation related jobs. Similar routes will be developed to improve access to other energy related jobs.</p>

The Cotonou agreement covers political relations, trade and development co-operation between the EU and 78 Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, and is a central focus of our current work on Mauritania. Article 96 of the agreement provides for appropriate measures when the essential and fundamental elements of the agreement (such as democracy) have been infringed. The EU wrote to the Mauritanian regime in September to initiate the process and met with Mauritanian officials on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-20">20 October</phrase> to discuss the procedures. The Mauritanians failed to provide acceptable proposals for the restoration of democracy, and were given one month to do so. Should the Mauritanians fail to provide acceptable proposals within this timeframe, consultations will be closed and the EU will consider appropriate measures including targeted sanctions. These measures may cover any aspect of the EU-ACP relationship (including development assistance, trade, financial and economic co-operation, political dialogue, humanitarian and emergency assistance).</p>

The effect of any financial difficulties experienced by Russian businessmen with commercial interests in the UK on the total level of employment would therefore be expected to be minimal.</p>

These do not include a gender element. But as a matter of good practice, the UK does consider that achieving a gender balance in the committee's membership is good for the committee and its work. The UK was therefore disappointed that no female candidates were put forward in the ballot for the last election. The committee has five female members.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.6/1">There are currently a small number of confirmed populations of water primrose, Ludwigia grandiflora, (a non-native invasive plant species) in Great Britain, which are believed to be small and manageable at present. A risk assessment of Ludwigia species has been carried out and will be published on the Non-native Species Secretariat website following peer review. It indicates a risk of major impacts and a moderate risk of spread. In line with the invasive non-native species framework strategy for Great Britain we recognise that a rapid response is therefore necessary to eradicate the species before it becomes established in Great Britain. This summer the Environment Agency began an eradication programme in partnership with land owners and Defra, which will continue into next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.6/2">We have commissioned the production of identification sheets for invasive non-native species including one for water primrose. This will be published on the Non-Native Species Secretariat website shortly and promoted more widely in due course. A factsheet including management information is also available on the website.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.6/3">Ludwigia species were amongst those proposed for addition to Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and for a ban on sale order, both in the recent Defra and Welsh Assembly Government consultation and in the separate Scottish Executive consultation. No decisions have been made as yet.</p>
