This means that the protection of productive farmland, alongside other benefits, is reflected in the scheme priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.8/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Questions asking what preparations have been made for the 2011 Census and whether a review of the 2001 Census was conducted, what the review concluded and what instructions have been given to the Office for National Statistics. (HL297, HL298)</p>
	<p pid="a.86.8/4">There have been a number of extensive reviews of the 2001 Census, including those by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee and Public Accounts Committee. In addition there were reviews by the National Audit Office, the former Statistics Commission and other bodies such as the Local Government Association. All these reviews have been published. In summary, some of the key issues raised in these reviews covered the need to:</p>
	<p pid="a.86.8/5">develop robust field management and torn-tracking systems to enable better central control of field processes and activities;agree earlier those contractual arrangements with external suppliers for aspects of the census operation that are to be outsourced, and ensure that all such suppliers are selected through rigorous procurement procedures and early enough so that systems are able to be fully tested before the Census; anddevelop a high quality and up-to-date address list to increase the efficiency of the delivery of Census forms.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.8/6">We also conducted our own post-census evaluations and the main findings of all these reviews were set out in the general report on the 2001 Census published in 2005 and laid before Parliament. The conclusions from all these reviews have helped to shape the design of the 2011 Census.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.8/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-11">Thursday 11 December</phrase> the White Paper on the 2011 Census Helping to Shape Tomorrow was published. This sets out the UK Statistics Authority's proposals which include a number of major changes in the design for 2011, primarily:</p>

	<p pid="a.92.3/1">A review commissioned by the Department for Transport and published in 2002 (Bicycle Helmets&mdash;A review of their effectiveness, Road Safety Research Report No 30, available at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme1/bicyclehelmetsreviewofeffect4726">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme1/bicyclehelmetsreviewofeffect4726</a>) concluded that overall there is evidence that bicycle helmets can be effective at reducing the incidence and severity of head, brain and upper facial injuries and that they can be effective in reducing injury for users of all ages, though particularly for children. The report also concludes that there is some evidence that compulsory helmet wearing may discourage some people from cycling, leading to decreased bicycle use.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/2">The department has recently commissioned a new research project looking at a range of road safety and cycling issues. This is now under way and is being undertaken by a consortium led by TRL and including MVA, ITS Leeds, Simon Christmas Ltd, SHM and Arup. It will examine the following topics:</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/3">road user safety and cycling data;cycling infrastructure;attitudes and behaviours of cyclists and other road users; and bicycle helmets, including an updated evaluation of their effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/4">The research project as a whole is likely to be three years in duration, but we are aiming to complete the review of cycle helmet effectiveness by the end of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/5">The department also undertakes periodic surveys of cycle helmet wearing rates. Last February we published the 2006 cycle helmet wearing survey. This shows that cycle helmet rates have gone up from 28 per cent in 2004 to 31 per cent on major built up roads and from 10 per cent to 14 per cent on minor roads. The wearing rate for children increased from 14 per cent to 18 per cent. The project report and the research summary findings can be found online at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme1/cyclehelmets.pdf">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme1/cyclehelmets.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme1/report84findings.pdf">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme1/report84findings.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.0/1">Ten days' work experience is a mandatory element of the land-based and environment diploma. It is therefore a condition of funding that a provider or a consortium of providers delivering the diploma ensures that the work experience takes place. It is also a statutory requirement for schools to secure work experience placements for their 14-16 year old pupils. These are mainly arranged by Education Business Partnerships organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/2">In planning diploma delivery, 14-19 partnerships and consortia must ensure that efficient and effective travel arrangements are in place to enable learners to access all elements of the programme including work experience. To support them in this task in each of the 40 most rural areas we have funded the post of Transport and Access Coordinator (at &pound;75,000 per local authority for 18 months from September 2008) to allow these local authorities to investigate and arrange more effective and efficient transport for their young people accessing diplomas. We have also made funding available through the diploma formula grant to reflect the additional costs of travel between institutions in more sparsely populated local authorities. Details of how this funding was calculated can be found in the diploma grant guidance issued to local authorities and 14-19 partnerships in December 2007. This document can be accessed through the 14-19 education and skills website at <a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/14-19/">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/14-19/</a> within the 14-19 funding section under diploma funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/3">This funding is in addition to the significant investment taking place across the 14-19 reform programme. This includes &pound;30,000 given for each diploma being offered for the first time by a consortium in 2008 and 2009, and the central package of support offering training for the workforce (an investment of over &pound;80 million in total in 2008-09). We also offer produce a range of guidance and fund local delivery support (for example, our successful series of learning visits).</p>

	<p pid="a.98.5/2">The consumer in the September PQ is based on an average domestic electricity consumption figure quoted by Energywatch of 3,300 kWh per annum. In the November PQ it was based on a consumption figure of 4,400 kWh per annum which included average domestic and SME electricity consumption. This led to the higher figures in the latter for household costs. The correct figures are &pound;5.87 for 2005-06; &pound;7.35 for 2006-07; and &pound;8.94 for 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December 2007</phrase>, the Government announced the launch of a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) on a draft plan for up to 25 GW (installed capacity) of new offshore wind farms by 2020. Depending on the results of the SEA and the magnitude of impacts identified, the Government will take a decision on what the acceptable level of offshore wind development is. The supply of offshore wind turbines required up to 2020 will partly depend on the outcome of the SEA and a future decision by the Government, expected in spring 2009, on the level of offshore wind generation, and on the size of turbines selected by developers for specific sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/2">The Government commissioned Douglas Westwood to assess the impact of supply chain constraints on the deployment of bulk renewable electricity to 2020. The study, published in June 2008, concluded that current demand outstrips supply for offshore turbines and that investment was required in expanding all tiers of the supply chain for offshore wind to meet Government objectives. We anticipate that certainty of market scale, location and timing will be provided through the SEA process and allocation of development rights for a pipeline of projects by the Crown Estate. We anticipate that providing this market certainty should trigger investment in new manufacturing and installation capacity for offshore wind in the UK and around Europe, including expansion by existing manufacturers and new market entrants who will come on stream in time for deployment to meet the 2020 target. This should reduce constraints on the supply of turbines to the UK offshore market, reducing lead times as well as reducing costs due to increased competition.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">On the <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-19">19 November 2008</phrase> the UK Government held the first auction of carbon allowances. The sale price (clearing price) was &pound;13.61 (&euro;16.15) per allowance. The reserve price set by the Government was below the clearing price. According to the Community Emissions Trading Scheme (Allocation of Allowances for Payment) Scheme 2008, section 19(2), the Government will reveal the reserve price only if the clearing price is less than the reserve price.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">As set out in the Government response to consultation on proposed UK auction design for use during Phase II, the Government will not provide full details of how the reserve price is calculated until after the first few auctions. The absence of a detailed published methodology ensures an unbiased price discovery during the initial auctions, so that participants do not use the reserve price to help set their bids. The reserve price is calculated by applying a discount rate and a markdown to the prevalent secondary market price.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">The business process employed to auction UK carbon allowances strongly resembles the widely accepted process used to auction Treasury Gilts. Moreover, in line with the Community Emissions Trading Scheme (Allocation of Allowances for Payment) Regulations 2008, the Treasury has appointed an independent observer to oversee any UK auction of carbon allowances.</p>

The UK is also a signatory to the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.

Impunity for previous human rights abuses continues to be one of the major challenges for the new Government of Nepal.

This is an essential step towards preventing future violations and building a society where the rule of law is respected. Where investigations of this nature are carried out, we believe it is important for the results to be made known in a transparent and structured manner so that the public can have confidence in the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.0/2">Prisons have a broad, integrated and evidence-based suicide prevention strategy. A prisoner focused care planning system for at risk prisoners, called Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork, (ACCT), was introduced across the prison estate between 2005 and 2007 in partnership with the Department of Health. Its key benefits include:</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/3">a faster first response and assessment;the provision of flexible, individual, accountable care; anda multi disciplinary approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/4">As part of the ACCT process decisions are taken about how the individual will be managed to reduce the risks that they will harm themselves, including the frequency of conversations and observations. Levels of observation will differ in each case and will change over time. Constant supervision is a temporary arrangement where a prisoner is supervised by a designated member of staff on a one to one basis, remaining within eyesight at all times and within a suitable distance to be able to physically intervene quickly. It is required when it is believed that the prisoner could, at any time. make an attempt to kill themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/5">Acute suicidal crisis may be temporary and the case management approach afforded by ACCT provides the opportunity to reduce the level of supervision progressively, substituting alternative supports. as the prisoners' condition improves.</p>

My Written Answer referred to the current position with regard to the St Pancras train shed and not the position during the construction phase of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link project.

	<p pid="a.124.0/1">Arrangements for recycling of large household white goods are already in place. Since July 2007, producers of electrical and electronic equipment have been funding the collection, treatment and recycling of this type of equipment. A network of about 1,500 designated collection facilities&mdash;mostly at local authority civic amenity sites&mdash;is accepting waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) for recycling. Some retailers will also accept back items on a like for like basis or take away old equipment when they deliver a new item. During the first compliance period which ran from July to December 2007, 184,000 tonnes of household WEEE were collected for recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/2">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently running a consumer awareness campaign about the recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). This is focused specifically on small items of WEEE, because this is where the greatest collection deficit lies at present: the UK only collects 10 per cent by weight of all small WEEE purchased, whereas for all WEEE (including large white goods), the UK collects 25 per cent by weight of all items purchased. WRAP will look to extend the scope of the campaign from April 2009 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/3">WRAP has recently completed a demonstration project, showing that plastics from the UK's collective producer responsibility (CPR) scheme can be recycled back into new WEEE products (closed-loop recycling). This uses recycled fridge plastics to make new parts for washing machines at Indesit in Wales. Indesit has now incorporated this change into its production processes permanently.</p>

In recent years, the GLA fleet has reduced from nine to six vessels and the number of depot sites from nine to four. These reductions have been significant, ensuring that light dues rates have not increased since 1993.</p>
