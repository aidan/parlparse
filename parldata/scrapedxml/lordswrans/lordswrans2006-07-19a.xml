	<p pid="a.187.5/2">The temporary international mechanism is already paying for the supply of some utilities for the Occupied Territories.

The European Commission is still working to make the first payments to medical workers in July, but the security situation is slowing progress. The mechanism will ensure that healthcare continues to be provided in the Occupied Territories.

In connection with this, a 500-word article raising awareness of the possibility of trafficked women being forced to work in brothels was placed in the England football supporters fanzine that was distributed to travelling supporters to coincide with the first World Cup game against Paraguay. I am pleased to say that monitoring of the movement of people from eastern Europe to Germany has not revealed an increase in human trafficking for sexual exploitation during the World Cup.</p>

The particular areas of concern relate to issues surrounding the provision of recovery and reflection periods (Article 13) and residence permits (Article 14). The mandatory nature of these provisions, when coupled with the scope of the convention, has led to concerns that the provisions will act as an immigration pull factor, encourage spurious claims and be used by those who have no right to remain in an effort to frustrate removal. Abuse of the provisions would ultimately impact on those in genuine need of assistance.
