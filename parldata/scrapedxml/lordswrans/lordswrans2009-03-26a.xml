	<p pid="a.157.2/1">At present, the Government consider technologies that aim to reduce the time that carbon dioxide emissions remain in the earth's atmosphere to be speculative and unproven. However, the Government are keeping them under review, as they might ultimately have a role to play in helping to ameliorate climate change, particularly if emissions reductions are not achieved quickly enough or climate change turns out to be worse than projected.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/2">The Government have no present plans for funding any significant research on these technologies. However, we welcome the Royal Society's current study on geo-engineering, which will help to indicate which, if any, of these options might be viable and suitable for further research.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/3">The Natural Environment Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council support research relevant to better understanding such geo-engineering options, their viability and potential environmental consequences. Research Councils are funded by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, but under the Haldane principle (the idea that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians) researchers set their own detailed research priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">The ability of the Department for International Development (DfID) to relieve poverty in developing countries depends critically on the skills of its staff. Whilst some of these skills are specific to international development, others&mdash;such as leadership, project management and people management&mdash;apply across the Civil Service. The Skills Strategy for Government, launched in 2008, recognised that departments could achieve more by working together on these common issues. This will involve building stronger professions within government, helping departments to work together to procure and commission training, and influencing universities and colleges to train the present and potential future workforce more closely in line with Government's needs. In line with every other department, DfID has therefore agreed to contribute about &pound;3 for each member of its staff to the costs of delivering the strategy, which is managed by Government Skills (the Sector Skills Council for central government, and part of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills). As well as leading to more effective delivery of programmes such as international development, the skills strategy will drive savings for departments which significantly exceed their contributions to its funding.</p>

DfID has increased its expenditure in fragile states from 26 per cent of its overall bilateral spend in 2001 to around 40 per cent in 2007. Based on current plans this proportion is due to rise to approximately 60 per cent by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/2">Work on early warning is not funded under a central or distinct programme.

	<p pid="a.162.3/1">Clause 16 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill provides that petitions may require relevant officers, whether identified by name or description, to give evidence to an overview and scrutiny committee.

Alternatively, the overview and scrutiny committee could decide that for the purposes of addressing the concerns raised by the petition, it would be more appropriate for another officer to attend before it.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/2">Clause 13 provides that local authorities must acknowledge petitions, and that this acknowledgement must give such information about what the authority proposes to do in response to the petition as the authority considers appropriate. Local authorities may therefore use the acknowledgement to inform the petition organiser if the overview and scrutiny committee considers that for the purposes of addressing the concerns raised by the petition, it would be more appropriate for another officer to attend before it.

	<p pid="a.165.11/1">1160 members of school staff from Manchester City Council have engaged with the college in leadership provision programmes. It should be noted however, that although the college requests information from participants about the role they have within their school, this is not always provided. Therefore, 239 individuals are within this number of whom the college cannot state with certainty that they fulfilled a teaching role. However, given the activities that they will have participated in, the probability that these were not teaching staff is small.</p>

Following this summit, a full low carbon industrial strategy will be published in the summer. By continuing efforts to build a low carbon economy we will create the jobs and growth we need now. Turnover in the low carbon and environmental goods and services sector as a whole could rise to over &pound;150 billion and employment could rise by 400,000 people to 1.3 million by 2015.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-03-26a.171.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100821" speakername="Lord Young of Norwood Green" colon=":" colnum="171"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90326w0004.htm#09032632000265">
	<p pid="a.171.0/1">The introduction of the new A* grade from 2010 alongside other changes to the syllabus and style and nature of questions in the A-level examination have raised concerns within the higher education (HE) sector about how well teachers will be able to predict which students will achieve the new grade, and particularly whether predictions will be reliable enough to be used in the HE applications and admissions process.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.0/2">The National Council for Educational Excellence, following consultation with the HE sector, recommended that the Government should look to establish base data on the predictability of the new A* grade prior to predicted A* grades being used in the higher education applications and offers processes. The Government support this recommendation and are exploring how to evaluate the accuracy of A* predictions against actual achievements to enable the sector to judge whether the evidence supports the use of A* predictions in the applications process. The award of an A* grade will recognise genuine higher level attainment. There is no evidence that this will disadvantage any particular group of students.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.0/3">Discussions with HE representative bodies suggest that the majority of institutions are indicating that they do not intend to use the A* grade in the applications and offers processes at this stage, although a small number will. It is of course a matter for universities themselves to set their entry criteria and to ensure that they are fair and transparent. All institutions will this summer submit detailed strategic assessments to the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Office for Fair Access bringing together for the first time in a single document their published admissions policies and activities to widen participation in higher education.</p>
