	<p pid="a.251.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/2" qnum="HL3016">What future plans the Ministry of Defence has for joint force Harrier.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-02-28a.251.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100264" speakername="Lord Grocott" colon=":" colnum="251"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020228/text/20228w01.htm#20228w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.251.2/1">We have agreed an investment plan to take forward joint force Harrier (JFH) into the era of future joint combat aircraft (FJCA) and future carriers.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/2">The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) included a commitment to establish JFH, building on the success of Royal Navy and RAF Harrier aircraft operations in joint carrier air groups. This was a radical initiative to form a truly joint, flexible and deployable force optimised for the demands of the new strategic environment. JFH currently operates two aircraft types&ndash;&ndash;Sea Harrier FA2, an air defence aircraft flown by RN personnel, and Harrier GR7, a ground attack/reconnaissance aircraft flown by RAF personnel. The plan has been for both the Sea Harrier FA2 and Harrier GR7 to be replaced by a common aircraft type. This aircraft is currently designated the FJCA, with an in service date of 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/3">Work has been taking place on a migration plan to take forward JFH into the era of the FJCA and the future aircraft carrier. We have concluded that joint force Harrier should migrate to an all Harrier GR force, maximising investment in one aircraft type. It is planned to upgrade the GR7 to GR9 standard to ensure a credible expeditionary offensive capability until the aircraft leaves service. To achieve this, aircraft systems will be enhanced to extend their lives and give the Harrier the capability to operate with smart weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/4">Given the Harrier GR9's ability in future to employ smart weapons world-wide by day and night from land and sea and the increased emphasis on carrier based offensive air-power in the SDR and confirmed by the emerging conclusions of our post-<phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> work, the Sea Harrier FA2 will be withdrawn earlier than planned, by 2006. The Sea Harrier entered service in 1979 and will start to become obsolescent as this decade progresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/5">As a consequence of its earlier withdrawal from service, the planned relocation of Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft from RNAS Yeovilton to RAF Cottesmore and RAF Wittering in 2003 will not now proceed. The relocation of RN personnel will go ahead but slightly later than currently planned, over the period 2004 to 2006. By <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, JFH will have migrated to an all Harrier GR9 force by roughly equal numbers of RN and RAF personnel. These proposals will be subject to consultation with the trade unions in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/6">This plan will significantly enhance the offensive strike capability of our aircraft carriers pending the introduction to service of the FJCA.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-02-28a.252.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100264" speakername="Lord Grocott" colon=":" colnum="252"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020228/text/20228w01.htm#20228w01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.252.2/1">The Nimrod MRA4 will replace the Nimrod MR2 as the RAF's new maritime patrol aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/2">Recent work on future maritime reconnaissance capabilities has shown that the operational tasks of the Nimrod MRA4 aircraft can be carried out with a smaller fleet than originally envisaged. This will allow us to reduce the number of aircraft on order from 21 to 18. This revised approach will allow the RAF to meet all the tasks for which the aircraft is being procured while delivering better value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/3">This judgment reflects a number of factors. The submarine threat, while still prevalent world-wide, has not developed as expected when the production contract was signed in 1996. Moreover, the Nimrod MRA4 will also offer a markedly greater capability compared to the MR2 it succeeds through improved aircraft and sensor performance. Finally, discussions with BAE Systems, the prime contractor, have identified potential in-service support options to maximise aircraft availability for operational tasking.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/4">The Defence Procurement Agency is working with BAE Systems on an incremental approach to delivery for Nimrod MRA4. This includes the acceptance of aircraft in two steps. An initial capability will be provided by the time of first contracted aircraft delivery in August 2004, with the full specification being met by the time of the seventh aircraft delivery and entry into service, which is contracted for March 2005. The reduced order will affect only the last three aircraft of the previously planned production run.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/5">In accordance with the partnership principle of Smart acquisition, agreement has been reached with BAE Systems to maximise the financial benefits to the Ministry of Defence of this reduced order while incentivising the company appropriately. The reduction in procurement costs will be agreed in detail with the company. On the basis of current assumptions, the smaller fleet is expected to reduce support costs alone by some &pound;360 million.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-02-28a.256.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100688" speakername="Lord Williams of Mostyn" colon=":" colnum="256"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020228/text/20228w02.htm#20228w02_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.256.2/1">The 2002 report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which makes recommendations about the pay of the senior Civil Service, senior military personnel and the judiciary, together with the annual uprating of parliamentary salaries, is being published today. Copies are in the Printed Paper Office and the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/2">The main recommendations of the review body are:</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/3" class="indent">Senior Civil Service (SCS): an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> of 2.5 per cent to the Government's final indicative rates for the minima, target rates and maxima for each pay band and a new band for Permanent Secretaries; a minimum bonus payment of 3 per cent or &pound;2,000, whichever is the higher, for those making the greatest contribution; and a sum equivalent to 0.4 per cent of the total SCS pay bill to be made available for use by departments to address anomalies.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/4" class="indent">Senior military: an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> of 2.5 per cent in the value of all points on the new incremental pay scales.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/5" class="indent">Judiciary: an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> of 8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/6">The Government have decided to accept these recommendations in full for the senior Civil Service and senior military. The award for the judiciary will be staged, with 3.6 per cent payable from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> and the remaining 4.4 per cent payable from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/7">The cost of all the awards will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/8">Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the increase in pay bands for the senior Civil Service. Their pay entitlement will therefore increase from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> by 2.5 per cent. In addition they will receive the second and final instalment of &pound;2,000 recommended by the Review Body on Senior Salaries in its 48th report of March 2001.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-02-28a.257.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100395" speakername="Lord Macdonald of Tradeston" colon=":" colnum="257"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020228/text/20228w02.htm#20228w02_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.257.0/1">The Government do not keep central statistics on the average length of consultation periods across government. The recommended period for central government national public consultations, including about proposals for changes in the law or in administrative practices and procedures, is 12 weeks. The period recommended for consultations is set out in the Code of Practice on Written Consultation published in November 2000. There will be circumstances that unavoidably require a consultation period of more or less than 12 weeks. Among these are timetables set out in statute; those dictated by EU or other international processes; and those tied to the Budget or other annual financial cycles.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.2/1">Paragraph 84 of the Ministerial Code makes it clear that Ministers must always make efficient and cost-effective travel arrangements. Detailed guidance to Ministers on travel is set out in Travel by Ministers, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.</p>
