	<p pid="c.131.1/2" qnum="HL7402">What military assessments were made prior to the United Kingdom's recent deployment in Afghanistan on the strength of the Taliban and the potential reconstruction and security challenges in that country; what level of troop numbers they envisage would bring peace and development to Afghanistan; and for how long they consider this level would be required.</p>

	<p pid="c.131.2/1">The Government's decision to deploy as part of stage 3 of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force was based on rigorous UK military planning and assessments, including a preliminary team that deployed in late 2005 to Helmand. The Government's view then, as now, was that the Taliban and other illegally armed groups represented a significant impediment to the country's near-term reconstruction, particularly in the south. That is why we deployed a robust force including attack helicopters and artillery.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/2">The level of forces required for the ISAF operation is kept under continual review. We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-10">10 July 2006</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 511-17) a number of enhancements to help accelerate the planned reconstruction activity. We are working with NATO allies and non-NATO troop contributors to ensure that commanders on the ground have access to the resources they need to carry out the ISAF mission. Bringing about reconstruction and development in Afghanistan will require substantial economic, developmental and political support for some time to come. The precise force package that will need to be deployed to support the Afghan Government in this task will evolve over time.</p>

	<p pid="c.131.5/1">Price negotiations are private and commercial matters in which the Government cannot and should not get involved provided competition law is respected. However, the Government recognise that many farmers are affected by low farmgate prices, particularly in relation to rising production costs. Evidence shows that there is a wide disparity in the costs of production between the most and least efficient dairy farmers. An important part of the challenge, therefore, is for the least efficient producers to identify potential efficiency gains and to work towards decreasing production costs and increasing profitability.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.5/2">There is widespread acceptance in the dairy sector that improved efficiency is part of the solution to the industry's difficulties along with improvements in innovation and better relationships across the supply chain. Through the Dairy Supply Chain Forum we are encouraging improvements in all these areas. Defra has also awarded a number of substantial grants under the Agriculture Development Scheme to help through, for example, benchmarking.</p>

	<p pid="c.131.81/1">We do not have estimates for the total carbon emissions from vehicles travelling in excess of 70 miles per hour for each of the past five years. As part of the review of the UK climate change programme, however, the Government have looked at the potential carbon savings that might result in the year 2010 under a wide range of different policy scenarios. These included one scenario under which no vehicles exceeded the speed limits on motorways and dual carriageways. Our estimates suggest that savings in the region of 0.5 million tonnes of carbon per annum could theoretically occur under such a scenario. In practice, however, it would be virtually impossible to enforce blanket compliance with the 70 miles per hour speed limit, and the Government have no intention of introducing such a policy. With regard to the effect of carbon emissions as a result of a reduction in speed limits, I would refer the noble Lord to my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col.<I> WA 43</I>).</p>

	<p pid="c.131.84/1">The UN Security Council has a range of resolutions to address the appalling situation in Darfur. The council adopted UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1591 in March 2005 to sanction individuals who are impeding the peace process and violating human rights in Darfur. It established a panel of experts to make recommendations in this respect. The council adopted UNSCR 1672 in April 2006 to impose sanctions on a first group of individuals. We strongly support the panel of experts' continuing work. We agreed to extend its mandate in UNSCR 1713, adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-29">29 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.84/2">In UNSCR 1564, the council established an international commission of inquiry to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Darfur by all parties. This body reported in January 2005. In March 2005, we helped secure UNSCR 1593, referring the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC). We continue to work with our international partners to maintain pressure on all parties, including the Government of Sudan, to provide full co-operation to the ICC as it carries out its investigative work.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.84/3">In May 2006, UNSCR 1679 called for the full and rapid implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) signed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-05">5 May</phrase> in Abuja, and on the non-signatories to join the peace process. Progress here has been slow and insufficient. We are working actively in Darfur, with the Government of Sudan, and with our international partners to ensure the parties to the DPA implement their commitments and to bring non-signatories to sign the accord.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.84/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase>, the council authorised a UN Mission for Darfur to replace the current African Union (AU) Mission (AMIS). We are working with the UN Secretary-General, Security Council partners, the AU and the League of Arab States to secure Sudanese consent and co-operation for that mission. In the mean time, the United Nations will provide additional support to help bolster AMIS until a UN mission can deploy.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.84/5">The security situation in Darfur remains critical. The Sudanese armed forces launched a major offensive against rebels in Darfur in late August, which has also resulted in civilian deaths and displacements. Rebel violence has also affected humanitarian operations. We are calling urgently for an end to these military offensives.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.84/6">The humanitarian situation is precarious and has the potential to deteriorate very rapidly. Access for humanitarian agencies is already severely hampered by banditry, fighting and attacks on aid workers and hijacking of their vehicles. Any significant change in the security situation could result in a sharp decline in humanitarian conditions. For example, the withdrawal of agencies from Gereida in south Darfur, following prolonged interfactional fighting last weekend, has left an extremely vulnerable population of over 100,000. The number of persons displaced since the conflict began is estimated to be around 2 million. Since April 2004, we have contributed over &pound;190 million in humanitarian assistance to Sudan. We are supporting the World Food Programme through the Common Humanitarian Fund, to which we have contributed &pound;49 million in 2006, making up approximately 66 per cent of its total. &pound;24 million of bilateral aid in 2006 is in support of the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.84/7">Estimates of the number of those who have died as a result of the conflict in Darfur vary widely. The most commonly cited figure is around 200,000 but this remains an estimate based on extrapolation from limited available data.</p>
