	<p pid="a.245.2/1">(a) Policy includes negotiating, developing and implementing improved rules on welfare during transport in the European Union and in domestic legislation. A dedicated team in Animal Welfare Division is responsible for the monitoring of the operation and enforcementof these rules. They work in close liaison.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.2/2">(b) Monitoring of enforcement and compliance is an important part of the Government's twin-track policy of strict enforcement while encouraging the development of improved rules on a EU-wide basis. Monitoring of the rules on welfare during transport is best carried out by the State Veterinary Service and local authorities, which have the day to day responsibility for enforcement. The operations team in Animal Welfare Division maintains the database on transporter authorisations, checks that all new routes can comply with the law and arranges non-discriminatory checks on animals in co-operation with other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.2/3">(c) Animal Welfare Division is responsible for animal welfare on farm, during transport, at markets and at slaughter. There are currently 34.6 staff employed on policy duties in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.2/4">(d) The number of staff in Animal Welfare Division has increased by 4.6 persons to 42.6 since 1997; six are employed on operational duties related to animal welfare during transport. An Enforcement Liaison Officer has been appointed to develop day to day working relations between the department and local authorities, which have primary responsibility for enforcement.</p>

Standard tariffs of compensation were introduced in GB to speed up the payments of compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.6/2">The Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme (LWDS) is available to farmers whose animals face welfare difficulties as a result of movement restrictions. Animals taken under this scheme do not qualify for compensation. Instead a standard rate of payment is made to farmers to help resolve an identified welfare problem. These payments, which vary by species and type of animal, are not a reflection of the commercial or market value of the animal. The scheme is operated by the Intervention Board on behalf of the Ministry, throughout GB. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland ran a limited pig welfare disposal scheme, under which payments were the same as those for pigs slaughtered under the LWDS. LWDS payments have been set at revised levels for animals collected as of <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-30">30 April</phrase>.</p>

An offer was made for one scientist from the USA to bring the equipment to Pirbright to carry out some comparative testing, but this was not taken up.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.8/1">Carcasses are sprayed with an approved disinfectant before burning, which destroys any virus on the outside of the animal and so reduces the risk of any infection spreading at this stage. This is an established policy, contained in the standing instructions to the field State Veterinary Service. The procedure of spraying carcasses has not been specifically publicised to farmers. Disinfection of carcasses is the responsibility of my department. The procedure is supervised at all times by an appropriate person.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.8/2">Expert advice from the Environment Agency is that there is no difference in air pollution between burning sprayed and unsprayed carcasses.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.2/1">The addition of quicklime to carcasses is an historical practice and was done for the purpose of killing organisms such as anthrax spores. It is not necessary in this situation, as the foot and mouth virus is killed by the natural decomposition process. No recent research into the effects of lime on carcasses has been undertaken.</p>
