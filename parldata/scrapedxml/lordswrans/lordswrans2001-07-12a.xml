	<p pid="a.87.5/1">The former Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Melanie Johnson MP) announced in March that &quot;N2&quot;, the date for commencing the main provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, would be no later than the end of November 2001. I can now confirm that, in lay terms, the new regime will come into effect at midnight on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-30">30 November</phrase>. For legal reasons, the date named in the Commencement Order will be <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-01">1 December</phrase>. Naming this day will have the effect of commencing the main provisions of the Act from the beginning of that day, which complies with the timescale set by the former Economic Secretary. So far, the Government have secured Parliament's approval for seven statutory instruments subject to affirmative resolution, and made a further 27 statutory instruments subject to the negative resolution procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/2">We will shortly be making other statutory instruments with a view to enabling the FSA Board to make further provisions of its rulebook at its board meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-19">19 July</phrase>. The key provisions of the rulebook, of course, were made by the FSA at its board meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-21">21 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/3">In particular, we expect shortly to make the statutory instrument that provides mechanisms by which firms having authority under old law to do financial services business will be &quot;grandfathered&quot; across into permissions to do equivalent business once FSMA commences. The FSA will then be responsible for letting individual firms know their grandfathered permissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/4">From <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-03">Monday 3 September</phrase>, we will commence FSA powers to consider applications from financial services firms to modify their grandfathered permissions or the grant of new permissions; <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-03">3 September</phrase> will also be the date from which the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal will consider appeals on decisions taken by the FSA in respect of those applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/5">By the Summer Recess, therefore, the task of implementing the Act will pass substantially to the financial services firms. They will need: to become familiar with the secondary legislation passed by Government; to absorb the provisions of the rule book made by the FSA; to analyse their grandfathered N2 permissions, and consider whether to seek modifications to those permissions; to adapt their procedures; and to train their staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/6">The date set for N2 ensures that the new regime for financial regulation starts after the close of business on the day, week and month, and should further assist financial services firms in making their adjustment.</p>

This would create a new way for private and voluntary sponsors or existing successful schools to support the management of weak or failing schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">We also proposed this option should be extended to successful schools to enable them to work in partnership with external organisations. This might be attractive to schools embarking on a radical improvement strategy or seeking to develop a more distinct identity.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.1/2" qnum="HL195">What is the basis of the calculation of the figure of &pound;80 million to be allocated to health authorities for meeting the cost of nursing care for self-funders from October 2001 to April 2002; and whether this allocation includes any provision for the administration costs to the National Health Service of taking over the funding of nursing care in nursing homes; and</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/3" qnum="HL196">Whether any additional funding will be made available to health authorities if the proposed &pound;80 million to be allocated to health authorities for meeting the costs of nursing care for self-funders from October 2001 to April 2002 proves inadequate to meet the cost of such nursing care.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/1">The Government have estimated the additional cost to the Exchequer of providing free nursing care in England to be &pound;80 million in 2001-02. This estimate assumed that nursing care would be provided for approximately 35,000 self-funding nursing home residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">This figure includes the costs of assessing the nursing care needed and general administration costs for self-funding clients.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/3">It will be for health authorities in partnership with primary care groups/trusts to manage their budgets in a way that ensures that people's needs for nursing care are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">In the last four years, train operating companies (TOCs) have been paid support for passenger rail services (SPRS) by the Franchising Director and, since <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-01">1 February 2001</phrase>, by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). Also, they have been paid grant by passenger transport executives (PTEs).

	<p pid="a.92.0/12">Since Railtrack was privatised in 1996-97, no public money has been paid direct to the company, but its profitability is contingent on public money. Some 90 per cent of Railtrack's income is paid to the company by TOCs and FOCs in access charges, a substantial proportion of which are supported by public money.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/13">In future, Railtrack will continue to receive income from TOCs and FOCs, the large majority of which will continue to receive subsidy from the SRA and PTEs. In addition, the company will receive network grants from the SRA. While the precise amounts of those grants will depend on future movements in the retail prices index, payments are expected to be of the order of &pound;505 million in 2001-02 and &pound;900 million in 2002-03.</p>
