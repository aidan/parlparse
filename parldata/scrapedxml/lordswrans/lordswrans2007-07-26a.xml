	<p pid="a.107.0/1">The director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Government believe that the director's decision to discontinue the investigation was compatible with the OECD convention. This view is borne out by the finding of Mr Justice Collins, in refusing permission to seek judicial review of the decision, that the challenge was &quot;bound to fail&quot; and that &quot;there can be no doubt that national security does trump other issues&quot;. Further, the director's view was that the threat to national and international security from continuing the investigation was so compelling that he would have taken the same decision even if consideration of those matters had been contrary to the convention.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) is an independent statutory body established by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The HFEA has the responsibility for licensing research projects under this Act. A licence committee of the HFEA can only grant a research licence if it is shown to be necessary or desirable for one of the research purposes in the 1990 Act as amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">The HFEA issued a research licence to the Newcastle Fertility Centre at LIFE (RO153) following appeal. A summary of the decision-making process is available on the HFEA website at <a href="http://www.hfea.gov.uk">www.hfea.gov.uk</a>. This includes how they defined genetic structure of an embryo and their reasoning for issuing a licence for this specific project.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">The Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill contains definitions of various terms. As the Bill amends the 1990 Act, the definitions it contains apply to clauses within the Bill itself and, where appropriate, will apply to the amended 1990 Act. The definitions in the Bill derive from the Government's extensive review of the law in this area, including through public consultation, and differ from other definitions principally because they have been drawn up for the purpose of the updated legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/2">an assessment of basking shark movements between 2001-04 in EU waters of the north west Atlantic, which indicated broad distribution patterns; anda study of the conservation status of migratory sharks, which will assist an international negotiation meeting (due to be held in December 2007 in Seychelles) to identify and elaborate further options for international co-operation on migratory sharks.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/3">The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has tope listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; in terms of its conservation status because there is the potential for &quot;directed&quot; commercial fisheries to reduce their population sizes to endangered or unsustainable levels. As a result of commercial interest in the species, Defra consulted on options to control or prevent the development of a directed fishery in English and Welsh waters. The results of this consultation are being considered with a view to Defra announcing conservation measures in the autumn of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.5/1">The UK Roads Board, which brings together representatives of national and local government engaged in highways maintenance, has published <I>Well-M</I><I>aintained Highways</I>, a code of practice for highways maintenance which the Department for Transport endorses. The code, which can be found at <a href="http://www.ukroadsliaisonqroup.orq">www.ukroadsliaisonqroup.orq</a>, provides guidance on best practice for waste management and recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/2">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), which receives funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, encourages local authorities to specify recycled aggregates in their highway contracts. WRAP's recycled roads campaign and related procurement guidance have helped to more than double, between 2005 and 2006, the number of local authorities directly specifying recycled aggregates in their highway maintenance contracts. Twenty-one per cent of local authorities now have such a policy in place.</p>

Member states are not free to apply higher standards where there are harmonising measures at EU level unless those measures provide specific exceptions. However, in all circumstances, higher standards must be proportionate and must not be disguised restrictions on trade.</p>
