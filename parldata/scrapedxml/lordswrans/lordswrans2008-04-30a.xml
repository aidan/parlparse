	<p pid="a.27.5/1">The intersection of the B6403 and the Al near Colsterworth has a poor accident record. It is intended that this will be improved by closing the gap in the central reservation currently used by local traffic crossing the Al, and traffic on the Al turning right onto the B6403, and by routing traffic and non-motorised users onto the new overbridge currently under construction.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">In England, between September 2006 and August 2007, 33,444 kilolitres of milk was subsidised. This attracted an EU subsidy of just over &pound;4.1 million and the Government top-up was worth just over &pound;1.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/2">Putting this in context, the EU subsidy is worth around 3.6p per 200 millilitres serving, the top-up is worth another 0.8p while the milk costs parents on average 18 pence per 200 millilitre serving.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.5/1">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 cover Great Britain, while Northern Ireland has its own regulations which duplicate them (the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006). The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003, which apply throughout the United Kingdom, are enforced in England, Wales and Scotland by the trading standards departments of individual local authorities and in Northern Ireland by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. In Scotland, prosecutions against infringement of the regulations are brought by the procurator fiscal. In other words, there is legislation, and an enforcement framework to implement the relevant EU legislation on packaging throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
