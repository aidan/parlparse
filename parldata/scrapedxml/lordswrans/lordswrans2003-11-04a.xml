	<p pid="a.95.2/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on Britain's National Accounts. (HL5079).</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/4">I have assumed that your question refers to the estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth during the second quarter of 2003, which was revised from 0.3% to 0.6% in September 2003. This revision represents economic activity of approximately &pound;800 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/5">It is standard statistical procedure to revise previously published figures once new evidence becomes available. Revisions mainly arise from the availability of more rich and detailed information, as in this case, where results from a full survey of the construction industry gave a markedly different estimate of activity in this sector than had been provided by earlier model-based calculations, and early returns from the survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/6">The magnitude of the revision to GDP was outside the range that is usually expected at this time, and arose from an unusually large revision to the estimate of activity in a single sector of the economy. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is investigating whether this revision reflects ongoing difficulties in measuring a sector which is known to be volatile, and whether the sector measure itself meets our current expectations. We are also continually updating methods and adapting to shifts in the economic base of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/7">Further information regarding this revision to GDP appears in the Quarterly National Accounts Briefing Note which is available on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/qnabrief0903.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/qnabrief0903.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/8">Whenever revisions are made, we publish them in an honest and transparent manner, under the terms of the National Statistics Code of Practice. Furthermore, we periodically publish analyses of the revisions made to the GDP figures, so that users can assess the nature and magnitude of the changes that have been made.</p>

Regulation will come into force with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-31">31 October 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">The suspension of removals of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe announced in January 2002 was in response to concerns about the serious deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe in the build-up to the presidential election held in March that year. We did not, at that time, regard it as unsafe to return failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, but in view of the rapidly changing conditions we considered that it would be appropriate not to enforce returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">The Government's position is, as it has been since January 2002, that each asylum (and human rights) claim made by a Zimbabwean national will be considered on its individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information including that obtained from and through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">We do of course recognise that conditions in Zimbabwe are such that there are individuals who are able to demonstrate a need for international protection. Where they meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 convention, asylum is granted. There may also be individuals whose circumstances make them particularly vulnerable and who would engage our obligations under the ECHR. Where this is the case these individuals will be granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/4">In the first six months of this year, we have granted asylum to 615 Zimbabweans and granted other forms of protection to over 20 others. These statistics show that we are giving protection to the significant number of people who are found to be in need of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/5">If an application is refused, there will be a right of appeal to the independent appellate authorities against that decision. Should a claim be refused and any appeal be unsuccessful that means that, for that individual, return to Zimbabwe would be safe. That is why we consider it reasonable to expect an individual in that position to leave voluntarily.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/6">However, although it would be safe for failed asylum seekers to return to Zimbabwe, our view at present is that in the wider context of the Government's position on Zimbabwe, it would be inappropriate forcibly to return them at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/7">The policy remains under continuous review. Huw</p>

	<p pid="a.102.3/1">The delay to the Question tabled by Lord Avebury was caused by prolonged inconclusive debate between officials about whether the lead in dealing with the question should be taken by the Home Office, because of its responsibility for policy on criminal offences, or on faith policy, or by the Department for Constitutional Affairs, because of its responsibility for court statistics and records. Unfortunately, the mechanisms in place in the two departments which in the overwhelming majority of cases ensure that such debates are resolved quickly failed on this occasion. The staff concerned have been reminded that where agreement cannot be reached at desk officer level, questions must be referred to a sufficiently senior level in a timely fashion to ensure a resolution within the deadline. I offer an unreserved apology to the noble Lord and to the Lord Avebury for the delay which occurred on this occasion.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-04a.103.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="103"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031104/text/31104w06.htm#31104w06_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.103.3/1">The sheep scab research projects to which the Countess refers ended in September of this year and the final reports are currently being compiled by the contractors. These projects have emphasised the complex nature of using a vaccine-based approach to control sheep scab. Nevertheless the data accrued are encouraging and have shown that both the lesion areas and numbers of scab mites are reduced following injection of extracts of scab mites. Furthermore, the effects can be enhanced by concentrating sub-fractions of the extract.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/2">Accordingly the Government continue to be hopeful that it may be possible to vaccinate against sheep scab. However, the development of any vaccine is a lengthy process and to that end a new three-year programme of sheep scab research is currently being developed with a view to work commencing early in 2004. We would hope to have a clearer idea of when a sheep scab vaccine might become available towards the end of these new projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/3">The sheep scab projects which began in spring 2000 have also found a fungus that will infect mites at the high skin temperature of the sheep, produced tentative evidence of mite growth hormones which may provide a key to their control and shown that anti-inflammatory drugs reduce sheep scab infection.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/4">It is hoped that all of these investigations will continue once the new projects have been commissioned. The cost is likely to be in the order of &pound;550,000 per year until December 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.5/1">The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) was appointed by Ministers in 1998 to design and oversee a large-scale field trial, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), aimed at evaluating badger culling as a means to reduce the incidence of cattle TB. The trial involves three experimental treatments: (i) proactive culling, which aims to reduce badger densities to very low levels across entire trial areas, (ii) reactive culling, which seeks to remove only those badgers geographically close to recent cattle TB outbreaks on particular premises, and (iii) no culling (survey only).</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/2">The culling of badgers in reactive treatment areas of the RBCT will be suspended from today. The decision to suspend the culling of badgers in these areas has been taken on the basis of recent scientific findings from the ISG.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/3">The ISG has advised Ministers that its interim analysis of trial data so far indicates that there was a 27 per cent increase in the number of cases of bovine TB (breakdowns) occurring in reactive culling areas compared to the related survey-only areas where no badger culling took place.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/4">We have decided to suspend operations immediately because of the risk that a further three months of culling would cause additional TB breakdowns.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/5">The results that have not emerged from the reactive culling part of the trial will be published as soon as possible in a peer reviewed scientific journal. Data on herd breakdowns from the reactive trial areas will continue to be collected and subjected to further analysis with the more detailed results being submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal at a later date.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/6">On the advice of the ISG, operations will continue in proactive areas because the data for these areas do not yet yield a statistically significant result. The survey-only (control) areas will also continue to be monitored.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/7">The Government's policy on bovine TB is based on scientific advice and these findings will be taken into account in the development of the forthcoming TB strategy.</p>
