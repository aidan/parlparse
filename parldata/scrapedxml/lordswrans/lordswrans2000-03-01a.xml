	<p pid="a.74.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/2" qnum="HL1079">In which European Union countries, for the purpose of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) of the Common Agricultural Policy, accurate field areas are supplied by national governments to farmers; in which countries farmers are expected to engage surveyors at their own expense to measure field area; and whether they believe that the practice should be uniform within the European Union or whether it should differ under the concept of subsidiarity of the Maastricht Treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.0/1">Agriculture ministries in most or all member states and regions of the European Union supply IACS claimants with area information about their land. This may take the form of a map, an aerial photograph, a printout showing areas of fields claimed in the previous year, or a combination of more than one of these. However, it is only farmers themselves who are in a position to determine the actual proportion of the total area of their land that they are entitled to use as the basis of their IACS claims each year, and throughout the EU it is they who are responsible for ascertaining what those areas are. The IACS regulations, rightly in the Government's view, do not prescribe uniformity in the determination of areas used for the basis of aid claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/2">Instead, member states have the option of allowing farmers to claim, where appropriate, the total area of a field as shown on an official map or alternatively the area actually utilised. The option of claiming the total field area has been of value to UK farmers, since it avoids the need for them to incur costs associated with determining actual cropped areas, but the European Commission has indicated that its continued availability can only be justified if the extent of uncropped areas around field margins is kept within reasonable limits.</p>

We are also implementing several of the Royal Commission's other recommendations--such as extending direct payments to people over 65. We are looking at more costly changes as part of the Year 2000 Spending Review, which will be completed this summer. We will then publish a White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/2">A large number of representations to the Government on a variety of issues refer to long-term care. Nine hundred and eighty letters to the Department of Health have specifically focused on the Royal Commission's report. Many of the representations have broadly supported the recommendations in the Royal Commission's majority report; others have been critical and some have put forward alternative proposals. The Government will be exploring with the financial industry how they could best design long-term care insurance products to make them attractive to a wider audience.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/2">In particular, the salaried doctors scheme will enable doctors to work in general practice, who would otherwise have to buy into a practice: improvements to the general practitioner retainer scheme will increase the hours that GPs can work while out of mainstream employment and enhance the educational component to ease future reintegration into the workforce; and the Personal Medical Services Primary Care Act pilots will enable a flexible range of employment opportunities to be offered and the development of new ways in which services are delivered.</p>

The Treaty provides for no definition of the terms &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;xenophobia&quot;.

	<p pid="a.82.5/1">The number of persons in Norther Ireland who are seeking asylum and who are detained has always been small. The normal course of action has been to grant temporary admission or bail while their claim is under consideration. The Government have no plans to change this arrangement Because of the small number involved, the Government do not believe that a dedicated detention facility in Northern Ireland would be viable on cost or efficiency grounds. There are also considerable practical difficulties in segregating immigration detainees from prisoners at Magheberry and Magilligan. However, the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Prison Service recognise the difficulties of using prisons for people detained under the Immigration Act 1971 and plan to undertake a joint review of future provision of detention facilities in Northern Ireland. A meeting between the Immigration Service and the Northern Ireland Prison Service is scheduled to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-09">9 March</phrase>.</p>
