	<p pid="a.69.5/1">DfID does not fund the Palestinian Negotiations Affairs Department directly. Our support is delivered through a contract with ASI Ltd which is accountable to us for the use of our funding against an agreed budget and objectives for the operations of a negotiations support unit (NSU). We maintain a full record of expenditure under our contract with ASI Ltd in its management of the NSU. Invoices are submitted monthly which set out expenditure against agreed contract parameters. Our funding pays for technical assistance provided by international and local consultants, and the operational costs of NSU's office. Our contractual agreement with ASI Ltd is clear about the objective of the project, and the nature of activities to be funded. We have established arrangements for formal monitoring against agreed workplans, and are currently finalising plans to integrate this process with the four other governments, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark, that provide complementary funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.5/2">The purpose of the project is to provide professional legal, technical, policy and communications advice to the Palestinian Authority in preparation for, and during, permanent status negotiations with Israel. Following the breakdown of formal negotiations the NSU has broadened its role by seeking to encourage the resumption of permanent status negotiations by contributing to a variety of diplomatic peace initiatives. The project supports those in the Palestinian Authority who are committed to peace. We have no reason to doubt that all project activities have been consistent with these objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.5/1">The Record Office has recently replaced the document display cases in the Royal Gallery with new cases, approved by the Works of Art Committee, which are designed to meet professional standards for the display of original records. In future, displays will be changed regularly in order to protect the documents against the risk to their long-term preservation from over-exposure to light. These arrangements, which were agreed by the Administration and Works Sub-Committee in 2002, will enable a broader cross-section of the rich constitutional, legislative and historical content of the archives of both Houses to be viewed by visitors on the line of route.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/2">Certain documents of significant historical and constitutional interest, such as the death warrant of Charles I (1649), the articles of union between England and Scotland (1706), and the draft Declaration of Rights (1689), have had to be returned to the archives for conservation reasons after many years of public display. Good quality images of such documents will instead be featured in a panel above the cases. The Record Office is investigating the options for the production of facsimile copies of these documents.</p>
