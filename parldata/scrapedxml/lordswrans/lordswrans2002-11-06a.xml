Before this we had discussed the general issue of Article 23 with the SAR Government on a number of occasions, including when my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary visited Hong Kong in July this year. Since the publication of the consultation paper, the Lord Chancellor has discussed the proposals with members of the SAR Government during his visit to Hong Kong last month.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.8/2">We have made clear to the SAR Government that any legislation should be consistent with the principles of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and the two UN human rights covenants. We welcome the Hong Kong Secretary of Justice's assertion that any new laws would comply with these international covenants. We will watch this closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.8/3">The precise wording of any legislation will be of crucial importance. We are aware that many commentators on Hong Kong have urged that the text of the proposed legislation be published before it is tabled in the Legislative Council. We hope that the SAR Government will use the consultation period to clarify the detail of the legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.2/1">During the past two years the Prison Service has been taking forward a significant programme of work to tackle racism. The programme, known as RESPOND, was launched in late September 1999 by the director general and the Prison Service's first race equality adviser. It aims to deliver improved race relations through the implementation of five objectives: developing and supporting minority ethnic staff; confronting harassment and discrimination; ensuring fairness in appraisal and selection; ensuring equal opportunities for minority ethnic prisoners; recruiting minority ethnic staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">Among the measures introduced are new instructions to raise the standard of investigations into complaints by both staff and prisoners; the introduction into selection procedures for recruitment and promotion of an assessment of candidates' abilities to recognise and challenge inappropriate remarks; the launch of the RESPECT support network for minority ethnic staff in 2001 attended by 1,500 delegates; the allocation of &pound;400,000 to RESPECT to enable it to establish a countrywide network of branches, a confidential telephone helpline and other support structures; the introduction of four new racially aggravated offences into the prisoner discipline manual; keeping regime interventions and activities under continuing review from the standpoint of diversity; the development and delivery of a new package of diversity training for all staff; and sponsorship and attendance at a wide range of minority ethnic community and recruitment events which have supported the Prison Service's success in increasing minority ethnic recruitment. The proportion of minority ethnic staff employed by the Prison Service has risen from 3.2 per cent in 1999&ndash;2000 to 4.9 per cent in 2001&ndash;02. The service has also introduced a ban on membership by staff of racist organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">While the Prison Service can point to a number of tangible successes over the past two years, it recognises that more needs to be done and will continue developing the programme of work that is already in place. To this end, the director general continues to seek the assistance of outside experts and communities to provide constructive criticism of Prison Service policy and practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.0/1">The Prison Service's race equality scheme involves an initial assessment of all those activities relevant to the Act. Policy leads and managers have been reminded of their duty to consider the impact of policy development on people from different racial groups and of the circumstances when consultation may be necessary to avoid adverse disproportionate impact on those from minority ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">Managers are required to monitor the impact of their policies to ensure that local race relations management teams develop strategies, monitor performance and ensure the implementation of the national race relations policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">Results of assessments under the scheme will be published in the Prison Service annual reports and accounts; the Home Secretary's Race Equality Employment Targets Annual Progress Report; Home Office Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System; and on the Prison Service website.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/4">To meet its specific employment duties, the Prison Service will continue to publish information on the ethnicity of staff, staff promotions and staff leavers and will publish the results of its monitoring of the performance management system. Procedures will be developed to monitor the ethnicity data relating to applicants for employment and promotion, staff training, grievance and disciplinary procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/5">Her Majesty's Prison Service seeks to fulfil all its obligations under the Race Relations Act. In recognising the service's previous shortcomings in the effective practice and management of race equality, the director general has publicly acknowledged that the service is institutionally racist. A programme of action is in hand to address problems identified at Brixton prison and elsewhere across the service by the service's race equality adviser. For example, the complaints procedures for prisoners and staff have been modified to reduce the time delay to respond to grievances; &pound;750,000 has been invested to modernise equality training of all governing governors, policy leaders, the Prison Service management board, area managers and all race relations and equal opportunity officers in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/6">The director general has introduced a ban on recruiting members of racist organisations, and staff whose behaviour has been unacceptable have been dismissed.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/7">Two years ago the director general invited the Commission for Racial Equality to assist the Prison Service in its efforts to fight racism. The CRE is approaching the end of a formal investigation. The director general awaits its findings, which he hopes will, among other matters, assist him to identify any areas which require further action.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">At the request of the Association of Chief Police Officers, which believes that the improved accuracy of the L21A1 baton round means it is suitable for use in serious public disorder and also in dealing with individuals posing an immediate threat to life in circumstances where use of a conventional firearm may otherwise be necessary, we have sought and received a medical statement from the Defence Scientific Advisory Council on the use of the L21A1 baton round at ranges from 1 to 19 metres. This supplements its earlier assessment of the injury potential over longer ranges published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-02">2 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/2">The statement confirms that the probability of unintentional impact to the most vulnerable parts of the body remains low when the round is discharged at ranges of less than 20 metres and that there is no significant change in the probability of rounds striking the potentially vulnerable chest area. This means that the likelihood of serious injury or death occurring as the result of the impact of an L21A1 baton round is no greater at ranges between 1 and 19 metres than at the longer ranges which were the subject of the earlier statement by the Defence Scientific Advisory Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/3">I will today be placing a copy of the statement in the Library. The Association of Chief Police Officers is considering, in consultation with the Government, what, if any, revision to its existing guidelines on the use of baton rounds may be appropriate in the light of this statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.8/1">Before the ban on swill-feeding, only a small proportion (about 1.4 per cent) of catering waste from restaurants and other catering establishments was fed to pigs as swill. Since the ban on swill feeding the additional waste is currently disposed of to landfill or incineration, as is the case for the vast majority of catering waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.8/2">The Government, however, take seriously their recycling targets and are moving towards reducing the amount of bio-degradeable waste sent to landfill. To that end we are currently drawing up legislation to allow the treatment of catering waste in composting and biogas plants. We intend to consult on the draft legislation shortly.</p>

The consultation was targeted towards admission authorities, as they would have the most direct interest in changes to the codes and regulations. This is why all local education authorities, as the admission authorities of community and voluntary controlled schools, were consulted, along with a representative sample of foundation and voluntary aided schools, which are their own admission authorities, and a smaller sample of other non-admission authority schools. Representative bodies of all school types were also consulted, as well as numerous national bodies.

	<p pid="a.116.5/3">The campaign includes a press advert specifically about the change to state pension age for women and we have undertaken direct marketing activity, which includes press inserts and direct mailings targeted specifically at women. These materials all highlight the fact that the state pension age for women is changing.</p>
