	<p pid="b.144.2/1">The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment's Working Group on Risk Assessment of Mixtures of Pesticides and Similar Substances examined the potential effects of combinations of pesticide active substances. The committee concluded that compounds such as organophosphates and pyrethroids, which have different modes of action, were likely to act independently, while those with the same modes of action were likely to act additively. It follows that, if grain containing an organophosphorus pesticide were mixed with grain containing another organophosphorus compound, they would be likely to act additively in proportion to their toxicities and their overall concentration in the grain. An equivalent effect would be expected if the grain were to contain different pyrethroid compounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.2/2">The committee also concluded that generally, when exposure levels of the compounds within a mixture are in the range of the &quot;no observed adverse effect&quot; levels and the components of the mixture have different modes of action, no additive or potentiating interactions are found. At the low exposure levels associated with grain consumption, it is therefore likely that there would be no such effects between the organophosphate and pyrethroid compounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.2/3">Similarly, no additive or potentiating interactions would be expected if treated grain were used for stock feed or for milling into flour for human consumption. Such processing is more likely to lead to some reduction in the levels of pesticide present, depending primarily on the extent to which it was refined before inclusion in the finished product. Monitoring carried out by the independent Pesticide Residues Committee has shown that pesticide residues are generally found less frequently and at lower levels in bread than in grain or flour.</p>

	<p pid="b.146.5/1">The workload in East Berkshire and Oxfordshire has seen a substantial increase in the past six months that has put considerable pressure on all agencies in the area. This has, in the main, been as a result of significant police activity and performance in bringing offenders to court.</p>

	<p pid="b.146.5/9">CPS Abingdon serves all the Oxfordshire magistrates' courts. There are no figures to indicate a slow throughput in Abingdon. In fact, the average processing period in Oxfordshire is 2.09 (the average time in months to process a case), which is lower than the rest of Thames Valley (which is 2.86). This figure indicates that cases are dealt with more speedily in Oxfordshire. In relation to ineffective trials, the local performance has been better than the area and national target for four of the past six months. In relation to case-throughput, the CPS in Abingdon has seen no significant increase in respect of its workload over the past year.</p>

	<p pid="b.148.5/1">As around 75 per cent of the Own Resources System that finances the EC budget is funded by member states' GNI contributions, most member states make roughly the same contribution to the budget of around 1 per cent of GNI. The exceptions to this are: Belgium, which pays a disproportionate share of Traditional Own Resources (customs duties, agricultural duties and sugar levies which account for around 10 per cent of the Own Resources System) because of the port of Antwerp; and Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and the UK which benefit from corrections that lower their contributions to the EC budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.157.0/1">I am advised that the role of a sector and response officer was independently reviewed on behalf of PSNI by Sheffield Hallam University in 2003. The review confirmed the validity of the assessment and increased the standard marginally.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.0/2">In 2004 the test was removed from the applicant process and is now applied as a mandatory requirement at the of the student officer course and at the end of the probation period.</p>

	<p pid="b.157.2/2" qnum="HL3557">What was the cost of all current government-funded local authority and Highway Agency road schemes when first submitted for Targeted Programme Improvement approval; what are the latest cost estimates; and what are the percentage changes.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-02-14b.157.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="157"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060214/text/60214w05.htm#60214w05_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.157.3/1">I have placed three tables setting out the information requested for the targeted programme of improvements (TPI) and local transport major road schemes in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.3/2">Table 1 provides a list of TPI schemes that entered the programme before April 2003. This shows the latest agreed scheme budget against the scheme cost submitted for TPI entry approval. The scheme costs at programme entry were based on net scheme costs only and excluded VAT, projected inflation and optimism bias. The latest agreed budget scheme costs include allowance for identified risks, inflation up to scheme completion, non-recoverable VAT and optimism bias, in line with revised Treasury guidance issued in April 2003. This means that scheme costs pre-April 2003 cannot be directly compared with the latest agreed budget costs post-April 2003, as they are calculated on a different basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.3/3">For the schemes in table 1, about &pound;0.6 billion (39 per cent) of the &pound;1.54 billion variance against the cost reported at TPI entry is attributable to the addition of VAT, projected inflation at 2.5 per cent and optimism bias. The remainder can be attributed to underestimates in the scope of schemes and the impact of inflation. Scheme budgets have assumed that construction inflation would run at 2.5 per cent per annum. The latest indications suggest that a higher allowance may be more appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.3/4">Table 2 provides a list of TPI schemes that entered the programme since April 2003. Both the costs of the schemes at TPI entry and the latest agreed budget costs are now reported on the basis of projected outturn scheme and include an allowance for risk, inflation, non-recoverable VAT and optimism bias. The two sets of figures are therefore directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.3/5">Table 3 provides a list of local authority schemes where cost estimation is the responsibility of the promoting authority. The department requires scheme costings to be based on the authority's best estimate of outturn scheme cost including allowance for cost inflation up to scheme completion and provision for risk. Cost increases are subject to close scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.3/6">Both Highways Agency and local authority schemes with cost increases are subject to reappraisal and value for money assessment in line with Department for Transport guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.168.6/1">Commercial craft on the (tidal) River Thames are subject to a number of safety regulations governing construction, equipment, operation and crew competence. Current regulations largely reflect lessons learnt following the accident investigation into the sinking of the &quot;Marchioness&quot; (1989) and more recently the recommendations made by Lord Justice Clarke in his report on the public inquiry into safety on the Thames (1999).</p>
	<p pid="b.168.6/2">Passenger ships (i.e. vessels carrying more than 12 passengers) have to satisfy national safety standards, for construction, equipment and manning, laid down in the relevant passenger ship regulations. Small seagoing vessels (less than 24 metres) with no more than 12 passengers have to comply with the MCA Codes for small commercial vessels. Small vessels which do not go to sea are not currently subject to any national standards but have to meet the relevant Port of London Authority (PLA) byelaw licensing requirements. In 2005, the PLA incorporated the inland waters small passenger boat code standards into those requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.6/3">Skippers of passenger ships on the tidal Thames are required hold a waterman's licence or MCA boatmaster's licence. A new national boatmaster's licence is expected to become law later this year, which will replace current licensing systems in use on the Thames.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.6/4">Sea-going freight vessels have to comply with appropriate merchant shipping survey and certification requirements. For their masters and crew, the MCA stipulates an appropriate qualification under the international convention governing the standards, training and certification of watchkeepers and imposes minimum training requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.6/5">Barges, and other freight vessels which do not go to sea, are not subject to national standards at present, but are covered by PLA requirements. National standards will be adopted during 2007&ndash;08, in line with a corresponding EC directive which is currently being negotiated.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.6/6">There are no national training and qualification requirements for the operators of non-passenger vessels at present, but those operating commercially in the port would generally have a waterman's licence. The new boatmaster's licence will extend national competency requirements to the operators of these vessels.</p>

	<p pid="b.170.5/2" qnum="HL3811">What action they are taking in the light of evidence that the increasing demand for vegetable oils in the United Kingdom is leading to the growth of palm oil plantations which destroy large areas of rainforest and threaten the survival of the orang-utan.</p>

	<p pid="b.170.6/1">The Government are very conscious that increasing consumption of goods and services in the UK can have environmental and social consequences overseas. Defra is commissioning research work on the impacts of internationally sourced commodity production on biodiversity. The research will seek to identify those commodities with the largest effects on global biodiversity, and palm oil will be one of the commodities investigated. The results of the research will inform future policy development in the UK and abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.6/2">We are also working hard in a number of areas to tackle the important issue of natural habitat loss. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.170.6/3">In Borneo, we are working with the environmental organisation WWF in support of the Heart of Borneo initiative. <a href="http://www.panda.org/heart-of-borneo">www.panda.org/heart-of-borneo</a></p>
	<p pid="b.170.6/4">The UK Government have been, since its inception in September 2001, the major financial supporter of the Great Apes Survival Project (GRASP) run by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Educational, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). <a href="http://www.unep.org/grasp">www.unep.org/grasp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.6/5">In October 2005, EU Agriculture Ministers finalised new legislation on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) that will allow the EU to enter into agreements with developing countries to provide them with assistance to tackle illegal logging.</p>
	<p pid="b.170.6/6">The Government are also seeking to address concerns regarding the use of use of palm oil for transport biofuel production. We are proposing to develop a carbon and sustainability assurance scheme to ensure that the best transport biofuels are used in the UK. The Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership is looking to define the principal environmental criteria required to protect sensitive ecosystems and will prepare a draft environmental standard to apply to all fuels, including imports.</p>

	<p pid="b.171.2/1">(a) With reference to deforestation and specifically curbing the international trade in illegally logged timber, the UK is involved in discussions with Indonesia and Malaysia through the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. In December 2005, under the UK's presidency, the EU adopted the FLEGT legislation, which will allow the EU to enter into bilateral partnership agreements with timber-producing countries and provide them with assistance to tackle illegal logging. The legislation includes a system designed to identify legal and sustainable products and license them for export to the EU; this will be reinforced by powers for Customs to take a range of actions relating to unlicensed products from partner countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.2/2">These discussions with Indonesia build on an existing memorandum of understanding signed in 2002 between Indonesia and the UK. This has been an important catalyst for raising awareness of deforestation issues in Indonesia. The UK also supports (and DfID is a generous sponsor for) the Asia Forest Law Enforcement Governance process (AFLEG) and the Asia Forest Partnership&mdash;processes which aim to address illegal logging at the regional level in Asia.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.2/3">(b) We are engaged in discussions with civil society groups in Indonesia under the Multi-stakeholder Forestry Programme, and these discussions encompass issues of land-use change.</p>
	<p pid="b.171.2/4">(c) Concerning remaining habitats of the great apes, the UK Government, through the FCO and Defra, have committed around &pound;600,000 to the United Nations Great Apes Survival Project (GRASP), which is run by UNEP and UNESCO. After the EU (which last year approved project funding of &euro;2.4 million), we remain the single largest donor to GRASP's work. This project was launched in 2001 and aims to bring worldwide attention to the ape crisis, raise funds for conservation, and develop a global conservation strategy for all ape populations. GRASP is currently drafting a five-year programme of action, to take forward the recommendations and aspirations from the Kinshasa declaration signed last year. Discussions with Indonesia and Malaysia are taking place in the context of this project.</p>
