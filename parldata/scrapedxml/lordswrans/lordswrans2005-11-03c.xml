	<p pid="c.39.2/1">Avian influenza is a disease which mainly affects birds, with infrequent cases in those people who are closely exposed to infected poultry. However, if the virus evolves into a strain which readily infects people and is easily transmissible, this could result in a human influenza pandemic. We are working to ensure that both health professionals and the public have access to information about pandemic flu. The Chief Medical Officer has produced an explanatory guide on pandemic flu. In addition, a public information leaflet, frequently asked questions and key facts sheets have been developed. These are available on the Department of Health website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu">www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu</a> and have been distributed to primary care professionals.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/2">In the event of a pandemic, in order to reduce their risk of pandemic flu, people will be advised to:</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/3">If you are ill during a pandemic:</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/4" class="indent">stay at home if you are ill, or think you may be ill;</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/5" class="indent">drink plenty of fluids;</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/6" class="indent">take medicines to reduce fever; and</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/7" class="indent">if your symptoms are getting worse, contact your general practitioner or NHS Direct.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/8">To reduce risk of infection:</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/9" class="indent">wash hands frequently (particularly after contact with people who are ill);</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/10" class="indent">cover mouth and nose with a tissue while sneezing or coughing;</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/11" class="indent">dispose of used tissues promptly and carefully&mdash;bag and bin them;</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/12" class="indent">wash hard surfaces (for example, worktops, door knobs) with a domestic cleaner regularly;</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/13" class="indent">avoid unnecessary travel;</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/14" class="indent">avoid crowds where possible; and</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/15" class="indent">ensure your children follow this advice.</p>

	<p pid="c.43.8/1">There were three main agenda points at the European Union informal meeting of Health Ministers, held on 20 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.43.8/2">The first session focused on EU pandemic preparedness. Ministers received a technical update on scientific predictions of the size, scale and likelihood of a human pandemic outbreak. The World Health Organisation and European Commission made a presentation on pandemic preparedness and Ministers discussed requirements at EU, national and international level.</p>
	<p pid="c.43.8/3">The second session was on the shared values and common principles in health systems. Although there is much diversity in health systems throughout the EU, there is also much that unites countries across the political spectrum in Europe in terms of universality, equity and solidarity. There are also shared challenges such as ageing, technology and consumer expectations. Discussions covered how the EU can both meet the challenge of economic development in a globalised world and still maintain its commitment to high levels of social protection.</p>
	<p pid="c.43.8/4">The final session was on patient mobility. Co-operation has existed for decades between EU health systems so that workers, tourists and people who have retired to other member states can get the care they need. However, there is an increasing need for clarification of patients' entitlements and Ministers looked at the impact of patient mobility and specific areas where there is a lack of clarity about entitlements.</p>

Currently, the DVLA does not have agreements with its counterparts in other countries to obtain keeper or owner details for foreign-registered vehicles. For penalty charges, a company called Euro Parking Collection plc has been established to recover on behalf of client authorities the parking penalty charges incurred by foreign-registered vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="c.48.2/1">The statutory powers of the National Heritage Memorial Fund (which administers the Heritage Lottery Fund) to distribute lottery money are limited by the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 to the same purposes as set out in the National Heritage Act 1980. The 1980 Act was amended by the National Heritage Act 1997 to enable the fund also to make grants to projects which secure the preservation and enhancement of things of importance to the national heritage, and to encourage study, access, enjoyment and maintenance of such things, including the built and natural heritage, natural history and landscape.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.2/2">The power of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to give policy directions to the fund under Section 26(2) of the 1993 Act cannot change the funding powers set out in the 1980 Act and the policy directions issued by the Secretary of State to the fund reflect those broadened powers. The fund has, as a result, been able to promote access to such projects for people from all sections of society and to promote knowledge and interest in the heritage by children and young people, while encouraging sustainable development in projects it funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.2/3">The most recent directions were given to the fund in 1998 and are contained in the fund's 2004&ndash;05 annual report available in the Library.</p>
