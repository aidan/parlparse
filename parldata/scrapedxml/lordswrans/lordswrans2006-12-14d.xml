It has a Section 64 funding stream through which it funds each year a number of very important advocacy projects. It also encourages the health service to fund mental health advocacy through a number of initiatives such as developing an advocacy training qualification to ensure advocacy is consistently of high quality. Perhaps the most important support for advocacy has been through the introduction of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which will, in April 2007, introduce statutory advocacy for persons who are severely mentally incapacitated and who have no other family or friends to assist them in making complex decisions.</p>
	<p pid="d.218.5/2">The department has no plans to make dedicated advocates available to every individual with severe disabilities.

	<p pid="d.219.1/2" qnum="HL597">What is their approach to the principle of retrospective legislation; and what are the implications for that approach of the provision in the Further Education and Training Bill that principals in further education institutions should have specified qualifications irrespective of when they were appointed.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-12-14d.219.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="219"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61214w0001.htm#06121479000028">
	<p pid="d.219.2/1">The Government consider carefully on a case-by-case basis whether it is appropriate to legislate with retrospective effect. Such legislation has the potential to give rise to unfairness and may, in certain circumstances, be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. But in other cases, it is a wholly appropriate approach&mdash;for example, where a technical defect in legislation has been identified which needs to be remedied. That said, Clause 22 of the Further Education and Training Bill is not retrospective in its effect.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.2/2">This clause amends Section 137 of the Education Act 2002 in two ways. First, it disapplies subsection (3) in relation to England, which effectively means that all principals could be covered by regulations made under this section, whether they are serving or newly appointed. Secondly, it inserts new subsection (2A) which provides that regulations made under Section 137(9) may limit the period of time in which a principal may remain in post whilst obtaining the requisite qualification. At present, Section 137 does not apply to principals who were appointed before the commencement of the provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.2/3">We intend to put in place regulations for newly appointed principals next year and, following passage of this legislation, will extend their scope to cover serving principals when they move to a new post. It is, however, not our intention to make this leadership qualification mandatory for serving principals who remain in post at this stage. If there is insufficient voluntary participation in the qualifying programme by September 2009, we may extend the regulations to include this group. Once the regulations come into effect, we anticipate that principals would have up to three years in which to achieve the qualification.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.2/4">It is not unusual for additional requirements to be placed upon professionals once they have been appointed to a post, and a similar approach was taken for school heads who are now, by virtue of Section 135 of the Education Act 2002, required to obtain a specified qualification.</p>

However, the communiqu&eacute; from the Riga summit makes it clear that NATO expects Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to co-operate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and will closely monitor their respective efforts in this. This will be important for both countries as PfP members and if they want to move beyond PfP towards full NATO membership. The level of co-operation of both countries with the ICTY is subject to regular review by ICTY's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte.</p>

	<p pid="d.221.3/1">A national action plan for audiology is currently being developed to address issues around access and waiting times, including developing a strategic model for future service development.

	<p pid="d.221.3/2">In addition to the development of the action plan, the department has also announced the procurement of up to 300,000 audiology pathways to provide assessment, fitting and follow-up.

	<p pid="d.221.6/3">A national procurement of audiology services is being undertaken as part of the second phase of the independent sector treatment centre programme. Registration by an independent sector provider with the Healthcare Commission is a prerequisite for all contracts awarded under this procurement. The department also has in place a robust central contract management framework for these services which includes clinical and non-clinical key performance indicators, which cover service levels, patient experience and quality of care.</p>

	<p pid="d.222.2/1">It is the responsibility of local health services to ensure their populations benefit from modernised audiology services, including patients who require follow up treatment or have complex needs. The modernising hearing aid services (MHAS) programme run by the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID) on behalf of the department has resulted in all National Health Service audiology services routinely fitting digital hearing aids since April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.222.2/2">The national framework contract public/private partnership, announced in October 2003, allows NHS trusts to use particular private hearing aid dispensers to see NHS patients. It ensures that the patient receives care to the same standard as applies in the NHS, is provided with the same hearing aids and remains the responsibility of the NHS. A national action plan for audiology will be published in early 2007. The action plan will be aimed at improving access and reducing waiting times for the service. We are developing the plan in close conjunction with stakeholders, with a view to publication in early 2007. The plan will set out strategy, measures, deliverables and timescales.</p>
	<p pid="d.222.2/3">In addition to the development of the action plan, the department has also announced the procurement of up to 300,000 audiology pathways to provide assessment, fitting and follow up. The development of the action plan will build on the progress made through MHAS and the PPP to improve access to, and provision of, audiology services.</p>

	<p pid="d.223.2/1">I am advised that cerebral palsy is sometimes because of a blocked blood vessel, complications in labour, extreme prematurity or illness just after birth. Infections during pregnancy, or during infancy and early childhood&mdash;meningitis or encephalitis, for example&mdash;can also cause cerebral palsy. Occasionally it is due to an inherited disorder. It is sometimes possible to identify the cause of cerebral palsy, but not always.</p>

	<p pid="d.223.5/1">Adjusting for inflation, the purchasing power of &pound;50 in 1981 would be equivalent to the purchasing power of around &pound;137 (to January 2006). The Bank of England currently has no plans to change the denominational structure of its note issue. It does not believe that there is public demand for a &pound;100 note. This is because the public makes much greater use of electronic payments than they did in 1981. Survey evidence shows that the vast majority of cash transactions are for a value of &pound;5 or less and that the highest denomination note that the public would prefer to receive from an ATM withdrawal is &pound;20. A further consideration is that high denomination notes can be more attractive to those wishing to hold and transfer criminal funds.</p>
