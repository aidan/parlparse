	<p pid="a.66.6/1">Civil penalties under Section 32 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 are enforced in court proceedings brought by the Secretary of State. Proceedings may only be brought where the prescribed period for payment has expired and any objections to payment have been considered by the Secretary of State under Section 35(8). The rules governing such envorcement proceedings will be the ordinary Rules of Court applicable to debt actions brought by the Crown. It will be open to the carrier to raise one of the statutory defences available under Section 34 of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.6/2">Similarly, where a transporter is detained under Section 36 of the Act as a security for payment of the penalty, the sale of the transporter under Section 37 is subject to the procedure laid down in Schedule 1 to the Act and Statutory Instrument 2000/685. In particular, the sale requires the leave of the court, and before such leave can be granted the Secretary of State must prove that the penalty is due, that the penalty or any connected expenses have not been paid, and that the transporter is liable to sale. Notice of the proposed sale must be given to all interested persons, who may then become parties to the proceedings. Again, it will be open to the carrier to dispute liability by raising a defence under Section 34 of the Act. And the same defences will be available when the Secretary of State seeks to enforce any other security given in place of the transporter under Section 36(2)(b).</p>

	<p pid="a.67.5/1">In the explosion on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-01">Thursday 1 June</phrase>, Hammersmith Bridge sustained severe local damage where the device was planted under the road near the Barnes abutment, on the east side. The bomb was placed at the end of a crossbeam which directly supports the carriageway. The damage was such that the weight of any traffic on the road above could not be safely carried and the bridge must remain closed to vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/2">The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, the highway authority for the bridge, wants to reopen the bridge fully as soon as is practicable. The western footway has been opened to pedestrians and it is hoped to open the bridge to cycle and motorcycle traffic shortly. The council has reviewed a range of interim measures, including upgrading the temporary propping below the bridge, and providing temporary Bailey bridges spanning across the damaged area. The council has appointed a contractor to carry out the necessary repair work; the contractor has since started work.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/3">Hammersmith and Fulham has established a preliminary work programme which aims to reopen the bridge to traffic by the end of August 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.6/1">The Armed Forces Discipline Act 2000 introduces a right of appeal from summary disciplinary proceedings. It also changes the point at which accused facing summary disciplinary proceedings in the Army and Royal Air Force may elect instead to be tried by court martial. When the changes come into effect, the accused will be offered the opportunity to elect trial by court martial before the commanding officer hears the evidence on the charge rather than, as now, only after the commanding officer has found the charge proved. These new procedures will be similar to those already operated by the Royal Navy.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.6/2">The main purpose of altering the point of election for court martial is to remove any possibility of confusion between this procedure, which at present in the Army and Royal Air Force may be considered to have certain of the characteristics of an appeal, and the new right of appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.6/3">A court martial is a court of first instance under both the current and the new dispensations.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.2/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has today laid before Parliament four statutory instruments to improve the handling of planning appeals under each of the three main procedures, written representations, hearings and inquiries. These are: the Town and Country Planning (Appeals) (Written Representations Procedure) Regulations 2000; and Town and Country Planning (Hearings Procedure) (England) Rules 2000, the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000 and the Town and Country Planning Appeals (Determination by Inspectors) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000. My right honourable friend has also laid before Parliament a related amendment to the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/2">A departmental circular (DETR 5/2000), Planning Appeals: Procedures (including inquiries into called-in planning applications), is being issued today to accompany the new statutory instruments and copies have been placed in the House Libraries. This circular (which replaces Circular DOE 15/96) explains the new procedures governing written representations, hearings and inquiries (including inquiries into called-in planning applications). The changes implement the conclusions of a consultation exercise announced by my right honourable friend the then Minister for Planning on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-31">31 March</phrase> last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/3">The new arrangements, due to come into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-01">1 August 2000</phrase>, are a key component of our &quot;Modernising Planning&quot; programme. We are determined to improve the service offered to business householders and other users of the appeal system. The changes being introduced will improve the speed and efficiency of the system without impairing the quality, fairness or openness of the process or people's ability to participate.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/4">We have already set tough targets for the Planning Inspectorate to turn round appeals more quickly and it has made a good deal of progress in improving its own performance. However, improving service to the benefit of all concerned is not just the responsibility of the Planning Inspectorate. All parties to the appeals process have a responsibility to meet the deadlines set and to co-operate with the inspectorate in agreeing dates offered for hearings and inquiries. In future, representations received after due dates will normally be disregarded. We shall be carefully monitoring the impact of the changes and will review their effectiveness after about a year to help us decide whether any further action is needed.</p>
