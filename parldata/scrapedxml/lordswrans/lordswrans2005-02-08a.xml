	<p pid="a.98.8/1">The Association of Chief Police Officers has made representations to us about this and we have promised to look into their concerns. We want to work together to ensure that the new legislation impacts properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.8/2">The licensing fees will, for the first time, fund enforcement of licensing conditions by local authorities. We estimate that a minimum of 60 per cent of the premises annual charge will go to enforcement&mdash;about &pound;30 million. In contrast, the existing licensing system does not provide any resources for enforcement. Furthermore, through streamlining the administrative licensing process, the Licensing Act 2003 should save the police up to &pound;15 million annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.8/3">Fees are not meant to pay for the policing of the night-time economy, for example dealing with street drinkers and anti-social behaviour. That is why we have been developing separate policy proposals for tackling alcohol-related crime and disorder which we outlined in our consultation document <i>Drinking Responsibly: The Government's Proposals</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-21">21 January</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.5/1">Surveillance does not involve the same sorts of sensitive capabilities and techniques as interception. Exposure of capability in the case of interception is potentially much more damaging because targets can more easily avoid interception by changing the way in which they choose to communicate.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">Legal regimes in a range of overseas countries were considered. The review found that the United Kingdom could not simply transplant the evidential regimes of other countries because our legal system is very different, being both adversarial and subject to ECHR considerations. No other country examined had a statutory basis for intelligence agencies to assist law enforcement agencies as is the case in the United Kingdom. The review underlined the importance and value of the unparalleled co-operation between the United Kingdom's intelligence and law enforcement agencies but noted that this would be at risk, in a way that did not apply to the same extent to overseas jurisdictions, if there was a possibility that sensitive capabilities and techniques might be exposed.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.2/1">There was no intended criticism of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal which is a fully independent part of the decision-making process for the war pensions scheme. Nor were the examples given meant to be seen as cases of abuse of the war pensions scheme. As I made clear to the House, there is no dispute that the claimants were suffering from a medical condition, nor is the department questioning the entitlement which they enjoy under the war pensions scheme. My point was to illustrate the types of cases where the connection between an individual's service and their illness or death might be tenuous but could result in an award under the scheme because of its particular test of proof. I proposed that, for the future, entitlement should not be justifiable in such cases in an up-to-date scheme and that the money available should be more effectively focused on the more severely disabled due to service who are poorly provided for under existing arrangements. I remain of this view which in no way casts doubt on the hard work or the judgment of the President of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal for England and Wales or his tribunal colleagues, who are applying the war pensions scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.0/1">The process of re-structuring the infantry has been worked through by the Army, consulting with the divisions and regiments concerned. Colonels of individual regiments have been directly involved via the colonels commandants of the divisions of infantry. Proposals were submitted to the Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB) on a divisional basis by the relevant colonel commandant.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/2">In making this decision ECAB took advice from the colonel commandant of the Prince of Wales's Division as the representative of the regiments concerned and concluded that in line with that recommendation, the new regiment should be called The Royal Welsh and that its two battalions should be called 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh (The Royal Welch Fusiliers) and 2nd Battalion The Royal Welsh (The Royal Regiment of Wales).</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/3">With regards to the approach adopted for the Scottish division, in light of our intent to create genuinely large regiments and maximise the benefits thereof in the post arms plot era, ECAB carefully considered whether there were specific circumstances that were unique to the division. The conclusion reached was that the bold move direct to the largest single cap badge (and single tartan) regiment of five battalions warranted the retention of the antecedent names foremost. It was also felt that given the very different nature and large geographical spread of the existing regiments from Scotland, this would help maintain the best possible recruitment in light of such radical change.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/4">It remains the case, notwithstanding the representations referred to by the noble Lord, that the Scottish division was the only one to propose placing the antecedent names foremost during the consultation and decision making process, which informed ECAB's recommendation to the Secretary of State and his subsequent announcement on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase>. The remarks by the Chief of the General Staff to the Defence Select Committee of the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase> merely reflect that.</p>

However, while local authorities have the right to decide who is polled, we recognise the importance of local authorities being able to conduct such referendums on a full franchise, and we are considering how to achieve this while maintaining security of information on the full electoral register.</p>
