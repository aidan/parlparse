	<p pid="a.249.5/1">Planning obligations under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 can be used to secure the implementation of a planning policy in order to make acceptable a proposal for a Gypsy and Traveller site which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms. This could include securing a contribution towards infrastructure needed to mitigate the impacts of that development.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.5/2">Planning obligations are usually negotiated in the context of planning applications and should be sought by local planning authorities only if they meet all of the Secretary of State's policy tests set out in ODPM Circular 05/2005 <I>Planning Obligations</I>. Developers may also enter voluntarily into unilateral undertakings at any time.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.5/3">Planning obligations and unilateral undertakings are legal agreements and are usually drafted so that they come into effect at a time when planning permission is granted, and may provide that they are not enforceable until the developer implements the permission for which the planning obligation has been entered into.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.8/1">We are aware of representations made by the Countryside Alliance and others about housing and other development being built on floodplains. The Government's policy, set out in Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25), <I>Development and Flood Risk</I>, is to avoid inappropriate development in flood risk areas, and to direct development away from high risk areas by ensuring that sites at little or no risk of flooding are developed in preference to areas at higher risk. Local authorities should shape new development according to the needs of their area, and make decisions on where new housing should be located through the development plan process. They should ensure that new housing is developed in suitable locations, and carry out sustainability appraisals, informed by strategic flood risk assessments, in order to deliver sustainable development objectives, taking flood risk and climate change into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.8/2">However, the Government recognise that it will not always be possible to find locations for development at low flood risk. Around 10 per cent of England by land area, population and housing stock already lies within flood risk areas. There are large areas and towns and cities, for example in eastern England, where virtually all land is within high flood risk areas, with few sites for development in lower risk areas. PPS25 requires that any development that is needed in flood risk areas should be safe, should not increase flood risk and, where possible, reduce the overall risk through good design and layout of development on the site.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.0/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase>, the National DNA Database (NDNAD) held 364,058 profiles from individuals under 18 from all UK forces (including England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands). The number of profiles held on the database is not indicative of the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/2">At present, the replication rate is 13.3 per cent, that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent fewer than the number of profiles. Therefore, the estimated number of individuals under 18 as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase> is 315,638. Individuals who were under 18 at the time that a DNA sample was taken from them, but were over 18 on this date, are not included in the figures.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.3/1">It is understood this Question relates to profiles from known individuals rather than profiles from crime scenes. The number of these deleted between the establishment of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) in 1995 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-05">5 March 2008</phrase> is estimated to be 386,205.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.3/2">The types of record deleted have varied over time and between different parts of the United Kingdom. In England and Wales before 2001, the police could take DNA from anyone charged, but the samples and the profiles derived from them had to be destroyed if charges were dropped or the person was found not guilty.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.3/3">The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 changed this so that DNA could be kept from those who had been charged even if they were acquitted; the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (which came into force in 2004) extended the power further, so that DNA could be kept from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and held in a police station. In Scotland, DNA samples and profiles can be retained permanently from anyone convicted; if a prosecution is started for a sexual or violent offence, the DNA can be retained for three years with a possible extension, regardless of whether the person is brought to trial or convicted; otherwise the DNA samples and profiles have to be destroyed after the investigation. Therefore, since 2004 most of the profiles deleted from the NDNAD have been Scottish ones.</p>
