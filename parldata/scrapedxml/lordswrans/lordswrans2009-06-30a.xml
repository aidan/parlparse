	<p pid="a.29.2/1">Defra has no plans to impose an import ban on cattle and livestock from areas in Europe affected by bluetongue. Provided that EU movement rules for bluetongue susceptible species are being complied with, the risk posed by bluetongue in other member states is very low, and does not justify such a ban. Also, BTV-8 is being effectively managed through vaccination in most EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/2">Movements of bluetongue susceptible species are governed by EC Regulation 1266/2007, which was developed with the best available scientific advice, balancing risks proportionately against impact on trade. Where new evidence has become available, rules have been adjusted. We will continue to consider emerging evidence and any implications for movement conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-03">3 November 2008</phrase>, all of Great Britain became a single confluent restricted zone for Bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8). We are therefore effectively in the same BTV-8 restricted zone as neighbouring EU member states. Animals can be moved freely within this restricted zone, and to and from other BTV-8 restricted zones in Europe provided that they meet the generic import/export requirements and are accompanied by an export health certificate which has been signed by an official veterinarian. In the case of BTV-1, we are not part of this restricted zone which currently includes France and Spain. In this case movement controls into the UK are much stricter.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/4">We have implemented a robust post-import testing regime for all imported livestock, and where livestock test positive for Bluetongue, appropriate risk management action will be taken, depending on the serotype detected. Since December 2008 no imported livestock have tested positive for bluetongue. We urge industry to consider the risks and check the health and vaccination status of livestock when sourcing susceptible animals from abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/2">We are currently revising the drug and alcohol guidance for schools, and Ministers have announced their intention to making drug and alcohol education statutory as part of personal, social, health and economic education, subject to consultation and parliamentary process.

Political freedoms are completely absent and any dissent is brutally crushed. Treatment of Burma's ethnic groups is of particular concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/2">Appalling human rights abuses are undoubtedly happening in Burma. However, as Burma is not a state party to the Rome statute, it would require a Chapter VII UN Security Council resolution to refer the situation in the country to the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court. In the past two years our efforts have helped to secure unprecedented Security Council action on Burma, in the form of two strongly worded presidential statements. It is, however, highly unlikely that the council would agree to pass a binding resolution on this issue. Our efforts to secure a non-binding resolution on Burma in 2007 were blocked by other members. We regularly test the degree of consensus as we seek Security Council action and strong resolutions in the Human Rights Council and General Assembly.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.0/1">Mrs Fulton has requested that no information be given out about her case. Our high commission in Banjul have raised a number of issues on Mr Fulton's behalf with the Gambian Ministry of Interior. We understand that Mr Fulton was sentenced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase> to an additional three years' imprisonment for forgery, but is appealing against the sentence.

Following the safe return of five former legal residents to the UK, only one individual with this status, Shaker Aamer, is at Guantanamo Bay, where he has been held since February 2002. We requested his release and return to the UK in August 2007. The US has so far declined our request, owing to security concerns. We continue to make clear that our request stands for his release and return. We maintain an ongoing dialogue with the US regarding Mr Aamer's welfare, and are in frequent contact with his family and legal representatives.</p>
