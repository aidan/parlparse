	<p pid="a.107.5/1">The launch of the euro in 11 European Union (EU) countries has implications for UK firms of all sizes across a number of business sectors. That is why the Government established the Euro Preparations Unit (EPU). Since its inception in December 1997, EPU has run a national business information campaign on the euro and published euro factsheets and case studies, which help small and medium sized enterprises in particular to take account of the euro now that it is a business reality. Further information can be found in the Treasury's regular euro progress reports, the most recent of which was published in November 1999. Copies of these reports are available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.11/1">Green Ministers held their first meeting of this year on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-16">16 March</phrase>. The Committee agreed the publication of a series of guides to help promote sustainable development and the greening of government across Whitehall and beyond. Work of Green Ministers lists all the Government's targets and commitments in this area. It is also a good summary for those who would like to understand more about the role of Green Ministers and their work. Sustainable development--what it is and what you can do helps to explain sustainable development for the ordinary civil servant. The other leaflets will help public sector bodies prepare sustainable development awareness-raising strategies and address biodiversity issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.11/2">At the meeting, Green Ministers discussed progress on environmental management systems, travel plans and integrating the environment into policy. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office, their Green Minister, outlined progress on greening the police and prison service as well as the main department.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.11/3">Green Ministers agreed:</p>
	<p pid="a.109.11/4" class="indent">there should be an annual meeting of departments' senior officials responsible for sustainable development;</p>
	<p pid="a.109.11/5" class="indent">to continue their work to make the Government's funding regimes, such as the Spending Review and the Private Finance Initiative, as sustainable as possible, including taking account of the environment;</p>
	<p pid="a.109.11/6" class="indent">target a number of associate bodies (including non-departmental public bodies and executive agencies) and help them become models for best practice on sustainable development, encouraging others to follow suit.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.11/7">Since Green Ministers' last meeting in November, the Government have agreed proposals for new energy targets. From <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April</phrase>, Government will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1 per cent a year. In addition, Green Ministers will continue to make the benchmarking of Government buildings a priority and will investigate the feasibility of reporting on emissions from transport as well as buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.11/8">The departments represented by Ministers were: Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions; Cabinet Office; Foreign and Commonwealth Office; Department of Health; Department of Social Security; the Chancellor's Departments; Law Officers Departments; Home Office; the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and the Welsh Office. Those represented by officials were: Department for International Development and Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.3/1">My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, Mr O'Brien, published this consultation paper on <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-11">11 November 1999</phrase> and the consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-31">31 January 2000</phrase>. The Home Office received 2,820 responses, mostly from casino staff. Two-thousand, eight hundred and nine of the responses opposed the proposals. Six were neutral and five expressed support.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/2">Many casino staff were concerned about the impact which the proposal would have on them and their families, about the difficulties in travelling home especially for female staff in the early hours, and about more exposure to passive smoking. Some also said that management had not consulted them about the proposed change. They wanted us to regulate these employment issues by using the law rather than through employee/employer negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/3">The unions opposed the change. They drew attention to the lack of recognition for collective bargaining purposes in casinos and to the timing of the implementation of the union recognition provisions of the Employment Relations Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/4">Some residents' associations were also worried about increased noise early in the morning and additional traffic.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/5">Having considered the responses very carefully, my honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, Mr O'Brien, has nevertheless concluded that we should proceed with the proposal. The issue is not the number of responses, but the strength of the argument for restricting commercial freedom. Casinos will not be obliged to adopt longer opening hours, but they will have more flexibility to meet consumer demand and increase their competitiveness. The changes will not so significantly affect the running of casinos as to require deferment pending the outcome of the independent gambling review, which is to start after Easter. The Gaming Board for Great Britain has no objections.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/6">The Government understand the concerns about the impact of additional operating hours on casino staff and their families or on local residents. But the Gaming Act 1968 provides a regulatory framework for gambling in the public interest and is not designed to regulate normal employer/employee relations, which are subject to the Employment Relations Act 1999. We agree with the view expressed by the unions that any changes to casino hours should not be made before the union recognition provision of the Act is in force. The longer hours will not, therefore, be available until the end of July this year. In addition, it will continue to give to licensing authorities power to impose restrictions on casino hours where necessary to prevent disturbance or annoyance to the occupiers of other premises in the vicinity so that the concerns of residents can be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/7">The Scottish Executive has consulted on a similar exercise in respect of casinos in Scotland and will report the outcome separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/8">We will place a revised Regulatory Impact Assessment in the Library when the order is laid.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State at the Home Office, Mrs Roche, represented the United Kingdom at the Council. The main matters dealt with were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">'A' points</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">The list of 'A' points was agreed in full, including, amongst other things, the Europol Work Programme for 2000; the exchange of information in the evaluation of risks and control of new synthetic drugs; and the Council Decision concerning the better exchange of information in order to fight the use of counterfeit travel documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/4">Open debate on the protection of victims in the European Judicial Area</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/5">The priority being given to improving the position of victims in the European Union was welcomed wholeheartedly by the Council. The Commission's consultation paper was regarded as the basis for future work. All member states had domestic schemes to assist victims, but it was agreed that action was needed at Union level to ensure adequate protection for those who were victims abroad. The right to compensation was also discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/6">Adoption of the Agenda</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/7">In view of the ongoing discussions between Spain and the United Kingdom, in consultation with the Government of Gibraltar, the Presidency dropped four items (Insolvency, Service of Documents, Eurodac Regulations, Mandate for a parallel Dublin Agreement with Norway and Iceland) from the meeting's agenda, since the outstanding issue on these dossiers was the question of application to Gibraltar.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/8">Tampere Score-Board</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/9">There was a presentation by the Commission. The Council gave broad endorsement to the objectives, structure and deadlines set out in the Commission Score-Board as a political, not legal, commitment. It was acknowledged that the document should be flexible, with deadlines and substance being kept under review. A revised version would be presented for review once per Presidency. Member states set out their priorities, with the next Presidency giving a detailed picture of its Presidency objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/10">Counterfeiting the Euro</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/11">There was political agreement, subject to one Member State's parliamentary scrutiny reserve. The Commission announced its intention to bring forward a supplementary instrument including provisions on co-operation, training and exchange of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/12">Draft Mutual Legal Assistance Convention</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/13">Agreement was reached on outstanding issues except territorial scope and data protection. The draft Convention would be submitted for adoption at the May Council, following further consultation and consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/14">Framework Decision establishing joint teams to conduct criminal investigations in one or more member state</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/15">Member states remained divided as to the most appropriate means of implementing the paragraph of the Tampere conclusions calling for the establishment without delay of joint investigation teams to conduct criminal investigations. The issue would be remitted back to the appropriate working group.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/16">The prevention and control of organised crime: a European strategy for the beginning of the new Millennium</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/17">The text of the strategy was approved and would be published in the Official Journal in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/18">Collective Evaluation: preliminary country reports on Czech Republic and Hungary</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/19">The Council noted the reports by the Collective Evaluation Working Group. The importance of Justice and Home Affairs matters in the enlargement exercise was stressed. Member states would assist applicant countries all they could, but it was considered important that pressure should continue to be placed on the applicant countries themselves. It was agreed that the Council Secretariat would prepare a document for the Enlargement Working Group setting out any areas of omission or weakness identified in the country reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/20">Brussels II Regulation (proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children)</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/21">Substantial progress was made on this item, subject to the outstanding issue of territorial scope. The United Kingdom did not lift its parliamentary reserve and in that respect the reference in the press statement by the Council reporting on the outcome of the proceedings that &quot;political agreement&quot; has been reached on the draft instrument was incorrect.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/22">Brussels I Regulation (proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters)</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/23">The Presidency gave a &quot;state of play&quot; report on discussion of the draft Regulation. It was noted that the European Parliament's opinion was awaited. The Commission announced its intention to propose an amendment to Article 15 of the Regulation to make clear that it applied to distance contract only.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/24">Charter of Fundamental Rights</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/25">The Presidency gave a &quot;state of play&quot; report on discussions. A final draft would be prepared by June and adopted by the end of October, for submission to the European Council. Major issues such as scope, legal status and relationship with the European Court of Human Rights would be considered once agreement had been reached on the body of the text. There was no discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/26">Commission proposal for a European Refugee Fund</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/27">The Presidency gave the state of play, reporting on discussion in the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum, noting the need for the proposal to be clearer on the aims and target of the fund, on future financing and on the allocation criteria. The Commission was invited to bring forward a proposal on temporary protection as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/28">Following discussion, the Commission expressed the hope that the proposal could be adopted during the current Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/29">Revision of the Dublin Convention</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/30">The Commission paper (analysing the current problems with the operation of the Dublin Convention and considering alternatives for a replacement Title IV measure) was generally welcomed. The Commission planned to consult widely. A proposal would then be made at the turn of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/31">High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/32">The Presidency noted that the Action Plan on Albania and the neighbouring region had now been agreed by the High Level Working Group and would go to the General Affairs Council for adoption in June. New working methods had been established to take forward the implementation of all the Action Plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/33">United Kingdom Drugs Initiative</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">The Army and RAF have revised and updated the guidance given to their personnel on the values and standards of each Service and the standards of behaviour and conduct to which they are expected to adhere. This underpins Service ethos and so helps to sustain the operational effectiveness of the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">The revised guidance is set out in publications entitled Values and Standards of the British Army and Core Values and Standards of the Royal Air Force, which are being widely distributed in the Services. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.5/1">Marne Barracks is occupied by 5 Regiment Royal Artillery and 8 Transport Regiment Royal Logistic Corps. From 2003, 8 Transport Regiment will expand to include two further squadrons and in order to accommodate this increase it is proposed that part of the airfield should be built over. Precise details have yet to be confirmed, but it is envisaged that glider activity by 645 Volunteer Glider School at the airfield will be affected. An option study to identify an alternative site for the Gliding School is under way, but, in the meantime, gliding activity does not impede the current redevelopment.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/2">Currently, work is under way at Marne Barracks to upgrade the gymnasium and it is expected that this work will be complete by the end of September. In addition, a new Surveillance and Target Acquisition Training Centre should be completed at the end of the year. A major refurbishment of the single living accommodation will commence at the end of 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.7/2" qnum="HL1654">How the SA80 rifle compares to its predecessor the SLR in terms of: (a) accuracy; (b) overall length; (c) ease of carrying while undertaking other work; and (d) size of magazine.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-04-03a.117.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="117"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000403/text/00403w04.htm#00403w04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.117.0/1">The SA80 is a lighter, more accurate and more versatile weapon than the SLR. The lower recoil energy of the SA80 derived from its smaller cartridge makes it easier to maintain or reacquire a target during shooting than with the SLR. The average user therefore finds the weapon easier to handle and use. The SA80's SUSAT optical sight, issued to all infantry users, provides 4x magnification of a target, increasing further the accuracy and consistency of the weapon.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">The length of the SA80 is 785mm, some 350mm shorter than the SLR. The compact configuration of the SA80 allows it to be handled in and out of vehicles (such as armoured personnel carriers) much more easily, allowing the weapon to be brought into action more quickly and effectively. It also makes the SA80 easier to operate when moving in confined spaces such as in urban or jungle areas. The unique SA80 sling allows the weapon to be carried in a number of configurations, which allows greater flexibility than with the SLR both to carry the weapon and to complete other tasks such as digging.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/3">The SA80 magazine holds 30 rounds of 5.56mm ammunition compared to the 20 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition carried within the SLR magazine. This increases the amount of ammunition that a dismounted section can carry, increasing its flexibility.</p>
