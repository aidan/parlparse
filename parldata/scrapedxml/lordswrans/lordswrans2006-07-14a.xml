The primary role of UK forces deployed in Helmand will remain to support the Afghan security forces in creating a secure environment that enables others, including the Afghan Government, the United Nations, OGDs and non-governmental organisations to engage in reconstruction and development work.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.5/1">The harmonised Armed Forces allowances package is broadly cost neutral. However, in the short term across all three services there will be individuals who receive additional financial benefit and those who receive less; indeed, there may well be individuals who see an immediate increase in one allowance that they receive and a reduction in another. The financial effect on individual service personnel depends entirely on what allowances they are eligible to claim at any point in their service career. This is clearly dependent upon their particular circumstances at that time.</p>

Since then, the EU has agreed &euro;139 million of financial aid to bring them closer to the EU in pursuit of a settlement.

	<p pid="a.148.0/1">Organising the elections in the DRC is a difficult task in a country the size of Western Europe and with few roads or other transport infrastructure. Despite the immense technical and logistical challenges, the plans of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), supported by the UN and international community, are on track, and we are confident that the IEC will be ready to administer presidential and parliamentary elections on <phrase class="date" code="">30 July</phrase>. The final electoral list will be published this week. With assistance from the international community, the IEC is training staff for over 40,000 polling stations; and printing and deploying ballot papers across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/2">DfID, working with the South African police service, is supporting the Congolese police to prepare for providing a safe environment for voting. Essential communications equipment will be fully deployed and police trained in its use. Knowledge of the elections remains limited in many areas. We are also supporting a national multi-faith coalition to deliver civic and voter education to help address this but lack of knowledge about the electoral process will be an issue on polling day.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/3">Presidential candidates and parliamentary candidates, started campaigning on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-29">29 June</phrase>. DRC's media authority is overseeing the organisation of radio and TV debates. The UK, in concert with other international partners is closely monitoring the campaign and has called for the authorities to respect the freedoms of all candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/4">Observers are crucial to giving the people of DRC confidence in the electoral process. DfID is supporting up to 50,000 national observers, and observers from the Carter Center. The UK will participate in the 300-plus EU observer mission, and an observer mission from the Electoral Institute of Southern Africa. Further missions are expected from the African Union and SADC.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/5">The UK is the largest bilateral donor to the elections in DRC, providing &pound;25 million for the elections process and elections security. The Government are also heavily engaged politically in supporting preparations for credible, fair elections in DRC.</p>

However the Equal Opportunities Commission baseline budget allocation of just over &pound;8 million (&pound;8,005,000) for 2006-07 has not been reduced.

But we must all do more to address the global ideology that seeks to exploit such issues as a justification for extremism and terrorism.

	<p pid="a.155.2/1">Clause 12 of the Police and Justice Bill&mdash;&quot;Information gathering powers: extension to domestic flights&quot;&mdash;amends Section 32 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 to enable the police to gain advance bulk access to passenger, crew and service information on air and sea journeys within the United Kingdom for certain purposes. The new power will enable the police to gain effective intelligence on the movement of known terrorist suspects and criminals and will allow them to build up a detailed picture of suspect passengers, travel patterns and networks. Improved intelligence will result in more targeted interventions and reduce the likelihood of innocent travellers being stopped. It is not intended to help the police to detect and prosecute the theft of passengers' baggage at airports, which is more appropriate to Clause 10. Clause 10 introduces a new power for police to stop and search any person at an aerodrome, amending Part III of the Aviation Security Act 1982, to enable a police constable to stop and search, without warrant, any person, vehicle or aircraft in any area of an aerodrome where he has reasonable grounds to suspect that criminal activity has, or is about to, take place. The aim of this new power is to reduce opportunities for criminal activity at airports and, in turn, simultaneously to reduce opportunities for organised crime and terrorist activity. As such, it will extend to crimes involving the theft of and from passengers' baggage although at this stage we have no reliable estimates of the number of prosecutions that may result.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.6/1">There is a UN arms embargo on Darfur and an EU arms embargo on the whole of Sudan. The UK scrupulously follows both of these. There is evidence, including in the recent report prepared by the UN Panel of Experts for Sudan, that the arms embargo is being breached by all sides involved in the Darfur conflict and by others in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.6/2">We are aware of reports that Chinese weapons have been found in Darfur. We are actively encouraging China and other states to support work towards an arms trade treaty which would end the irresponsible trade in conventional arms.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.6/3">We have had no recent discussions on arms with Chad, Libya and Eritrea. However, we continue to discuss with all the states of the region how to promote lasting peace and stability in Darfur.</p>
