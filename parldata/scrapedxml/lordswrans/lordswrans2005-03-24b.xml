	<p pid="b.54.0/1">Following the takeover of power by the King on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase>, my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Douglas Alexander) summoned the Nepalese Ambassador to express our grave concern at developments. The UK also issued a statement with European Union (EU) partners highlighting our concerns about restrictions on liberty and calling for human rights to be respected. Our ambassador raised our concerns directly with the King on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-08">8 February</phrase> and raised similar concerns in conjunction with other EU member states' ambassadors, with the new Nepalese Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/2">We understand that many of the political leaders have now been released from detention, although we remain concerned for other political and human rights activists who have been detained since the King's takeover. Restrictions on political reporting and commentary in the media are gradually being relaxed although there is still an outright ban on military reporting that does not come direct from official military sources. In the absence of independent reporting, through the media and through non-governmental organisations, it is very difficult to get confirmed reports of extra-judicial killings or human rights abuses by the Royal Nepalese Army or the Maoists. However, we continue to be deeply concerned about Nepal's poor human rights record and condemn all abuses, whoever the perpetrator is.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/3">Our ambassador is now seeking an early audience with the King to encourage him again to restore the fundamental rights as a first step towards restoring democracy and democratic-process. We will be taking the issue up at the United Nations Commission for Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.58.5/1">Disadvantaged areas relief (DAR) on commercial transactions is estimated to cost &pound;870 million out of the estimated total cost of DAR of &pound;1 billion in 2004&ndash;05. The estimated yield from abolition of DAR on commercial transactions is lower than the cost of relief because the latter includes the effect of the substitution of DAR for other stamp duty land tax (SDLT) reliefs (such as group relief), the claiming of DAR in respect of transactions undertaken in earlier years, and the effect of additional transactions generated by the relief. None of these elements of the cost of relief claimed will form part of the yield from abolition of DAR on commercial transactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.5/2">Because the cost of these individual elements is highly uncertain, the estimated yield from ending disadvantaged areas relief in 2005&ndash;06 is based upon the estimated historic yield from commercial transactions, projected forwards to 2005&ndash;06, and the proportion of transactions taking place in disadvantaged areas prior to the introduction of the relief.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.3/1">Section 176A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974&mdash;inserted into the Act by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Electronic Communications) Order 2004&mdash;augments the existing rules in Section 176 of the Act governing the service of documents with specific provisions dealing with the transmission of electronic documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.3/2">Section 176 is subject to the general rules that items sent by post are deemed to have been delivered on the day following posting. The intention was to retain this assumption in respect of electronic transmission. However, as the general rule does not apply to electronic communications, a specific provision to that effect was required. The &quot;next day&quot; approach was adopted because it avoids the need to make assumptions about office hours and typical transit time. The civil procedure rules contain a similar rule in respect of faxed documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.3/3">The different approach in respect of Section 69 is again to replicate existing provisions in the Consumer Credit Act that apply to paper-based transmission. The amended Section 69(7) specifically stated that a notice of cancellation by the borrower is deemed to have been served at the time of posting. Regulation 2(5) therefore replaces Section 69(7) with a new provision which states that a cancellation notice will be treated as having been served either at the time of posting or at the time of transmission. Historically the Consumer Credit Act has made this distinction between the deemed receipt of cancellation notices and the delivery of other communications to ensure that a borrower who wishes to cancel an agreement is able to do so with the confidence that the cancellation will be effective within the statutory cooling-off period.</p>
