If an electoral registration officer (ERO) or an acting returning officer (ARO) has a suspicion of electoral fraud, it is for them to notify the police. Where an application meets the statutory requirements, it must be accepted, and, where practicable, the ERO will confirm the arrangements by notifying the elector.

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">(a) The seat spacing proposals in the CAA-sponsored ICE Ergonomics research were based primarily on emergency evacuation requirements. ICE Ergonomics were additionally asked to consider the medical aspects of long-term sitting and the scope for addressing this within the minimum seat spacing requirements. The report concluded that there was a lack of prospective, controlled data and that the contribution of seat design and spacing to the development of thromboembolic disease was not yet known.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">(b) Any decision to increase the safety-based minima on UK aircraft on long-haul flights would be a matter for the CAA.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">There is currently no evidence to justify an increase in the minima on long-haul flights on the grounds of health. On the basis of our current understanding of travel-related DVT, it is immobility that presents the most significant risk factor and this issue is addressed in the advice on DVT published by the Department of Health. Our present plans for further research on DVT incorporate an assessment of whether there are elements specific to the aircraft environment that can also increase the risk of DVT, including seat spacing on long-haul flights.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">(c) Validation of the findings from the ICE Ergonomics research is a matter for the Joint Aviation Authorities to take forward. Any passenger trials would almost certainly involve a cross-section of the public, including age and general fitness. While the effects of sitting for several hours could be embodied within such testing, it would not be possible to do so under conditions that truly simulated the atmospheric and environmental conditions that exist in the flying environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">(d) There are a number of factors that affect the amount of space and the degree of comfort afforded by any given seat on an aircraft, including the position of the seat in front, the design and construction of the seat itself and the build of the occupant. In addition, different seats on the same aircraft can have different seat pitch or seat width. It is difficult to include all the relevant variables within a single set of measurements without compromising the clarity of the information. The work the department is currently undertaking on a definition of seat size, and on which it is consulting interested parties, aims to provide passengers with a consistent and straightforward basis on which to make comparisons when terms such as &quot;seat pitch&quot; and &quot;seat width&quot; are used.Rebo</p>

	<p pid="a.90.5/1">We continue to work closely with France to address the problem of cross-Channel illegal migration and achieve a situation in which the Red Cross Centre at Sangatte can be closed. A package of measures was announced following a meeting between my right honourable friend the Home Secretary (David Blunkett) and Daniel Vaillant in September. Since then bilateral discussion and a special Cross-Channel Commission subgroup has been set up to look specifically at the issue of Sangatte and how to deal with its residents. The group has met twice, in Paris on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase> and in London on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-18">18 March</phrase>.

Since <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-04">4 February</phrase>, these controls have applied to all passengers intending to board UK-bound services, including those travelling between Paris and Calais with domestic-only tickets.

	<p pid="a.90.5/4">The provision of a legislative base for funding a resettlement programme, which would operate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is included in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill. It will not be possible to begin any programme until that provision has cleared Parliament and received Royal Assent. My officials are at present, therefore, developing a best practice model in consultation with other government departments, and expert groups that could be the basis for a programme, should sufficient funding be available.

	<p pid="a.92.3/1">I am today able to announce the outcome of the second stage of the quinquennial review of the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC).</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/2">The first stage of the review recommended that the second stage of the review should focus on the issues associated with the implementation of a strategic ownership model, to encourage collective ownership by the user research councils of CCLRC's large facilities, addressing in particular the implications for the status of CCLRC and its accountability to Ministers and Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/3">The second stage of the review has been led by the chief executive of the CCLRC, Professor John Wood, and conducted under the guidance an external review-board chaired by Sir Peter Williams, and the Office of Science and Technology. The review has been conducted in accordance with the latest Cabinet Office guidance and Cabinet Office and Treasury officials have had an opportunity to comment on the draft report and its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/4">The principal recommendation is that for its core business the CCLRC should remain a non-departmental public body (NDPB) and a research council. In addition, CCLRC should be given a strategic role, as identified in stage one, to act as a national focus for large facilities for neutron scattering, synchrotron radiation and high power lasers on behalf of the research councils UK. Further, it should also co-ordinate the development for Research Councils UK of policies and strategies for the provision of access by UK scientists to leading-edge, large-scale facilities in these scientific areas, both nationally and internationally. The co-ordination and provision of strategic advice would be carried out separately from the day-to-day operation of CCLRC-owned facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/5">There should be a common scheme for access to the large facilities for researchers sponsored by all the research councils. For those proposals that successfully undergo competitive peer review, there will be a &quot;free at the point of access&quot; arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/6">CCLRC's funding arrangements should alter so that CCLRC receives direct funding from the Office of Science and Technology for providing, operating, maintaining, developing and upgrading its large facilities and their instrumentation. This would be on the basis that a rolling medium-term plan for the operational requirements of the large facilities be prepared by CCLRC and endorsed by Research Councils UK. This arrangement would ensure that the chief executive of CCLRC as accounting officer is clearly and visibly accountable for the value for money of all aspects of the delivery of science from these large facilities. In addition, there will be an external review of CCLRC's cost base and financial processes in advance of the changes to the funding arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/7">I warmly welcome these recommendations and offer my thanks to Professor Wood and the review board.</p>

In assessing whether proposals would raise standards, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State would consider their impact on standards of achievement in the basics and on the breadth of provision available. The Government have made clear their view that they would not in general regard a proposal to suspend the requirement to teach a compulsory subject as standards-raising unless appropriate arrangements are in place to secure high standards in the basics and a broad and balanced curriculum. It follows that only in such circumstances would my right honourable friend the Secretary of State have the power to grant the order, but that if these conditions were met, the legislation would allow an order to be granted.</p>
