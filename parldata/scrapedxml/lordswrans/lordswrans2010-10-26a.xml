	<p pid="a.247.2/1">The supervision of individual institutions and system-wide regulatory requirements are determined by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), an independent body. Following the onset of the financial crisis the FSA implemented the so-called '4-6-8' capital regime. This requires UK banks to hold at least 4 per cent of core tier 1 capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.2/2">At an international level, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, recently delivered a historic and crucial set of reforms that will substantially increase financial stability. Following the G20 agreement in Toronto, regulation will be strengthened only once the recovery is assured. To this end an extended implementation period to 2019 will ensure the transition to new standards, including higher capital and liquidity requirements, will not jeopardise the economic recovery. These reforms will be implemented within the EU by amending the capital requirements directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.2/3">As part of the transition period we negotiated in the Basel package, we do not expect the FSA to lower bank capital requirements. UK banks have already made particularly good progress, having raised their average core tier 1 ratios to the highest level in more than a decade. Analysis by the tripartite authorities suggests the transition to higher regulatory standards will be manageable for UK banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.2/4">In order to ensure the flow of credit to businesses, the Chancellor announced a number of proposals at the Budget in June 2010. These include increasing the Enterprise Finance Guarantee by &#163;200 million to enable additional lending of up to &#163;700 million for small businesses until <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> and the launch of a new Enterprise Capital Fund, to provide an extra &#163;37.5 million in equity finance for small businesses with high growth potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.2/5">The Government have also published a Green Paper on business finance in July, to help inform and take forward their agenda on credit and other sources of finance for businesses. This paper discussed the current conditions of bank lending to small and medium sized businesses. Further information about the Green Paper is available here: <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/businessfinance">http://www.bis.gov.uk/businessfinance</a>. The consultation period for the Green Paper closed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-20">20 September</phrase> and the Government will comment on responses in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.2/6">In response to the Government's Green Paper on business finance, the British Bankers' Association has recently published the outcomes of its business finance taskforce, which was written in conjunction with the six major UK banks. The taskforce banks have committed to improving customer relationships through a new lending code, ensuring better access to finance and promoting better understanding.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.2/1">The Government do not keep statistics on prosecutions for breaches of election law in England and Wales. The figures cited below are extracted from reports prepared by the Electoral Commission rather than from central government records. Accordingly, those reports do not necessarily constitute a complete record of the number of prosecutions during the period referred to.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/2">With regard to the General Election of 2005, the Electoral Commission's report <I>Allegations of electoral malpractice in England and Wales 2000-2006</I> gives details of allegations of electoral malpractice in relation to offences under the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 1983 during that period. The report found that in 2005, there were 59 allegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/3">The Electoral Commission's report <I>Further analysis of CPS files on allegations of electoral malpractice in England and Wales 2000-2006</I> gives details of prosecutions for electoral malpractice under the RPA 1983 during that period. The report found that there was one conviction in 2005, though noted that convictions do not necessarily occur in the same year that proceedings are initiated. Though statistics are not recorded on prosecutions brought under common law fraud offences in England and Wales, I am aware that subsequently five people were convicted under the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud at the 2005 General Election in the Bradford West constituency and all received a custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/4">With regard to the Scottish Parliament election of 2007 and the Scottish local government elections of 2007, I understand that there have been no prosecutions for fraud under the RPA 1983. When bringing common law fraud charges, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in Scotland cannot differentiate between different types of fraud. Therefore no information is available in relation to any electoral fraud that might have been prosecuted under common law.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/5">With regard to the Welsh Assembly election of 2007, and local government elections in England in 2007, the Electoral Commission's report <I>Electoral malpractice in England and Wales</I><I>-</I><I>2007 trends</I> found that at the 2007 elections 129 allegations of electoral malpractice were recorded in England and Wales. I am aware that subsequently six people were convicted of committing a number of electoral offences at the May 2007 local government elections in Slough and all received a custodial sentence. Charges that were brought against some of these six individuals also included the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/6">At elections in 2008, 2009 and 2010 there was systematic monitoring by the Electoral Commission and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) of allegations of electoral malpractice reported to the police during the election period.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/7">With regard to local government elections in England and Wales in 2008, the Electoral Commission and ACPO report <I>Allegations of electoral malpractice at the May 2008 elections in England and Wales</I> found that one case led to prosecution, which resulted in the conviction of one person on a charge of making a false application to vote by proxy and a fine of &#163;1,015.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/8">With regard to the European elections of 2009 and local government elections in England in 2009, the Electoral Commission and ACPO report <I>Analysis of allegations of electoral malpractice at the June 2009 elections</I> found that two people pleaded guilty to three charges of false registration and other non-electoral fraud charges in Bournemouth, and each received a sentence of one month's imprisonment for the registration offences. The commission found that, in mid-December 2009, one person pleaded guilty to two charges of personation at the European parliamentary and local government elections in Cannock, and was sentenced to four months in prison. The commission's report also provided updated information about the outcome of allegations of fraud at the May 2008 elections. The report found that a further two cases relating to the May 2008 elections had led to charges or prosecutions meaning that three cases in total relating to the May 2008 elections had led to charges or prosecutions. The first additional case resulted in two people pleading guilty to personation at a polling station, and were both given the maximum community service order penalty of 300 hours. In the second additional case, charges were brought against one person for two false applications to vote by proxy. This person has now been found guilty and was sentenced in August 2010 to six months in prison, suspended for 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/9">With regard to local government elections in England in 2010, the Electoral Commission has indicated that it will publish verified data and analysis on the extent and nature of cases of electoral malpractice reported during 2010, including the May 2010 UK General Election and local government elections, in January 2011. This will include an update on any unresolved cases that were previously reported and unresolved.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.5/2">The NDA also has existing commercial contracts with both overseas and UK reactor operators to reprocess other spent fuel through THORP. The NDA will continue to manage these contracts taking into account the most appropriate use of the existing plant and their resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.2/1">UN agencies and non-governmental organisations have published a number of reports on the health of children in Gaza since Operation Cast Lead. These show that many children still suffer traumatic stress and that their health is compromised by declining public health service provision, unclean water and a lack of necessary micro-nutrients in food. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides education for 222,000 children in Gaza, reports that schools are overcrowded and children must attend in shifts.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.2/2">Following Operation Cast Lead the UK Government spent &#163;24.8 million on humanitarian assistance. This included the clearance of unexploded ordnance to allow children to return to school, counselling for traumatised children, the building of safe play areas, and improvement to services for pregnant women, new mothers and babies. UK funding also provided food aid and clean water for families in most need. We also provided &#163;5 million to UNRWA specifically to improve education services in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.2/3">The UK and European Union (EU) are major donors to UNRWA. Our ongoing support to UNRWA's core budget helps provide food aid, social services, healthcare and education to refugees in Gaza and across the region. So far this year the UK Government have provided &#163;19 million support. This has helped provide food aid to nearly 1 million Gazans; schooling for almost 480,000 children across the region, and primary healthcare to refugees across the region through 138 clinics with 9.5 million annual patient visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.2/4">The UK and the EU continue to press Israel to allow reconstruction in Gaza and further to relax restrictions on movement and access into and out of Gaza. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-16">16 September</phrase> the European Council called for full implementation of the measures to improve access announced by Israel in June and complementary measures, in order to achieve a fundamental change of policy that will allow for reconstruction and the economic recovery of Gaza.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.0/1">Primodos first became available in the United Kingdom in 1959 and was discontinued in 1978. Primodos was used as a hormonal pregnancy test and for the treatment of various gynaecological complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/2">The licensed dose of Primodos as a pregnancy test was one tablet on each of two consecutive days. Each Primodos tablet contained two sex hormones, a progestogen (norethisterone acetate, 10 milligrams) and an oestrogen (ethinylestradiol, 0.02 milligrams).</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/3">No licensed medicines currently available in the UK contain norethisterone acetate and ethinylestradiol at the same doses as Primodos.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/4">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has no information on the number of children who were born with disabilities to mothers who took Primodos during pregnancy. A total of three reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in association with Primodos (spina bifida, cleft palate, congenital abnormality and pre-eclampsia) via the UK's Yellow Card Scheme are on the MHRA database. None of these cases reported the dose that was administered to the patient. As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-13">13 October 2010</phrase> the MHRA had received a total of 32 UK spontaneous &quot;suspected&quot; ADR reports associated with the combination of the drug ingredients norethisterone and ethinylestradiol (other than Primodos) which describe a congenital abnormality. These reports were received over a period of 45 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/5">The former Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised on the safety of a number of hormonal preparations, including Primodos in 1975 and 1977. The CSM letters and the minutes from the CSM meeting have been placed in the Library. The advice of the CSM was that these hormonal preparations should not be indicated for, or promoted as, a pregnancy test; that a warning about a possible hazard in pregnancy should be inserted in all promotional literature; and that pregnant women should not use these products.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/6">In the absence of any significant new scientific evidence that has become available since Primodos was discontinued, a meeting such as that suggested would be unlikely to benefit any of those concerned. Local clinicians and multidisciplinary teams assess the health and care needs of people who consider that they have been adversely affected by Primodos or other hormonal pregnancy tests. The MHRA therefore has no current plans to meet members of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests, people suspected to have been adversely affected by the drug Primodos, or with the pharmaceutical company, Bayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/7">A large number of medicines currently available in the UK contain norethisterone and ethinylestradiol. These are licensed for hormone replacement therapy, contraception, various gynaecological conditions and in the treatment of some cancers. When used for oral contraception the doses of norethisterone and ethinylestradiol are lower than Primodos. Norethisterone is also currently available as progestogen-only contraception. In common with all licensed medicines, warnings relating to potential side effects of medicines that contain norethisterone and ethinylestradiol are provided in the patient information leaflet that accompanies each medicine, including information about use in pregnancy. All medicines on the UK market are continuously monitored to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/8">Primolut N is one of the norethisterone-containing medicines currently available in the UK. Primolut N tablets are licensed for use in a range of gynaecological conditions and contain five milligrams of norethisterone, a progestogenic sex hormone. Advice and warnings relating to potential side effects of Primolut N are provided in the summary of product characteristics for health care professionals, and the patient information leaflet that accompanies each packet of medicine. As with all medicines used in the UK, the MHRA, together with advice from an independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines keeps the safety of Primolut N under continuous review. The MHRA is not aware of any current safety issues with Primolut N.</p>

Guidance on the disposal of NHS owned land and buildings is contained in <I>Health Building Note 00-08: Estatecode</I>, which has already been placed in the Library. In the majority of cases, where an NHS asset is surplus to requirements, it is sold at the best price reasonably obtainable in the market.
