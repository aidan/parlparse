Around 400 of these are adjacent to Parliament Buildings and are for the use of Assembly members, staff and visitors. The remaining 2,100 are used by civil servants working on the estate, together with visitors and contractors. This total includes spaces designated for use by people with disabilities and for visitors. No extra spaces have been created since 1995 apart from 25 temporary spaces provided recently. Work commenced late September 2003 to upgrade a redundant builder's compound to provide an additional 70 parking spaces. Any further development for parking will be dependent upon the implementation plan stemming from the NI Civil Service accommodation review.</p>

An initial contract was placed with KBR, part of the US Halliburton, without competitive tendering. This was based on the fact that KBR had an existing contract with the USACE, won previously under open, competitive tender. We understand that this contract was extended to cover oil facility repair work which had to be completed in the short term and that a competition would be held as soon as possible to replace this. An open, competitive invitation to tender for two contracts&mdash;one covering repairs in northern Iraq and another for the south&mdash;was issued by the USACE in July this year.
