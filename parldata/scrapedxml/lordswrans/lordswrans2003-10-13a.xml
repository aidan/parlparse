	<p pid="a.90.3/1">District councils in Northern Ireland are responsible for taking enforcement action against those who allow their dogs to foul in public places under the provisions of the Litter (Northern Ireland) Order 1994. Such action can involve issuing fixed penalty notices or taking summary proceedings against offenders in the courts. I understand that issuing fixed penalties is more likely to be the form of action taken by councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.3/2">The department does not routinely collect or hold information about the number of prosecutions taken by district councils.

The Government are determined that the aviation industry will play its part in reducing emissions at source, particularly NOx as NO2 is the pollutant under greatest pressure. The Government push hard within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) for tighter NOx emissions standards and a decision on a new global NOx standard is expected in 2004. The Government are supporting UK industry work towards achieving European emissions technology goals that include, by 2020, an 80 per cent reduction in NOx emissions compared with technology levels in current service. A key vehicle for promoting industry action is the DTI aerospace innovation and growth team report launched in June this year.
