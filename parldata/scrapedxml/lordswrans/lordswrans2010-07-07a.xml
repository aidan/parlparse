	<p pid="a.48.8/2">The fund's budget for 2010-11 has been increased by 3 per cent on 2009-10 but, in part because of an increase in care costs, in order to remain in budget the trustees are unable to accept new applications for the remainder of 2010-11. As a result of this decision the Independent Living Fund will be able to continue to support its 21,000 existing users and to help some 600 new users to whom offers of funding have already been made this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">Neither Germany nor the UK has designated reserve gas storage capacity. The amount of commercial gas storage capacity in the two countries, expressed as the ratio of this capacity to average daily gas consumption, is equivalent to around 77 days in Germany and 16 days in the UK (based on 2008 data for gas consumption). This reflects a number of structural differences between the two markets, including: the amount of indigenous production (which in the UK is now declining); the amount and diversity of gas import capacity; and the availability of market-driven arrangements for demand-side response.</p>

All newly elected UK MEPs in the June 2009 elections were automatically enrolled onto the new MEPs pay statute. The monthly pre-tax salary of MEPs under the new pay statute is &#8364;7807.12.

MEPs can also be refunded up to &#8364;4148 per year for other travel outside their own member state undertaken as part of their work, and be reimbursed for up to 24 return journeys within their own member state.</p>

The council did not need to be given power to reject recommendations made by the Constitutional Commissioners, since it was not bound by them.

	<p pid="a.59.5/1">My department is currently assessing the effects of the services directive on the street trader licensing and pedlar certification schemes, in view of the fact that it is now our view that pedlars selling goods fall within the scope of the directive (as well as the provision of services more generally). The certification of pedlars under the Pedlars Act 1871 is an authorisation scheme within the terms of the services directive and we must be satisfied that any such schemes fall within the permissible limits set by the directive. The Provision of Services Regulations 2009 amended the definition of a pedlar in the Pedlars Act 1871 so as to remove references to service provision. Menders of chairs who provide their services as pedlars are therefore no longer subject to the Pedlars Act. Pedlars who retail goods remain subject to the Act and it is this coverage which is currently under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.0/1">UK Trade &amp; Investment is targeting 17 key high growth markets, including China and India, based on their potential for growth and other criteria such as their market match and scope for UKTI help. Of the 23,600 UK businesses that UKTI helped in 2009-10, nearly 40 per cent were seeking help in regards to these high growth markets. We are responding to this demand for help to secure new business by: ensuring there are targeted services and advice available for businesses considering these markets; raising greater awareness among UK business of these markets drawing on our expertise here and in our overseas network; communicating to business the specific opportunities in them; and campaigning for better access for UK companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/2">In addition to this, senior Ministers are actively engaging with overseas Governments in these markets. For instance, in support of British business in India, both the Secretary of State for Business and the Foreign Secretary have already met the Indian Commerce Minister to discuss further activity to ensure that the UK-India business relationship strengthens further. In regards to China, the Chancellor of the Exchequer visited in June. The Foreign Secretary hopes to visit in the very near future and the Prime Minister will visit in November. Discussion is also ongoing with the Chinese Government to identify dates in the autumn for the annual economic and financial dialogue and joint economic and trade commission. All of these will offer opportunities for active engagement by British business.</p>
