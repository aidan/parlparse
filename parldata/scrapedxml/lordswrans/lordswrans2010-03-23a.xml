</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-23a.273.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="273"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100323w0001.htm#10032379000039">
	<p pid="a.273.8/1">Part of the reduction in the-spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in new parishes is due to pre-movement testing, which is performed on animals moving out of herds in parishes tested yearly or two-yearly. This form of testing was first introduced in the spring of 2006 and intensified in 2007, and is intended in the main to protect herds in low-incidence areas that might receive animals from high-risk areas. Herds in low-risk areas are precisely the herds that are monitored under the bovine TB indicator as part of Public Service Agreement 9 (PSA 9) and that tend to be skin-tested once in four years. The indicator commenced in 2003 and targets a reduction in the spread of bTB to new parishes to below the incremental trend of 17.5 confirmed new incidents per annum by the end of 2008. Since it would take up to four years for any reduction in bTB infection resulting from pre-movement testing to show its full effect on skin testing results, we would expect any effect on the PSA 9 indicator to continue into 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.8/2">Although the apparent year-on-year reduction in bTB incidence in new parishes (despite the increase in numbers of herds and animals tested for bTB in 2009) is welcome, the Government remain cautious and do not want to read too much into the short-term disease trends, given the cyclical and multifactorial nature of bTB incidence in the endemic areas. The incidence of bTB in parts of England is still far too high for EU standards and we continue to take the fight against the disease very seriously, not least because of the serious impact it has on farmers.</p>

We are supporting government institutions to develop a more efficient and transparent public financial management system, and are working to improve the quality of government audit and budgeting processes.</p>

We are strong supporters of DRC efforts to fully implement the extractive industry transparency initiative (EITI). Together with the World Bank and the DRC Ministry of Mines we are currently developing a multi-year mining sector reform programme which aims to transform the way the sector is managed and ensure that the Government extends their control over all mining activities in DRC.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.5/1">I understand the Question to be about the Government's plans, if any, to alter the Information Commissioner's powers to require newspapers to provide him with details of legal advice they have received about their potential use of confidential information.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.5/2">There are no such plans at present. The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides the Information Commissioner with the power to serve information notices, which require data controllers to provide such information as is necessary to determine compliance with the data protection principles. Where an information notice is served on a data controller who processes personal data for the special purposes of journalism, art or literature, the Information Commissioner must first consider whether the data in question might be processed for one or more of those special purposes, and hence whether a special information notice might be more appropriate. Information supplied under a special information notice should allow the Information Commissioner to determine whether information is indeed being processed for special purposes or not. Information processed for special purposes is exempt from certain requirements under the DPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.5/3">Additionally, the DPA provides for the Information Commissioner to carry out a good practice assessment of any processing of personal data, with the data controller's consent, to assess compliance with the data protection principles. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 introduced a new power for the Information Commissioner to serve an assessment notice on government departments which would allow him to enter their premises to assess compliance with the data protection principles without requiring their consent. The Act allows the Secretary of State to extend the assessment notice power to include additional categories of data controllers following a recommendation by the Information Commissioner, consultation with the Commissioner and with the, relevant category of data controllers. Such a recommendation could include newspapers, however, an assessment notice would not permit the Information Commissioner to assess the processing of personal data for one or more of the special purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.0/1">My department has not undertaken any specific studies on the costs of constructing light rail systems in Great Britain compared with the rest of Europe. However, the National Audit Office in its report titled <I>Improving </I><I>P</I><I>ublic </I><I>T</I><I>ransport in England through Light Rail</I> published in April 2004 did consider European systems against those in operation in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/2">There are crucial differences in urban geography which make light rail ideally suited to some French and German cities. Trams are most cost-effective in corridors of very heavy passenger demand. These can support frequent services and closely spaced stops, and generate high patronage per route kilometre. Broad avenues leading to French/German city centres make it relatively easy to accommodate street-running trams without conflict with motor traffic whilst narrower city centre streets have often been pedestrianised. Both these sorts of conditions are relatively rare in English cities. In addition population density in catchment areas of our existing tram systems tends to be much lower than in continental cities, with less frequent services and stops.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/3">Any proposed light rail transit system that is seeking funding from the Department for Transport is assessed using the new approach to appraisal (NATA) process. The NATA process ensures that all impacts are considered when taking a decision about whether to fund a particular system. This includes an assessment of the impact on all transport users including light rail passengers. The NATA process uses the same approach to assessing benefits across all modes of transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/4">With regards to utility services, utility companies, along with a number of other organisations, have a statutory right to place apparatus in the highway to enable them to fulfil a statutory duty, for instance the supply of energy or water. If a highway, bridge or transport authority is intending to carry out works in the highway that will affect apparatus, then it is only fair that the cost of moving that apparatus should be met by the organisation that requires the apparatus to be moved.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/5">Promoters of light rail systems will factor in any costs associated with utility diversions into the total estimated scheme costs.</p>
