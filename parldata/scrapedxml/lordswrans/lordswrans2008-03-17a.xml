The Government are committed to working with the insurance industry to maximise the availability of flood insurance for homes and small businesses, and maintains regular contact with the Association of British Insurers to discuss insurance cover for existing properties, and other issues of mutual interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/2">The Government's planning policies on development and flood risk are set out in planning policy statement 25 (PPS25), &quot;Development and Flood Risk&quot;. Our policy approach, which we strengthened in December 2006, is to avoid inappropriate development in flood risk areas, and to direct development away from high risk areas by ensuring that sites at little or no risk of flooding are developed in preference to areas at higher risk. To support the policies in PPS25, we have made the Environment Agency a statutory consultee on applications for development in flood risk areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/3">Local authorities are required to decide planning applications for new housing in flood risk areas in accordance with the development plan. They must also take into account all material considerations, including government policy in PPS25, and any views expressed by the Environment Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.6/2">Volunteer samples may be taken only with the person's written consent to giving a DNA sample in order to assist the police investigation. The resulting DNA profile is then compared in the forensic laboratory with the DNA material recovered from the crime scene. Volunteer subject sample profiles are added to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) only where the individual has also given separate written consent for their profile to be loaded and retained on the NDNAD for searching against other unsolved crime scene profiles.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.6/3">There are no plans to issue any general invitation to the public to provide DNA samples voluntarily. Inviting members of the public to give DNA where there is no reason to do so in connection with a particular investigation is not likely to be a cost-effective use of police and NDNAD resources. If a member of the public offers to provide the police with a DNA sample voluntarily without any connection to a particular investigation, it would be a matter for the chief officer of the police force concerned to consider whether to accept this offer in the light of the particular circumstances of the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.2/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase>, the National DNA Database (NDNAD) held 44 profiles from individuals under the age of 10, from all United Kingdom police forces (including England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands). In England and Wales, a child under the age of 10 is below the age of criminal responsibility and therefore a DNA sample can be taken only with the consent of a parent or guardian. If police think a child under 10 might have committed a crime they might decide to take a DNA sample to establish whether they have done it or to eliminate them from investigations. A child under 10 might also have DNA taken to eliminate their profile because they were a victim or present at the crime scene.</p>
