	<p pid="a.24.1/2" qnum="HL4933">What studies they are undertaking into the issues surrounding the decline in prices for Africa's key commodities; what necessary remedial action has so far been identified; and what consequential policy is being implemented.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-28a.24.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="24"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031028/text/31028w01.htm#31028w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.24.2/1">Currently, about half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa rely upon &quot;traditional&quot; agricultural commodities (in particular cocoa, coffee, tea and cotton) for over 50 per cent of their exports. These commodities also underpin the livelihoods of millions of some of the poorest people in the region, even in countries where agriculture's relative importance, as measured by macro-economic indicators, is less significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/2">The long-term decline in commodity prices, and the associated negative shift in the producers' terms of trade, has been well documented since at least the 1950s. The current fall in prices is, however, particularly severe. By 2002, the IMF estimated that world cotton prices had fallen to a 17-year low and coffee prices has reached a 30-year low. This trend is the consequence of several factors including:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/3" class="indent">(a) Increased supply from the expansion of production in developing countries&mdash;including, but not exclusively, relatively new exporting countries such as Vietnam in the case of coffee;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/4" class="indent">(b) The relatively slower rate of growth of demand for commodities in their developed country markets; and</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/5" class="indent">(c) The impact on certain, but not all, commodities of trade distorting policies of many developed countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/6">Given the general level of understanding of the problem, we are not and do not intend to carry out further studies to review the causes of declining commodity price other than to analyse in greater detail the impact of developed country policies and the realistic implications for developed countries of their removal. This is in order to inform the development of the UK's position in continuing trade and CAP reform negotiations and to help steer our own development assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/7">Declining commodity prices have serious consequences for developing countries and poor people. But this impact primarily stems from their dependence upon a narrow range of commodities rather than the movement in price itself. The key to tackling this problem therefore lies in economic diversification. Diversification is however a long-term objective. In the interim, the UK Government, through their bilateral and multilateral development programme, are supporting a range of innovative approaches to assist commodity-dependent exporting countries (and poor people in those countries) reduce their vulnerability to volatile commodity prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/8">The UK's policy on commodities will be set out in the forthcoming UK Government and industry report Assisting Commodity Producers. This report will consider how UK industry and government can work together to address the negative impact of commodity dependence. Furthermore, the Government are working to secure a more development-friendly reform of international agriculture trade rules and to reduce the impact of trade distorting policies; for example, reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">Skill Force is a nationwide Ministry of Defence-originated and Department for Education and Skills-supported youth initiative to re-engage disaffected 14 to 16 year-olds with mainstream education. There are currently 23 teams operating in around 100 schools with 3,000 participants. Pupils drop two GCSE options in favour of a more vocationally based education. Skill Force mainly uses former military instructors who have recently left the armed services to deliver a wide range of key skill-based subjects to young people who are in danger of becoming disaffected with the formal academic education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">Evaluation of the first 12 schemes showed that Skill Force had been very successful in reducing truancy and exclusions by around 80 per cent, and had had a positive impact upon behaviour. As a consequence, DfES has helped to fund a further 11 schemes which have been operating for a year as part of the Behaviour Improvement Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">The Institute of Education, London University has recently conducted an independent and comprehensive evaluation of Skill Force. The report concluded that:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Overall, Skill Force is an extremely well managed programme which provides a unique service to schools. It has been successful in meeting the needs of any disaffected students, improving their motivation, confidence, communication and social skills. It has reduced exclusions, improved behaviour, attendance, attitudes towards education and attainment and also provided students with a range of practical, vocational qualifications. It offers excellent value for money. The comments from students and parents provided in this report are a testament to the opportunities it offers. Perhaps more importantly it has the support of school management. The ethos of Skill Force is positive, 'can do' and focused on problem solving. The challenges outlined above will be tackled with enthusiasm and solutions found.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/5">We are today placing a copy of this report in the Library of the House. We are currently assessing, with the Connexions service, the impact that Skill Force has had upon participants entering employment, training and education on leaving secondary school in July 2003 at the end of the initial two-year course. The Ministry of Defence and the Department for Education and Skills will continue to work together on the longer-term future of Skill Force. Huw</p>

	<p pid="a.27.2/1">HQ 3 (UK) Division continues to command the Multinational Division (South-East) (MND(SE)) in Iraq, with contributions from the Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and Romania.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/2">We have begun a process of roulement of United Kingdom forces, which involves the incremental replacement of HQ 3 (UK) Division with a composite HQ MND(SE), the replacement of 19 Mechanised Brigade with 20 Armoured Brigade, the replacement of HQ 101 Logistic Brigade with a composite HQ UK national support element (NSE), the roulement of the combat service support units that will make up the UK NSE, and the mobilisation of around 1,000 Reservists. We expect the maritime and air elements of our presence in theatre to remain broadly stable.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/3">A number of adjustments to our force levels in Iraq were made over the summer. Some of these were relatively minor, such as the withdrawal of around 30 armoured engineers and the short-term deployment of around 30 personnel from 23 Pioneer Regiment Royal Logistic Corps to undertake building and construction tasks around Shabah logistics base.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/4">On a larger scale, we also deployed the 2nd Battalion The Light Infantry (2LI) and the 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets (1RGJ), to conduct a number of additional security and training tasks and provide MND(SE) with the flexibility and capacity to carry out surge operations designed to counter crime and enhance security. A recent major operation in MND(SE), Operation Sweeney, has resulted in 291 arrests, the seizure of six weapons caches, and the interception of 57 vessels and 58 vehicles involved in criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/5">Some of the additional requirements for which 2LI and IRGJ deployed are now being reduced or progressively transferred to Iraqi security forces. But some other requirements will continue over the next few months, including the provision of training for the new Iraqi civil defence corps. In overall terms, we assess that these continuing requirements can be met by approximately one battalion rather than two. When 2LI and 1RGJ are withdrawn from theatre in November and December they will therefore be replaced by the 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment (2 Para). We envisage that 2 Para will deploy from early November.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/6">In addition to adjustments to force levels, we have also deployed further equipment to theatre, including over 200 armoured Land Rovers, three Puma helicopters and three Gazelle helicopters. Taken together, these enhancements provide MND(SE) with greater mobility, force protection and surveillance capabilities, increasing the flexibility and effectiveness of the force.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/7">We will continue to keep the size and mix of forces in theatre under close review, and we expect to make further adjustments as a matter of routine to ensure that MND(SE) has appropriate capabilities for the tasks in hand. This is likely to include temporary increases in force levels when appropriate, to provide the general officer commanding MND(SE) with additional tactical flexibility and help ensure that progress and momentum are maintained and where possible accelerated. To facilitate this process we intend as a matter of course to nominate two battalions as over-the-horizon operational reserves for Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">The Government are looking at many ways, including all-postal ballots and e-voting, to modernise our electoral system and to increase the opportunities that people have to vote. To test the robustness of the new options and to build public confidence in them, we have undertaken an extensive programme of pilot innovations at local elections. This is why we are promoting legislation to permit further pilots to be held in a number of regions at the European Parliament and combined local elections in June 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/2">Our focus over the forthcoming months will be on working to ensure that pilots held at the combined elections are successful in delivering elections that are more straightforward and accessible for all electors.

	<p pid="a.34.3/1">There is a very close day-to-day working relationship between UK Sport and the UK Sports Institute network. UK Sport takes a strategic lead role hosting regular meetings with the home country institute directors, the British Olympic Association and the British Paralympic Association to discuss work programmes, service delivery and system development. In addition the chairs of each of the four institutes join these meetings at least twice a year to form the leadership group taking a strategic perspective.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/1">The monitoring of compliance with the terms of subsidised bus contracts is the responsibility of the local transport authority which issues the contract. In addition, the Traffic Commissioner is responsible for enforcing the bus service registration rules which require the operator of a local bus service&mdash;whether subsidised or commercial&mdash;to run that service in accordance with the timetable details registered with the commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/2">I understand that the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) undertakes regular monitoring of its subsidised bus contracts, and the results show that in 2002&ndash;03 nearly 92 per cent of these ran as required under the terms of the contracts. GMPTE reports that this indicates a higher level of cancellation of subsidised services than is the case in other PTE areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/3">In order to inform the Government's 10-year plan target for bus reliability, national data are collected on the number of scheduled services run. The latest figures show that 98.6 per cent of all local bus services were run as scheduled. These data are not collected separately for subsidised services and are not available on an area basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/4">I also understand that GMPTE already penalises operators for lost mileage on subsidised services, and is currently considering proposals for operators to assist passengers who are affected by the non-operation of subsidised services.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">The Government have no plans currently to impose requirements on operators to compensate passengers for service cancellations.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.3/1">The Government's Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme provides support for training officers and ratings, meeting around 50 per cent of the costs. It provided funding for 557 new officer cadets in the year 2002&ndash;03, an increase of 77 from the previous year. The current budget is &pound;9.4 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/2">Seafarer training is also a key element of the UK tonnage tax, which imposes a minimum training obligation on companies entering the scheme. This is to train one officer trainee per year for every 15 officer posts in the company's effective officer complement. The MTO is cumulative and covers each trainee for up to three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/3">The number of actual trainees under tonnage tax during 2002&ndash;03 was 670, while the cumulative training commitment for 2003&ndash;04, with several returns still outstanding, is already over 1,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.3/4">Although the increase in cadet recruitment is very encouraging, the Government recognise that it is not enough to achieve stability in UK officer numbers. We are therefore examining ways in which the take-up of SMarT can be increased within the current budget.</p>
