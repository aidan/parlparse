It is probable that, in the event of London staging the Games, there would be other costs associated with ensuring the security of the Olympic Games. New threats as well as innovative counter-terrorism measures are likely to exist in 2012 and therefore it is difficult to speculate at this time as to what the cost implications will be.</p>
