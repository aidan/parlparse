</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-12-17a.3.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="3"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo011217/text/11217w01.htm#11217w01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.3.2/1">The Government are committed to putting in place effective measures to combat the trafficking of human beings and to penalise those engaged in this abhorrent practice. To this end, the United Kingdom has signed the Trafficking Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, which requires the specific criminalisation of trafficking in human beings. The Government are also currently negotiating an European Union (EU) Framework Decision, which is a binding European Union instrument and requires criminalisation of trafficking in human beings for the purposes of exploiting their labour and services or for sexual exploitation. Under its provisions, the UK will be required to have implemented the instrument within two years of its adoption.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">Measuring the scope of people trafficking is problematic due to the hidden nature of the act. However, a Home Office research study Stopping Traffic (Police Research Series 125), published last year, indicated that, although there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation, there was no evidence to suggest that the problem in the UK was on the same scale as in some other EU countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/3">The UK is contributing to the EU STOP Programme, which was set up by a joint action of the European Council in 1996. This programme provides support to member state organisations responsible for action against the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children. A European Council decision of <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-28">28 June 2001</phrase> established a second phase of this programme (STOP II).</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/4">As part of a multi-faceted approach, people trafficking is also being addressed from the prevention end. We are developing a cross-departmental strategic approach to trafficking that will include a more joined up government lead programme on prevention and the care of potential and actual people trafficking victims. We know that children are trafficked for a number of reasons, including adoption and child labour as well as sexual exploitation. With this in mind, there are also plans to build on existing trafficking prevention projects to educate potential victims of the dangers, particularly for women and children. The Department for International Development (DfID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) already fund such projects in source countries and assist with repatriation and reintegration of people trafficked in an attempt to prevent multiple victimisation in the future. In collaboration with these countries and international organisations, DfID supports a project by the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) aimed at combating the trafficking of children in certain subregions.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/5">In addition, we set up Project Reflex last year, which is a multi-agency task force chaired by the National Crime Squad, to co-ordinate action against organised immigration crime, including people trafficking, and to develop the intelligence and strategic planning to underpin them. It is now well established and has already resulted in some major successes, involving partners overseas, in disrupting organised criminal groups involved in bringing people to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.2/1">In the past the misuse of rebated fuels (red diesel and marked kerosene for heating) was not considered to be a significant threat to the revenue. Historically, the duty differential between rebated fuels and unrebated fuels was not as large as it is today. As a consequence, it was considered unnecessary to require distributors of rebated fuels to ask for and keep proof that these fuels were to be put to a legitimate use or to make returns to us. Such requirements would have put an undue burden on legitimate traders as well as requiring significant Customs resourcing to process and analyse this information for little gain.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">However, Customs has become concerned over the increasing misuse of these fuels as road fuels and is now proposing to introduce a scheme requiring distributors to be approved by Customs and to exercise a duty of care by asking certain questions to satisfy themselves that end-users are putting the fuel to a legitimate use and keeping a record of this information. In addition, they will be required to submit regular returns to Customs. This additional information will give us a better picture of the problem and allow us to better target our controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/3">This new scheme forms part of the Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud strategy paper, published at PBR, <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-27">27 November</phrase>. The information Customs requires on returns will be of direct interest in assessing risks and targeting controls and must not place a disproportionate burden on legitimate trade. We do not anticipate requiring a breakdown of quantities of rebated fuel bought according to schedule 1 category of vehicle in which it is to be used as this would not be relevant to the scheme's aim. It would also be inaccurate as large consumers, eg local authorities, might have difficulty in providing information as to what quantities will be used in different types of vehicle. Requiring any additional information would also place extra administrative burden on both distributors and Customs. Traders will, however, be required to keep certain information on their customers which will be available to Customs officers on targeted assurance visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/4">We will shortly be consulting with the trade on these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/5">An alternative scheme requiring all end users to register with us and submit returns detailing the quantities used per category is not feasible. Given the large numbers of end users it would mean a huge investment of Customs resource and a significant burden on users, so would be unwieldly and disproportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/6">Customs records of the number of vehicles detected do not disaggregate between the nature of the offences involved in each case. We regret, therefore, that this information is not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has conducted a comprehensive review of aircrew retention this summer. We sought to identify why we have a shortfall in this highly trained group of personnel and how that shortfall might best be addressed. A study team, including representatives from the three Services, HM Treasury and external consultancy, has reviewed aircrew requirements and looked at employment patterns, career structures, training systems and remuneration, as well as the recruitment and financial policies of the commercial sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/2">The working group collated the views of over 1,000 aircrew (probably the largest such survey the Armed Forces has undertaken) as well as those of managers. It examined and identified why people leave service life, as well as the attractions of the commercial sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/3">The main cause of the shortage of aircrew was a failure of the training system to deliver against challenging targets. That has already been addressed but it will take time to deliver. We intend, therefore, further to improve the retention of our current aircrew.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/4">The working group identified a series of issues impacting on retention. Many of the quality of life issues emerging from the review of aircrew retention were already being tackled: for example, the very significant programmes introduced to spend an additional &pound;1 billion over the next 10 years on modernising single living accommodation and to spend &pound;650 million by November 2005 on upgrading married quarters. We recognise that accommodation problems spread beyond housing, and action is needed to address sub-standard working and technical accommodation as well. Senior service officers have also set in hand work to address a number of key concerns raised by aircrew&mdash;for example, on operational tempo, career management, frequency of moves, and more. The impact of resolving these concerns will also be of benefit to personnel beyond the aircrew community. Some of the issues raised by aircrew are misperceptions and to address this better communication is being developed across the services.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/5">There are some remuneration aspects arising from this review and, as is usual, we have made proposals to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). The outcome will be reported to the House in due course&mdash;probably early February.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/6">We are monitoring closely developments in the commercial sector. But, even if the pull to the private sector decreases as a result of a contraction in the civil sector, we still have a responsibility to deal with the natural factors which cause personnel to leave and which are preventing us reaching aircrew manning balance.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">In July we announced a package of measures to streamline the handling in the planning system of major infrastructure projects such as new airports, runways, rail links and roads. The objective was to speed up the decision-making process so as to cut the delay, cost and uncertainty of the present process, while making sure that people continue to be properly involved and have the opportunity to make their views known.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">The package comprised: up-to-date comments of government policy before major infrastructure projects are considered in the planning system to help reduce inquiry time spent on debating the policy; an improved regional framework which will assist consideration of individual projects (eg through the revised arrangements for regional planning guidance); new procedures to give Parliament the opportunity to approve projects in principle before consideration of the details at inquiry; improved inquiry procedures for major infrastructure projects; and improved arrangements for compulsory purchase and compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/3">We are today publishing a consultation paper setting out our detailed proposals for new parliamentary procedures. Copies are being laid before both Houses. The deadline for comment is <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-22">22 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/4">It is right that Parliament should have the opportunity to consider infrastructure projects of major importance to the country and to the economy. Parliament's involvement will add weight and accountability to the process without reducing the opportunities for people to have their say. Parliament's endorsement of the principle of, need for and location of a project will speed up the decision-making process by removing the necessity for the subsequent planning inquiry to look at these issues. We propose to underpin this with new powers for planning inspectors to focus discussion at the inquiry, which will just look at the details of implementing the project on the ground. The final decision on a project will rest with the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/5">Our proposals give people a clear opportunity to make their views known before Parliament debates the issues. They provide a mechanism for people to make objections or other representations about a proposed project. Parliament would have copies of all of them and a summary. In addition, the parliamentary stage would be preceded by development of a statement of government policy, on the content of which there would normally be prior public consultation, and people can express their views at a subsequent inquiry on the detailed aspects of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/6">These opportunities for people to be involved at three key stages of the process would be over and above the consultations between developers and local people on proposed projects before an application for planning consent is submitted. We want local people to be involved as early as possible in shaping proposals affecting them and the areas in which they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/7">Introducing the new procedures would require primary legislation. This will be brought forward when parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.0/1">Currently 96 per cent of all footpaths in England are open to the public. Access restrictions still apply to those footpaths crossing farms that are subject to specific veterinary restrictions (mostly farms where livestock were diagnosed as having foot and mouth disease). The counties worst hit by the disease, including Cumbria, North Yorkshire, Durham and Northumberland, are most affected by this as they have the largest numbers of such farms.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/2">With the improving disease situation, the veterinary risk assessment on the use of public footpaths has been revised, and concludes that it is now safe to re-open footpaths crossing restricted premises, apart from those passing through farmyards or buildings, once final cleansing and disinfection are complete, or, if final cleansing and disinfection are not being undertaken, then three months after completion of preliminary cleansing and disinfection.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/3">The revised veterinary risk assessment was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-07">7 December</phrase>, along with revised government guidance to local authorities on re-opening footpaths that encouraged them to work closely with local divisional veterinary managers to establish exactly which footpaths can be re-opened in the light of this development. Where footpaths pass through farmyards or buildings, local authorities should try to arrange temporary permissive diversions with the farmers concerned, especially where particularly popular local footpaths or national trails are concerned. However, if this does not prove possible, then those footpaths must remain closed until the veterinary restrictions are lifted.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/4">It is likely that almost all footpaths in England will be re-opened in the early part of next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.0/1">Countryside Stewardship payment rates are reviewed regularly. In line with EU rules, the rates reflect any income lost in undertaking stewardship options, plus any additional costs incurred, such as specialised management or extra capital works, and a small incentive element of up to 20 per cent. Agreement holders should therefore be no worse off than their counterparts who are outside the scheme. The continuing demand for the scheme, with nearly 3,000 applications this year, indicates that the current level of payments is generally acceptable.</p>

A recent survey showed a 17.2 per cent fall in occupancy in London hotels but only 1.7 per cent in regional hotels, and an ETC survey found that since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September</phrase> nearly 1 million people in Britain have changed their plans from holidaying abroad to taking a trip at home.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.0/1">Whether or not a provision falls within a particular part or section of an Act in domestic law is not decisive of how it will be regarded for EU law purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/2">The Government's view is that being a Member of Parliament is not an occupation within the scope of the directive: an MP can more properly be characterised as someone holding political office. Occupations are within the scope of the directive only where an employment-type relationship arises. Being a Member of Parliament does not, in the Government's view, give rise to such a relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/3">Apart from the issue of whether being a Member of Parliament is an occupation under the directive, the Government are of the view that the directive does not apply to the electoral process because it is not comparable to selection for employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/4">The Government accept that the equal treatment principle applies to the control of access to employment and occupations covered by the directive. By accepting this, however, the Government do not accept that the selection by a political party of a candidate for election is control of access to employment and occupation. Holding political office would not, in our view, cause an employment-type relationship to arise, whether between the Member and their political party or otherwise. Standing as a candidate for election or standing for selection to be a candidate is not the same as having access to employment or occupation.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/5">It is accepted that the directive covers access to vocational guidance, vocational training, advanced vocational training and retraining. It may also cover access to occupations and vocations, but only so long as the occupation or vocation concerned involves an employment-type relationship. For the reasons advanced above, however, this does not mean, that the directive applies to selection of candidates as MPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/6">As to whether political parties are public authorities for the purposes of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, a body will only be a public authority for the purposes of the Human Rights Act if it has a public function, that is, a function which is governmental or quasi-governmental in nature and which seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the public. The Government's view is that the selection of a candidate to stand for election is internal to the party and its members, and is more a private act that furthers the party's own ends than a public function.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/7">As stated in my Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-28">28 November</phrase> (WA 56), however, it is not for the Government to give assurances as to how the law will be construed. The Government reach their view after due deliberation, but that it is binding in any way ultimately it is for the courts to decide.</p>
