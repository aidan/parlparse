	<p pid="b.93.2/1">We are greatly concerned by Israeli settlement building, particularly around east Jerusalem. We continue to raise the issue of settlement activity with the Israeli Government. Phase one of the quartet road map calls on Israel to freeze all settlement expansion, including &quot;natural growth&quot;, and to dismantle settlement outposts erected since March 2001. We continue to urge Israel to meet its road map commitments. We have stressed repeatedly that the building of settlements on occupied land is contrary to international law. My right honourable friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister of State (Dr Kim Howells) raised with Israeli Housing Minister Herzog our concerns about reports of Israeli intentions to construct additional dwellings in Ma'ale Adumim, during his recent visit to Israel and Palestine.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.6/1">A meeting with the French Education Ministry is expected to take place before the end of this year to build on existing agreements for bilateral education co-operation, including teacher exchanges. We have strong links with Germany through its embassy and our partnership with the British Council, through which we fund a range of teacher exchange and linking activity. The EU education programme Socrates also supports teacher interaction, including visits, between 31 European countries, including the UK, France and Germany. Through these and other programmes and resources that we fund directly, we expect to see continued and expanding opportunities for teacher exchanges and visits between our three countries.</p>
