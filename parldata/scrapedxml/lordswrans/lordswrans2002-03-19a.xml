	<p pid="a.132.2/1">Employers provide occupational pensions, including defined benefit pension schemes, on a voluntary basis and are therefore free to decide whether to continue to provide such pensions to their employees in the future. There is legislation in place to ensure that the pension rights that individuals have already built up in schemes are protected. We have commissioned reviews of the regulatory system and the retail savings market which are due to report this summer. lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.138.8/1">In the course of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment it is likely that more embryos will be created than the maximum of two which are allowed to be transferred to a woman at any one time.

	<p pid="a.138.8/2">Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos may be used in conjuction with IVF. The use of the PGD technique in itself should not involve the destruction of any embryos.

	<p pid="a.139.2/1">The key assumption is that pregnancy-related factors are the main causes of the increasing incidence of breast cancer and these are the only variables considered in the analysis. While reproductive history is important, it is not the only influence; for example, genetic predisposition, the development of the breast screening programme and obesity will also affect incidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/2">The main analysis in the report compared cumulative abortion rates and incidence of breast cancer and found a close correlation. However, correlation does not prove causation and the hypothesis linking abortion and breast cancer is still only a theory. Other factors that have increased over the same time period such as divorce rate could also show a correlation that would turn out to be spurious. Bill</p>
