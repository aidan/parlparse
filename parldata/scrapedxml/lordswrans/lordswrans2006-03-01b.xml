	<p pid="b.53.2/1">Westminster City Council, as a Trailblazer area, works with partners to tackle anti social behaviour in Victoria Street and the environs of Westminster Cathedral. Westminster City Council has undertaken a number of initiatives to tackle anti-social behaviour, including, enhanced cleansing services, working on an exercise with local residents' groups, businesses and the Cathedral authority to &quot;design out crime&quot; and encouraging local businesses not to sell strong alcohol to those of vulnerable disposition. The area also has been designated as a controlled drinking zone which has proven successful in reducing levels of street drinking. A joint taskforce has been set up to tackle issues in relation to problems stemming from large numbers of people arriving in the area from EU accession countries. The Respect Taskforce receives regular updates from Westminster City Council regarding this progress. We would expect Westminster City Council to make public their work to tackle anti-social behaviour and I understand it plans to publish on its website a report of its work as a Trailblazer to tackle begging in the Westminster area for the period 2004&ndash;05 at the end of March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.5/1">Currently, the Civil Aviation Authority considers that the GPS should be used only to supplement conventional navigation techniques for cross-country navigation outside controlled airspace and not replace them.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.5/2">Positional accuracy for the US Global Positioning System (GPS) can vary by 10m or more depending on location and time. In urban areas and mountainous regions signal visibility can be obstructed.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.5/3">Future radio navigation needs will require better integrity and service guarantees; for instance, for safety-critical transport applications. Some augmentation systems are available now. The EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) wide area augmentation system is expected to be certificated for civil aviation use in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.58.8/1">New measures to tackle knife crime are included in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, currently before Parliament. We plan to raise the age for purchasing a knife or other bladed article to 18, give head teachers powers to search pupils for weapons, and introduce a new offence of using another person to hide or carry a gun or knife. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-08">8 February</phrase>, the Home Secretary announced that a nationwide knife amnesty would start on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May</phrase> until the end of June. This will give people the opportunity to hand in unwanted knives and other bladed instruments for safe disposal. We also have an ongoing programme of community engagement to discuss issues around knife crime. In addition, the connected fund is supporting local community groups working to tackle gun crime, knife crime and gangs. Many of the projects supported involve working with at-risk young people to provide training and mentoring, education, diversionary activities and other projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.3/1">The remit of the Post Primary Review Working Group required it to take account of the responses to the consultation on the recommendations of the post-primary review body (the Burns report). The advice from the working group (the Costello report) was accepted by the Government in January 2004. The report was not published for consultation and responses were not therefore sought on its content.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.3/2">Aspects of the working group's recommendations, however, have been or will be the subject of consultation in the course of implementation. Consultation exercise on new admissions arrangements for post-primary schools took place between January and June 2005 and a summary report on responses received was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-06">6 December 2005</phrase>. A proposal for a draft Education (Northern Ireland) Order which will give effect to aspects of the new post-primary arrangements, including provisions to introduce new admissions arrangements and the entitlement framework, is the subject of a current consultation exercise. The closing date for comments is <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>. Consultation on draft regulations setting out the detail of new admissions criteria is planned for 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.0/1">No medicines are licensed for the treatment of depressive illness in under-18s in the United Kingdom. A doctor may prescribe a medicine outside of its licensed indication if they consider it to be in the best interests of their patient. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised in 2003 that the majority of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) should not be used in the treatment of depressive illness in those under 18 years of age. Only fluoxetine (Prozac) has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in treating depressive illness in children and adolescents. Overall the balance of risks and benefits for fluoxetine in the treatment of depressive illness in under-18s is judged to be favourable.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.0/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued a guideline on the treatment of depression in children and young people in September 2005. This guideline took into account CSM advice and recommended that where an anti-depressant was considered appropriate, fluoxetine should be prescribed. NICE recommended that citalopram and sertraline could be considered where fluoxetine has not worked or has not been tolerated.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.0/3">A recently published study (Drug Safety 2005;28(12):1151-1157) which looked specifically at the effect of CSM advice on the prescribing of SSRIs for depression in children and adolescents found that the CSM advice had had a significant effect in reversing the rising trend of anti-depressant prescribing to children and adolescents in primary care.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.0/4">The data which were used in newspaper reports to suggest that over 80,000 prescriptions of SSRIs were to people under 18 in 2005 do not reflect prescribing to children and adolescents under the age of 18 for the treatment of depressive illness. These figures include prescriptions of SSRIs to 18 year-olds, and to those under 18 years for indications other than depressive illness (two SSRIs, sertraline and fluvoxamine are authorised for use in children and adolescents under 18 years with obsessive compulsive disorder).</p>

	<p pid="b.80.2/1">Significant progress has been made with the new single non-emergency number (SNEN)&mdash;a new service to offer the public direct access, via a new three digit number, to community safety advice, information and action, while freeing up the 999 emergency service to handle emergency incidents. The SNEN service will be rolled out across England and Wales in a number of waves. The first wave will see the service launch in five areas in summer 2006 and the service will be operating nationally by 2008. The SNEN service will be provided by local authorities and police forces working in partnership to deliver services and handle calls. Core services for SNEN partnerships are: vandalism, graffiti and other deliberate damage to property, noisy neighbours or loud parties, intimidation and harassment, abandoned vehicles, rubbish or litter lying around (including fly tipping), people being drunk or rowdy in public places, drug related anti-social behaviour, and street lighting. Wave one involves partnerships between police forces and local authorities in areas of Hampshire and Isle of Wight, Northumbria, Leicestershire and Rutland, South Yorkshire and South Wales. SNEN operators will deal with inquiries over the phone by giving advice and information where needed, arranging for action to be taken when appropriate or by directing the caller to a person or organisation who can help them. The service will operate around the clock and will put callers directly in touch with specially trained operators, employed by local authority and police force partnerships, for information and advice. The SNEN will complement, rather than duplicate existing services and aims to improve the delivery of these services by facilitating a better co-ordinated response by local agencies.

	<p pid="b.82.0/1">My Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase> followed consultation between relevant departments (including the Home Office, FCO, and the Department for Transport). It also reflected the fact that procedures at military air stations are consistent with Wider Immigration Service policies, to the extent that details of individuals who stay in the UK are passed to HM Revenue and Customs and the Immigration Service. These details are not necessarily retained by the MoD and where aircraft simply transit through the airfield, to refuel for example, and passengers do not leave the airfield, the name of the pilot and aircraft owner are recorded, but airfields are not required to record passenger details. Therefore we cannot determine how many passengers have passed through military airfields in the past five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/2">The issue of whether or not the Government have the right to passenger information is covered by immigration legislation in the form of paragraphs 27 (2) and 27 (B) of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Immigration Act and the subsequent orders, the Immigration (Particulars of Passengers and Crew) (Amendment) Order 1975 and The Immigration (Passengers Information) Order 2000. Carriers are not obliged to provide this information unless it has been requested by an immigration officer in writing. As these powers are exercised in accordance with risk on an intelligence-led basis, and wherever there is good reason in the context of the immigration control, the Immigration Service has no plans to exercise them in relation to these flights.</p>
