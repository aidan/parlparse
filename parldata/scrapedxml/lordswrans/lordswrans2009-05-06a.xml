However, as set out in the Answer I gave the noble Lord on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March 2009</phrase>, calculations of embodied carbon need to consider a wide range of factors, such as whether materials are recycled, the carbon intensity of the energy used in the manufacturing process, transportation costs, rotor diameter and, most crucially, the height, wind speeds and obstructions near the turbine. For this reason, a range is given in calculations of embodied carbon.</p>

The committee recommends further strengthening of work and activities in the area of child rights. The UK supports these conclusions both in principle and practically through bilateral and EU projects aimed at ensuring the full implementation of UNICEF minimum standards. We follow developments relating to the prosecution of minors closely, including by meeting both the non-governmental organisations working on this issue and some of the minors affected, including during regional visits. We raised this issue with provincial governors in December together with EU colleagues, and raised the issue with central government as part of the EU's regular dialogue with Turkey.</p>
