	<p pid="a.193.1/2" qnum="HL6396">What mechanisms they have put in place to ensure that asylum seekers persuaded to leave the United Kingdom by payments of &pound;3,000 do not subsequently return under other identities to claim a further payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.2/1">In assessing the eligibility of any applicant for the Voluntary Assisted Return and Reintegration Programme (VARRP) all details are checked on Home Office systems and any duplicate claim made is identified and will be refused. To maintain the integrity of the asylum system, any individual who is found not to be in need of international protection and who does not qualify for leave on another basis is required to leave the United Kingdom. If they have been refused assistance under VARRP and subsequently fail to depart voluntarily, they will face enforced removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/2">We are developing procedures to deal with those who might be intending to abuse the system by seeking to return to the United Kingdom under a different identity and then trying to claim asylum again and they include the current capture of visa applicants' fingerprints that covers 11 countries at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/3">The results have shown that the capture of biometrics is helping to counter the return of failed asylum seekers to the UK. The Biometrics Programme in UKvisas, set up in 2005, is however extending the capture of biometrics to all remaining visa-issuing posts from late this summer, with completion aimed around the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/4">As part of the initial asylum process, all asylum applicants are fingerprinted with the exception of those under the age of five.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/5">These prints are stored in the Immigration and Asylum Fingerprint Service (IAFS) database. If a failed asylum seeker applies for a new visa, their fingerprints will be taken, (if they are applying in an overseas post where biometrics are currently captured), and checked by the Immigration Fingerprinting Bureau (IFB) against the IAFS database for possible matches in any identity. If an applicant is shown to have previously claimed asylum in a different identity, the two cases are linked on the Home Office system with alias details being listed on both records.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/6">All asylum claims are determined on their individual merits, including any claims made by those who have previously availed themselves of VARRP.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.5/1">In accordance with Financial Reporting Standards, the properties were transferred to QinetiQ at fair acquisition value. This was derived from a valuation carried out by GVA Grimley LLP, with a valuation date of <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase>. That was then adjusted to take account of certain additional site-specific factors, including details of lease arrangements and work carried out by environmental consultants to assess potential contamination. Valuations were carried out in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) manual of valuation and the practice statements for the valuation of properties in company accounts. The basis of the Grimley valuation was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/2">for properties which, at the time of transfer, were seen as likely to be sold by QinetiQ, the Grimley valuation was on the basis of open market value (OMV);for those properties which were anticipated to remain in use to support the ongoing business activities of the company, the valuation was, in accordance with accounting and Stock Exchange rules, based on the depreciated replacement cost (DRC). For technical reasons relating to specific properties, there were a small number of exceptions to this approach. These were: Alverstoke (transferred at OMV); Portsdown Technology Park (transferred at adjusted OMV to take account of certain environmental and other liabilities); Fort Halstead and Winfrith (where complex leasing arrangements required a separate assessment of fair value).</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/3">Separate clawback arrangements exist to ensure that the taxpayer shares in any excess gains from property disposals. The values used for calculating clawback are based on the unadjusted Grimley valuations and consequently may differ from the valuations used for the transfer of property from DERA to QinetiQ.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.5/1">Yes, we will be reviewing the benefits accruing from the installation of a wood-chip boiler at the Worcester office, as part of our action plan to reduce carbon emissions in line with targets for sustainable operations on the government estate, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/2">We are required to reduce carbon emissions by12.5 per cent by 2010-11 and 30 per cent by 2020 (against the baseline year 1999-2000). There is also a target for the central government office estate to be carbon neutral by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/3">As they use low-carbon technology, wood-chip boilers can make a significant contribution to achieving these targets. We are currently reviewing the efficiency of the Worcester boiler, in particular the flexibility to burn chips of varying moisture content and size, and plan to take forward the lessons learnt from that installation in considering similar projects at other sites on the Defra estate.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">The Government are already working to raise product standards and encourage consumers to use the most efficient products available. This includes light bulbs.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/2">My department and HM Treasury are working with major retailers and the Energy Saving Trust to introduce voluntary schemes to raise the energy efficiency of the goods they sell. Initially it is expected that these schemes will focus on consumer electronics, but they may be expanded to other products.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/3">Defra's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) supports measures such as the mandatory EU energy labelling scheme (the &quot;A to G label&quot;) which, for domestic light bulbs, has been mandatory since <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>. Energy labels provide clear and easily recognisable information about the energy consumption and performance of domestic products on a seven-point scale ranging from &quot;A&quot; (most efficient) to &quot;G&quot; (least efficient), thus enabling consumers to make a considered choice when purchasing energy consuming products.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/4">MTP also works with the Lighting Association, the Lighting Industry Federation, the Energy Saving Trust and the Energy Efficiency Partnership to promote energy-efficient lighting that is both commercially viable and acceptable to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/5">The Energy Saving Trust endorses and vigorously promotes the best lighting products under its energy efficiency recommended scheme, and building regulations require new housing to have a minimum number of energy-efficient fittings.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/6">Under the energy efficiency commitment, electricity and gas suppliers are required to meet targets for the promotion of improvements in domestic energy efficiency. They do this by encouraging and assisting household consumers to take up energy-efficient measures, including compact fluorescent lamps.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/1">Under the terms of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's (RCEP) framework agreement with the department, a government response to their reports should be published within one year of publication. We agreed with the Royal Commission a longer time timetable for the response in this case. The Royal Commission recognised that the delay enabled the response to reflect developments on the Marine Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/2">The key recommendation in the RCEP report was the need for a new framework for marine management. This could only be addressed in the Government response by including developments on the Marine Bill, after the public consultation on the Bill was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase>.</p>

The change to five years brings us in line with other European countries on length of residence criteria. The Government do not feel that there are any benefits to be had by maintaining a different provision in the UK from that which applies elsewhere in the EU. The Government also feel that settlement should be based on a degree of attachment to the United Kingdom similar to that currently required for citizenship, and should form the later part of a journey towards integration. We feel that the increase in the qualifying period supports this. Those who have already qualified for settlement are allowed to keep their settled status subject to continuing to be ordinarily resident here. The change only affects those who have still not qualified. The change is not therefore retrospective.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.5/1">The international ban on trade in ivory remains firmly in place and is fully supported by the UK Government. We remain clearly of the view that the illegal and unsustainable trade in ivory should not be permitted. We will not support any resumption in the commercial trade in ivory until we are satisfied that this will not result in an increase in the illegal killing of elephants, or undermine the conservation of elephant populations elsewhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/2">The UK has been closely concerned in the debate surrounding proposals for one-off sales of stockpiled ivory, through our involvement in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). CITES has placed a number of strict pre-conditions that have to be met before one-off sales of ivory stocks could take place. In addition, the proceeds would have to be used exclusively for elephant and community conservation projects within, or near, the areas where the elephants reside. The UK will not support the proposed one-off sales if we are not entirely satisfied that the strict conditions are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/3">To assist any considerations, my colleague the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Biodiversity (Barry Gardiner) has asked the International Fund for Animal Welfare to prepare estimates of the cost of improving conservation measures to combat elephant poaching commensurate with ensuring that any stimulus such one-off sales of stockpiled ivory might give to the black-market trade would be more than offset by the improved conservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/4">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>, all applications for Article 10 certificates for un-worked ivory tusks are being refused regardless of origin or acquired date, unless there are very exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/5">Last year officials prepared a specific guidance note for antique dealers, in consultation with the British Antique Dealers Association, concerning the control of trade in endangered species. It contains information concerning the requirements that must be complied with by dealers when they are engaged in the sale of antique items in the UK or their export overseas, and the ramifications of non-compliance with the regulations. This was distributed to trade associations and to applicants and enquirers with antique queries.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/6">The findings of Care for the Wild's report, <I>Ivory Markets in Europe</I>, produced by Dr Esmond Martin and Dr Daniel Stiles last year, states there is no evidence of a large illegal market in ivory products in the UK or Europe as a whole. Although the scale of the UK's worked ivory market was ranked ninth out of 33 countries surveyed, the report concluded that most of this ivory trade was legal.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/7">Statistics from the Elephant Trade Information System (a global monitoring system established to track and assess the scale of illegal trade in ivory) has not revealed any significant problems of illegal ivory trade in the UK. We believe that there are far more serious ivory issues than that represented by the UK trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/8">We are working, within the context of the UK's commitment to reduce poverty in developing countries, to secure public and animal health here, and to meet a commitment to stem the loss of biodiversity globally. An interdepartmental ministerial body on biodiversity issues has commissioned a study into the importance of bushmeat to poverty alleviation and biodiversity loss. It is expected to report in Summer 2006. Improved forest governance and reduction in illegal logging are also seen as key to the sustainable management of forests and forest resources, which include bushmeat.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.3/1">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/2">Evidence from the Labour Force Survey suggests that in 2005 there were fewer than 50,000 women who had two or more jobs that each pay less than the lower earnings limit (LEL) but which added together pay more than the LEL.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/3">Due to the small sample sizes available in this dataset, we are unable to provide the additional information about this group.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/4">The Labour Force Survey on which the information provided is based on &quot;point in time&quot; analysis, so only provides a snapshot of the number of people in these particular circumstances at the time the data are collected. Individuals may not, of course, be in these circumstances all of their working lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/5">As a result of our proposed reforms to the basic state pension (BSP), including the reduction in the number of qualifying years to 30, we estimate that by 2025, over 90 per cent of women and men reaching state pension age will be entitled to a full BSP. The extension of childcare credits in state second pension (S2P) to parents until their youngest child turns 12 means that from 2010 around an extra 780,000 women and 30,000 men will be accruing S2P.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.3/6">People reaching pension age from 2010 will have far greater opportunity to build BSP and S2P entitlement over their working life. Provision of care or spells of employment with earnings below the LEL should no longer compromise this opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.6/1">Women are not eligible for autocredits. The additional savings against our proposal to phase out autocredits for men in line with the increase in state pension age for women are estimated to be negligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.6/2">Our proposal to phase out autocredits between 2010 and 2020 is designed to align the availability of autocredits with the availability of pension credit under the current regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.6/3">The retention of autocredits is inappropriate in a society where someone aged 60 can now expect to live, on average, for another 25 years or more. As the state pension age for women rises in 2010, we will increasingly treat men and women aged 60-64 as active labour-market participants. The proposal to reduce the number of qualifying years required to achieve a full basic state pension to 30 will, in any event, mean that few could benefit from the continued availability of autocredits.</p>

This change sought to ensure that reporting arrangements for royal travel were more consistent with other grants-in-aid and royal expenditure where figures in the annual report are rounded to the nearest &pound;100,000.

	<p pid="a.214.3/1">Direct employment of sheep shearers by a labour user is outside the scope of the Gangmasters Licensing Act 2004. The Act does apply where sheep shearers are supplied to a labour user by a third party, such as a sheep shearing contractor.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.3/2">However, after reviewing the terms of the Gangmasters Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations 2006, we have concluded that the exemption applicable to the use of a worker by an agricultural machinery service provider in order to deliver a machinery service (paragraph 8 of the schedule to the regulations) also applies to sheep shearers. This conclusion is based on the view that the clippers supplied for use by the shearers are defined as machinery for the purpose of interpreting the terms of this provision. In view of this, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) has confirmed that contractors who supply sheep shearers and provide the machinery they use do not need to obtain a gangmasters licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.3/3">The GLA will be monitoring the terms of this exemption to ensure that it is not exploited by unscrupulous labour providers determined to avoid the licensing requirement. If it is deemed necessary to revise the terms of the exemption to close any potential loophole, we will ensure that the National Association of Agricultural Contractors (NAAC) and other interested parties are consulted on the proposals brought forward for this purpose.</p>
