In particular, it does not provide for the Secretary of State to delegate to the police service a power to divide dealers into larger or smaller businesses and to charge different fees for each type of business.

	<p pid="a.18.5/1">It is not my department's practice to comment on notifications received under Section 193 of the Trade Union (Consolidation) Act 1992 unless details of those notifications have already been put in the public domain by the employers concerned, as the information may be commercially sensitive. Employers known to be contemplating making collective redundancies are, however, reminded of their obligations and of the criminal offence involved if they fail, without good reason, to meet them.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.1/2" qnum="HL318">Whether they will provide the same screening and other health related measures for United Kingdom civilian citizens who may have been exposed to depleted uranium, wherever that may have occurred, as is provided for military personnel who served in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.2/1">The Government consider that the health risks from exposure to depleted uranium to United Kingdom military personnel and civilians who have served in the Balkans are very low. Nevertheless, steps are being taken to identify an appropriate screening programme for these groups. The Ministry of Defence will be seeking the views of the UK National Screening Committee in developing proposals. The nature and scope of such a screening programme has yet to be determined. Recently the Department of Health has sent a circular to medical practitioners covering advice from the Ministry of Defence on how to manage patients who might present to general practitioners or hospital specialists for advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">Any individuals who are concerned about their health because of possible exposure to depleted uranium for any reason should, of course, seek medical advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.2/1">The UK National Screening Committee advised the Government that universal neo-natal hearing screening (UNHS) provided a more effective and efficient screen to help detect permanent hearing loss in children. However, it pointed out that there were many practical issues to be resolved in changing from an infant distraction test to UNHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">To ensure that UNHS can be introduced to high quality, consistent standards, these changes will be piloted first in 20 health authority areas. The lessons from the pilots will help inform and plan a national implementation.</p>
