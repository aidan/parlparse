Civil society plays a vital role in supporting citizens to improve their lives. Civil society organisations are central to delivering services, enabling citizens to be more active in their development and ensuring that policies benefit ordinary people. Through our work with Comic Relief we are supporting the common ground initiative to increase funding to small and diaspora organisations to create real and sustainable change to some of the poorest and most disadvantaged communities in Africa. DfID is planning closer engagement with UK based African diaspora during the autumn and to build further on links already made including, most recently, with Somalian diaspora.</p>
