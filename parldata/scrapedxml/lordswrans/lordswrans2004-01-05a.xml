	<p pid="a.4.2/1">The Government recognises Israel's legitimate security concerns, and deplores the terrorist suicide bombings of Israeli civilians. But, we consider Israel's building of a wall on occupied land to be unlawful, and remain concerned by the route of the barrier. We regret that Israel has not complied with the General Assembly's demand in Resolution ES-10/13 to halt and reverse the construction of the fence, and we continue to urge the Israeli authorities to take action to this effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/2">Nevertheless, the British Government, like our EU partners, abstained on Resolution ES-10/14, which called for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the legality of the fence. We believe it inappropriate to take such action without the consent of both parties. Moreover, we do not see that an advisory opinion will change the actual situation on ground. Our priority should be to ensure continued dialogue, implementation of roadmap obligations and immediate action on the ground.</p>

In addition we have said repeatedly that neither side should take unilateral action that could prejudge the status of Jerusalem. We regard the status of Jerusalem as still to be determined in permanent status negotiations between the parties. Pending agreement, we recognise de facto Israeli authority over West Jerusalem, but consider East Jerusalem to be occupied territory. We recognise no sovereignty over the city.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-01-05a.8.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="8"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040105/text/40105w02.htm#40105w02_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.8.3/1">The UN Panel on the Illegal Exploitation of the Natural Resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has now completed its work. It addressed one of the central and most contentious issues of the conflict in the DRC: the link between the causes of the conflict and the exploitation of natural resources. The panel's final report contains a number of important recommendations about how both the Congolese people and the international community should better manage the exploitation of resources to benefit the people of the DRC. Without losing sight of what has gone on before and the need for justice in appropriate cases, we need to build on many of its positive recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/2">We agree with the panel that the international community must support the Transitional National Government (TNG) in the DRC. We are already working with the new government in Congo and with international and regional partners to help develop its institutions and to put in place effective management of the country's natural resources. The huge potential of the Congo's natural resources should be exploited legally and in a regulated way, for the benefit of all Congolese. We want to see trade in natural resources become a cohesive factor in regional stability and not a cause of conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/3">We are playing a leading role in helping the TNG make effective its Anti-Corruption Commission. We are helping the new government adhere to the Kimberley Process on the regulated trade in diamonds, which is the country's most significant export. We have funded Global Witness to research and publish an independent preliminary report on resource exploitation, and we are planning to fund further research in this field. We are talking to the TNG about the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which the Prime Minister launched in February 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/4">We are also engaged in promoting confidence-building measures in the region. We welcome the declaration on Good Neighbourliness made by the Governments of Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and the DRC in New York on <phrase class="date" code="">25 September</phrase>, which includes that there must be no illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the DRC. We encourage the states concerned to continue to follow this up with steps to address bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/5">The illegal exploitation of resources in the DRC has served to fuel the conflict by funding arms flows. We need to ensure that the arms embargo on groups operating in the DRC is effectively implemented and monitored. We are playing a leading role through our Mission in New York in supporting proposals for an arms embargo monitoring mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/6">As well as looking forward, we need to address what has happened in the past. We take seriously the allegations made against the British companies named in the report. We have already pursued these allegations: the DTI, as National Contact Point for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines has scrutinised the dossiers referred to it by the UN Panel and has been in contact with the named companies or their representatives to discuss the allegations. Her Majesty's Customs and Excise has studied the UN Panel's papers relating to the UK companies named in the report, but have been unable to take matters further, due to lack of evidence which would be sufficient to mount a criminal investigation. We are disappointed that despite numerous appeals to the panel to furnish detailed information to substantiate its allegations, we have not received any such information. We cannot now pursue the cases named in the report further without more specific information. There is so far no evidence that named companies have breached either OECD guidelines or UK law. We continue to ask the UN to supply us with the information on which the panel based its allegations. We also urge the NGO community to submit any specific information it may have to the National Contact Point.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/7">We continue to press regional states to investigate and, where appropriate, take action on the allegations made in the panel reports. In this respect we welcome the publication of the conclusions of the Commission of Inquiry established by the Ugandan Government. We remain in close contact with the Government of Uganda on follow-up work to the commission's report. We also welcome the establishment of a Judicial Commission by the Rwandan Government and urge it to publicise the results of its investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/8">The panels's final report included a section which the panel chose not to make public, but which was submitted on a confidential basis to the Security Council. It is not appropriate for us to comment on this, but as far as we are aware, none of the companies or individuals named in the confidential section is of British nationality.</p>

The principal obligations in the new protocol are:</p>

There was a general recognition of the value of biosecurity measures and procedures, which will ensure that such dangerous materials are not accessible to persons who might or could misuse them for purposes contrary to the BWC.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/5">There was also agreement that these measures are essential effort in facilitating more effective implementation and enforcement of the convention, as well as providing the basis for an assessment of progress at the 2006 Review Conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/6">As with the earlier meeting of BWC experts in August, which had prepared the way for political decision-making, there was an impressive level of participation. Some 92 states parties were represented and a total of 32 national statements were delivered, including one notably from Iraq which for the first time showed an open and positive engagement with its obligations under the convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/7">The United Kingdom was grateful to the Chair, Ambassador Toth of Hungary, for the efforts he made to achieve consensus on a final document that reflects the commonality of views and approaches that were demonstrated throughout. The commitment to assess progress at the Sixth Review Conference in 2006 on the extent of which states parties have put in place the necessary legislation is, in our view, particularly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/8">The outcome of the November meeting represents a very positive start to the work programme that lies ahead of us. Success was particularly important this year, as it is to be hoped that a precedent has now been set for agreement on effective action to emerge from the further meetings under the Biological Weapons Convention, scheduled to take place in 2004 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/9">The United Kingdom believes that the success of the meetings in 2003 has also helped to prove to the wider arms control community that this new process can be made to work. It has delivered a shared international analysis and a readiness to adopt practical measures. Most important, a co-operative spirit continued to prevail throughout the discussions in Geneva, which also augurs well for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/10">South Africa will chair the meetings next year on suspicious outbreaks of disease and the need for improved international surveillance. The UK takes over in 2005 with the task of examining a possible code of conduct for scientists. Work has already begun on our preparations for both of these meetings. I will keep the House informed of developments and outcomes in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">The fifth annual Overseas Territories Consultative Council, held in London on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase>, provided an opportunity to review, with representatives of the UK Overseas Territories, progress in implementing the commitments made in the 1999 White Paper Partnership for Progress and Prosperity: Britain and the Overseas Territories (Cm 4264).</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">Several Overseas Territory representatives argued, in the context of constitutional reviews currently under way, for a greater devolution of responsibility and reduction in the powers of governors, in some cases amounting to full internal self-government and total abolition of the UK Government's reserved powers. Territory representatives also sought clarification of their rights of self-determination and free association under the terms of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1541 of 1960.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/3">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Bill Rammell) emphasised that the security and good governance of the Overseas Territories remains a key foreign policy objective for the UK Government, as indicated in the White Paper UK International Priorities: A Strategy for the FCO, Cm 6052, published on <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase>. Territories have the right to seek independence, where this is an option, but, while the link with the United Kingdom remains, the UK Government will have to retain sufficient powers to protect its overall responsibility for ensuring good governance and compliance with international obligations and to minimise its contingent liabilities arising from its relationship with the Territories. The UK Government consider it important to protect key values, particularly the independence of the judiciary, the political impartiality and integrity of the public service, and sound financial management in the territories. Governors have a key role to play in this.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.8/1">There has been a 28 per cent increase in core expenditure provision for fire and rescue authorities since 1997, a year-on-year increase of over 4 per cent and a real increase in provision. In 2004&ndash;05 authorities will receive an average increase of 4.2 per cent and no authority will get less than a 3.5 per cent increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.8/2">The Government believe that the costs and savings of modernisation should balance over the spending review 2002 period (2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06). Fire and rescue authorities, through the Local Government Association, have said that this is achievable. The Independent Review of the Fire and Rescue Service said: &quot;We are confident that, within the foreseeable future, benefits will more than exceed additional costs, including those of the pay increase we propose&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.8/3">However, the Government recognise that there may be a lag between costs and savings of modernisation. An additional &pound;30 million transitional funding is available for England and Wales, which will be released subject to satisfactory progress on ongoing pay negotiations and modernisation. It will be recouped over the SR2002 period.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.8/4">In addition, the Government have committed &pound;56 million on phase one of the New Dimension programme, which seeks to ensure that fire and rescue authorities are sufficiently trained and equipped to deal safely and effectively with major chemical, nuclear, biological and conventional terrorist incidents on a national scale. The Government are also providing a further &pound;132 million for phase two of the New Dimension programme, which includes purchase of modern search and rescue equipment which will improve authorities' capacity to respond to incidents involving, for example, collapsed buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.5/2">There will thus be differences between projects, but I understand that a rule of thumb in the wind energy industry is that new projects may currently cost an average of some &pound;650,000 per megawatt of capacity installed, including the cost of the turbine, transport to the site, and erection and commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/3">Making use of this rule of thumb, rough approximations can be made of the replacement cost of currently operational wind farm projects: some &pound;150 million for Wales; some &pound;130 million for Scotland; some &pound;100 million for England and some &pound;45 million for Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/1">The broadband market must necessarily be market driven. If the operators charge too much for their services, consumers will not use them, and they will not recoup the cost of their investment. The best chance they have of doing so is to get products into the market at a price attractive to consumers. The independent regulator Ofcom, has the power to intervene if they feel prices are being maintained artificially high.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/2">The UK has over 300 ADSL broadband providers and significant levels of infrastructure competition. Many service providers offer free connection, activation on broadband products and deals on modems. These are commercial decisions for private sector companies. Broadband is growing fast in the UK with around 40,000 new customers a week. Competition is fostering innovative pricing&mdash;such as the free activation offer&mdash;and removing barriers to broadband take up.</p>
