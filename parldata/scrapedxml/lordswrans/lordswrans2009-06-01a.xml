	<p pid="a.3.2/1">In recognition of the highly mobile nature of service life, it is Ministry of Defence (MoD) policy that service accommodation is provided for all entitled service personnel as part of their terms and conditions of service. In cases where no suitable service accommodation is available, substitute accommodation is sourced from the commercial rental market via the MoD accommodation agency contractor in order to meet this obligation. Substitute accommodation is normally provided within the same radius/travelling time from a place of work as service accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">Different arrangements apply to single and family accommodation. Where the provision of substitute service single accommodation (SSSA) is required an indicative rental ceiling is applicable. Strict criteria also govern entitlement, property specification, furnishing, and standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/3">Indicative rental ceilings are set by the MoD in conjunction with the contractor and reviewed regularly. The indicative rental ceilings as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase> are set out in the table below:</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/17">Substitute service family accommodation (SSFA) broadly equates to a service person's equivalent entitlement to service family accommodation (SFA). Because of the unpredictability of the commercial rental market there is no indicative rental ceiling. Approval is required by defence estates, which is provided in accordance with a locally determined average of rents to ensure value for money. Occupants of SSFA pay daily charges for comparable SFA of a similar size/type.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/18">Rental payment is made directly by the MoD to the contractor who then pays the landlord. Individuals may occupy properties in excess of their entitlement by payment of a personal contribution towards the rent.</p>

However, Lord Bradley's report itself recognises many recommendations, including that concerning a further review of the potential for early intervention with children and young people, are longer term and will need further work to ensure that all implications are considered.

However, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of this figure or to find a reliable estimate regarding the overall number of child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

	<p pid="a.24.3/1">We have made no assessment of exactly how many journalists and aid workers have been expelled by the Government of Ethiopia from the Somali region of Ethiopia (the Ogaden) in the past two years or how many of them were British citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/2">The International Committee for the Red Cross is the most notable organisation to be expelled from the Somalia region (July 2007). Even though it is still working to a minimum level in the rest of Ethiopia, there are no signs that it will be allowed to re-enter the Somali Region. We are also aware that Medicins Sans Frontieres (Switzerland) ceased operating in the region in mid 2008 claiming intimidation and inability to do its job.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.2/3">The remainder are veterans who did not serve for long enough to qualify for a service pension and who are not yet old enough (60 years) or needy enough to qualify for a Welfare Pension. Many would have been made redundant with less than 10 years' service when the Brigade of Gurkhas reduced in size, particularly in the late 1960s before the move from Malaysia to Hong Kong. They would have received a gratuity but no pension.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.6/2">Most margarine products contain low levels of trans fats (less than 1 per cent), which like saturated fat is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, the current United Kingdom population trans fat intakes are about half the maximum recommended level of 2 per cent of food energy, as recommended by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA, 1994) and endorsed by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN, 2007).

Under EU regulations, the UK has no direct say in how another member state calculates these costs.

	<p pid="a.34.6/1">The UN's Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has investigated the activities of Hussar Ltd in the trade of gold from DRC. Its inquiries covered Hussar Ltd's relationship with Uganda Commercial Impex Ltd, a company now subject to UN sanctions. We concluded in 2006 that it would not be appropriate to impose sanctions on Hussar Ltd through the UN. We have no information to indicate that Hussar is currently involved in the trade of gold from DRC. If it resumes its involvement in this trade, we would expect the company to act in compliance with the terms of the UN arms embargo and sanctions regime which apply in DRC.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.9/1">Greater Manchester is already leading the way in the roll-out of identity cards. The city's airport is working with the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) as one of the first wave of airports which are introducing identity cards to airside workers from this autumn. Launching the service to the public in Manchester will widen the range of people in the region who are using the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.9/2">It will give the public, retailers and service providers a chance to become familiar with the cards as supporting hardware such as chip and pin readers are introduced. Another factor in Manchester's favour is its large population of young people and students. Our research indicates that this group is particularly likely to need to be able to prove their age and identity and are thus likely to benefit from the early adoption of ID cards.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/1">A telephone check to IPS would include the ID card (product) number as well as certain other information on the face of the card. This information would be sufficient for IPS to determine whether such a card was issued and is still valid. Such a check would also require authentication that the requesting party was authorised to make the request, that they were doing so with the card holder's consent, that the person presenting the card resembled the photograph on the card and that the card showed no obvious signs of tampering. The process for doing this would be very similar to the current Passport Validation Service, but the exact process is still being defined.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/3">To help improve communications around the development and launch of the identity card, IPS launched a website on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May 2009</phrase>. Through the site located at <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/identity">www.direct.gov.uk/identity</a> citizens will be able register their interest in identity cards and the National Identity Service (NIS). Once registered on the site they will receive regular e-newsletters providing help and advice around how to protect your identity, the development of the NIS and the introduction of identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/4"><I>Planned marketing activity</I></p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">IPS is working with a media planning agency to finalise the marketing channel strategy for activity in and around Greater Manchester. We expect to be undertaking two campaigns. The first, due to go live during August, will be aimed at businesses in those sectors which are likely to come into contact with identity cards when they are selling products or services. The second, due to go live during October, is aimed at citizens to notify them about the ability to get an identity card in their area and explaining what it can do for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/6"><I>Recent stakeholder and communications activity</I></p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/7">IPS has met with a large number of stakeholder organisations as part of a continuing programme to inform and consult on the NIS. These have included organisations from the public, private and third sector including National Union of Students, Universities UK and other organisations representing students. In Greater Manchester in particular we have already met with organisations such as the Learning and Skills Council and the universities. The Home Secretary's speech on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-29">29 January</phrase> in Manchester Town Hall was attended by 35 different organisations from Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/8">IPS will continue our programme of stakeholder involvement to ensure that important information regarding the NIS reaches the widest possible audience. We are planning events in Greater Manchester over the next two months and will ensure that student organisations are represented.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/10"><I>Activity with young people</I></p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/11">During her recent visit to Manchester, the Home Secretary visited Newall Green School in Wythenshawe to meet young people who could be some of the first to be able to apply for cards from 2010. Together they discussed how identity cards will help young people strike out on their own by opening their first bank account, renting their first flat, or perhaps travelling to Europe for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/12"><I>Recent media activity</I></p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/13">As part of the Home Secretary's recent visit to Manchester, the regional broadcast/ print media were invited to attend and film her visit to a local school to discuss identity issues, and undertake interviews with the Home Secretary. We also issued a press notice including a supportive statement from Manchester Airport Group. IPS provided proactive briefings with regional media following the speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/14">Local coverage of the event focused primarily on good pieces in the <I>Manchester Evening News</I> and Press Association, which was picked up more widely by local and regional media.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/15">National online coverage was reported by BBC News, ITN Online, Channel Four Online, Eastern Daily Press and a range of global news sites.</p>

The power is in fact broad and can be used in any circumstances, provided it is exercised reasonably, proportionately and consistently. An individual excluded by the Home Secretary must be refused entry to the UK, in accordance with paragraph 320(6) of the immigration rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.8/2">In response to the recommendations of the Rose Early Reading Review, we changed the national curriculum to ensure that all children learn to read through the use of systematic phonics. We have also developed the Communication, Language and Literacy Development programme. This programme provides every local authority with a specialist consultant to improve the teaching of reading in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/3">For those children who struggle with reading, we are rolling out the Every Child a Reader programme which delivers a suite of early literacy interventions to support these pupils. The ECAR approach is based on three waves of intervention with those children most in need receiving intensive one-to-one support (using the Reading Recovery programme) whilst other children, with less severe literacy learning difficulties, receive small group support. By 2010-11, 30,000 children a year with severe literacy difficulties will benefit from Every Child a Reader.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/4">The primary framework, developed by the National Strategies, is available online for all schools. This offers a broad range of optional guidance and resources to support teachers in ensuring that their teaching is personalised to the needs of every child. Local authorities and schools receive training from the National Strategies in the effective use of the framework and its supporting materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/5">We have also developed the What Works Well website, a growing database of case studies, provided by teachers, that shares real practice which has improved learning and teaching.</p>

It provides evidence-based information about skin cancer and in 2009 will raise awareness of the dangers of sunbeds. In addition the Department of Health in England has worked with the Health and Safety Executive which has recently issued revised guidance for sunbed operators and users. Some time ago the UK health departments also asked the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation and the Environment (COMARE) to set up a sub-committee on sunbeds.

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) monitors prohibition rates carefully both nationally and at individual sites. VOSA's strategy of targeting has led to a steady increase in national prohibition rates since 2003, with a small reduction in 2008-09. Figures for individual sites are more variable. The figures for Liverpool and Holyhead have been placed in the House of Commons Library. The figures vary year on year, but generally reflect the upward national trend. VOSA's planning is based on a 5 per cent increase in prohibition rates for the current year to reflect continuing improvements in targeting. However, increases in checks at any site could lead to higher deterrence which could cause prohibition rates to decline.</p>

Although the approximately 70 political detainees who were in custody when the inclusive government was formed have been released, they are under strict bail conditions and there are reports of continued state harassment. We will continue to monitor the human rights situation closely and to put pressure on the Government of Zimbabwe to honour their commitments to improve respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
