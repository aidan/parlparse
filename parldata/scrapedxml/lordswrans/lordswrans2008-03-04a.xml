	<p pid="a.165.11/1">The position of the Government on this issue is long-standing. The Government acknowledge the strength of feeling about this terrible episode of history and recognise the massacres of 1915-16 as a tragedy. However, neither this Government nor previous Governments have judged that the evidence is sufficiently unequivocal to persuade us that these events should be categorised as genocide as defined by the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.11/2">As my right honourable friend the then Minister for Europe (Geoffrey Hoon) said in a debate in Westminster Hall on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June 2006</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 137WH), the work of establishing the truth must be conducted as a joint exercise by the parties directly involved if it is to help towards reconciliation. There needs to be a truth and reconciliation process owned by the people of Armenia and Turkey. Outsiders can commend the idea to the parties, but they should not try to do the work for them&mdash;undertaking this is an important part of the confidence-building and reconciliation process for the parties themselves. The Government will continue to encourage the parties to embark on such a process. In the mean time, we should resist the temptation to pre-empt its conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.2/1">The Government are not undertaking any investigations into potentially disputed property bought by British citizens in northern Cyprus. However, in response to inquires from members of the public, and through our travel advice on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website (<a href="http://www.fco.gove">www.fco.gove</a>. uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029390590&amp;a=KCountry Advice&amp;aid=1013618387279), we strongly advise anyone thinking of purchasing property in the northern part of Cyprus to seek independent legal advice before buying any land or property. We also highlight the risks associated with buying property in the northern part of Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/2">In our contacts with the leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community, we recognise the Turkish Cypriots' need for economic development in support of reunification. But we urge them to ensure that any property development that takes place does so in a manner that is both environmentally sustainable and does not complicate an eventual solution. Ultimately we believe that the difficult issue of property is likely to be fully resolved only in the context of a comprehensive settlement. We continue to urge both sides to engage constructively with the United Nations and to show the political will necessary to make decisive progress towards a comprehensive settlement in 2008.</p>

The UK has given full and consistent support, both practical and political, to ICTY's work.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/2">The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council conclusions of June 2007 recalled that the pace and conclusion of the negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement (SAA) would depend on Serbia's full co-operation with ICTY. There is currently no consensus within the EU that the necessary conditions have been met for SAA signature.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/3">The Government's position is that the political process must move forward in a way that upholds ICTY conditionality and ensures that this remains embedded in the accession process. The Government would be ready&mdash;in the interest of sending a clear signal of EU commitment to Serbia's European future&mdash;to contemplate signature of an SAA if there were clear agreement that ICTY conditionality were to remain clearly embedded in the accession process and to apply at the next relevant stage. A further relevant consideration is Serbia's response to developments in Kosovo. Violence against international personnel in Kosovo or against diplomatic premises in Belgrade, and statements by Serbian Ministers that condone this, clearly create an unpromising background for progress in the EU's relations with Serbia.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.2/1">Chapter 7 of the <I>Coronary Heart Disease National Service Framework</I>, published in March 2000, issued appropriate guidance to the National Health Service about the provision of cardiac rehabilitation services.

	<p pid="a.174.2/1">This country operates in an increasingly global economy in which there is a greater international exchange of skilled workers than ever before and our world-class university system makes our graduates and skilled people highly attractive to international companies and employers. It is important that we go on equipping people of all backgrounds and talents with the skills that they need to be properly qualified to work wherever they wish. However, the vast majority (90 per cent) of those highly skilled workers are being employed by UK-based employers using the higher-level skills that they have acquired to make us a highly competitive and productive economy on the world stage. Many of the 10 per cent who seek opportunities overseas return at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.5/1">We agree with the associate parliamentary group's report that more effort is needed to implement the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) in the run-up to the 2009 elections. The CPA is the bedrock of stability and democratic transformation in Sudan and 2008 is a critical year in the agreement's implementation. The census, preparation for elections, continued installation of the joint integrated units and demarcation of the north-south boundary are important milestones ahead and we will support both parties in helping to achieve them.</p>
