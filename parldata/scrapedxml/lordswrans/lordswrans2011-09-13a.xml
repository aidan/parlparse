	<p pid="a.47.5/1">The Government are absolutely committed to tackling and preventing female genital mutilation (FGM) and we recognise that a joined-up approach across front-line agencies is needed to safeguard girls and protect women. Tackling FGM forms a key part of <I>The Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls: Action Plan</I>, published in March this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.5/2">In 2010 we developed and distributed over 40,000 information leaflets and 40,000 posters that have been circulated to schools, health services, charities and community groups around the country. We have also established a regular forum for the voluntary and community sector to raise concerns with the Government and inform our work. This forum is also used to map community engagement work and identify best practice, such as the new multi-agency practice guidelines to help ensure that professionals are able and confident to intervene to protect girls at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.5/3">There are 15 specialist clinics (as of March 2011) in the NHS which treat women and girls who have been subjected to FGM, all with trained and culturally sensitive staff who offer a range of healthcare services for women and girls including reversal surgery. Services are confidential and in many instances interpreters are available. These clinics are open to women to attend without referral from their own doctors and are funded by local PCTs.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.5/1">At a national level, the Government will create a health research regulatory agency to combine and streamline the approvals for health research which are at present scattered across many organisations. This will reduce the regulatory burden on research-active businesses, universities and the National Health Service, improve the timeliness of decisions about research projects and hence the cost-effectiveness of their delivery in the United Kingdom. This action has clear support from the Academy of Medical Sciences review of health research regulation and governance. As a first step, the Government will establish this year a special health authority with the National Research Ethics Service as its core. The new agency will work closely with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to create a unified approval process and promote proportionate standards for compliance and inspection within a consistent national system of research governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/2">At a local level, the Government will radically transform the incentives for efficiency in research initiation and delivery. In May, the Government launched through the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) a framework of good practice and standard procedures called the NIHR Research Support Services to facilitate consistent local research management and greatly improve performance. NHS providers which adopt these standards will stop unnecessary duplication of checks. They will publish metrics regularly on their performance. They will have access to NIHR financial support for these activities. For clinical trials, the NIHR will from 2012 publish outcomes against public NIHR benchmarks, including an initial benchmark of 70 days or less from the time a provider receives a valid research protocol to the time when that provider recruits the first patient for that study. In future, NIHR funding to providers of NHS services will become conditional on meeting benchmarks, including the 70-day benchmark to recruit first patients for trials. The NIHR will make this a condition of new contracts from autumn 2011 and performance will affect funding from 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/3">The Government published their intentions in the Plan for Growth in March 2011, available from HM Treasury. None of them requires legislation expressly for NHS foundation trusts.</p>
