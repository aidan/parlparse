Information on the detail of these negotiations between individual departments and the local trade unions is not collated centrally&mdash;to do so would incur disproportionate cost. Under the centrally managed arrangements for the SCS, the independent Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) makes recommendations to the Government on reward policy for the SCS each year. The First Division Association, which represents senior civil servants, submits its own evidence to the SSRB, but does not have negotiating rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">The system of post-legislative scrutiny set out in the White Paper is initiated by the submission of a memorandum on the Act by the relevant government department to the departmental Select Committee, generally between three and five years after the Act receives Royal Assent.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.5/1">There are a number of factors which will cause differences in prisoner costs, such as the category, size, age, and location of the prisons, the mix of prisoners and the internal regime and rehabilitation work followed. For example, in England and Wales the average cost per prisoner in a male dispersal prison (category A) is more than double the cost in a male open prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/2">The Northern Ireland Prison Service is substantially smaller than that in England and Wales and the scope for benefiting from economies of scale is considerably less. Staffing levels are higher due to complexity and inefficient building designs. In addition, salaries are historically higher in Northern Ireland due to the management of terrorist prisoners. Steps are being taken to align salaries to those paid elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.8/1">The apparently large difference in the ratio of officers to prisoners is mainly due to the different classification of prison officers between the two jurisdictions. In Northern Ireland, a wider group of staff are classified as officers than in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.8/2">If operational support grades are included along with officer grades to calculate the ratio for England the ratio falls to 2.2:1. The continuing differential is because the Northern Ireland Prison Service has not been able to benefit from economies of scale.</p>
