	<p pid="a.365.2/1">In the interests of long-term financial affordability, the strategic defence and security review (SDSR) determined that we would transition to a two-platform fast jet fleet consisting of the highly capable multi-role aircraft, Typhoon and Joint Strike Fighter. In the transition period the difficult decision has been taken to remove Harrier from service in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/2">The overriding factor in deciding between removing either the Tornado GR4 or Harrier was the ability to support operations in Afghanistan. The Harrier fleet would have been too small to support Afghanistan operations at current levels, notwithstanding Carrier Strike and other contingent operations. Conversely, the Tornado GR4 force-even at its reduced size-will be significantly larger than the current Harrier force and would allow continuous UK fast jet close air support to forces in Afghanistan and the ability to support concurrent operations. It also has a number of key capability advantages over the Harrier GR9 including: greater payload and range and integration of capabilities such as Storm Shadow; fully integrated dual mode Brimstone; the Raptor reconnaissance pod; and a cannon.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/3">We will retain a reduced Tornado GR4 fleet that will draw down gradually to ensure there is no effect on operations in Afghanistan as we transition to Typhoon and Joint Strike Fighter, from which we will also regenerate our Carrier Strike capability. In line with these transitions, we currently plan to take the Tornado GR4 out of service in 2021. This updates the out-of-service date and associated costs in the reply I gave to the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-16">16 November</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-11-16.178"><I>Official Report</I>, col. WA 178</phrase>) which were based on pre-SDSR plans. The Prime Minister received full advice on the options regarding our fast jet fleet as part of the SDSR process.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/4">The MoD made estimates of cost savings accrued from measures considered in the SDSR for the purpose of formulating policy. Some of these have been published to help inform the public debate. Release of further detail may prejudice the MoD's negotiating position with its commercial suppliers. Furthermore, final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation, which will generally be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trades unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity and health and safety. The MoD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed savings or updated in-service cost figures at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/5">The MoD calculates the full cost of aircraft per flying hour; the current rates for our fast jets are shown below. These figures include forward and depth servicing, fuel costs, crew costs, training costs, cost of capital charge, depreciation and amortisation. The Typhoon cost per flying hour reflects the build-up of the fleet with small numbers of aircraft currently in service. This cost will comparatively reduce as the fleet builds and is expected to be similar to our other fast jet fleets when we reach a steady state position.</p>

	<p pid="a.365.2/15">These costs will need to be reviewed once we have finalised the SDSR decisions and how they will be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/16">The Tornado aircraft fleet, consisting of the GR4 ground attack and F3 air defence variants, is supported by two availability-based maintenance contracts. The Availability Transformation: Tornado Aircraft Contract (ATTAC), for which BAE Systems is the prime contractor, provides depth support until 2016 and has a total value of &#163;1.5 billion. The Turbo-Union RB 199 engine which powers the Tornado aircraft is supported by the RB 199 Operational Contract for Engine Transformation 2 (ROCET 2) awarded to Rolls-Royce until 2025. The contract has a total value of &#163;690 million. There are no penalty clauses in either contract. However, both contracts include a number of conditions that allow for early termination. Any costs associated with the implementation of these conditions following the SDSR outcome are being negotiated with the contractor.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/17">Under the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot) programme approved in December 2007, 96 Tornado GR4 aircraft will receive capability upgrades between 2011 and 2014 at an estimated cost of around &#163;300 million. This number of aircraft is sufficient to maintain the operational capability of the Tornado GR4 Forward Available Fleet until OSD. There are currently no plans for the aircraft to receive any further capability upgrades after 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/18">For the number of Tornado GR4 modified for operations in Afghanistan, I refer the noble Lord to the reply I gave to the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-04">4 November</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-11-04.427"><I>Official Report</I>, col. WA 427</phrase>). To optimise the further 17 Tornado aircraft required for operations in Afghanistan will cost around &#163;0.5 million. The 15 Harrier GR9 aircraft that have returned from Afghanistan would require refitting of equipment to be made ready for operations.</p>

Prime Minister Maliki will then have a further 30 days to submit a Cabinet to the CoR for approval.

	<p pid="a.393.0/1">We have always been clear that tackling the fiscal deficit is the Government's main priority and that local authorities must make a contribution to reducing the deficit. We have said for some time that this should not be achieved by salami-slicing budgets but that we expect local authorities to start early to make radical changes, so that they can continue to provide key front-line services with less money. The best councils have already been undertaking major restructuring in areas such as shared services, back office and procurement in readiness for the spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/2">The spending review 2010 provides a fair though challenging settlement for local government. It delivers radical reforms with new financial freedoms including the ending of ring-fencing of all revenue grants from 2011-12, except simplified school grants, and a new public health grant from 2013. We have also removed top-down bureaucratic burdens. Local government has the freedom and powers to deliver the key front-line services that people rely on and to make significant savings. The measures that we are taking to deliver transparency about spending decisions and outcomes will help local areas to hold their local authorities to account and ensure that councils cut waste and use funding in the most effective way to deliver local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/3">Decisions on the level and profile of all settlements took into account the needs of public services and affordability within the overall spending envelope. The spending review set out the decisions necessary to deliver the Government's deficit reduction plan. As a result of the action that the Government are taking, the Office for Budget Responsibility projects that the structural current deficit will be eliminated by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/4">Formula grant is only one element of support for councils. Other funding will be provided through specific grants. The full picture for local government will be available once we are in a position to provide further details on the overall spending plans for local authorities. Our aim is to make available as much of this information as possible at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement 2011-12.</p>
