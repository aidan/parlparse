	<p pid="a.6.0/1">Anyone can stand for the United Kingdom House of Commons. A Commonwealth citizen, or citizen of the Irish Republic, may take a seat in the House of Commons as long as (like British citizens) he or she is aged 21 or over. In United Kingdom law, there is a general disqualification in respect of members of legislatures outside the Commonwealth, subject to the exception that a Bill now before the Lordships' House seeks to create in respect of the Dail.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">The Home Office does not hold information about members of the House of Commons who have also been elected members of other legislatures. Nor am I able to answer for the legal requirements of legislatures in other countries, such as member states of the European Union. There is nothing in United Kingdom law, however, to prevent a member of the Isle of Man or Channel Islands legislatures from also standing for and taking a seat in the House of Commons, as long as he or she is a Briton, Commonwealth or Irish citizen.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">Neither is there United Kingdom law which prevents one person standing for and being elected to represent two constituencies. The procedures where a member is elected for two seats are set out on page 34 of Erskine May.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly will govern who may be appointed Minister or Member of the Executive. Elected Members of the House of Commons have not been prevented from sitting as part of devolved legislatures, although the Scotland Act 1998 prohibits government Ministers from being members of the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5">Election to a local authority is governed by Sections 79 and 80 of the Local Government Act 1972, as amended by the Local Government Elections (Changes to the Franchise and Qualifications of Members) Regulations 1985, which sets residence qualifications in addiction to nationality requirements</p>

	<p pid="a.7.5/1">The Government's policy in respect of the repatriation of those persons recognised as refugees in the United Kingdom, whatever their nationality or country of habitual residence, is in accordance with the provisions of the 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/2">Article 1F(b) of the convention provides that the provisions of the convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that they have committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to admission to that country as a refugee.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.5/2">The police already have statutory powers to deal with the misuse of crossbows. The Crossbows Act 1987 imposes restrictions on the sale and hire of crossbows to, and their possession by, people under 17 years of age. In addition, if the police believe that somebody is carrying a crossbow with intent to cause injury they may prosecute him or her under Section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953, which makes it an offence to carry an offensive weapon in a public place, carrying a maximum penalty of four years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine or both.</p>
