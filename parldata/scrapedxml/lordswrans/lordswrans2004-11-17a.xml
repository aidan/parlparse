	<p pid="a.161.5/41">The FCO created a dedicated sports budget in 2001, subsequently subsumed into its public diplomacy challenge fund. No central records of FCO-sponsored sporting projects are held for the period before 2001. In addition, missions overseas may have funded further projects since 2001 for which records are also not held centrally; obtaining details of these would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/42">UK missions have not yet distributed any London 2012 briefing notes overseas, since this would be in contravention of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules on promotion outside the territory of the bidding city. These rules have restricted what we can do before the IOC accepts London's candidature file. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the FCO (Bill Rammell) will now be co-ordinating the lobbying efforts of FCO missions overseas as well as other existing FCO support to the London bid. Posts have already received briefing on what activities they may undertake when the overseas promotion rules are relaxed and I will arrange for a copy of this to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.6/1">At the Istanbul summit in June 2004, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) partners committed the resources needed to establish five provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) in northern Afghanistan. This enabled NATO to achieve stage 1 of the phased expansion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) (the north). All the resources pledged at the Istanbul summit have been delivered and stage 1 was completed in September when the Netherlands opened the fifth NATO-led PRT.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.6/2">The Istanbul summit generated initial political support for stage 2 of ISAF expansion (in western Afghanistan). NATO still requires further contributions of personnel, air assets and logistical support to carry out stage 2 and is continuing the force generation process to address these shortfalls. We are pressing potential contributors to commit part or whole PRTs or wider force enablers for stage 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.6/3">NATO also undertook at the Istanbul summit to help provide security support during the Afghan presidential elections. This was delivered in the form of two additional battalions and the augmentation of existing PRTs in-country during the election period, as well as a NATO &quot;over-the-horizon&quot; force which remained on standby, ready to deploy if necessary. NATO is now considering how it might be able to support the parliamentary elections due to be held in spring 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.2/1">The provision of military training and other military services is not, in general, subject to export control.

	<p pid="a.166.2/2">In general, individuals carrying out military services will be subject to the national law of the country in which they are carrying out such activities.

For example, besides the advice in planning policy guidance note 15 on the reuse of historic buildings, planning policy statement 7, <i>Sustainable Development in Rural Areas</i>, encourages diversification and reuse of suitable existing buildings in the countryside, while recognising the need to preserve those of architectural and historic interest or which contribute to local character.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.8/1">The Working Time Directive for mobile workers applies only to operations covered by the EU drivers' hours rules in Regulation 3820/85. This regulation excludes from its scope vehicles with a maximum laden weight below 3.5 tonnes, and &quot;specialised breakdown vehicles&quot;. This means that many drivers of breakdown vehicles will not be covered by the directive for mobile workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/2">There is nothing in the Road Transport (Working Time) Directive (2002/15/EC) or in our draft regulations that specifically refer to emergencies; but we have published some advice in our draft guidance for industry. Employers must schedule work in such a way that workers are able to comply with these regulations. However, provided road safety is not jeopardised, and to enable the worker to reach a suitable stopping place, the mobile worker may depart from these rules to the extent necessary to ensure the safety of persons, the vehicle or of its load.</p>

It is not possible, therefore, to drive a vehicle for 59 hours over eight consecutive weeks. However, under new regulations that come into force in March 2005, drivers may work up to 60 hours a week as long as their working time does not exceed an average 48 hours a week, over the reference period.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.5/1">Since the publication of the National Languages Strategy in December 2002, we have made much progress with promoting all modern foreign languages, not just French and German, in both primary and secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.5/2">Nineteen local education authorities have taken up key stage 2 language pathfinder roles to develop ways of delivering primary languages; we are consulting on a draft framework for the teaching and learning of languages at key stage 2; we have recently committed &pound;5 million to support primary language learning in 2005&ndash;06; and by the end of this year will have trained well over 1,000 new teachers with a modern foreign language specialism.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.5/3">The department has recently published research showing that the number of primary schools offering languages to their pupils has increased from 20 per cent in 2000 to 44 per cent in 2002&ndash;03. We intend to repeat this research in future years to monitor the extent of schools' take-up of foreign language learning and to gauge the progress towards our end-of-the-decade commitment that every pupil throughout key stage 2 will have the opportunity to study a language. Ofsted will continue to play a role in monitoring the quality of schools' language learning provision in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.5/4">A framework to support the teaching, planning and learning of modern foreign languages at key stage 3 was introduced into schools in 2003, and is already being used widely. A new voluntary assessment scheme to recognise and accredit individuals' language skills is currently being piloted in three languages and will be made available to all schools in eight languages from September 2005. We are also seeking to increase the range of vocational and academic options that are available to young people who wish to learn a language at key stage 4.</p>

We are also funding continuing professional development courses to raise teachers' confidence in this sphere. We do not propose to make extra or ring-fenced funding available for such experiences but believe that increased overall funding and longer-term budgets for schools will make them even better placed to plan according to local needs.

	<p pid="a.177.2/1">The main risk on a petrol station forecourt is the spillage of petrol while dispensing it into a vehicle or container. Using a mobile phone while carrying out the activity increases the risk, as this may be a distraction to the motorist. The options available for guidance range from offering no advice on the possible hazards of using a mobile phone through to the complete prohibition of mobile phone use anywhere on the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/2">Thus, the joint HSE/local authorities co-ordinators of regulatory services guidance adopts a proportionate approach. It mentions that operating a mobile phone while dispensing petrol into a vehicle or container is a distraction, which increases the risk of petrol spillage. The risk of a spillage may be fairy low, but it is reasonably practicable and sensible to avoid it. The guidance makes it clear that mobile phones can be used on other parts of the site.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">The fee levels to be set by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport under the terms of the Licensing Act 2003 have not been finalised. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-04">4 November</phrase>, we announced the publication of a consultation on fee levels. We welcome the views of sports clubs as part of that public consultation, which ends on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-23">23 December</phrase>. All responses will be carefully considered before the fees are finalised. The proposal in that consultation is that fee levels to be paid by an individual club for the grant of a club premises certificate and the annual charge payable by a club holding such a certificate will depend on its non-domestic rateable value. The proposed fees for grant of a certificate range between &pound;80 and &pound;500 and annual charges between &pound;40 and &pound;225. These fee levels have been proposed to ensure that licensing authorities are able to recover fully their costs of administration, inspection and enforcement under the terms of the Act and no more. It would be wrong for these costs to fall on the taxpayer and the Government made it clear throughout the parliamentary stages of the Licensing Bill that it would not be appropriate for the consumption of alcohol to be subsidised.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.2/1">It was announced on the <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September 2004</phrase> changes to the individual licensing system for controlling cormorants.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">The main policy change is to abandon the strategy of shooting a small number of cormorants to reinforce non-lethal scaring. Licences will now allow fisheries managers to reduce the numbers of cormorants at a site as well as to aid scaring. A revised licensing system will make it simpler to apply for licences to kill cormorants where serious damage is occurring or is likely to occur. The objective of the new licensing policy is not to reduce the cormorant population but to reduce damage caused by cormorants while protecting the conservation state of the cormorant population.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/3">Defra will continue to grant licences to kill cormorants on a case-by-case basis to solve specific problems at fisheries and non-lethal solutions will have to have been considered first. However, the number of licences issued is likely to increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/4">Modelling from the Central Science Laboratory suggests the cormorant population is likely to reduce a little but stabilise well above its historic level. Its reports have explored the limits within which the licensing system may operate without risking the conservation status of the cormorant population. They do not recommend levels of population reduction. To further safeguard the conservation of cormorants we will monitor the national population and if necessary reduce or stop the granting of licences should the population not respond in the way we predict. There are no plans for any further changes in this policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.0/1">Countryside Stewardship Scheme agreement holders who have reduced production as a result of their joining the scheme were entitled to claim under the single payment scheme (SPS) hardship provisions, where this has affected their entitlement based on the SPS reference period.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/2">From next year, stewardship options which involve reduced stocking rates or reduced cropped area will no longer lead to a reduction of subsidy payments. We will therefore be reviewing calculation of the income forgone elements of Stewardship payment rates to remove any payment for loss of subsidy, to avoid double funding.</p>
