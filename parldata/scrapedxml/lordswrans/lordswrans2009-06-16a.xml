To ensure continued UK food security, our food supply must be reliable and resilient to shocks and crises, and ensuring food security must sit alongside other priorities such as tackling climate change and securing a healthy natural environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/3">Rather than introduce self-sufficiency measures, the Government will continue to work towards radical reform of the CAP in order to enhance the integration of the single market and contribute to the food security of all member states. This will reduce the costs of food for consumers, making trade less distorting and more sustainable; with substantial reductions in the cost to taxpayers.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">Government Ministers recognise that the tariff classification of mobility scooters continues to cause serious concern for both importers and end users of the products. The work to pursue a resolution is being co-ordinated by officials from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). HMRC has met with representatives from the British Healthcare Trade Association (BHTA) and other interested parties as well as officials from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) to discuss the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">Tariff classification matters fall within the competence of the European Community which has set an import duty of 10 per cent for these vehicles. It is the European Commission's (EC) role to ensure uniform treatment of the same goods by agreeing a common EU position and then presenting that unified view. The UK, via officials from HMRC, has made representations to the Commission to have the classification of mobility scooters referred back to the World Customs Organisation. The EC has declined on the basis that current guidelines provide uniformity of classification. In this context it is important to remember that classification experts, both at the European and the international levels, are not influenced by duty rates. The EC has agreed to consider the introduction of duty-free treatment or a reduced rate of customs duty for mobility scooters. In connection with this the EC has asked member states to respond to a UK request for information about any national production. The existence of production in the EU will influence the decision about any future duty reduction. Eight out of the 27 member states have responded so far with some production identified in Germany.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">In a separate development, a Dutch national court has ruled that a mobility scooter should be classified as an invalid carriage at 0 per cent duty. There was some discussion about this ruling at the European Customs Code Committee in September 2008. The EC has now advised HMRC that a draft regulation to confirm the classification of mobility scooters will be presented for discussion and possibly for voting at the next meeting in July 09.</p>

We recognise that moving from a largely unregulated environment into systematic medicines regulation represents a significant challenge for parts of the over-the-counter herbal medicines sector. Accordingly, the MHRA has been running a programme to manage the regulatory impact of the directive. Initiatives have included provision of additional national guidance, workshops and regular dialogue with the industry's Herbal Forum. The MHRA also provides the opportunity for individual companies seeking to register products under the scheme to be given regulatory and scientific advice. The MHRA has no plans to end this advice service, however, our expectation is that, as with any such new scheme, with growing experience, more companies will become confident in operating under these regulatory arrangements.</p>

It is important to stress that the blood services in the United Kingdom (UK) have not been found to be similarly at fault. Payments are therefore being made in very different, specific circumstances in Ireland that do not apply in the UK.</p>

Certain expenses that they claim, in particular the expense allowance for the costs of overnight accommodation away from their home to enable them to carry out their parliamentary duties, are exempt from tax under specific legislation introduced in 1984 and are therefore not required to be reported to HMRC. Other expense payments are subject to the usual rules on the taxation of employment income. A deduction can then be claimed, again according to the usual tax rules, for expenses which MPs incur wholly, exclusively and necessarily whilst performing their duties as an MP, or for expenses which they have to incur on travelling whilst performing those duties. HMRC updates its guidance to MPs at the start of each new Parliament.</p>

It is on the basis of findings like these that we have given the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) and the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) challenging remits to help develop a world-class teaching profession through improved ITT and CPD provision for school teachers and leaders. These remits include the development and implementation of the new Masters in teaching and learning for teachers and development of better arrangements for the collaborative professional development of the school workforce delivered through clusters.
