	<p pid="a.121.2/1">The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group discussed developments in Fiji at its meeting in London on <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State represented the United Kingdom. The group welcomed the holding of broadly free and fair elections in Fiji in August and September 2001. In recognition of this and the fact that the Fiji Government were now addressing the current uncertainty over their own constitutionality in a responsible manner, the group decided that the conditions were now right to readmit Fiji to the councils of the Commonwealth. However, in view of the remaining uncertainty over the government's constitutionality, the group also decided that Fiji should remain on its agenda and that the Secretary General's Special Envoy, Justice Pius Langa of South Africa, should remain engaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">In view of this, we decided on <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase> to lift the targeted package of measures that the then Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/718" name="John Battle">my honourable friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr Battle)</phrase> announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-21">21 July 2000</phrase>. We will once again consider applications for funding for small projects from the Fiji Government in the areas of good governance, human rights, conflict prevention and the environment. We have also ended our blanket ban on joint military exercises and visits to Fiji by Royal Navy ships. Possible co-operation in this area will be considered on a case-by-case basis. And in keeping with national and EU criteria, we will continue not to issue export licences for military or security equipment where there is a clear risk that it will be used for internal repression. We will not hesitate to reimpose these measures, and even consider extending their scope, in the event that the Government of Fiji fail to meet their constitutional obligations to all of Fiji's citizens.</p>

The review will be undertaken by officials from the Forestry Commission, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury.

	<p pid="a.123.0/1">In January 2001 the State Veterinary Service (SVS) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food comprised a Veterinary Policy Unit together with the SVS Field Service. Both were under the command of the Chief Veterinary Officer. The Veterinary Policy Unit, located at Page Street Headquarters in London and with outstationed wildlife units in the West Country, liaised with HQ units in Edinburgh and Cardiff. The SVS Field Service comprised HQ in Page Street, London and a network of five regional and 23 divisional animal health offices throughout Great Britain. The SVS became part of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) with the creation of Defra in June 2001. In July 2001 the National Scrapie Administrative Centre was launched at Worcester as part of the SVS Field Service.</p>

The SVS Field Service has transferred to the command of the Director General of Operations and Service Delivery. The structure of the SVS Field Service is currently the same as in July 2001 but a new animal health divisional office is being created at Newcastle. This will bring the total number of animal health divisions to 24.</p>
