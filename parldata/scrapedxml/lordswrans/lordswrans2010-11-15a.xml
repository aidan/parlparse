As a consequence, MMR vaccine uptake rates continue to rise. Provisional data for April-June 2010 published by the Health Protection Agency show 88.3 per cent of children in England had received the first MMR dose by their second birthday, an increase of about five percentage points over the preceding two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.0/3">The objective of the MMR immunisation programme is to provide two doses of MMR vaccine at appropriate intervals for all eligible individuals. These doses are routinely offered at ages of around 13 months and between three years four months and five years old. Children who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated remain eligible to receive two doses of MMR vaccine at a later age.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.6/1">In respect of the financial year 2007-08, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) received 244 returns from local authorities containing a total of 301,809 records of payments of housing benefit paid directly to landlords. Details of these payments, along with 45,257 returns made in 2008-09, were made available to HMRC compliance staff for the purposes of risk assessment and, where appropriate, some form of compliance intervention. HMRC maintains a record of formal compliance interventions but the record does not, in every case, contain details of which pieces of information from third parties (such as local authorities) were used during the intervention. It is not therefore possible to give an answer to this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.6/2">HMRC records do, however, show a number of cases where detail of housing benefit paid was the main piece of third-party information used during an intervention. For 2008-09 (the year when it is most likely that 2007-08 information was used), HMRC settled 202 income tax interventions which totalled &#163;972,869 in additional tax, although not all the additional tax in these interventions was attributable to housing benefit payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.0/1">To live within the spending review settlement we will need to secure a reduction in unit costs and we recognise therefore that schools, colleges and other training providers will have to make challenging but, I believe, achievable efficiency savings. We will provide advice to support schools and colleges to help them identify how efficiencies can be made. There is much good practice on better procurement, better use of administrative resources and more efficient use of teaching resources. However, we do not want to be prescriptive and it will be for schools and colleges to identify for themselves how to deliver the necessary efficiency measures. Furthermore, we have already taken steps to reduce the inefficiency in the way that 16-19 institutions are funded by introducing a simplified funding system and ensuring that funding follows the learner.</p>
