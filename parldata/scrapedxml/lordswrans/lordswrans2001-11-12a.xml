	<p pid="a.54.3/1">The situation in Sierra Leone has improved beyond all expectations since our original intervention in May 2000. Significant challenges remain, but the prospects for peace are now better than at any time since the conflict began. Over 20,000 combatants have disarmed and handed over 3,115 handguns, 11,883 assault weapons, 709 group or crew-served weapons and 518,340 rounds of ammunition since May 2001: 10,800 of these weapons have been destroyed to date. The rebel leadership has renounced violence in favour of transforming the RUF into a political party ahead of elections announced for <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-14">14 May 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/2">The UK's engagement, in support of the United Nations, together with that of regional leaders including President Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Konare of Mali, has underpinned the recent progress in the peace process. But the Government of Sierra Leone will need the continued support of the international community to enable them to consolidate the peace and begin to rebuild the country's shattered institutions and infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/3">The Government of Sierra Leone have not, so far, had to use their forces to free up territory previously held by the rebels. The government are gradually extending their authority throughout their territory as disarmament progresses: the Sierra Leone police are now present in the nine of Sierra Leone's 13 districts&mdash;constituting over 70 per cent of the country&mdash;that are officially recognised as disarmed. We expect them to have gained full control over the whole of their territory once disarmament has been completed in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/4">The main diamond-producing area of Kono was one of the first to demobilise. But a sizable presence of RUF ex-combatants remains in the diamond producing areas, which are beginning to come under government control.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/5">UNAMSIL has deployed troops throughout Sierra Leone. Its function is set out in its mandate authorised under Security Council Resolution 1270 (1999) of <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-22">22 October 1999</phrase>, amended by Security Council Resolution 1289 (2000) of <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-07">7 February 2000</phrase>. Its main objectives are to assist the Government of Sierra Leone to extend their authority, restore law and order and stabilise the situation progressively throughout the country, and to help to promote a political process towards disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration and the holding, in due course, of free and fair elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/6">Spontaneous returns make it hard to determine a precise figure of displaced persons who have returned to their original homes. UNHCR records indicate that 26,000 resettled between April and June 2001, and plans are in hand to resettle another 18,000 from December 2001. Another 120,000 internally displaced persons now in camps in Sierra Leone await resettlement, and a further 80,000 are being accommodated in host communities. Regionally, Guinea is hosting about 109,500 Sierra Leonean refugees, Liberia 70,000, the Gambia 7,630 and an estimated 9,000 Sierra Leonean nationals are in other West African countries awaiting repatriation.</p>

The Department of Health has produced a leaflet, NHS Funded Nursing Care in Nursing Homes&mdash;What it means for you, a guide for people living in or going into nursing homes, their families and their carers to coincide with the implementation of free nursing care for those funding their own care from <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October</phrase>. Primary care trusts, health authorities and councils are distributing these to nursing homes, residents, their families and carers. National Health Service nurses will also have the opportunity to explain the scheme face-to-face when individual determinations of the registered nursing care contribution are carried out. The public can also obtain information from NHS Direct and, in the south-west of England, from Care Direct.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.8/1">The abolition of the Welsh Sunday opening polls requires the repeal of Sections 67 and 68 of, and Schedule 8 to, the Licensing Act 1964. Polls only need to be held in 2003 if 500 electors in any Welsh district requisition one. It has been the policy of successive governments to abolish these polls and we have indicated our readiness to do so as part of the general reform and modernisation of alcohol licensing law. However, as it was not possible to include a licensing reform Bill in the legislative programme announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-20">20 June</phrase> for this Session of Parliament, it may not be possible to abolish the polls by means of primary legislation before they are next due in 2003. The Government are therefore presently considering whether or not it would be lawful and appropriate to amend the law by means of a regulatory reform order under the terms of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. However, no final decision has yet been made as to whether to seek such an order.</p>

Checks at BIPs on legally presented consignments identify and prevent import of some 1,400 consignments a year (2.7 per cent of total consignments presented) that do not conform with Community requirements. DEFRA and the appropriate enforcement bodies are looking at the control measures to improve our ability to detect and prevent illegal imports of animal products outside BIPs. Amendments have been made to our national legislation to make it easier for local authorities to act when illegally imported animal products are found. Amendments to national legislation to provide enforcement authorities with wider powers to stop and inspect commercial consignments and personal baggage to reduce the risk of animal products being imported illegally are also being considered.</p>
