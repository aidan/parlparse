Committee Room G also has provision for sound amplification. Refurbishment is planned for Committee Rooms 3A and 4B, and permanent sound systems will then be provided. The Moses Room acoustics have been studied by the BBC and modifications have been made in accordance with its recommendations. It is unlikely that further improvements can be achieved there.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/2">The other House of Lords' meeting rooms in the Palace do not have sound systems installed. Most of the rooms are small and do not appear to need them. However, Peers may, at any time, contact Mr Robert Jelley (extension 6049) to request the services of Westminster Sound in providing sound raising for specific meetings.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.2/1">The administration of appeals under Part I of the Act will be undertaken by the Planning Inspectorate whose inspectors will be appointed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to determine appeals, unless the Secretary of State chooses to do so herself. Posts as access inspectors will be offered on both a full-time and part-time basis. At this stage we do not know how many appeals under Section 11 there wil be but we estimate that around 50 inspectors will be needed initially. These are working assumptions and may be amended in the light of experience. All inspectors will receive full training but the details have yet to be finalised.</p>

We recognise that the computer systems used by some local authorties limit their ability to apply different rent changes to different properties next April. I am advising those authorities that for 2002-03 they should apply the average percentage rent change suggested in our restructuring proposals for their stock to all of their rents except where this might involve breaches of the RPI + 0.5 per cent + &pound;2 limit, or the maximum rents announced in my Answer on <phrase class="date" code="">26 November</phrase>, (Official Report, WA 10-12).

	<p pid="a.97.8/3">Reintegration panels are responsible for co-ordinating services for excluded pupils. They must draw up an individual reintegration plan for each excluded child. This plan should be in place within a month of the governors upholding the exclusion and it is reviewed on a monthly basis. It should include a target date for return to school, once the school to which the child will return has been identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/1">The London Heart Hospital was acquired by the National Health Service taking advantage of a short-term commercial opportunity which existed earlier in the year as the owners sought to dispose of the hospital, which was making significant financial losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/2">An option to lease the hospital was initially explored. However, it was understood that the parent company was on the verge of placing the hospital into administration. A judgment was made that an outright purchase represented both the best value for the NHS and the only secure way to obtain the continuing use of the facilities as a hospital available to the NHS in the short time-frame apparent before administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/3">Therefore, the opportunity was taken to significantly increase cardiac and cardiology capacity in London and the South East in a state of the art hospital which was rebuilt and equipped in 1998, and at a purchase price below the district valuer's valuation. Increasing capacity in this way provides further facilities to reduce waiting lists in the NHS. It also provides patient care in a modern hospital with outstanding patient facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/4">The hospital has been operational as a NHS facility since <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> when services in the Middlesex Hospital moved to the Heart Hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/5">Sufficient evidence was gathered in the time available prior to purchase, consistent with the exceptional circumstances surrounding the opportunity for acquisition, which demonstrated the benefits of a speedy and cost-efficient purchase for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/6">As a multi-site trust, University College London Hospital is accustomed to making arrangements to ensure the safety of patients who require the care of more than one clinical speciality. The safety of patients who require the care of more than one clinical speciality. The safety of patients at all its sites is the trust's highest priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/7">Prior to the transfer of cardiac services from the Middlesex Hospital site to the Heart Hospital site, revised protocols were developed to continue to provide non-cardiac patients with acccess to specialist cardiological care. A coronary care unit remains on the University College Hospital site and is attended daily by a consultant cardiologist.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/8">Arrangements were also put in place for non-cardiac specialist clinical staff to contribute to the care of those patients at the Heart Hospital where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/9">The critical care facility at the Heart Hospital is closely allied to the other critical care facilities in the trust and shares common clinical practices and rotates staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/10">The NHS acquisition of the Heart Hospital included the entire asset register. This included a number of works of art. There were 183 items and they were collectively valued on the register at &pound;76,826. All are still at the hospital. There are no plans to move them.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/11">The Heart Hospital has three cardiac catheter laboratories&mdash;two monoplanes and one biplane. The biplane allows two views of the heart at right angles to be taken simultaneously, and is used for more complex diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. These procedures are commonly performed on congenital heart disease patients, but can also be advantageous for use in electrophysiology patients. Although the Heart Hospital, since its acquisition by the NHS, does not treat paediatric patients, it has a large congenital heart disease workload&mdash;which it is planned to extend&mdash;and also undertakes electrophysiology work. The biplane laboratory can also be used for undertaking routine cardiology procedures. The laboratory in which the biplane is situated will therefore be in constant use once the Heart Hospital is working to its full capacity.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.0/1">The Government have not commissioned research into the costs to the community of autism. The only published study in this area is The Economic Impact of Autism in Britain by Jarbrink and Knapp, sponsored by the Mental Health Foundation and the Shirley Foundation. Their paper suggests that the average additional cost per person with autism over a lifetime might be &pound;2.4 million&mdash;the bulk of this being for living support and day activities. Statutory support for adults with autism comes predominantly from mental health and learning disability services. The total cost of these services in 1999-2000 was approximately &pound;4,250 million and &pound;3,000 million respectively. The proportion of each attributable to autism is not separately identified.</p>

They are also strongly encouraged to report all suspected ADRs which occur in children, regardless of whether the drug is Xblack triangle&quot; or established. This includes any suspected ADRs associated with childhood vaccines. The guidance specifically mentions delayed effects to medicines that may manifest months or years after exposure and asks that any suspicion of such an association be reported. Guidance is included in the British National Formulary distributed to health professionals twice yearly and in the United Kingdom Health Department's memorandum Immunisation against Infectious Disease which is supplied to health professionals involved in immunisation. Guidance is also given on the Medicines Control Agency website at <a href="http://www.mca.gov.uk">www.mca.gov.uk</a>. No specific guidance has been given on reporting suspected cases of autism associated with vaccines and it is the responsibility of individual reporters to use their clinical judgement in reporting if they suspect there is an association between an adverse event and any medicine given.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.8/1">The responsibility for setting eligibility criteria for continuing National Health Service healthcare rests with local health authorites, working closely with their local councils. Health service local authority circulars HSC 2001/015: LAC (2001)18 on continuing care, issued in June 2001, copies of which are available in the Library, listed the key issues that health authorities should pay attention to when establishing continuing NHS healthcare criteria. A need for continuing NHS healthcare may be indicated where the nature, complexity, intensity or unpredictability of the individual's healthcare needs (and any combination of these needs) requires regular supervision by a consultant, palliative care, therapy or other NHS member of the team.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.8/2">The local conditions or criteria for continuing NHS healthcare may differ from the highest band of free nursing care because they may include services other than nursing care, whereas the highest band of free nursing care only covers nursing needs that the registered nurse contribution tool picks up following the assessment process.</p>
