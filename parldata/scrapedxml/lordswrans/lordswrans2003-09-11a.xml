The Government have considered the committee's report with great care, and the Prime Minister would like to place on record his thanks to the committee for its thorough consideration of these issues. The Prime Minister is pleased to be able to announce the Government accept the majority of the recommendations. Our response to the main recommendations is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.138.11/2" class="indent">Independent Ethics Adviser&mdash;the Government agree to the appointment of an independent adviser to provide Ministers and Permanent Secretaries with an additional source of professional advice as required on the handling of complex financial issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.11/6" class="indent">Appointments&mdash;the response makes clear that the Government are committed to maintaining a permanent and impartial Civil Service where selection is made on merit on the basis of fair and open competition. It also acknowledges the important role of the Civil Service Commissioners in the recruitment processes and in upholding the core values of the Civil Service. The response commits the Government to discussions with the Civil Service Commissioners to consider whether the different approaches to Civil Service and public appointments continue to be justified.</p>

Therefore potential claims of unlawful discrimination which fall within the scope of the directive will be subject to the revised provisions&mdash;such as the amended definition of indirect discrimination, the new statutory definition of harassment (which corresponds to the existing case law definition), the new definition of &quot;genuine occupational requirement&quot;, the repeal of some provisions which are contrary to the principle of equal treatment (as defined in the directive)&mdash;whereas claims which fall outside the scope of the directive will be subject to the Act's original provisions.</p>

The inclusion of religiously aggravated offences is necessary and logical, to prevent anomalies in the protection offered to different groups. The Government will keep under review whether any further extensions should be made in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.2/1">Primary responsibility for controlling the spread of ragwort lies with the occupier of the land. A local authority has clear responsibility as an occupier if the authority owns the land or has responsibility for it. Local authorities also have a positive role to play in the control of ragwort, for example, by active weed control alongside rural roads and upon any other land for which they may be responsible. They may also play a part in publicising the threat that the weed poses to livestock and in particular to horses.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">Common ragwort is one of five injurious weeds specified in the Weeds Act 1959. The Act permits the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to serve notice on any occupier of land to take action to prevent injurious weeds from spreading. An occupier who unreasonably fails to comply with the notice will be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine on conviction.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">The Ragwort Control Bill, which will shortly be presented to the House, provides for a code of practice to strengthen enforcement of the Act by making it clear what should be done to clear ragwort when that is necessary. The code will also be admissible in evidence in enforcement proceedings under the Weeds Act.</p>
