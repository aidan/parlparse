	<p pid="a.131.2/2">Decisions on broadcast programme standards are a matter for Ofcom to determine independently of government, according to the provisions of the Broadcasting and Communications Acts. Under Section 2.4 of Ofcom's broadcasting code which applies to all broadcasters, programmes must not include material which, taking into account the context, condones or glamorises violent, dangerous or seriously anti-social behaviour and is likely to encourage others to copy such behaviour. This has been in place since July 2005. Ofcom also periodically commissions research which informs the development and interpretation of its code.</p>

Following the arrest of party leaders, political activists, members of civil society and human rights defenders on 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January</phrase>, we summoned the Nepalese Ambassador to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to explain his government's actions. My honourable friend, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister of State, Dr Howells, urged the Government of Nepal to release all of the political activists detained in the most recent round up of arrests.

	<p pid="a.134.6/6">The UK has made a number of representations to the Government of Nepal about restrictions on the media and abuses of human rights over the past year. During the UK's presidency of the EU, we led a senior official-level EU troika visit to Nepal in which we raised these issues and publicly urged the government and security forces to respect human rights and to use security legislation with utmost caution. In response to the arrests in January, the EU demarched the Nepalese Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January</phrase> calling for the immediate release of recently detained political prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.5/1">The UN estimates that there are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance in Darfur. The priority is to provide assistance and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/2">Recent assessments indicate a major improvement in the nutrition situation in Darfur with malnutrition rates almost half what they were in the previous year. Likewise, the recent World Health Organisation (WHO) Darfur survey showed mortality rates have, in cases, reduced by two-thirds since August 2004. These improvements are due to the massive scale of the humanitarian response.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/3">The UK is the second largest bilateral humanitarian donor in Darfur (after the US), providing over &pound;96 million since September 2003. These funds have meant that hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people have been provided with shelter, food, water and basic healthcare. However, the situation still remains extremely fragile. We are particularly concerned about the impact that the deteriorating security situation is having on humanitarian operations, especially in south and west Darfur. If aid were reduced because of conflict, insecurity or funding shortages, humanitarian indicators would deteriorate very quickly. We are taking every opportunity to call for an improvement in security and to press for a negotiated political agreement in Abuja.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.6/1">The UK Government support the conservation of tropical rainforests through the work of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The countries with tropical rainforests receiving UK support include Brazil, Indonesia, Cambodia, Cameroon and Ghana. The Department for International Development (DfID) spends approximately &pound;19 million a year through its country programmes on forestry, with a view to promoting its contribution to sustainable economic growth and livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/2">The priority is to address the governance and market failures that drive illegal and unsustainable logging of tropical rainforests. The Government do this by working through the G8, the EU and other programmes which help strengthen forest governance and tackle corruption. The UK is also helping to develop markets and incentive-based approaches to pay for and conserve the ecosystem services that rainforests provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/3">This work is carried out in partnership with a wide range of organisations to protect the livelihoods of forest-dependent poor people&mdash;including indigenous people. In Ghana and Cameroon, for example, DfID programmes are strengthening civil society and advocacy groups which support indigenous people to use the policy and regulatory frameworks that secure their rights to forests.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/4">This support to civil society groups helps strengthen demand for accountable and transparent forest governance and policies. In Brazil, DfID has supported the Indigenous People's Demonstration Project to enhance the capacity of indigenous people's organisations to protect their culture and land.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/5">In the Congo Basin region, DfID is supporting civil society strengthening and dialogue between governments, the private sector and NGOs. In Cambodia DfID has supported work on independent forest monitoring carried out by Global Witness. Protecting the rights of indigenous people was central to this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/6">DfID has also funded a study on the impacts of improved forest governance and law enforcement on the livelihoods of the poor, including indigenous people. The Forest People's Programme, which represents the interests of indigenous people, helped to carry out this research.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.1/2" qnum="HL3810">Whether they are reviewing the role of the Tropical Forestry Action Plan and the United Nations Forum on Forests in controlling illegal logging operations; and what further action they propose to take on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.2/1">The Tropical Forestry Action Plan ended in the 1990s. The Department for International Development and other development agencies now contribute to the National Forest Programme Facility, which is hosted by, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations. The facility is supporting 46 developing countries in the development of their forest policies and plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/2">The FAO and the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) have jointly developed guidelines to tackle illegal logging. The commodity agreement governing ITTO, the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA), was renegotiated in January 2006. The new agreement makes provision for tackling illegal logging.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/3">The subject of illegal logging was addressed for the first time during the fifth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) in 2005, based on a paper submitted by the United Kingdom representative on practical actions to combat illegal logging. The future of the UNFF will be discussed at the sixth session in February 2006. The United Kingdom will promote actions to control illegal logging within whatever arrangements follow on from the UNFF.</p>
