	<p pid="a.129.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2" qnum="HL1492">Whether the improvement of performance against the Department for International Development's targets to reduce maternal mortality in Africa will depend more on the training of traditional birth attendants in situ than on increasing staff and skilled attendants within the government health services.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">DfID's performance on reducing maternal mortality in Africa will not depend on training traditional birth attendants (TBAs) at the expense of increasing skilled birth attendants (SBAs). Evidence has shown that TBA training has little demonstrable impact on reducing maternal deaths. However, TBAs can have an important socio-cultural role. There is evidence (e.g. in Egypt) that where they are linked to the formal health system, more women benefit from skilled birth attendance.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">DfID helps strengthen country health systems as a whole, including training health workers, improving the supply of drugs and commodities, infrastructure, planning and financing to ensure effective delivery of reproductive health services.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.5/1">The total sum underpaid, the greatest single underpayment made in 2007, and the greatest single overpayment made in the same year are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/2">I can confirm that all identified under and overpayments of salary that occurred during 2007 have been rectified. Any underpayments are rectified at the earliest opportunity, usually the following month. Overpayments are recovered in accordance with service regulations. Where underpayments would result in hardship, units are able to provide interim payments to individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/3">The majority of the pay errors are due to late or incorrect human input. Error rates will reduce as familiarity with the new system grows. There is no complacency and the MoD acknowledges that all such errors should be eliminated if at all possible.</p>

As an example, the commissioner said in his report that the Scottish Justice Minister has confirmed that outright refusal of an application in Scotland is comparatively rare, because the requesting police forces and the senior officials in her department scrutinise the applications with care before they are submitted for her approval. All applications made to the Secretary of State are scrutinised by officials in the warrants unit within their respective departments to ensure that the statutory requirements have been met. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State personally weighs the issues and may refuse to grant a warrant if in her view the strict requirements of, for example, necessity or proportionality are not met.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">The UK Government agree with the conclusions of the Associate Parliamentary Group (APG) report on the importance of investment in education in southern Sudan, including higher and further education. DfID has made a substantial contribution to the education sector as a whole. We are a major donor to the Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) which has a &pound;23.3 million programme in the education sector. Under this programme 1,200 teachers have been trained and 10 new schools will be built this year. Under the DfID-supported Basic Services Fund 2,000 children have returned to school and 570 additional teachers will be trained in 2008. We share the APG's conclusion on the positive impact of the UNICEF &quot;Go to School&quot; programme and will provide &pound;2 million in support of this in 2008. DfID's &pound;1.5 million British Council programme delivers a variety of vocational education and teacher training schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/2">In support of encouraging skilled Sudanese to return and take up posts in the public sector, we are providing &pound;2 million for training in leadership and management for highly qualified Diaspora returning to take up senior civil service posts. A pre-requisite for encouraging Diaspora to return is a functioning public sector. In recognition of this we also have a &pound;2 million training programme for civil servants in central and local government. DfID also has a strong training component in its justice and police programme, which has delivered management and administrative training to around 600 civil servants.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.0/1">The UK Government have supported work to understand China's importance as a major consumer, importer and exporter of forest products. This has focused on global trends with an emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region, historically the main source of China's imports. There have not been any studies that focus specifically on the Democratic Republic of Congo or Cameroon.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/2">In the Democratic Republic of Congo, none of the 156 registered logging concessions is owned by Chinese companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/3">One of the largest forest holdings in Cameroon, controlling 12 per cent of the total forest area allocated to concessions, is held by Chinese companies. We are working with the Government of Cameroon to ensure transparent and sustainable management of its forest, including in its interactions with foreign forest management companies.</p>
