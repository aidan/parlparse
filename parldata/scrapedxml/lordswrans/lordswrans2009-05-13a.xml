These costs include construction and maintenance costs but do not include grid connection costs (which depend on location and distance from the nearest grid connection point rather than type of generation).

These pilots provide the stability and support necessary for young people to achieve in education, training and employment. In addition, the Children and Young Persons Act extends the right for all care leavers to a personal adviser until the age of 25 if they are in education and training and places a requirement on local authorities to pay a bursary to care leavers who undertake a course of higher education.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.0/1">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has an ongoing programme of initiatives in place to deliver significant sustainability improvements across its estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/2">Defra has implemented a carbon management programme which has enabled it to develop a systematic approach to monitoring and managing its carbon emissions. The department is successfully improving the energy efficiency of its estate by implementing a range of technologies, initiatives and operational improvements. Initiatives which have already been implemented include: voltage regulation technologies, energy efficiency lighting, insulation and draught proofing, biomass, combined heat and power plants and automatic metering (AMR) of utilities. Thermal imaging surveys have also been undertaken at a number of sites and the results will form a programme of works to improve the thermal efficiency of the buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/3">All new build and refurbishment projects undergo sustainability reviews and are designed to achieve BREEAM excellent as standard. Recent projects such as the new office at Alnwick, which is designed to operate as carbon neutral, demonstrate Defra's commitment to deliver sustainable solutions in the design, build and operation of all its developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/4">The Ministry of Justice is taking a number of actions to reduce the use of energy and these have been published in the OGC delivery plan at <a href="http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/Delivery_Plan_Update_">www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/Delivery_Plan_Update_</a> Dec08.pdf.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.3/1">The Government have not carried out such an assessment of all states that have systems of Sharia law, or elements thereof, in place. But all states are bound under the UN charter to promote respect for human rights. All states, including those that practise Sharia, have also voluntarily ratified at least one international human rights treaty under the UN's auspices, and are hence bound by their human rights obligations under the relevant treaties and obliged to submit reports on the measures they have adopted to give effect to the rights in the treaties they have ratified to the relevant treaty monitoring body. These monitoring processes are designed to assess the compatibility of a state's laws and practices with its international human rights obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.3/2">While the Government would not wish to generalise about Sharia, which takes different forms in a number of states, they do have some concerns where Sharia is used to restrict the enjoyment of some human rights and freedoms. We are concerned that women and children can be subject to discrimination in many countries where the principles of Sharia are applied. However, much of this discrimination is based on interpretation, tradition and custom rather than the principles of Sharia itself. Many Muslim states have signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and have committed themselves to eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and we urge them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.3/3">The Government's concern about the violations of these rights worldwide is not confined only to states where Sharia is applied. While we oppose the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, depending on how Sharia is interpreted we have serious concerns about: the broad scope of crimes that are punishable by death, the age at which an individual is eligible to face the death penalty and stoning as a method of execution. The UK, with its EU partners, campaigns against the death penalty, under whatever system of law it is imposed.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.8/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has powers under Section 52 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to require institutions within the further education sector to provide education for young people aged 16 to 19. This power does not apply to schools with sixth forms or academies.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.8/2">Clause 43 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill proposes to replicate the LSC's powers in the 1992 Act for local authorities and through Clause 42 of the Bill, we propose to extend the local authorities' powers also to require a maintained school with a sixth form to provide a named individual aged 16-19, with education. The position with academies is not affected by these proposals. As now, local authorities can ask an academy, including the academy sixth form, to admit a child in accordance with their published admission arrangements. If the academy refuses, the local authority can refer the matter to the Secretary of State who, through provisions in the academy funding agreement, can require the academy to admit the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.8/3">These clauses enable local authorities to support the small number of young people who may be struggling to find a suitable place in learning, to fulfil their duty to participate. This will be particularly important when considering the needs of our more vulnerable groups of young people, although the expectation is that local authorities, as with the LSC, will need to use them only very sparingly, if at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">Guidance provided by the department makes it clear that confidentiality can and should be overridden when it is necessary to prevent significant harm to other people. However, where a patient is judged not to pose a risk to others then he or she has the same right to confidentiality as any other person. Where clinicians have authorised the release of an individual, and consider that this person poses no risk to others at that point in time, there is no basis for informing anyone about previous mental health history. Removing the right to confidentiality for all patients who have suffered from mental illness would have significant human rights implications.</p>
