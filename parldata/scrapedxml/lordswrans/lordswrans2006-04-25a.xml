While it is not currently possible to indicate whether these people have ever been cautioned, charged or convicted previously, 541 have subsequently matched to crimes represented on the National DNA Database, providing the police with key intelligence leads on the possible identity of the offender and assisting crime investigation and detection. The data used for this reply was taken from a &quot;snapshot&quot; of Police National Computer records and is not held by the National DNA Database. It has not been updated since December 2005 and a new set could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Home Office officials are working with colleagues in the Police Information and Technology Organisation (PITO) which is responsible for PNC and with police service staff to develop a process to routinely report this and other statistical information that is held on either NDNAD or PNC. This work is under way and I will write to the noble Baroness as soon as the work has been completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.5/1">Passports are issued in the United Kingdom at the discretion of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, and by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary in overseas posts, both exercising the Royal Prerogative. In practice, passports are issued when the Secretary of State is satisfied as to the identity and British nationality of applicants, in accordance with legislation, except in certain well defined categories, of which Parliament has been informed from time to time. These are: (i) a minor whose journey was known to be contrary to: a court order; the wishes of a parent or other person or authority in whose favour a residence or care order had been made or who had been awarded custody; care and control; or the provisions of Section 25(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 as amended by Section 42 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1963, or Section 56 of the Adoption Act 1976, as amended by the Children Act 1989; (ii) a person for whose arrest a warrant had been issued in the United Kingdom, or a person who was wanted by the United Kingdom police on suspicion of a serious crime; (iii) in very rare cases, a person whose past or proposed activities were so demonstrably undesirable that the grant or continued enjoyment of passport facilities would be contrary to the public interest; and (iv) a person repatriated from abroad at public expense until the debt has been repaid. In addition, the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 makes provision for the Crown Courts to impose travel restriction orders on certain drug trafficking offenders and to confiscate the passports of those who are British Nationals for the period of the travel ban. The courts provide details to the UK Passport Service of those subject to a travel restriction order and any passport application will be refused as long as the order is in force. Applications from individuals in respect of whom a court had notified the UK Passport Service that foreign travel was prohibited as a condition of bail would also be refused.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/1">The latest figures relate to 2003&ndash;04. As pension credit was introduced only half way through that year, estimates should be treated with caution as they are based on only six months of data. It is estimated that between 44 and 51 per cent. of pensioner households are eligible to claim pension credit in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/2" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/3">1. Estimates are given as ranges in order to account for possible biases inherent in estimates from data that are less than perfect. They also take account of the effects of sampling variation.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/4">2. Estimates cover all those aged 60 and over in the private household population of Great Britain. The data source is the Family Resources Survey 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/5">3. For the purposes of this analysis, a pensioner household is defined as either a single person aged at least 60 years old or, if a couple, both will be termed pensioners if one is aged at least 60 years old. This is consistent with both the definition used in &quot;Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-up&quot; publications, and with the fact any individual aged 60 or over is entitled to pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.2/1">The stakeholder advisory group on extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) (SAGE) is sponsored by the Department of Health with funding contributions from the charity Children with Leukaemia and National Grid plc. The aim of SAGE is,</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/2" class="indent">&quot;to bring together stakeholders to identify and explore the implications for a precautionary approach to ELF EMF and make practical recommendations for precautionary measures&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/3">Its terms of reference and ways of working are described on the website <a href="http://www.rkpartnership.co.uk/sage">www.rkpartnership.co.uk/sage</a>. SAGE was set up in response to the National Radiological Protection Board's (now Health Protection Agency's Radiation Protection Division) advice,</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/4" class="indent">&quot;to consider the possible need for further precautionary measures,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/5">in addition to its EMF guidelines (<a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/documents-of-nrpb/abstracts/absd15-2.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/documents&ndash;of&ndash;nrpb/abstracts/absd15-2.htm</a>). SAGE has been running since 2004 and is expected to produce its first report later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/6">The paper by Draper and colleagues was published in June 2005. The Health Protection Agency placed a response statement on its website (<a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk">www.hpa.org.uk</a>) in which it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/7" class="indent">&quot;This large epidemiological study has found higher rates of childhood leukaemia among those born within 600 metres of a power line compared with those born further away. Rates of other types of childhood cancer are not raised. The authors of the study do not regard these findings as establishing a definite causal association between childhood leukaemia and exposures to electromagnetic fields from power lines&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/8">The Draper study was one of many scientific background papers informing SAGE's discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/9">The issue of schools close to power lines is among the topics being considered by SAGE.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.2/1">Bidders for the south-west franchise have been asked to submit proposals that meet the franchise objectives, one of which is to make an improvement in resource efficiency. Bidders are expected to determine the most appropriate method for achieving these goals and, should they recommend changes to operational practices, to demonstrate that their proposal represents value for money and that the risks to implementation have been assessed.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">We are working to ensure that teachers have the knowledge they need to help all young people achieve their full learning potential. In order to be recommended for the award of qualified teacher status, all trainee school teachers must demonstrate understanding of a range of special educational needs and disabilities. They should also know where to seek help, including from special educational needs (SEN) co-ordinators and other services and sources. The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) will be making recommendations shortly on possible new standards for classroom teachers at each stage of their career. These recommendations will follow extensive consultation and should reflect the five outcomes of <i>Every Child Matters</i>, as well as paying due attention to special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">Special educational needs are identified as one of a number of areas for the beginning of a teacher's continuing professional development. From September 2006, the TDA will be funding a two-year project designed to enhance the specialist SEN skills of serving teachers. Initially, this will make a modular professional development course, leading to a postgraduate qualification, available to 100 teachers.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">Under Article 17(1) of the working time directive, member states may derogate from certain limits when, on account of the specific characteristics of the activity concerned, the duration of working time is not measured and/or predetermined.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">This was transposed into Regulation 20 in 1998. There were questions from stakeholders about its practical application as very few workers, if any, perform work that is never measured or predetermined. Regulation 20(2) was an attempt to provide clarification.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/3">Regulation 20(2) is the subject of infraction proceedings brought by the European Commission before the European Court of Justice as wrongly depriving some workers of protection. During the course of the proceedings the European Commission has helpfully clarified that it accepts that these workers may perform some work that is measured provided that the nature of their activity as a whole is such that they decide themselves on the organisation of their working time. Consequently, it has become apparent that Regulation 20(2) is not necessary for the proper implementation of the working time directive and has been deleted.</p>
