	<p pid="b.181.2/1">The rules of the Armed Forces compensation scheme do not prevent an individual placing an award in a personal injury trust. It is for the individual in receipt of an award to decide how he or she wishes to use it. Such an award, whether or not it is placed in a trust fund, does not affect entitlement to either the care component or the mobility component of disability living allowance. In addition, capital in trust funds that derives from payment in compensation for personal injury may be disregarded for the purposes of assessing entitlement to income-related benefits. However, the detailed application of the relevant rules is a matter on which the individual should seek advice from the Department for Work and Pensions or from one of the ex-service organisations which can assist on such matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.182.5/1">Biometric passports&mdash;that is, passports which incorporate a digital facial image or fingerprints, or both&mdash;are being planned by many countries. The EU, for example, has agreed a regulation on the incorporation of both facial image and fingerprints into the EU common format passport. Passports and identity cards fulfil different functions, although identity cards are in some cases accepted as travel documents, as in the case with EU nationals travelling on identity cards issued by their respective member states which are accepted for travel within the EU. (The plans to introduce identity cards in the United Kingdom are not dependent on the development of new technology for passports.) However, because we intend to link the issue of identity cards to the issue of passports, we have given the indicative cost of the two documents together in the regulatory impact assessment for the Identity Cards Bill. Most of the cost will be due to the increased cost of enhanced security features in passports. The regulatory impact assessment explains the relationship between the costs of biometric passports and the costs of identity cards.</p>

	<p pid="b.183.5/1">The current UK passports are machine readable travel documents (MRTDs) and include biometric identifiers that comply with the standards for such documents set out by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The UK Passport Service intends to introduce passports (ePassports) that include a contactless chip that is to contain the same biometric identifiers in a format laid down and agreed by ICAO's New Technology Working Group (NTWG). There is a clear determination for countries to apply the ICAO standards consistently and we are actively participating in activities to ensure this is the case. The interoperability of ePassports has been strongly considered and a number of trials have been held with a further trial expected later this year.</p>

The costs of the central infrastructure related to the verification network have been accounted for elsewhere within the scheme cost estimates and the &pound;584 million average annual running cost estimate published in the RIA makes an allowance for this.</p>

	<p pid="b.184.2/1">United Kingdom Government officials have attended a number of international conferences and trials of biometric-enabled electronic chips in passports in the past two years. These have included trials held in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States of America. Such fora are intended to give those countries planning to issue biometric passports the opportunity to test the passports they have developed and for manufacturers to test their technology. This approach has encouraged manufacturers to develop technology designed to offer both future-proofing to support prospective developments in this field and interoperability between systems. EU member states participating in the biometric visa regulation are awaiting the results of a project run by the French and Belgians. The results of this will inform further developments of biometrics in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.6/1">Information on the number of illegal migrants in the UK, who are either long or short-term economic migrants, in each of the past five years is not available. No government have ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally. By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately, and that remains the case. Although it is impossible to determine accurately how many people are in the UK illegally, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase> the Home Office published a report which included an estimate of the size of the illegal migrant population in the UK in 2001. It should be noted that the report included an estimate, not an accurate or definitive figure. As mentioned in the report, the only method to estimate the size of the unauthorised migrant population in the UK that currently can sensibly be applied is the residual method. As the method relies on data from the Census of the Population undertaken every 10 years, it is not possible to produce an estimate for a more recent year. A copy of the RDS online report 29/05&mdash;<i>Sizing the unauthorised (illegal) migrant population in the United Kingdom in 2001 </i>can be found at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/notes/June-summaries.html">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/notes/June&mdash;summaries.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.189.8/1">All haemophilia patients are now eligible for treatment with recombinant products. Data collected by the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO) indicates that approximately 83 per cent of haemophilia patients who were eligible for treatment in the second year of the rollout were receiving recombinant treatment by December 2004. The 17 per cent not yet recorded as receiving recombinant treatment are those with low usage identified between April 2002 to March 2003, and therefore may be treated infrequently or have not required treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.8/2">This figure is based on the audit data collected for patients who received plasma product identified between April 2002 to March 2003. This is the period that UKHCDO used to help calculate allocations for haemophilia patients for the start of the recombinant roll out.</p>

	<p pid="b.190.8/2">It is important that the affected governments and communities are better prepared for all future crises. The part of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in this effort involves having adequate systems in place to provide early warnings of potential natural disasters. The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) has set up an interim Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning Centre which involves both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.8/3">National contact points have been identified and are managed by the IOC team in Paris. National needs assessments are ongoing and a coherent plan for the final system is due by September this year. It is hoped that the final system will be in place by July 2006. We and other donors such as France, Australia, Japan the United States and the European Commission are awaiting the final design to decide how we might best support them.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.8/4">The UK supports the creation of this system and other disaster risk reduction measures. DfID has also allocated &pound;7.5 million for disaster risk reduction measures to tsunami affected countries. This will include support to community-level work to raise awareness of danger signals from early warning systems and ensure they know how to respond best to protect themselves and their families.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.2/1">The Government do not hold the detailed information requested by the noble Lord. In the early stages of the &quot;Adam&quot; case, the Metropolitan Police (MPS) wrote to educational welfare officers at each of the London boroughs asking for information on black males between the ages of four and seven years who had not turned up for the autumn term. Around 300 possible names were notified to the MPS and further inquiries by individual officers were pursued in respect of 161 boys. Officers found no evidence that any of these boys had come to any harm.</p>

This new policy reflects the change in patterns of tuberculosis in the United Kingdom.</p>
