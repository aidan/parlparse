	<p pid="a.137.5/1">This information is held by the General Medical Council (GMC). They inform us that there was one psychiatrist erased, and one suspended from the Medical Register in 1995, and one suspended and subsequently erased in 1998. Matters relating to a consultant's contract are between the doctor and the National Health Service employer. In cases where consultants are erased from the Medical Register, the contract with the employer becomes void and the doctor is no longer able to practise medicine. In cases of suspension from the GMC register, the consultant is not able to work in the NHS until the suspension is withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/2">It is a contractual requirement that all doctors who work in the NHS are registered with the GMC.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/3">Adverse findings against doctors made by the Professional Conduct Committee and the Committee for Professional Performance are sent to NHS trusts and health authorities in the form of a Health Service Circular. We are currently reviewing the present arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.2/1">The 2000 Report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body has been published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. We are grateful to the Chairman and members of the Review Body for the work they have put into them.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/2">In the Comprehensive Spending Review the Government made it clear that public sector pay settlements would need to be fair and affordable and support budgeted public service improvements. In making their recommendations, the AFPRB have taken into account a number of considerations, including the recruitment, retention and motivation of the Armed Forces and have recommended an increase in basic military salary of 3.3 per cent for all ranks, with the exception of Privates, Lance Corporals, Captains and Lieutenants, who should receive 3.8 per cent. An increase of 1 per cent in X Factor is also recommended. The X Factor, which has not been reviewed for five years, is paid as an addition to basic pay and reflects the differences between conditions of service experienced by members of the Armed Forces over a full career and conditions in civilian life, which cannot be taken directly into account in assessing pay comparability. The graduate starting salary is set at &pound;18,126 per annum. There are also some increases in Additional Pay (eg Flying Pay, Submarine Pay and Hydrographic Pay) and in Longer Separated Service Allowance/Bonus.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/3">These recommendations will fully support the Armed Forces strategic personnel policies, in particular in relation to recruitment and retention, The additional cost to the Defence Budget will be &pound;260 million. This will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/4">The AFPRB's recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.5/2">Letter to Lord Marlesford from the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Mr Peter Nutt, dated <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-15">15 February 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/3">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Lord Whitty, has asked me to reply to your recent parliamentary Question about litter on the M.11 between the A.406 (Junction 4) and the M.25 (Junction 6).</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/4">Our Term Maintenance Contractors are responsible for litter sweeping and clearance on instructions from our agents, who make regular inspections and safety patrols, plus occasional checks at night. While no penalty is payable, payment for the work would not be approved unless it was carried out to the satisfaction of our agents.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/5">Weather and other constraints permitting, the M.11 between Junctions 4 and 6 is scheduled for litter picking and sweeping within the next two weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/6">No exceptional litter problems had been identified recently and no general complaint received about this stretch of motorway, but we do acknowledge that, in spite of our best efforts, during adverse weather conditions or when traffic queues build up, large amounts of litter can accumulate very quickly along any busy motorway.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/7">If you have any further queries on this matter please contact the Highways Agency's Area Manager, Mike Ford, on 01306 878219.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.2/1">No. The Government recognise that sleeping rough is extremely bad for the health and welfare of the individuals concerned and are therefore committed to reducing rough sleeping in England to as near zero as possible or by at least two-thirds by 2002. This commitment is backed up by a budget of nearly &pound;200 million over three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/2">One element of the Government's strategy for tackling rough sleeping is to ensure that there is adequate accommodation available. The most vulnerable rough sleepers, however, will need more than accommodation to help them off the streets. Many will have other, more complex, needs, including drugs or alcohol abuse, and mental health problems, and these must also be addressed. Only then can we help rough sleepers to develop a settled and meaningful lifestyle away from the streets.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">As my right honourable friend the Minister announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February</phrase>, 47 awards of grant totalling &pound;2 million have been made under the Agriculture Development Scheme 1999. A list of the successful projects is given below. The size of individual awards is commercially confidential but they range in value from &pound;5,500 to &pound;100,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">Each application was assessed against the following criteria: the abilities of the proponents to deliver the project, and their financial viability; the requirement for grant to progress the project; the economic difficulty being experienced by the sector targeted, the proportion of primary producers within the sector likely to benefit from the project and the duration of that benefit; the likely benefit to the agri-food economy as a whole; the relevance of the project to the issues facing the sector; value for money; the quality and credibility of the application; and the quality of proposals for disseminating the results of the project to relevant interests.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-02-15a.148.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100331" speakername="Baroness Jay of Paddington" colon=":" colnum="148"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000215/text/00215w03.htm#00215w03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.148.2/1">The 2000 report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which makes recommendations about the pay of the senior civil service, senior military personnel and the judiciary, together with the annual uprating of parliamentary salaries, is being published today. Copies are available from the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/2">The main recommendations of the Review Body are:</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/3" class="indent">an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> of 2.9 per cent in the minimum and maximum values of each of the pay bands for the senior civil service. Within the bands, departments and agencies will determine individual awards on the basis of performance. A further 0.4 per cent of the total senior civil service paybill should be made available to fund additional performance awards for the most senior staff, whose pay has fallen well behind comparable remuneration elsewhere. Promotion to and within the senior civil service should be recognised by a move to a higher pay band and an increase of not less than 10 per cent;</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/4" class="indent">an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> of 3.3 per cent in judicial salaries, with additional increases for seven senior members of the judiciary as a result of changes in the salary structure at those levels in recognition of their increasing responsibility for judicial leadership and the supervision of the judicial system.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/5" class="indent">An increase from <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> of 3.3 per cent in the maxima of the pay ranges within which individual salaries are set for senior military personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/6">The Government have decided to accept these recommendations. Their cost will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/7">Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the increase in pay bands for the senior civil service. Their pay entitlements will therefore increase from <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> by 2.9 per cent.</p>
