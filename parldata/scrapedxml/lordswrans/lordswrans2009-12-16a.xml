	<p pid="a.225.2/2">Detentions operations are absolutely vital when conducting counter-insurgency campaigns. The ability to detain suspect insurgents is essential for operational effectiveness in Afghanistan. Counter-insurgency work is vital to international efforts to bring stability to Afghanistan. The US plays a key role in this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/3">In the case of UK detention operations in Afghanistan, detainees are held in accordance with ISAF guidelines for a maximum of 96 hours and then transferred to the Afghan authorities or released. In exceptional circumstances, and with ministerial authorisation, detention can be extended to allow for gathering intelligence that is vital for the protection of UK forces and Afghan nationals. The UK is clear that all detainees should be treated humanely.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.5/1">BOMBAF Badakhshan is a border management project aimed at developing the capacity of the Government of Afghanistan to facilitate legitimate trade and movement between Afghanistan and Tajikistan, increase revenues through clear and accountable customs taxation, and tackle illegal smuggling (including narcotics). Phase I of the project, which will end on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December 2009</phrase>, has been working to deliver, among other things, three Afghan border check-points (BCPs) in Badakhshan through the provision of infrastructure, equipment and border management training to local Afghan officials. This stage has cost &#8364;5.5 million, funded by the European Commission, United Kingdom and the UN Development Programme (UNDP). UNDP have administered the project. The UK contributed &#163;500,000 towards Phase I.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.5/2">A September 2009 assessment of BOMBAF Badakhshan by the European Commission concluded that the infrastructure, equipment and training supplied through the project had provided a good platform for further development of Afghan Border Police operational capacity in Badakhshan. The report identified the need for further funding to enable the project to continue. We understand that the UNDP are in discussions with potential donors about funding for BOMBAF Phase II.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.5/3">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) commends the work of BOMBAF Badakhshan, which has successfully established three operational BCPs in the province. While these BCPs have increased the Afghan Government's capacity to combat cross-border crime (including narcotic trafficking) to Tajikistan, the FCO recognises the continuing need for investment into border management in Badakhshan. This need must however be considered alongside competing demands for UK resources, and as such there are no current plans to provide further funding for BOMBAF Badakhshan.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.5/4">The UK continues to be a major supporter of the Afghan Government's national drug control strategy, and is spending over &#163;27 million in 2009-10 in support of it. This strategy is a comprehensive approach that balances the need to ensure that there are viable alternatives to poppy for farmers with the need to directly target those involved in the drugs trade.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.0/1">The Food and Environment Research Agency's National Bee Unit (NBU) has been investigating the causes of colony losses in England and Wales over the past two years. The results have shown that the most important risk factor in the mortality or weakening of colonies is deformed wing virus, a virus transmitted by the parasitic varroa mite, clearly indicating failed or unsuccessful treatments of mite infestations. The key results from the investigations into abnormal colony losses will be published on the NBU's website in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.230.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/2"><I>Letter from Jil Matheson, National Statistician, to Lord Laird, dated December 2009.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking (a) what answers are anticipated to the 2011 Census to the proposed ethnic group questions &quot;any other Black/African/Caribbean background&quot; and &quot;any other ethnic group&quot;; (b) what &quot;other ethnic group&quot; other than Arabic was considered; and (c) what percentage of respondents to the 2007 census test described themselves as &quot;Gypsy or Irish traveller&quot;. (HL699)</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/4">(a) We would expect a range of different written responses for those ticking the &quot;Any other Black/African/Caribbean background&quot; box and the &quot;Any other ethnic group&quot; box in the 2011 Census question on ethnic group.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/5">In 2001, for more than eight in 10 (84 per cent) of those in the &quot;Other Black&quot; group, an ethnic group description was specified in the text box on the census form. The majority (63 per cent) specified a &quot;Black British&quot; ethnic identity. A further 13 per cent were coded to a &quot;Black Mixed&quot; group, indicating mixed ethnicity where both or all ethnicities described are from different black groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/6">The main write-in descriptions of the &quot;Other Ethnic group&quot; were Filipino (23 per cent), Japanese (21 per cent), Vietnamese (11 per cent), Arab (11 per cent), Middle Eastern (6 per cent), and North African (4 per cent) although we except most east Asian descriptors to be written in under the &quot;Other Asian&quot; space in 2011 and Arab respondents to use the &quot;Arab&quot; tick-box.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/7">More information about the 2001 &quot;other&quot; groups can be found in our article <I>Who are the &quot;Other&quot; ethnic groups?</I> which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articies/nojournal/other_ethnicgroups.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articies/nojournal/other_ethnicgroups.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/8">(b) With space on the census questionnaire limited to only two new tick boxes, and many more demands for tick-boxes than could be accommodated, ONS developed a set of principles by which requirements for new tick box categories for ethnic groups could be assessed and prioritised. These covered:</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/9">strength of need for information;lack of alternative sources of information;clarity and quality of the information collected and acceptability to respondents; andcomparability with the 2001 Census data.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/10">Particular groups which were identified during the consultation with users and also considered for individual tick boxes were:</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/11">African</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/12">Cornish</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/13">East African Asian</p>

	<p pid="a.230.3/28">Vietnamese</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/29">Detailed information about the prioritisation process and the ethnic groups which were considered together with the scores obtained are available in Annex A of the Information Paper <I>Deciding which tick-boxes to add to the ethnic group question in the 2011 England and Wales Census</I>.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.0/4">(a) The design of the 2011 Census questionnaire, including fonts, text format and page layout, has been subject to extensive methodological research and testing.

The title of the &quot;Mixed/multiple ethnic groups&quot; category in the ethnic group question cannot, therefore, be amended at this stage.</p>

Experience shows that non-respondents to requests for consent are more likely to be from deprived areas, where there is a tendency for children to have higher levels of dental decay. I understand that the number of general anaesthetic required for tooth extractions in Southampton remains unacceptably high with recent figures from 2006 to 2009 showing that approximately 500 children every year need to have decayed teeth removed.

	<p pid="a.240.8/1">An element of the Cabinet Office's overall pay award is allocated to non-consolidated variable pay related to performance. These payments are used to drive high performance and form part of the pay award for members of staff who demonstrate exceptional performance, for example by exceeding targets set or meeting challenging objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.8/2">Non-consolidated variable pay awards are funded from within existing pay bill controls, and have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined targets and, as such, do not add to future pay bill costs.

	<p pid="a.244.0/1">In 2010-11 financial year after efficiency savings, total investment in adult training places delivered through FE colleges and training institutions will increase by 3 per cent to &#163;3.5 billion compared with 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/2">As part of Budget 2009 it was agreed that &#163;340 million efficiency savings would be made from the further education (FE) and skills sector in 2010-11 financial year. The Skills Investment Strategy 2010-11 (November, 2009) sets out how this level of savings can be achieved. &#163;100 million of savings will be achieved by reviewing the funding provided to deliver partners, including the Learning and Skills Improvement Service. The remainder of savings will be achieved from the funding routed through the Skills Funding Agency (which will replace the Learning and Skills Council from April 2010) to FE colleges and training institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/3">In making these savings we have sought to protect front-line services and focus on improving value for money by only buying high quality provision and maximising the contribution toward training from businesses, who are the main beneficiaries of the skills system.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/4">The potential impact of funding changes on FE colleges and training providers and their ability to deliver to priority groups of learners was considered when taking decisions on where savings should be made. At the national level we have ensured that funding is better focussed on provision that will support our priority groups of learners including those with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, individuals out of work and those with a low level of skills in line with our statutory entitlements.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/5">The LSC will now undertake discussions with individual colleges and training institutions to agree funding allocations for the 2010-11 academic year. It is through these discussions that any issues relating to the mix and balance of their provision will be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.3/1">The Management Boards of both Houses have endorsed an Environmental Action Plan and are currently reviewing an environmental policy statement prepared by the Head of Fire Safety and Environment. The policy statement will be considered by the relevant domestic committees in early 2010. Work is also taking place to establish credible baseline figures against which emissions figures can be measured and to identify environmental opportunities across the Parliamentary Estate, including voltage optimisation and energy awareness. This will enable robust long-term environmental targets, including a carbon reduction target, to be set from 2010. Parliament's energy consumption and carbon emissions are already monitored on a monthly basis. In previous years, carbon emissions have risen year-on-year because of increased occupancy of the Parliamentary Estate, IT use and cooling loads, but they appear to be on course to decrease over the financial year 2009-10 for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/2">In the last 18 months, building management systems controlling heating and cooling have been reconfigured; new remote energy meters, kitchen ventilation and lighting controls and energy efficient lighting and movement sensors have been installed; an insulation trial has been initiated as part of the cast iron roofs project; and a feasibility study of the energy supply options has been conducted. On the specific question of temperature, some radiators on the estate have temperature controls but the age of the buildings and the infrastructure make heating a difficult issue. It will be possible to improve the situation through refurbishment of primary and secondary systems over the coming years.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.0/1">The purpose of a bail hearing is for the court to determine whether the circumstances of the case and the defendant's history suggest that the defendant presents such a risk to the course of justice or to the safety of the public as to warrant a remand in custody. This issue is entirely separate from the determination of guilt or innocence, which is for the trial alone. The fact that a defendant who has been remanded in custody is subsequently found not guilty does not mean that the remand decision was wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/2">While the Government believe that bail should be withheld in all appropriate cases, we also believe that no one should be remanded in custody unless the circumstances justify it. Our approach over several years, therefore, has been to provide bail services that allow the courts to make bail the appropriate decision in more cases. These services include the provision of electronic monitoring of defendants on bail as an alternative to custody and the introduction of bail support and accommodation schemes to provide, where possible and where necessary, suitable addresses to which defendants can be bailed and where they can get help to comply with their bail conditions.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-12-16a.252.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="252"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91216w0005.htm#09121659000269">
	<p pid="a.252.2/1">The annual maintenance costs of the elevated sections of the Midland Links motorways vary depending on the maintenance schemes that have been carried out during the year. Maintenance schemes are divided into major and routine categories. The following amounts have been or are due to be spent on the maintenance of the structures of the Midland Links during the current four year period:</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/2">2006-07-&#163;17.5 million;2007-08-&#163;10.5 million;2008-09-&#163;14.5 million; and2009-10-&#163;22.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/3">During this period, the following four major maintenance schemes were carried out. The first three included elements of carriageway surface renewal work:</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/4">Ray Hall Viaduct Deck Refurbishment (2006-07);Bromford Viaduct Deck Refurbishment (2006-07); Bromford Viaduct Resurfacing (2008-09); andRay Hall Viaduct Structural repairs to concrete supports (2006-07-2007-08).</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/5">As the surfacing work extended beyond the elevated sections, it is not possible to identify separate figures for this work for these sections. All four schemes had significant effects on traffic flows on the motorway.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/6">Other schemes included in the annual figures involved works on the support structures beneath the running lanes of the motorway and thus did not affect motorway traffic flows.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/7">As part of the preparation process for all major schemes that have a potential effect on traffic flows on the motorway, the Highways Agency takes into account the level of predicted delays so that they can be minimised. The delay costs for the above schemes have been calculated as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/8">Ray Hall Deck Refurbishment-&#163;2.7 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/9">Bromford Viaduct Deck Refurbishment-&#163;1.51 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/10">Ray Hall Viaduct Structural Repairs-&#163;23.4 million; and</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/11">Bromford Viaduct Resurfacing-&#163;1.52 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/12">The figure of &#163;23.4 million for Ray Hall Viaduct is high because the repairs were to the supports carrying the M6 over the link road from the M6 southbound carriageway to the M5 southbound carriageway. The link road beneath was reduced to one lane for safety reasons, causing unavoidable delays to both M6 southbound traffic and traffic using the link road.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/13">None of the annual figures includes routine maintenance, such as minor resurfacing, lighting and drainage, or winter maintenance-that is, salting. Such works are funded from a regional budget for all motorways and are not separated for Midland Links sections. Routine maintenance is generally carried out overnight to minimise delays to motorway traffic.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.0/1">The Government have committed to rolling out a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) in each police force area by 2011. The Department of Health, Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service work closely together on this programme with advice from the Department for Children, Schools and Families on the specific needs of children and young people where required.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/2">Responsibility for the commissioning of Sexual Assault Referral Centres lies in the partnership of police forces, primary care trusts and local authorities. SARCs can be established to provide services to victims of all ages. Quite often, children who may have been sexually abused may have experienced other forms of abuse and would require a co-ordinated multi-disciplinary and multi-agency approach to their care. SARCs which provide services to children and young people need to take account of national guidance in <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>, clinical guidelines from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and guidelines from the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH).</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/3">The Department of Health, Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) jointly published a guide in October 2009, which sets out the minimum elements essential for providing high quality Sexual Assault Referral Centres for adults and children who are victims of sexual assault. A copy of the guide has been placed in the Library.</p>
