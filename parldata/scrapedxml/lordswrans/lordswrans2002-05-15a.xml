	<p pid="a.41.2/1">We would welcome a discussion of capital punishment at Commonwealth Law Ministers meetings should the occasion arise. But we do not plan to place this issue on the agenda. My right honourable friends firmly reiterate Her Majesty's Government's opposition to the death penalty and urge states to abolish capital punishment in a range of forums, including at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in April this year. It is important, however, to get the message across at the right time and at the right level. Commonwealth Law Ministers meetings consider the development of law in areas where a political consensus already exists across the Commonwealth. This is not yet the case among Commonwealth countries on the issue of capital punishment.</p>

Her Majesty's Government are looking at ways of supporting the implementation of the Malino agreements, though this is unlikely to include international monitoring.

We are determined however that this should be taken as an opportunity to reduce the administrative burdens on the police, and not allow them to be tied in procedural knots which prevent them bringing criminals to justice. We want to ensure that after nearly 20 years PACE is still a useful tool supporting the police and, if changes are needed, we will have no hesitation in making them. Rebo</p>

	<p pid="a.42.6/1">The non-fossil fuel obligation is concerned with electricity generation rather than road fuels. The European directive on mineral oils duties structures requires organic and non-fossil fuels used as road fuels to be taxed at the same rate as the mineral oil for which they are substituting, unless the member state concerned has secured a derogation from the provisions of the directive. The Government promote the development and use of alternative fuels, including non-fossil fuels, where there are sound environmental reasons for doing so; for example, a new duty rate for biodiesel, set at 20p per litre below the rate of ultra-low sulphur petrol, will be introduced from Royal Assent to the Finance Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.2/1">The risk of fraud in the use of the payable order book for the payment of Armed Forces pensions arose from the fact that payable orders were exchanged for cash, and each book contained nine months-worth of pension payments. There have been occasions where payable orders continued to be cashed after a pensioner's death or following the theft of a book.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/2">The payment of pensioners by way of a voucher, or indeed the other alternative method of payment via a bankers automated clearing system transfer, will reduce considerably the scope for such fraud to occur. Unlike the payable order book method of payment, a voucher cannot be exchanged for cash, but has to be paid into a bank account. Each voucher is individually identifiable via an accounting system that can detect the bank account to which a voucher has been paid. As vouchers are forwarded to the pensioner either weekly or monthly, the period during which any potential fraud may take place, should they be lost or stolen, is also reduced. Pensioners may continue to draw cash from Post Offices subject to having an account with certain banks.</p>

The application fee is one of a range of fees payable by private receivership clients where the Public Guardianship Office is involved in the management of their financial affairs.

	<p pid="a.50.3/1">The Government remain committed to reforming this important area of the law. When parliamentary time allows, they will legislate to improve and clarify the decision-making process for those who are unable to make decisions for themselves or who cannot communicate their decisions. In advance of securing parliamentary time, the Government are taking forward a number of initiatives. These include the formation of a consultative forum on mental incapacity. This will help us to develop and implement a shared agenda for improving the lives of people with mental incapacity and their carers.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">The level of fines imposed on Novaya Gazeta is a matter for the Russian courts. However Russia is obliged as a member of the Council of Europe to abide by Article 10 (&quot;Freedom of Expression&quot;) of the European Convention on Human Rights and to respect the OSCE principle of freedom of the press and media. It follows that damages should be proportionate to the offence and should not be used punitively in order to drive a newspaper out of business. We therefore welcome reports that the fines may be reduced following negotiations between the plaintiff, who had sued the newspaper for defamation, and the newspaper's editor.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/2">Her Majesty's Government continue to monitor closely the situation of the media in Russia. Along with our EU partners we have reminded the Russian authorities of the special importance of the independence and plurality of the media. Her Majesty's Government agree with the conclusion of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) at its April session that Russia needs to be more rigorous in promoting fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression and supports PACE's decision to continue monitoring Russia's implementation of its commitments and obligations as a member of the Council of Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.0/1">The Government's veterinary advice is that livestock shows pose a small but significant risk of the transmission of foot and mouth or other notifiable diseases. Faeces, saliva, bedding and unused feed of animals with sub-clinical infection pose a risk of the transmission of disease and the shows licence conditions, developed in full consultation with shows organisers, have been prepared to minimise that risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/2">That is why the shows licence conditions require those who tend animals to wear protective clothing and ask shows organisers to take all reasonable steps to stop others from touching animals or things contaminated with animal products. Animals at shows will be in close proximity to the public. Animals in the countryside will pose a lesser risk; they will tend to move away from walkers. Members of the public walking in the countryside will normally avoid walking in animal faeces and if they do inadvertently become contaminated will take steps to remove it.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/3">The need for biosecurity is keenly appreciated by the majority of show organisers. I am pleased that they are taking a responsible attitude to biosecurity to protect livestock farmers and the wider rural community from another devastating outbreak of animal disease.</p>

This will be in the light of the lessons identified from the handling of the outbreak.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.5/1">International research and more recent statistics contradict the claims made in this paper. A comprehensive review of international research shows that the provision of specialist youth contraceptive services increases the use of contraception without increasing sexual activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2">Research also shows that the most effective strategy for decreasing teenage conception rates is a multifaceted approach of which access to youth specific contraceptive services is a key factor. Our Teenage Pregnancy Strategy encompasses this approach, including helping young people to resist peer pressure to have early sex, improving sex and relationship education and acces to effective services, and involving parents and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/3">Early signs of the strategy's impact are encouraging with figures for 2000 showing a 6.2 per cent reduction from 1998 in both under-18 and under-16 conception rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.5/1">The time-scales set out in the Question reflect the agreed position between the Government and the House of Lords, as expressed in paragraph 9.35 of the Companion to the Standing Orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">In relation to the House of Commons, the majority of committees in that House scrutinise individual departments. This facilitates speedy response since responsibility for the response rests usually with the one department. However, in their response to a Liaison Committee report in another place the Government noted, &quot;The longer and more complex a report and the more it focuses on cross-cutting issues, the greater the need for time to consider and consult.&quot; The Government also drew attention to the fact that, &quot;Departments may not be able, in all circumstances, to meet this [two month] deadline, particularly if a report is complex.&quot; (Cm 4737, paragraphs 31 and 32). House of Lords committees are not departmentally linked and so are intrinsically more likely to undertake complex inquiries. Accordingly, it makes sense to retain the option of a longer response time.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/3">The Government attempt to respond to reports of the Eurpean Union Committee more quickly because the scrutiny reserve requires them to be dealt with swiftly.</p>
