	<p pid="a.25.8/1">Since June 2000, British forces have provided short-term training to Sierra Leone. Some 6,500 members of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) have been given basic infantry skills. The training programmes have gone well, with the SLA demonstrating its ability to strengthen control of government-held areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.8/2">To consolidate the achievements to date, provide more officer/NCO and specialist training and put the SLA in a position to train itself in future, we are planning a further package of training by British teams until September. This will prepare the way for handing over to the International Military Advisory and Training Team (IMATT), announced by the Prime Minister in March 2000, which will take on the continuing training task. Some six countries, including a sizeable British contingent, are expected to be represented in the IMATT. We plan to increase the IMATT's overall size from 90 posts originally envisaged to 126. This reflects a detailed assessment of what will be required to consolidate the excellent work that British forces will have achieved through the Short Term Training Teams. We also plan to maintain an operational Headquarters in Sierra Leone for the rest of the year, and to demonstrate, through periodic exercises, the availability of the over-the-horizon rapid reaction capability. These measures will increase the cost of our training and equipment programme by some &pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.8/3">These further measures demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to help the Government of Sierra Leone and the UN to restore peace and stability throughout Sierra Leone.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">Ministers at the WEU Ministerial Council in Marseille in November 2000 and at the Nice European Council in December 2000 decided to transfer the functions of the WEU Satellite Centre to the EU. This will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase>. The Satellite Centre, based at Torrejon in Spain, is an imagery analysis and training centre: it does not possess its own satellites and does not have subsidiary agencies. In the EU its primary role will be to provide interpretation of satellite and aerial images, acquired from external sources, to the Council of Ministers in support of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Under the EU, as under the WEU, the Satellite Centre is unlikely to have a permanent formal relationship with NATO, but will be able to offer its services to a variety of customers including national governments and international organisations, such as NATO.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.6/3" class="indent">Four Chairs at the Universities of Leicester, Leeds, Queen's--Belfast;</p>

	<p pid="a.27.6/7" class="indent">Lincolnshire and Humberside, Exeter, South Bank (London), Central Lancashire, Westminster, Aberystwyth, Kent, Queen Mary and Westfield College (London), Durham, Bradford, Sheffield, De Montfort, Thames Valley (London), York, Coventry, Paisley, Leeds Metropolitan, Lancaster, East Anglia, John Moores (Liverpool), Warwick, Kingston, Oxford, Northumbria, Liverpool, North London, Ulster (Coleraine), Glasgow, Loughborough, Reading, Portsmouth, Nottingham, Greenwich, Dundee, Newcastle upon Tyne, Salford, St Andrews, Glamorgan; Robert Gordon (Aberdeen). Chairs Ad Personam: Sussex, Kent, Essex, Ulster (Coleraine), Edinburgh, Royal Holloway (London), Glasgow, Lincolnshire and Humberside, Loughborough, Manchester Metropolitan, Manchester (2), Newcastle upon Tyne, Oxford, Plymouth. Jean Monnet European Centres of Excellence: Aberystwyth, Bath, Queen's (Belfast), Birmingham, Sussex, Essex, Kent, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, London School of Economics, Loughborough, Newcastle upon Tyne. To note:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/8" class="indent">(i) Projects are financed by the European Commission for the first three years; they must be taught for at least seven years;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/9" class="indent">(ii) The Jean Monnet subsidy is given to the university (not to the professor); approval of choice of professor must be granted by the European Commission; should a professor leave the university, the Commission would need to approve the successor;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/10" class="indent">(iii) Where universities have more than one chair, these will be in different disciplines--eg Political Sciences, Economics, European Law; in exceptional cases, there may be two Chairs, with different professors, where projects are of a very high standard;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/11" class="indent">(iv) The majority of Jean Monnett Chairs correspond to the setting up of new teaching activities. A Chair Ad Personam allows Universities to allocate chairs to professors and senior lecturers who already devote 100 per cent of their teaching time to European integration issues, and would not therefore meet the criteria of providing new teaching activities. This relates particularly to professors in post at the time of the launch of the Jean Monnet Project in 1990.</p>

Representations made last year by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions led to an agreement by Eurostar to consider carrying recognised assistance dogs such as guide dogs for the blind. They are still considering their position but are in no doubt as to the Government's desire to see assistance dogs allowed on Eurostar trains. The decision whether or not to carry animals is one for the Eurostar Group (Eurostar UK Ltd, SNCF and SNCB) to make collectively. Eurotunnel allows pets to travel with their owners in private cars on its passenger shuttle services through the Channel Tunnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.5/1">The UK's climate change programme that was published in November 2000 sets out full details of the measures the Government are taking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including methane emissions. Many of these measures are aimed at preventing emissions; others are designed to collect and use it as an energy source.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/2">Methane emissions from landfills have been reduced by almost 40 per cent since 1990. Measures like the Landfill Directive and the landfill tax are aimed at cutting the amount of biodegradable waste sent to landfill. There has also been increased collection of landfill gas and its use as an energy source. Since 1990, over 140 landfill gas projects have been contracted under the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation to supply electricity to the National Grid. The Government are continuing their support for the use of landfill gas, and also sewage gas, as energy sources through the Renewables Obligation and exemptions from the climate change levy. Methane emissions from landfill sites are projected to continue to decline to about 70 per cent below 1990 levels in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/3">About one third of methane emissions from operational coal mines is currently captured and a third of this is used for energy recovery. This proportion is however expected to increase over the coming decade. The Government are working with industry to encourage and develop further use of methane from this source.</p>

Numbers of GP principals who will reach the age of 70 in each of the next five years are set out in the table.

Haemophilia centre directors were notified in December 2000 of the batch numbers of the clotting factor and are in the process of identifying the recipients from their patient records. The UK Haemophilia Doctors Association, in consultation with the Department of Health, has agreed a policy of giving all haemophilia patients information about the incident and offering them a choice to know if they or their children received the implicated clotting factor. Counselling and advice to patients will be provided by haemophilia centres. The Government have asked an expert panel to consider as a matter of urgency how such incidents should be managed in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/2">In 1998, the Government took the step of ceasing to use UK plasma in the manufacture of blood products as a precautionary measure against the theoretical risk that vCJD can be transmitted in this way.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/1">I am writing in reply to your Questions laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-12">12 December 2000</phrase>, I apologise for the delay in answering.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/2">You asked Her Majesty's Government the following three questions: for what purpose they allocated &pound;14 million to Zimbabwe in the last financial year; for what purposes the &pound;14 million allocated to Zimbabwe is intended to be used by the Government of Zimbabwe in this financial year; and for what purposes the &pound;14 million allocated to Zimbabwe is intended to be used by the Government of Zimbabwe in the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/3">Total DfID spend in Zimbabwe in 1999-2000 was &pound;14,029,000. This, however, was rounded to produce the &pound;14 million figure. The actual expenditure by major activity in Zimbabwe for the last financial year (1999-2000) and planned expenditure for the current financial year (2000-01) is best explained in the table which I attach at Appendix 1. The allocation for 2001-02 is &pound;12 million. Major spending activities will be broadly similar to those described for the current financial year.</p>
