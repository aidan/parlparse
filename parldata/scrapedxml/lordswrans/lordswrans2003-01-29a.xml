	<p pid="a.158.2/1">Given the integrated nature of the public private partnership (PPP) we have not separately costed individual workstreams within the project. However, we expect the total cost, since the PPP was announced in the Strategic Defence Review, to be around &pound;80 million. This includes not only the splitting of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency into the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and QinetiQ but also the initial options study, the public consultation process, vesting of QinetiQ as a plc and completion of the sale of shares in the company. Of this, approximately &pound;24 million relates to expenditure on IT and infrastructure and approximately &pound;49 million relates to consultancy fees.</p>

However, if they apply for either they are subject to the habitual residence test. If they pass the test they can receive help through the benefit system and apply for social housing immediately. If they fail the test they may appeal against the decision or re-apply at a later date.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">Under the National Assistance Act 1948, local authorities may provide accommodation to British passport holders who do not pass the habitual residence test if they are destitute and have a need for care and attention which is not otherwise available. Such accommodition can only be provided as board and lodging and if the local authority considers it appropriate to do so in all the circumstances. Authorities are not obliged under the Act to provide other services or cash payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/3">Under the Children Act 1989 local authority social services departments are responsible for supporting any children in need, regardless of their country of origin. A returning child with a UK passport would receive help from social services in the same way as any other child. Services are provided to protect the welfare of the child but can be provided to other family members if to do so would meet this primary aim.

	<p pid="a.162.2/1">Research suggests that children in workless households are much more likely to be deprived than children living in a working household. Work is crucial if we are to stop life-cycle effects of poverty and the way it is passed down the generations. Work is not only important for those of working age. Children who grow up in non-working families have an increased risk of being unemployed themselves in adulthood. This is borne out by Gregg and Machin in their 1998 paper: Child Development and Success or Failure in the Youth Labour Market, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/2">However, we recognise that disabled children and their families have additional needs. We are committed to helping severely disabled people with the extra costs they face as a result of their disabilities. This is why from April 2001 the disabled living allowance higher rate mobility component was extended to severely disabled children aged three and four, providing extra help to their families currently worth &pound;39.30 a week.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.2/1">People who are entitled to a winter fuel payment while living in the UK may be able to continue to receive winter fuel payments if they move to another European economic area (EEA) country. Our broad estimate for 2003&ndash;04 is that some 69,000 people could be so entitled at a cost of up to &pound;11 million. This estimate will be revised when we have sufficient data on actual payments made to entitled recipients living in another EEA country.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.0/1">Recent Defra research showed that during the past 30 years house sparrow populations have declined most in South East England and suburban and urban gardens have seen the most marked fall. In contrast, they are thriving in Scotland and Wales, both in urban and rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/2">Starling numbers have declined in both suburban and rural areas. The decline has been greatest in the South and West. Starling breeding patterns have shown a recent improvement but this is least so in urban gardens in the South East.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/3">Defra research has been complemented by work co-ordinated on behalf of the London Biodiversity Partnership (LBP) by the RSPB, London Wildlife Trust, Greater London Authority and London Natural History Society. The survey Where Have All Our Sparrows Gone? ran from <phrase class="date" code="">18 June</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-19">19 July 2002</phrase>. The Mayor of London announced the results of the research on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-14">14 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/4">Over 9,000 people took part in the survey, counting almost 75,000 sparrows and creating the most detailed picture of the city's sparrows to date. The broad picture is of a ring of urban London where sparrows are still quite common, rather fewer sparrows around the outskirts, a definite sparrow hotspot on the eastern side of London but a gap in Inner London where very few sparrows were recorded. The lowest mean number of sparrows was found in the Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/5">Other interesting results include that sparrows were more likely to nest in homes built before 1945 than in newer homes. City farms have continued to attract sparrows, even within the inner boroughs: 96 per cent had sparrows, with an average count of 12 birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/6">Further analysis of the survey results is planned to see how strongly they correlate with various factors in London that might be impacting on sparrows.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.2/1">(a) The estimated costs to industry of complying with the White Paper of February 2001 on a Strategy for a Future Chemicals Policy vary widely. For instance, the recent business impact assessment produced for the Commission estimated the direct cost to industry as ranging between E1.4 billion to E7 billion (&pound;886 million to &pound;4.43 billion) across the EU&mdash;based on certain assumptions and scenarios.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/2">The partial regulatory impact assessment (RIA) prepared by my department suggests that the costs to the UK industry alone might be of the order of &pound;423 million (about E670 million).</p>

The RIA will generate the estimate called for and will be made publicly available.</p>

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority considered egg sharing in 1998 and has kept it under review since then, covering the provision of consent and the preparation of formal agreements between the parties involved in its code of practice. The authority is aware, however, that some people find this a matter of concern and the issue is to be discussed by the authority's ethics committee.

	<p pid="a.172.6/1">I regret that the information contained in the footnote to my reply of <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-02">2 December 2002</phrase> (WA 83) about the number of abortions performed since 1990 under Section 1(1)(d) of the Abortion Act 1967 is incorrect. The footnote should state:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.6/2">&quot;Figures for 1990 to 1997 are of abortions performed at 25 weeks 0 days gestation or more and may include a very small number of abortions performed under sections other than 1(1)(d); figures from 1998 onwards are of abortions under Section 1(1)(d) performed at more than 24 weeks 0 days gestation.&quot;</p>
