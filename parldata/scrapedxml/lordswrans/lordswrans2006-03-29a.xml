	<p pid="a.114.2/3">Improving service provision and care for people with CFS/ME has been an evolving process, while CNCCs and local multi-disciplinary teams have sought to recruit and train staff and find premises in which to see patients.

CFS/ME services will therefore be considered as part of the future local planning of services and PCTs can take steps to ensure the establishment of further CFS/ME services, if there is local need.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.8/1">Flood risk management is a devolved responsibility. Defra has policy responsibility in England, funds most of the Environment Agency's flood-related work and grant-aids individual projects undertaken by local authorities and internal drainage boards. The programme to manage risk is driven by these operating authorities; Defra does not build defences, nor directs the authorities on which specific projects to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/2">Climate change is expected to impact on flood risk through increased storminess and sea level rise and Defra advises the operating authorities on allowances to be made in the design of defences. The department's developing strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management, <i>Making Space for Water</i>, aims to produce revised policy guidance on appraisal by 2007 for those implementing measures to manage flood risk. This updated guidance will take account of the latest research and developments of good practice to ensure that adaptability to climate change through robust and resilient solutions and full consideration of all economic, environmental and social impacts continues to be an integral part of all flood and coastal erosion risk management decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/3">The Government have no specific plans to strengthen protection for farmland. However, operating authorities are encouraged to consider the case for improvement on merit within a strategic catchment-wide approach to reducing flood risk. Such works may be grant-aided by Defra if they meet our criteria. Clearly issues such as value for money, maximising the benefit from public investment and long-term sustainability are key considerations when deciding how to invest taxpayers' money and building ever-higher defences in all places is unlikely to be either sustainable or cost effective. The Government intend to continue to give priority to schemes which have maximum effect in reducing the risk of flooding to people.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.6/1">Further to my Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March</phrase> (<i>WA 118</i>), the departures from the assessment of reasonable time experienced since April 2005 are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/2">Between April 2005 and October 2005, an administrative backlog of entry clearance and family-visitor appeals built up with the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT), totalling approximately 39,000 cases. Those cases experienced a delay in initial processing (acknowledgement and issue of papers to the respondent requesting the appeal bundle) of up to 16 weeks. The administrative backlog was cleared by the end of December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/3">Since October 2005, the initial administrative action on all entry clearance and family visit appeals received by the AIT has been timely. As bundles are received by the AIT from entry clearance and visa officers abroad, appeals are listed for hearing. There are departures from the reasonable timescales for the respondent to provide the AIT with an appeal bundle, but they are not consistent and could not be assessed without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/4">As a result of workload volumes, and the clearance of backlogged cases, the AIT is currently listing entry clearance and family visit appeals at 16 weeks from receipt of the appeal bundle. This represents a departure of between eight and 12 weeks from anticipated reasonable timescales.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/5">For years prior to April 2005 and the implementation of the AIT, appeals were subject to different lodging and handling arrangements. Appeals were all lodged at first instance with the respondent. Timescales comparable to those quoted from April 2005 are not available, but for the period April 2004 to March 2005 an immigration-related appeal (including both in-country and entry clearance cases) took on average 54 weeks from lodging, with the respondent, to decision by an immigration adjudicator.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.3/1">The current system allows women who care for children or dependants to build up state pension entitlement through home responsibilities protection (HRP) which reduces the number of years needed for a full basic state pension. Combined with women's improved labour market position, since its introduction in 1978 HRP has improved women's basic state pension records.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.3/2">However, we know that the current system can produce unequal outcomes for women and carers and women have done less well than men in building entitlement to state pension. The report <i>Women and Pensions: The Evidence</i> provides a useful compendium of evidence that highlights the key influences on the level of women's retirement income, including consideration of the impact of parenthood and family caring responsibilities on pension entitlement.</p>

The Act also contains restrictions on the sources of donations so as to prohibit foreign or anonymous donations to political parties.

	<p pid="a.129.11/1">This Government are taking action to explore the potential impact of undersea noise on the marine environment, particularly marine mammals.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.11/2">For example, Defra commissioned research from the Zoological Society of London in 2004 to look at the feasibility of examining the ears of stranded dead cetaceans to see if they show any signs of damage from marine noise. The results of this research are due to be reported to my department in May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.11/3">The results from this project will advance the objectives of ASCOBANS (Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas). It will also make a valuable contribution towards the UK's cetacean biodiversity action plans, which call for studies into the effects of underwater sounds on cetacean species.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.11/4">In addition, the Department for Trade and Industry is currently funding two projects, which are being carried out by Subacoustech Limited. The first of these is estimating, measuring and controlling the environmental effects of man-made noise on the marine environment. The second project is a feasibility and demonstration study based on active and passive detection of marine mammals.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/1">The UK is not seeking a United Nations Security Council resolution. The president of the United Nations Security Council issued a statement on Somalia on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase> (S/PRST/2006/1 1). This includes the following reference to piracy:</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The Council encourages member states whose naval vessels and military aircraft operate in international waters and airspace adjacent to the coast of Somalia to be vigilant to any incident of piracy therein and to take appropriate action to protect merchant shipping, in particular the transportation of humanitarian aid, against any such act, in line with relevant international law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/3">The full text of the statement can be found on the UN website at <a href="http://www.daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/272/81/PDF/N0627281.pdf?OpenElement">www.daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/272/81/PDF/N0627281.pdf?OpenElement</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/4">The UK is a member of CTF-150, a coalition naval task force whose area of operations includes the waters off the coast of Somalia. CTF-150 vessels operate regular naval patrols in the area, which act as a deterrent to illegal activities. Under international law, these activities are restricted to international waters. In 2006, there have been two incidents of CTF-150 vessels intercepting and capturing pirates off the coast of Somalia.</p>
