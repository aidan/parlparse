The optimum level of spares holdings is determined in conjunction with industry and is periodically refined based on information drawn from actual operating experience. The optimum numbers and locations for spares holdings vary with the nature of operations and are therefore subject to change.</p>

This included a proposed summary maximum penalty of &pound;50,000 as deterrent. A report on this consultation will be published in the near future.</p>

The consultation called for comments on a range of possible regulatory options to address unlawful file-sharing, which has a significant impact on the UK's creative economy and on music and film in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.6/4">The Government are also in active discussion with representatives of the cinema industry in relation to illegal copying of films in cinemas, particularly through the use of camcorders and other devices.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.6/5">On-the-ground enforcement is also a major issue. The Fake Free London campaign aims to reduce the level of counterfeiting and piracy in the run up to the 2012 Olympics. Funded by the Intellectual Property Office, and carried out in partnership with the police, trading standards and the film industry, a series of enforcement operations were carried out in three of the London Olympic boroughs in late 2008.</p>

However, the Government are committed to moving towards more sustainable low-carbon buildings that are more energy and water efficient, and support our wider climate change and sustainability goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">The Government are particularly supportive of the use of green roofs as they increase and facilitate the use of sustainable drainage systems (SUDS). SUDS provide an effective control of rainwater runoff at source, freeing up capacity for drainage in the below-ground system, as well as benefiting water resources through groundwater recharge, rainwater harvesting and helping to improve water quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/3">Those building homes to the sustainability standards set out in the code for sustainable homes may incorporate green roofs to achieve the surface water management, energy efficiency and ecology credits. Financial incentives available to encourage building to the code include the stamp duty land tax exemption for those who reach zero carbon/level 6. In addition, those new developments built on Homes and Communities Agency land or funded through the Government's national housing affordability programme are required to meet level 3 of the code for sustainable homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.2/2">My department published <I>Improving the Effectiveness of Rent Arrears Management: Good Practice Guidance </I>in June 2005.

This guidance is also available on the Communities and Local Government website at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/improvingeffectiveness">www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/improvingeffectiveness</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">On rent arrears, the guidance makes no explicit reference to debit or credit cards. It stresses the value of preventative measures. It advises landlords, among other things, to ensure that arrears repayment arrangements are realistic by undertaking with the tenant a detailed financial assessment of his or her income and expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/4">On rent payment, the guidance advises that landlords should provide a diverse range of methods for tenants to pay their rent. These should be well-publicised, flexible, accessible and convenient to use. Whilst credit and debit cards are included in the range of possible payment methods mentioned, the guidance states that any review of payment methods should consider their effectiveness in minimising arrears.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/5">The Tenant Services Authority (which succeeded the Housing Corporation as the regulator of social housing on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase>) is aware that the use of credit and debit cards to pay rent and rent arrears has raised concerns. The Tenant Services Authority supports flexible approaches to the payment of rent and other charges. For many tenants, for example those who may find travelling difficult, being able to use direct debits or online banking provides convenience and security. The Tenant Services Authority also recognises that it may not be cost-effective for landlords to handle relatively small amounts of cash. It has not issued any guidance to housing associations on this, as it is for each individual association to decide its own approach to managing rent payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.3/1">An industry-wide technology roadmap plotting the pathways to ultra-low-carbon including electric vehicles is being developed and finalised by the New Automotive Innovation Growth Team (NAIGT). Government are supporting the associated research agenda to accelerate their market introduction through the Technology Strategy Board-led low-carbon vehicle innovation platform, worth over &pound;100 million of public sector support.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/2">Under the innovation platform, a &pound;10 million research competition has recently been announced for an ultra-low-carbon vehicle demonstrators targeting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to be on the road late 2009/early 2010, and a further &pound;10 million ultra-efficient vehicle systems competition has also been announced to assist in the future practical development of commercially viable next generation electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid-electric road vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/3">In addition to support provided through the innovation platform, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council continues to work with academe and industry to support high quality research through its programmes and responsive mode funding for underpinning research on battery technology, electric motors and control systems.</p>

	Working Time Directive

	<p pid="a.116.1/1" qnum="HL853">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in the light of the statement by Mr John Black, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, in the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> of 18 January on the effect of the Working Time Directive on the National Health Service, they will inform the European Union that they will not implement the directive.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-02-03a.116.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100960" speakername="Lord Darzi of Denham" colon=":" colnum="116"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90203w0003.htm#09020352000076">
	<p pid="a.116.2/1">The National Health Service has made excellent progress on implementing the European Working Time Directive (EWTD). Already, around two-thirds of doctors in training already work 48 hours a week or less. Based on estimates from the NHS we expect that by August this will have risen to around 96 per cent. The department and the NHS remain committed to implementing the EWTD for trainee doctors.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">Patient safety and the quality of patient care come first for everyone involved. We are working with the medical profession and the NHS to support those services which have yet to implement the directive, while ensuring that service quality is the top priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/3">For a very small number of specific services at local level, implementation is extremely difficult. This could, for example, be due to service reconfigurations, or to service isolation. In this small number of cases, the department will apply to the European Commission for derogation, which will allow this small number of local services an extra four hours in addition to the minimum 48. This element of flexibility represents good NHS management.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/4">We understand those in the medical profession who are concerned about the quality of training for doctors in some specialties. We are committed to ensuring the quality of training for NHS doctors and want to work with the profession to see how best to do so.</p>
