These excavations impacted upon the design of the building and as a result it has been possible to avoid disturbing the remains of the amphitheatre beneath. In fact, the foundations of the new building have been carefully designed to avoid any remains and to preserve them in situ, for posterity. The Court Service was aware of the location of the site and of its archaeological significance, but all appropriate approvals in relation to both planning and preservation had been obtained by the developers.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.3/1">The NatWest Quarterly Survey indicated that the proportion of small businesses that say late payment is a problem continues to fall--from 45.1 per cent in October 1997 survey to 36.7 per cent. The findings of this survey suggested that there may well be a potential to increase usage of the legislation by publicising more widely its ease of use. We intend to work with our partners on the Better Payment Practice Group to spread this message across the small business community.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/2">We recognise that we are still at an early stage and the UK has some way to go before we meet the example set by countries such as Sweden and Denmark. However, progress made since the introduction of the legislation and the Better Payment Practice Campaign in 1998 has been encouraging. Recent research published in the Grant Thornton European Business Survey confirms that the average payment period for sales invoices in the UK now stands at 45 days against an EU average of 54 days. The survey also confirms a continuing downward trend in UK payment times.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">The data published by Experian draw on the sales ledger information of many different companies and report the number of days the subject company takes to pay its invoices. One very good reason for apparently lengthy payment periods among some companies is that many agree terms of 60 or more days. Seemingly slow payers could therefore, actually, be paying within the terms agreed with their suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">The Government are, however, commited to improving the payment culture of the UK and have introduced a range of measures to help businesses tackle the problem of late payment of commercial debt, including the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. In addition, the Government support the recently approved EC directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions and propose to consult the businesss community during transposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">We recognise, however, that legislation is one part of a package of measures introduced to improve payment practices in the UK and will continue to work in partnership with the business community, through the Better Payment Practice Group (BPPG), to help businesses benefit from the increased opportunities that a healthy cash flow can bring.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.0/1">The remark was made in the context of jobseeker's allowance (JSA), which is an active benefit. The three labour market conditions of entitlement for JSA are that jobseekers must be available for work, must seek work actively each week, and must enter into a jobseeker's agreement setting out the type of work they are looking for and the steps they intend to take in order to find it. In addition, jobseekers are liable to a benefit sanction if they cause or prolong their own unemployment through certain acts or omissions which they could reasonably have avoided.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">Careful consideration has been given to the Assisted Area map for the whole of Scotland and the Government have listened carefully to all representations that have been made. The European Commission raised a number of concerns that required changes to the original proposal. The most recent proposal, published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-10">10 April 2000</phrase>, gives Scotland a population coverage of 48 per cent, down by only 1 per cent from the original proposal. I am sure that the final outcome will be good for Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/2">Letter to Lord Jacobs from the National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales, Office for National Statistics, Mr Len Cook, dated <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-28">28 June 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary Questions HL2899 and HL2900. HL2899 asks for the current underlying rate of inflation if the depreciation component had not been introduced in 1995. HL2900 asks by what annual rate the average price of owner occupied homes has depreciated or appreciated since 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/4">In response to Question HL2899, the underlying rate of inflation is taken to mean the Retail Price Index excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX). If the depreciation component of RPIX were removed, the percentage change over the latest 12-month period (to May 2000) would be 1.6 per cent. This figure is published every month in Table 2 of the Consumer Price Indices First Release and can be downloaded for free from timezone on the National Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">www.statistics.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/5">In response to Question HL2900, a table has been attached showing the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) house price index for the UK. The rise in house prices demonstrated by this index should not be confused with the depreciation calculation used in the RPI. The depreciation component of the RPI represents the notional amount needed to be put aside to keep a property in a constant state of repair and at a constant level of quality. It covers large infrequent renovations required to make good deterioration and obsolescence to owner-occupied housing. It does not include routine repairs and maintenance, as these are already covered elsewhere in the index.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.0/1">Since it was introduced, no government have increased age addition on the basic state pension that is paid to those aged 80 or over.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/2">Our priority is to help the poorest pensioners and to help all pensioner households. That is why we have introduced a comprehensive strategy to tackle pensioner poverty. We have introduced the minimum income guarantee, winter fuel payments, reduced VAT on fuel, restored free eye test, allocated extra money to improve cataract services and cardiac care, and reduced income tax. We have also introduced the home energy efficiency scheme and will be providing free TV licences for the over 75s, concessionary bus fares, pensioner credit and doubling the capital limits in minimum income guarantee.</p>
