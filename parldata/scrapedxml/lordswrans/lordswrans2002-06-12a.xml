	<p pid="a.37.8/1">The work to date on the New Chapter to the Strategic Defence Review indicates that there is scope for an additional role for the Reserves in home defence and security tasks, which would draw on their strengths and skills in the response to a crisis and which the Reserves would themselves welcome. To explain our concept and to seek views upon it, the Ministry of Defence has today issued a discussion document entitled The Role of the Reserves in Home Defence and Security. Copies of the document have been placed in the Library of the House. It makes proposals for providing a significant enhancement to the support which the department and the Armed Forces can provide to the civil authorities in such circumstances in three areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/2" class="indent">by the formation of reaction forces on a regional basis, comprising an average of 500 Reserve personnel who volunteer for the role and who would be available to be deployed in a crisis;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/3" class="indent">by formalising the role of 2 Signals Brigade, and its predominantly Territorial Army subordinate units, in supporting those personnel deploying in response to a crisis, and enhancing its communications equipment accordingly;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/4" class="indent">by using Reserve personnel to improve our contingency planning, and the machinery by which the civil authorities can gain access to support from the Armed Forces in a crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/5">This is a significant development for our Reserve Forces, and an important new challenge for them. We will take account of the views of the Reserves and their employers on the discussion document in finalising our proposals. At that stage, we will also take a final view on the implications for the size and shape of our Reserves forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.0/1">The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 places a general duty on public authorities, including schools and LEAs, to aim to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and good race relations between people of different racial groups. To help schools to comply with this duty, they are subject to specific, statutory duties, and were required by the <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase> this year to have prepared a written race equality policy setting out how they will tackle racial discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and good race relations across all areas of school activity. They are also required to assess and monitor the impact of their policies on pupils, parents and staff from different racial groups, in particular whether their policies have, or could have, an adverse impact on the attainment levels of pupils from different racial groups. The policies to be assessed and monitored can include discipline and exclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/2">Black-Caribbean exclusions are down from 46 in every 10,000 for 1999&ndash;2000 to an estimated 38 in every 10,000 (approximately 3.5 per cent to approximately 3 per cent) for 2000&ndash;2001. Although figures are now falling, we are not complacent about the exclusion of black children from school and they continue to be of concern to us. We are working with key partners, both inside and outside of government, to develop ways of tackling the problem and examining the whole issue of black attainment in schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.3/1">In its first report, the Advisory Committee on Consumer Products and the Environment Committee (ACCPE) presented the idea of setting up a new Internet information service, which could provide advice and guidance on the environmental impacts of products and the scope for making more sustainable consumption choices. It recommended that the Government should first commission work on the economic and technical feasibility of such a project, and the potential demand for the service. This has been done and the consultants' report is available on the DEFRA website, at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">http://www.defra.gov.uk</a>.environment.consumerprod/accpe/research/index.htm. Having considered the details of this feasibility study, ACCPE has recently made recommendations (in its second report, Action for Greener Products: a toolbox for change, published in May) about the practicalities of piloting a new service. The Government are now preparing a pilot stage, with a view to full implementation if that is successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">Further to my reply of <phrase class="date" code="">11 April</phrase>, mahogany (Swietenia Macrophylla) is listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and does not therefore require an import permit. However, the importer must complete an import notification form which must be presented to HM Customs for clearance.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">These notifications specify the quantity of timber imported and are passed to my department (as the UK CITES Management Authority) to record. Details of quantities imported are then passed annually to the United Nations Environment Programme which collates similar information from all other signatories to the covention. These figures are published annually.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">In its report on New Covent Garden Market published last year the House of Commons Select Committee on Agriculture recommended a review of the provision of wholesale markets in London.</p>
