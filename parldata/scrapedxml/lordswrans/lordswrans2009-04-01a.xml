	<p pid="a.235.0/1">Her Majesty's Government continue to discuss the Defence Trade Co-operation Treaty with the US Government at all levels. The Prime Minister wrote recently to President Obama on the matter, and the Foreign and Commonwealth and Defence Secretaries have also received assurances from their US counterparts about support for early ratification. Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have also been engaged. At the working level, MoD officials in the British Defence Staff in Washington regularly discuss treaty implementation with their US colleagues in preparation for ratification. The next meeting with UK-based officials will take place later in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/2">The treaty still requires the advice and consent of the US Senate, and the UK has worked hard to ensure that senators are aware of the importance the UK places on it and the benefits for both nations in operational and industrial terms. Although ratification is wholly a matter for the Senate, we understand that there are no substantive objections to the treaty. Officials are nevertheless ready to provide further clarification on certain aspects of implementation and enforcement. HMG remain hopeful that the treaty will receive advice and consent from the US Senate in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.8/2">The international community continues to press Russia to abide by its commitments under the Sarkozy-Medvedev agreements. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-05">5 February 2009</phrase>, for example, the Czech Republic as EU presidency issued a statement expressing serious concern about possible Russian plans to build up its military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. That statement referred specifically to the ceasefire agreements and urged Russia to continue to implement all its commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.8/3">EU partners have also agreed that the pace and tone of negotiations on a new EU-Russia agreement will reflect Russia's actions, including in Georgia. The resumption of negotiations does not constitute a return to business as usual. In a similar vein, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has made clear that the decision of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-05">5 March 2009</phrase> to resume meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation-Russia Council does not mean that the events of August 2008 will be overlooked. The alliance will use meetings to engage Russia, but in a hard-headed way, including on Georgia issues. Our own bilateral engagement with Russia is consistent with this international approach. We are not seeking to isolate Russia, but nor will we avoid making concerns clear. We and partners will continue to urge Russia to abide by its commitments in Georgia.</p>

The application of the definitions provided in Schedule 1 to the Licensing Act is a matter for licensing authorities in the first instance. Whether a proposed activity is licensable has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. It appears from reports of the filming that the licensing authority and the police were involved in planning the event. I can see nothing that suggests that they exercised their powers inappropriately in this case.</p>

	<p pid="a.247.5/1">In some circumstances Natural England does support fencing of open moorland, where this is regarded as essential to meet nature conservation or land management objectives. Where this is the case, Natural England promotes prior consultation with stakeholders, and actively considers how impacts on the landscape and on access can be minimised.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.5/2">The public access provisions in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 do not prevent the erection of fences on or around moorland or any other type of open country. Natural England would expect the access authority and the occupier to work together to ensure that suitable crossing points are included at appropriate locations along any new fences&mdash;and that where the requirement is temporary, arrangements are put in place for removal of the fencing once it has served its purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.5/3">In the case of open moorland which is registered common land, approval is normally required from the Secretary of State prior to the erection of any new fences.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.5/1">Our relationship with the US is our single most important bilateral relationship. It is based on shared values, working together to tackle threats to international security, advancing global stability and encouraging freedom and democracy. We are close partners in addressing a wide range of issues including the current economic downturn, counterterrorism, homeland security, nuclear non-proliferation and the Middle East peace process.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.0/1">The Israeli Government are currently carrying out internal investigations into a wide range of allegations. The Israelis have not provided us with progress reports, and as these are internal Israeli investigations we would not expect any such reports until the investigations are completed and the results made known.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/2">We will consider very carefully the results of investigations once they are available. At that stage, the parties and the international community will need to decide on any further action.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.3/1">Section 45(1)(a) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA) places a duty on the local waste collection authority (WCA) to make arrangements for the collection of household waste in its area, except where the waste is so isolated or inaccessible that the cost of collection would be unreasonably high and the local authority is satisfied that adequate arrangements for its disposal have been made by the holder of the waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.3/2">Section 46 of the EPA entitles the local waste collection authority to stipulate the conditions of the service. These conditions are set out in a Section 46 notice, which the authority must issue to recipients of the service prior to their introduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.3/3">The Climate Change Act 2008 amended the EPA by adding a subsection to Section 46 which clarifies that local authorities need not collect waste that is placed for collection in contravention of a requirement in the Section 46 notice.</p>
