	<p pid="a.25.2/1">The chief executive of the Special EU Programmes Body resigned with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-10">Wednesday 10 December 2003</phrase>. On his resignation he was, in addition to his earnings to that date, entitled to seven weeks' pay in lieu of notice equivalent to &pound;12,569 (which includes compensation for loss of pension). He also received a one-off ex-gratia payment of &pound;20,000, and solicitors' costs of &pound;2,500. The SEUPB terminated its leasing arrangements for Mr McKinney's car with the lessor with effect from 6 pm on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">Tuesday 9 December 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/2">In terms of pension payments, Mr McKinney is entitled to payments equivalent to what is payable under the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (Northern Ireland) pending the introduction of the North/South scheme. Mr McKinney's entitlements are based mainly on his previous employment in the local government sector in Northern Ireland, plus amounts in respect of his employment with the SEUPB. The amounts payable to him are a lump sum of &pound;84,824 and an annual pension payment of &pound;28,275. These amounts are based on his final salary in SEUPB, pension benefits of 26 years 306 days which he had accrued in respect of his previous employment in local government and which will be transferred to the North/South scheme when it comes into effect; and two years 312 days reckonable service in the SEUPB. These payments will be made by the SEUPB until the North/South pension scheme commences, after which the North/South scheme will reimburse the SEUPB for any payments made and assume responsibility for all future payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/1">There are three separate groups for pay purposes within the 11 departments of the Northern Ireland Administration: non-industrial staff up to and including Grade 6, the Senior Civil Service (SCS) and industrial staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/2">For non-industrial staff up to and including Grade 6 the 2003 pay award was worth 3.67 per cent overall. The amount received by an individual depends on his or her current position on the pay scale, but the majority of individuals are receiving increases of between 2 per cent and 6 per cent. For these grades pay negotiations are carried out between the Department of Finance and Personnel, on behalf of all 11 departments of the Northern Ireland Administration, and the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA). The 2002 pay increase for grades up to and including Grade 6 was worth 5.5 per cent overall and was therefore 1.83 per cent more than the 2003 increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/3">The 2003 increase for the SCS was worth 5.37 per cent. The amount received by an individual depended on performance ranking and position in the payband. A separate pay system exists for the SCS with increases made on the basis of recommendations made by the independent Senior Salaries Review Body. Unlike the other staff groups the SCS pay award process does not involve negotiations with trade unions. The 2002 pay increase for the SCS was worth 4.38 per cent and was therefore 0.99 per cent less than the 2003 increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/4">For industrial staff, departments have responsibility for carrying out their own pay negotiations and these have yet to be concluded for the 2003 pay round.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.5/1">In 2002, the last year for which full figures are available, the EBRD invested 1.2 billion euros in 36 projects in south-eastern Europe. This brought the bank's cumulative investment in the region to 5.1 billion euros in 210 projects. These projects included support for privatisation, restructuring, small and medium-sized enterprises, and critical infrastructure projects such as road building. Details of all projects on a country by country basis are available on the bank's website at <a href="http://www.ebrd.com">www.ebrd.com</a>. The full 2003 figures will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/2">In the future, the bank aims to expand investment in the region and to continue its leading role under the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe in implementing private sector initiatives and in developing regional co-operation in infrastructure. Given that the EBRD's business is largely in the private sector and is therefore demand-driven, it is not possible to provide firm figures for future spend. However, the EBRD's individual country strategies for south-eastern Europe state the main areas of focus for the bank, and the majority of the strategies give an indication of the size of the project pipeline at the time of strategy approval (country strategies are available on EBRD's website). The bank also publishes project summary documents with information on upcoming projects on its website, for example a regional road development programme in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

This will enable the supply chain to be managed with increased effectiveness and efficiency and improve the quality of information on forecast arrival dates provided to headquarters and units awaiting the delivery of stores. MMiT will not replace the existing consignment tracking systems but will exploit the data they already contain, converting them into more useful management information and making them more widely and easily available within the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.3/3">MMiT has been allocated &pound;5.866 million to complete the assessment phase of the project. It is estimated that the provision of a suitable system is likely to cost in the region of a further &pound;10 million but this figure will be refined once the optimum solution has been identified and any contracts have been negotiated.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.3/1">The Government fully recognise the important role that fathers play in raising their children and are working hard to support all fathers in fulfilling their responsibilities. We want parents, especially fathers, to see asking for help and support as a positive step, taken by a responsible parent for the good of their family, not as a sign of weakness or an admission of failure. The Teenage Pregnancy Unit (TPU) has supported the publication of a booklet and set of posters highlighting the support needs of young fathers. The resources draw on research with teenage fathers and aim to raise awareness of health and other support professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.3/2">The teenage pregnancy strategy is supporting two projects funded under the Department of Health's Section 64 scheme to assist voluntary organisations. Fathers Direct is developing an antenatal intervention to engage young black fathers. The project, based in King's College Hospital, is linked to the local teenage pregnancy strategy and Sure Start Plus pilot. The results of the project will be available in early 2005. The other project, run by ContinYou, is working with young fathers to develop an intervention to support young dads before and after the birth. We expect organisations to share good practice by disseminating their outcomes nationally. The TPU is working with relevant organisations including the Trust for the Study of Adolescence (TSA) further to develop work with young fathers within local teenage pregnancy strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.3/3">The department established an Advisory Group on Fathers, to help to shape its policies on involving parents in children's education. This was the first working group specifically on fathers and their importance to children's learning ever to have been set up by government. The outcomes from the group will feed into advice for schools on how best to involve fathers in children's learning and education.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.3/4">In 2001, the Home Secretary announced funding of &pound;300,000 for a young fathers project led by TSA. TSA is working with five local organisations to work up a model that will demonstrate effective ways of involving and encouraging young men to bond with their children and improve their parenting skills, and this project has been subject to independent research.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.3/2">The Government are redressing the availability and training of teachers and coaches through the national strategy for PE, school sport and club links and the implementation of the key recommendations of the Coaching Task Force.

Within the latter: (i) the Community Sports Coach scheme will create 3,000 full and part-time community sports coaches, who will work in partnership at local level with schools, clubs and other local or regional organisations supporting sport by 2006; and (ii) the introduction of the national coaching certificate will raise standards in coach education and give coaches a nationally recognised and transferable professional qualification for the first time.</p>
