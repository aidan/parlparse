	<p pid="b.187.2/1">Discussions have been taking place with Liverpool City Council and some other local authorities aimed at providing the Immigration Service with assistance from social workers skilled in assessing age. Funding forms part of these discussions. There are currently around 200 unaccompanied asylum seeking children in Liverpool. It is not possible to say if any are former child soldiers or have been intentionally trafficked. I would expect any evidence of this to be brought forward as part of an individual's claim for asylum.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.2/1">iSoft is not one of the preferred supplier contractors for either the data [odq]spine[cdq], or the [odq]Choose and Book[cdq] system, under the national programme for information technology in the national health service (NPfIT). Those contracts were awarded to British Telecom and Atos Origin respectively. iSoft is, however, a key subcontractor for three of the programme's five local service providers (LSPs), and has a track record of successful delivery of information technology systems to the National Health Service over a considerable number of years. Choice of subcontractors was and remains a matter for the LSPs concerned. NPfIT is delivering to the NHS a service for clinicians rather than a software package.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.2/2">In the Eastern, North East, and North West and West Midlands cluster areas&mdash;where iSoft solutions are being deployed&mdash;some 900 sites have had iSoft solutions installed, and these are being used by more than 25,000 users. Some LSP local system deployment activity is being rescheduled as a result of LSPs and their subcontractors, including iSoft, taking longer than originally anticipated to deliver software solutions. However, there is no single new deadline. NPfIT is a hugely complex 10-year programme which will see many thousands of further deployments and associated deadlines. Because contracts under the programme are structured so that financing and completion risk rests with the LSPs and their subcontractors, those who deliver get paid; the corollary also applies.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-02-16b.204.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="204"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60216w05.htm#60216w05_spmin2">
	<p pid="b.204.5/1">Since April 2002, the RDAs have been financed through a single programme budget (the [odq]single pot[cdq]). This consists of money from various departments (DTI, ODPM, DfES, Defra, DCMS and UKTI). Defra's contribution to the single pot in 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;51.5 million. Inflation-proofing will see this increase to &pound;52.5 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;54.5 million in 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.5/2">The single pot is allocated using a funding formula, and is available to the RDAs to address regional priorities (set out in regional economic strategies), whilst at the same time contributing to the delivery of national PSA targets. Funding for administrative overheads is allocated from the single pot using a flat-rate indicator.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.5/3"><i>Rural Strategy 2004</i> announced that, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, Defra intended to devolve decision-making on delivery of economic and social regeneration policies to the regional development agencies, and transfer funding from the Countryside Agency to the RDAs. Funding of &pound;21.3 million per annum has since been allocated for the years 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08 and is distributed outside the single pot mechanism, using the new rural indicator to ensure these resources are targeted according to rural need. However, as with the overall single pot funding, RDAs have the flexibility to utilise this funding to contribute to the targets set by government (including Defra's PSA targets on rural productivity and access to services, sustainable farming and food, and sustainable development) and the priorities in each regional economic strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.5/4">How each RDA utilises its single pot allocation will vary according to regional need. Details of RDA priorities and planned spending can be found in individual RDA corporate plans, with six-monthly reports on performance, setting out what has been achieved. These documents can be found on each RDA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.5/5">This move to devolve funding to the regions through RDAs is part of the Government's devolving decision-making agenda. RDAs, working in partnership, will decide how to spend their resources to meet national targets and address regional needs. However, Defra is confident that by devolving these responsibilities to the RDAs and having increased the resources it makes available to them, rural delivery will become more responsive to local priorities and better focused on areas and people that need it most.</p>
