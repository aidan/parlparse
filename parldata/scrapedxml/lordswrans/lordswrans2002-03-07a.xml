The UK is deeply concerned about these communities and is working bilaterally and with other development partners to help address their needs.</p>

WFP officials agreed that this action would not adversely impact their work in East Africa, where many countries have a good harvest and regional maize stocks are high.

	<p pid="a.31.0/1">British Embassy staff in Tel Aviv do not undertake physical checks on the end-use of UK licensed equipment, components and spare parts supplied by the UK to Israel. They do not have the resources to do so. In addition, many UK defence exports in recent years have been components or pieces of technology embedded in other systems and therefore not very visible. We do however use information supplied by a number of sources to check that UK equipment is not being used against Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, including information gathered by our embassy and non-governmental organisations among others.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/2">The Government have also taken steps to strengthen the process of risk assessment when considering export licence applications for any destination. For example, we have improved our procedures for gathering information on end-users of potential concern from UK overseas posts. We also take into account reliable information received about end-users of concern from a variety of external sources, including international reporting bodies and non-governmental organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.8/1">We refer my noble friend to the announcement my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence made in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-24">24 July 2000</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 778&ndash;79) about our decision to implement the Core Competence model for the DERA public private partnership. Under this approach, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-01">1 July 2001</phrase> around three-quarters of the former DERA organisation was vested with its assets as QinetiQ, a wholly government owned company. For strategic reasons, the remainder was retained within the Ministry of Defence as the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory to carry out functions that could not appropriately be transferred to the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/2">Since the vesting of QinetiQ as a company on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-01">1 July 2001</phrase>, work has concentrated on preparing the company for sale, options for which were through a flotation or strategic partnership. We have now completed a comprehensive review of the available options for the transaction route and timing in conjunction with specialist advisers and QinetiQ's senior management. Although flotation has always been our preferred route, as we have consistently stated, the priority is to achieve a successful move into the private sector with a transaction that clearly achieves best value for the taxpayer. We believe that a flotation under current market conditions would not realise this, yet delay could lead to a damaging loss of momentum. We have, therefore, decided that the strategic partner route offers the best potential for a transaction within 2002, offers value to the taxpayer and meets our objective of a successful public private partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/3">A strategic partner would work closely with QinetiQ and contribute significantly to growing the overall value of its business, from which the taxpayer would benefit through MoD's initial retention of a significant financial interest in the company. MoD will also retain a special share as a means of protecting UK defence and security interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.8/4">Confidential discussions with potential strategic partners will now begin and it is expected that a preferred partner will be selected, and agreements signed, later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/1">New EU-wide measures (implemented domestically under the Processed Animal Protein Regulations from <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-01">1 August 2001</phrase>) already control intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of a wide range of processed animal proteins, effectively preventing their inclusion in feed for farmed animals in order to stop the propagation of BSE.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/2">In Great Britain, a national feed sampling programme has been in place since 1996 to monitor compliance with BSE-related feed controls. This programme, operated by the State Veterinary Service, typically takes around 20,000 samples per year from feed mills, on-farm mixers and other premises handling livestock feed. The results of the programme are very encouraging and indicate wide compliance with the feed controls, confirming that prohibited ingredients (from domestic or imported sources) are being effectively removed from the market, distribution channels and farms.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/3">One theoretical issue is that recent cases of BSE in younger animals may have been exposed to infection as a result of cross-contamination (during transhipment) of imported vegetable protein used in the production of animal feedingstuffs with meat and bone meal. We are continuing carefully to investigate such cases but there is currently no clear evidence that individual animals have been infected by this route.</p>

The JNCC is due to report in April and we plan to host a European conference to discuss the findings of the report during the summer.
