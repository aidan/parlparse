	<p pid="c.1.1/2" qnum="HL4554">Whether they are aware of any measures that can be taken by the United Kingdom military and other personnel in Afghanistan, alongside other coalition and NATO forces, to assist President Karzai's Government to extend their control outside the Greater Kabul administration zone.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.2/1">The primary role of the International Security Assistance Force is to help create an environment in which the Afghan Government can: extend their authority across the entire country; maintain security; and facilitate reconstruction and development. UK troops and other personnel deployed as part of the provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in Helmand will work closely with the Afghan Government and international partners to provide an integrated diplomatic, political, developmental and military package in support of these aims. This will help bring about the kind of progress in the south and east that we have already seen in the north and west.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/2">The primary role of UK troops in Helmand will be to help provide a secure environment in which the PRT can operate. They will also train and work alongside the Afghan security forces to build their capacity to combat the narcotics trade, the residual Taliban insurgency and illegally armed groups. The civilian team, including representatives of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development, will help to establish strong democratic institutions, a functioning legal system and a sustainable legitimate economy capable of providing livelihoods for the local population.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/3">This effort is backed up by a significant development aid package for Afghanistan from the UK and from the international community, totalling over $10 billion over the next three years.</p>

	<p pid="c.4.0/1">Since the launch of the transfer controls initiative (TCI) in 2003, the UK along with many international partners has made progress in building international consensus on the need for stronger controls on the export, import and transhipment of small arms and light weapons (SALW). The issue is now firmly on the international agenda. In particular the TCI has built support for stronger transfer controls in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean (such as the Nairobi protocol and the Andean pact) regions where the problems associated with illicit trade in SALW are severe. At the review conference of the UN programme of action this summer we will seek agreement to develop a set of politically binding criteria for SALW transfers.</p>
	<p pid="c.4.0/2">The UK has also played a leading role among EU partners in formulating a strong EU SALW strategy to support the UN programme of action on SALW. Both bilaterally and through the EU we fund projects to enhance small arms control legislation in countries where weapons availability and transhipment are recognised problems and where there is a negative impact on development. We also support SALW stockpile management and the destruction of surplus SALW.</p>
	<p pid="c.4.0/3">We are also working with international partners to promote the concept of an arms trade treaty, a legally binding instrument that would cover all conventional weapons.</p>
	<p pid="c.4.0/4">As an exporter of defence equipment, we operate one of the most rigorous licensing systems in the world. All potential exports are assessed on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Under these criteria, the Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression or provoke or aggravate conflict.</p>

	<p pid="c.19.5/1">Part 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill provides a power to reform legislation by order. It also provides a power to implement recommendations made by one or more of the Law Commissions in the United Kingdom for reforming legislation or the common law. Reforms to the common law can be made only to the extent that they are implementing such recommendations, and not otherwise. The Government have made a commitment not to deliver highly controversial measures by order and not to push forward proposals that are opposed by the relevant parliamentary committees (<phrase class="date" code="2007-02-09">Thursday, 9 February</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, col. 1058&ndash;59)</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/2">In addition, the order-making powers in the Bill are subject to a number of safeguards. All proposals for orders must undergo statutory consultation and orders must be scrutinised by specialist parliamentary committees. In addition, an order that is reforming legislation (except where merely restating provisions) or which is amending or abolishing the common law may be made only if the Minister considers that the following conditions, where relevant, are satisfied:</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/3" class="indent">the policy objective intended to be secured by the provision could not be satisfactorily secured by non-legislative means;</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/4" class="indent">the effect of the order is proportionate to the policy objective;</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/5" class="indent">the provision, taken as a whole, strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected by it;</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/6" class="indent">the provision does not remove any necessary protection; and</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/7" class="indent">the provision does not prevent any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom which that person might reasonably expect to continue to exercise.</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/8">Where a provision is merely restating legislation or codifying the common law, the Minister must be satisfied that the provision would make the law more accessible or more easily understood.</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/9">A number of topic-specific restrictions also apply to all orders. For example, an order cannot impose or increase taxation or, other than in the case of an order implementing a Law Commission recommendation, create criminal offences punishable with a penalty above certain specified limits, as under the 2001 Act.</p>

The 2003 Act repealed and re-enacted, with considerable improvements, a number of offences dating from the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (which had consolidated offences dating from 1861). The 2003 Act introduced tougher new penalties for many offences, introduced new laws to protect the young and vulnerable from sexual abuse and ended laws which had discriminated against male homosexual sexual activity. Part 2 of the 2003 Act re-enacted, with considerable improvements, the notification requirements on convicted or cautioned sex offenders (the sex offenders register) and also introduced four civil orders to assist the police in the management of sex offenders and those who pose a risk of sexual harm.</p>
