	<p pid="a.99.2/1">As it currently stands, the European Commission's proposal for Article 13 of the council directive concerning the general arrangements for excise duty would restrict duty-free sales to passengers whose immediate destination is outside the EU. The Government have not conducted an assessment of the extent of any impact of the proposal on smaller regional airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">However, later proposals from the EU presidency have replaced the word &quot;immediate&quot; with &quot;final&quot; in Article 13 of the draft directive. This will maintain the current position, allowing passengers to continue purchasing duty-free goods at any port or airport, providing they hold a valid transport document to a destination outside the EU, regardless of their immediate or interim destination.</p>

Only if they choose to register with the scheme will they receive information about the release, whether temporary or otherwise, of the perpetrator of the crime against them.

	<p pid="a.101.2/1">Planning authorities are expected to address the environmental, social and economic impacts that arise from the proposed location of a renewable energy project. In doing so, they can already use planning conditions to require the removal of a renewable energy installation at the end of a specified period. In such cases planning conditions can also be used to require that a site is restored to its former condition. In the case of wind farms, a guidance note prepared for the Renewables Advisory Board and published by BERR<sup>*</sup>, highlights that decommissioning conditions can be used to ensure full and satisfactory restoration of a site, either in whole or part, should one or more turbines cease to be operational for a given period of time prior to the cessation of a planning permission. There is no reason in principle why such conditions should not be applicable to other installations for renewable energy. Planning authorities can also impose planning conditions relating to other environmental matters such as noise emissions. The companion guide supporting Planning Policy Statement 22 on renewable energy<sup>**</sup> provides practice guidance on the use of planning conditions and their applicability to a range of renewable energy technologies.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.2/1">As I indicated in my Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May 2008</phrase> (<I>WA 154</I>), public petitions to the House of Lords are rare: the last occasion on which a petition was presented was on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-13">13 December 2000</phrase>. I do not therefore believe that expenditure on developing a system of e-petitioning unique to the House of Lords could be justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April 2008</phrase> the House of Commons Procedure Committee published a comprehensive report on <I>e-Petitions</I> (1st Report, Session 2007-08, HC 136). The Committee envisages that if its proposals are agreed by the House of Commons the earliest date at which a system of e-petitioning could be operational is likely to be early in 2010. The appropriate committees in this House may at the appropriate time wish to take stock of experience in the Commons, and consider whether a similar system should be introduced in the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.6/20" class="indent">(1) More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total workforce figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years' figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.</p>
