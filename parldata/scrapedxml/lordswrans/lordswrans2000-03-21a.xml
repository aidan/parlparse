I am as keen, however, on seeing our servicemen and women eating British products as I am for our contractor to secure the best value for money. Accordingly, our contractor is required specifically to give full consideration to British products, which we look to them to buy wherever they are competitive. Currently all beef for consumption by our UK-based service personnel is British. In addition, 100 per cent of our pork; some 50 per cent of our bacon and gammon; and 30 per cent of our chicken is being sourced in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.5/1">As part of a study commissioned by the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company on transportation options on the Belfast to Newtownards Corridor, a full range of possible transport options was examined. Arising out of this study, the preferred technical option for a modern transit route to link Dundonald and Knock with the centre of Belfast is a new concept known as EWAY. The type of transit system proposed, described as a train on rubber wheels, claims to offer the best features of rail and bus by combining the freedom from congestion of rail with the more realistic cost and greater flexibility of the bus. At this point in time there are no plans to proceed with EWAY, given the current financial resources available for public transport in Northern Ireland.</p>
