	<p pid="a.101.5/1">The last case to come before a United Kingdom court involving an application for permission to withdraw life support from a patient in a permanent vegetative state was that of Re M &amp; Re H. In this case, decided on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-06">6 October</phrase>, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, President of the Family Division of the High Court, made a declaration that doctors can lawfully withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration from two women in a permanent vegetative state as this was in their best interests and did not constitute an infringement of Article 2 of the convention, the right to life. So far as I am aware, no case of this kind has as yet been before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In cases such as this, as in other cases under the Human Rights Act 1998, a court determining a question which has arisen in connection with a convention right must take into account any judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, to the extent that, in its judgment, it is relevant.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">As my honourable friend the Minister of State for the Home Office (Mrs Roche) explained to you in her response to your letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-06">6 September 2000</phrase>, a lengthy consultation process has accompanied the drafting of the Detention Centre Rules and the intention has been to consult as widely as possible. Among those involved have been the leading interested non-governmental organisations--for example, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the Refugee Council, the Medical Foundation and the Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees, along with a number of smaller groups. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, other government departments, the British Medical Association, Immigration Service staff, members of the Visiting Committees, and of course the contractors who currently run the establishments have also been consulted.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">As I explained in the Answer I gave you on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-09">9 October</phrase> (Official Report, WA8), the Detention Centre Rules will be laid before Parliament after they have been &quot;made&quot;. This is likely to be in the late autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/3">The procedure for this Statutory Instrument was debated and determined during the passage of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The rules are subject to the ordinary negative resolution procedure and as such will not be submitted to Parliament in draft form prior to finalisation.</p>
