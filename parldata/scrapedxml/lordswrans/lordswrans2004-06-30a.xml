	<p pid="a.21.2/1">In order to qualify for debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative, governments lead participatory processes to develop poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs), involving civil society and the international community. To date, parliaments have not played a significant role in these processes, but there are increasing signs of parliamentary interest and involvement. DfID supports this development because the PRSP approach ensures that the money saved from debt servicing is spent on health, education and other development projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">Of the 23 sub-Saharan African countries that have qualified for the HIPC initiative, 19 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) all have full PRSPs in place. The remaining four countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe) have presented interim PRSPs to the World Bank and IMF boards.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.5/1">Reduced loan payments arise as a direct result of the increased use of grants in the International Development Association (IDA). Reduced loans or increased grants have two associated costs. The first is the lost income from the repayment of the loans that would have been made in the place of grants (the lost reflows), and the second is the lost administrative charges on IDA loans. For grants agreed during the thirteenth replenishment of IDA (IDA 13), the UK has supported a proposal, whereby lost administrative charges would be compensated through upfront contributions made by donors, and lost reflows would be compensated as and when these would have fallen due on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/2">In IDA 14, the issue of compensating IDA for the cost of grants will arise again, as grants are expected to remain an important funding instrument for IDA. Further proposals for grant compensation are being put forward by World Bank staff, and these will be discussed during the replenishment negotiations. A key objective for the UK will be to secure an agreement which recognises the importance of ensuring the long-term financial integrity of IDA.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.2/1">There are no faith-based offending behaviour programmes for prisoners accredited by the Correctional Services Accreditation Panel (CSAP). Some prisons do run faith-based courses accredited by other recognised bodies and open to all prisoners, for example on victim awareness, but no prisoner should be disadvantaged for refusing to attend such a course for reasons of conscience. Where there are good reasons why a prisoner cannot participate in a particular recommended activity, this should be recorded in the sentence plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/2">It is open to the prisoner to seek a transfer to another prison running a similar non faith-based course. Current guidance requires governors to consider regime and family contact issues before moving prisoners and, whenever possible, to avoid moving prisoners if it disrupts their participation in an educational course or treatment programme or their consideration for parole. However, where a prisoner is identified as needing work, treatment or education programmes, which are not available at their current location, they may be moved to another appropriate prison; subject to available vacancies at that establishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/3">There are no essential pre-conditions of parole that require a prisoner to attend an offending related course. It is, however, a mandatory requirement that reports of any offence related courses attended are included in a prisoner's parole dossier. The Parole Board, an independent non-departmental executive body, determines parole and the Prison Service has no input into the parole decision process.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.6/1">The Government will cease funding the UK secretariat on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>. Unlike her predecessor, the new UK member of the European Monitoring Centre (EUMC) management board does not carry the significant extra duties of chair of the management and executive boards of the EUMC. She therefore does not have the same need for a support office in London as her predecessor. The centre in Vienna is now fully up and running and able to provide practical support to board members, unlike when the secretariat was established. Furthermore, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) is currently developing a European strategy and is becoming more engaged with European processes&mdash;a fact which is inevitably leading to a duplication of activity between the CRE and the secretariat which the Government cannot justify funding. This decision was taken after careful consideration and in no way represents any reduction in the UK Government's commitment to the EUMC or to the fight against racism at national or European level.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/1">Under the Private Security Industry Act 2001 (PSIA), we have put in place measures for the effective regulation of the industry. The Security Industry Authority (SIA) will license people to work in various sectors of the industry. These arrangements will be introduced in phases. Licensing of door supervisors commenced in the pilot area of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight in March of this year, and will roll out across England and Wales over the next 10 months. Licensing of door supervisors will be followed later this year by that of vehicle immobilisers, with the manned guarding sector (security officers) and key holders in early to mid-2005, although no set dates have yet been confirmed. The final sector to be subject to regulation will be that of security consultants and private investigators in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/2">Anyone involved with work of a security guarding nature will require a licence, and the PSIA makes provision for employees, employers, managers, supervisors and directors of security companies to be licensed.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/3">The authority's procedures include three checks on people applying for licences:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/4" class="indent">an identity check of the licence applicant,</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/5" class="indent">a criminal record check at standard disclosure level through the Criminal Records Bureau, which includes information about all convictions&mdash;including any that are spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act&mdash;cautions, reprimands and warnings recorded centrally on the Police national computer, and</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/6" class="indent">a check on professional competence to do the job.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/7">As to companies engaged in the industry, the authority's voluntary approved contractor scheme (ACS), is expected to come into effect from the summer of 2005. The ACS will provide consumers and industries with an assurance that what is being accredited is competent, committed to quality and adheres to professional standards. The scheme will allow the SIA to guide and facilitate the industry, and ensure that it is focused on internal performance standards and quality of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/8">The principal objective of the measures is to raise performance standards in the industry, thereby promoting increased public trust and confidence and assist in nurturing development opportunities.</p>

We do, however, have concerns about the proposals on insurance and pensions, exemptions and the extent to which the directive may place obligations on service recipients as well as service providers. The European Commission is continuing to negotiate with member states regarding the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.5/2">The Government are committed to making National Health Service services more responsive to patients, by offering more choice across the spectrum of health care. In future, patients' personal preferences will be expressed in the choices that they make, and this may include choosing the gender of the clinician that they wish to see. The ability to choose the gender of clinician may be of particular importance to people of some faiths where questions of decency may arise. The United Kingdom is seeking to ensure that the final form of the directive will enable a patient to express preferences about the gender of their clinician. The negotiations are continuing, however, and, at this stage, we are not in a position to predict the outcome on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Third party claims including those for property loss or damage and for personal injury and death or in respect of any other matter arising from or attributing to Coalition personnel or any persons employed by them, whether normally resident in Iraq or not, and that do not arise in connection with military combat operations, shall be submitted and dealt with by the Parent State whose coalition personnel, property, activities or other assets are alleged to have caused the claimed damage, in a manner consistent with the national laws of the Parent State&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">Hence, we would generally make payments in circumstances where the claim would give rise to a legal liability under English Law. Payments by other coalition partners is a matter for them.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.3/1">The Ministry of Defence currently does not have a unified approach for costing the discrete components of individual training across the three services. Work is under way to develop a consistent methodology for costing training outputs across defence.</p>
