	<p pid="a.154.9/1">Directive 2002/46/EC on food supplements came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-12">12 July 2002</phrase>. The Food Supplements Regulations England 2003, which implement the Directive in England, were laid before Parliament in June 2003 and the provisions are set to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August 2005</phrase>. There is parallel legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.9/2">In October 2003 the Minister for Public Health (Miss Melanie Johnson), had a useful meeting with representatives of the health food industry to discuss their concerns over the potential impact of the directive, particularly relating to the submission of safety dossiers to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and to the future setting of European maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.9/3">Since then there has been a constructive meeting, facilitated by the Food Standards Agency, between industry representatives and representatives of the EFSA to discuss safety dossiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.9/4">In addition, the Minister for Public Health recently set out the Government's views on the setting of maximum limits to Commissioner David Byrne. EFSA is continuing work on safe upper limits for intakes of vitamins and minerals begun by the Scientific Committee on Food. It is not expected to complete this work until Summer 2005 at the earliest. The Commission will not publish a proposal on EU maximum limits until this work is complete. Commissioner Byrne and the Minister for Public Health agreed to talk again when EFSA's advice has been published and, if appropriate, meet. In the mean time, officials continue to press the case for safety based maximum limits in all the relevant European fora. They are also keeping in close contact with the Commission officials who will in due course draft the proposal on EU maximum limits. The Minister for Public Health has asked for progress reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.9/5">The Minister for Public Health is willing to meet again with food supplement industry representatives. However, she has suggested to the industry that before such a meeting takes place it would be useful for industry technical advisers to meet Food Standards Agency officials to discuss detailed technical issues relating to dossiers and then for the industry to gain experience of submitting such dossiers to EFSA.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.5/1">The pension protection fund will protect members of eligible defined benefit and hybrid pension schemes who may otherwise lose some or all of their pension entitlement should their sponsoring employer become insolvent. Those schemes eligible for PPF assistance will be liable to pay the pension protection levies.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/2">However, we expect that those schemes which will be exempt from the new scheme funding requirements will not be eligible for assistance from the PPF. Broadly speaking this is because the existing framework for these schemes already provides a high level of security.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/3">In the main, those schemes which will be exempted from the new scheme funding requirements will be those schemes currently exempt from the minimum funding requirement (MFR). We will check that it remains appropriate to exempt them before the relevant regulations are made. The Chatsworth Settlement Estate Pension Scheme is exempt from the MFR because the structure of the trust means that pension beneficiaries would be able to call on the entire assets of the trust, where necessary, to fund their pensions. This provides a higher level of security than the MFR.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.0/15">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/16">1. Data from the 2000 Government Actuary's Department survey of occupational pension schemes suggest that it would be reasonable to assume that &frac34; of private sector defined benefit schemes already offer benefits to same-sex couples, albeit at the trustees' discretion. Using this assumption, the annual costs for future accrual are based on the additional contributions that would need to be paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/17">2. Under the high take-up scenario, the Government Actuary's Department assumes that, by 2050, 6 per cent of the lesbian, gay and bisexual population aged around 70 who are retired with occupational pensions will be in civil partnerships (the proportions around age 70 being a key driver in determining the cost of benefits to spouses/partners on death). This figure is broadly consistent with the assumption that, overall, around 3.3 per cent of the lesbian, gay and bisexual population aged 16 and over will be in civil partnerships, as compared to around 33 per cent of the heterosexual population aged 16 and over who would be married.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/18">3. Further information on the assumptions for the take-up of civil partnerships are included in Annex A of the regulatory impact assessment published with the Civil Partnership Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.9/1">It is neither appropriate nor fair to identify the names of contractors with whom the department is in dispute given that these are ongoing disputes, which are being concluded through litigation or alternative disputes resolution procedures. Although some contractors and their representatives have sought to publicise their disputes through the media for reasons unknown to the department, others have chosen not to do so and no useful purpose is likely to be served by the identity of contractors being divulged in these circumstances. From information held centrally, none of the contractors with whom Defra is in dispute appears to have farming as their primary business activity. All of the contractors, to either a greater or lesser degree, have supplied services to the farming sector since the start of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.8/1">The Government are working on a wide-ranging strategy to ensure that members of the public will be well informed about where the right of access introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 applies when the first two regions, the South East and lower North West, open for access on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-19">19 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.8/2">As part of this strategy, the Countryside Agency will very shortly be issuing guidance to access authorities and land managers on the use of signs. The guidance will give access authorities the lead role in erecting and maintaining signs to show where open access rights exist and will encourage them to consult widely with land managers, local access forums and other interested parties in drawing up their plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.8/3">New signs will not be needed in every case and the guidance will advocate careful thought about whether additional signage is appropriate. The Government have allocated &pound;2 million for 2004&ndash;05 towards an access management grant scheme, to be administered by the Countryside Agency, which will help authorities to meet the cost of providing signs. Interim guidance about how the scheme will work has been available since April this year and final guidance will be issued by the Countryside Agency in early June.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.8/4">The Countryside Agency has already held two workshops attended by access authorities in the South East and lower North West to promote the scheme and plans to hold a further series of meetings with land managers in these areas in partnership with the Country Land and Business Association later this year.</p>
