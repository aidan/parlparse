<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-12-11c.159.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="159"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61211w0001.htm#06121122000032">
	<p pid="c.159.2/1">Defra does not have a target to reduce total costs to farmers by 25 per cent. However, we do have a commitment to reduce administrative burdens by 25 per cent by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.2/2">Lord Davidson's review on the implementation of EU legislation, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>, found that the unnecessary over-implementation of EU legislation may not be as widespread in the UK as is sometimes claimed. It is sometimes beneficial for the UK economy to set or maintain regulatory standards that exceed the minimum requirements of European legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.2/3">However, the review did conclude that there were areas in the stock of legislation where regulatory burdens can be removed. The review included three Defra case studies: on waste legislation, on fisheries legislation and on the herd register for bovine animals. It makes specific recommendations for Defra in these areas. The report also includes wider recommendations to encourage the spread of best practice across departments in the implementation of EU legislation. Some of these build on Defra's existing best practice work.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.2/4">Defra's 2006 simplification plan, <I>Maximising Outcomes, Minimising Burdens</I>, will be published on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase> and will be available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/regulat/requlat.asp">www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/regulat/requlat.asp</a>. Copies of the plan will also be placed in the House Library. The Defra simplification plan will take forward the specific simplification proposals from Lord Davidson's review. In addition, the more generic recommendations which aim to further strengthen the implementation of EU legislation in the future will, if they are not already, be incorporated into our programme of better regulation culture change.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.2/5">The plan reports on the key findings from the cross-Whitehall exercise to measure the administrative burdens imposed by regulations, and how these burdens fall on different stakeholders. It also details simplification projects, many already under way, which will ensure that Defra meets its commitment to reduce administrative burdens by 25 per cent by 2010. Reducing these burdens is just one aspect of better regulation and the plan details initiatives that will improve the way in which Defra and its delivery bodies interact with business. We are working with business stakeholders, including the National Farmers' Union, to develop these initiatives and to help to monitor our delivery of the plan as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.2/6">Defra's farm regulation and charging strategy, <I>Partners for Success</I>, was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-28">28 November 2005</phrase>. The strategy commits the Government to improving the way in which we regulate (and enforce regulation) and to reducing bureaucracy. This will improve farmers' capacity to help to protect the environment, animal health and welfare, food safety and worker safety. It is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/regulation/charge/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/regulation/charge/index.htm</a>.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-12-11c.160.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="160"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61211w0001.htm#06121122000039">
	<p pid="c.160.2/1">The integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) directive applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of industrial activities. This means that emissions to air, water (including discharges to sewer) and land, plus a range of other environmental effects, including noise and vibration, must be considered together before a permit is granted. IPPC aims to prevent emissions and waste production and, where that is not practicable, to reduce them to acceptable levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.2/2">The regulator must set permit conditions so as to achieve a high level of protection for the environment and human health as a whole. These conditions are based on the use of the &quot;best available techniques&quot;, which balances the costs to the operator against the benefits to the environment and human health.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.2/3">Regulatory costs have to be met by those whose activities cause the need for them and so cannot be waived. Intensive livestock installations will be charged &pound;3,331 for a permit application and then annual charges of &pound;2,229 for a small installation and &pound;2,794 for a large one. The IPPC directive applies only to poultry installations with places for more than 40,000 birds and to installations with places for more than 2,000 production pigs or 750 sows. Large units are those greater than 10 times the lower threshold&mdash;that is, those greater than 400,000 birds, 20,000 production pigs or 7,500 sows.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="">19 May</phrase>, the industry accepted an offer from the Environment Agency whereby, provided that permit applications are received evenly through the <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 January 2007</phrase> application period, a subsistence charge of &pound;1,471 for an existing small installation and &pound;1,844 for an existing large one will be charged to industry from August 2007 until March 2008. This represents a substantial saving to industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.2/5">The IPPC directive is required to be implemented in its entirety in all member states by 2007. In the UK, the farming sector is among the last to be regulated by the national transposing regulations (with the exception of new installations). Most other industrial sectors have had to apply for an IPPC permit and comply with the provisions of the IPPC regime sooner than intensive livestock.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.2/6">Some EU member states may not charge for IPPC permit applications, but may recover varying proportions of their costs from the regulated industry, while others bear the cost in general taxation. This is a political decision for each national Government. The differing practices that are in place make it difficult to make comparisons of the costs to producers across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.2/7">I met representatives of the industry recently and assured them that I would look again at what might be able to be done to reduce the costs of these regulatory requirements.</p>

	<p pid="c.166.2/1">Our intention is to publish the action plan early in 2007. It is clearly essential that it should be informed by the views of the broad range of stakeholders, including the professional bodies, and that it should command broad support wherever possible. A working group has been established to develop proposals, but for reasons of size has not been designed to be representative of the various groups. A forum will be held before publication to ensure that stakeholder groups and others have a formal opportunity to consider possible proposals and contribute their views. The department has already had submissions from a number of professional organisations and others are of course welcome to write with theirs. Whether or not there is formal consultation on the action plan or elements of it will depend on the nature of the measures.</p>

The chief executive of the National Offender Management Service is the ultimate authority for each contract. With the exception of HMP &amp; YOI Ashfield, this is delegated to regional offender managers for the area where the prison is located. Within each of the contracted establishments is a Home Office controller whose task is to ensure adherence to the contract on a day-to-day basis and to take remedial action in the event of non-compliance. The Home Office controllers are line-managed through the regional offender manager. The attached table lists contracted adult establishments and their respective regional offender managers.</p>
