	<p pid="b.21.2/1">DfID has agreed to allocate up to &pound;20 million per year to support development projects in the Helmand province. We have allocated &pound;1 million annually to a &pound;3 million quick impact fund, which will be managed by the provincial reconstruction team and include money from other parts of the UK Government. It will fund small-scale projects in a number of areas including community development; stabilisation activities implemented by local non-governmental organisations in areas where the Government of Afghanistan cannot work; and support to refurbish drug rehabilitation clinics. This may include irrigation schemes; local access roads; canal cleaning; and skills training for women and war widows. Sustainability will be a criterion for assessing the use of quick impact funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/2">The majority of DfID funding to Helmand will go through Government of Afghanistan national programmes to build the capacity of the Government and extend their authority throughout the country. DfID's support will help strengthen key institutions of government including the Office of the Governor; the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development; and the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Food. DfID also supports programmes that promote alternatives to poppy production in Helmand, including the development of legal crops, access to agricultural services and broader rural development issues such as infrastructure, access to credit and markets and skills development.</p>

	<p pid="b.21.5/1">During the beef export ban, UK beef could be exported only after meeting strict traceability and processing criteria laid down in legislation. Following the EU decision on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase> to lift the ban on UK beef, it is expected that legislation to allow beef from Northern Ireland to be treated in Europe will be in force by the end of April. That is a very welcome move and will allow exports of Northern Ireland beef and cattle to resume as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.5/2">Because of the beef export ban, Northern Irish beef has not been promoted in Europe. However, the Government have been proactive in recent months, undertaking a wide range of vital preliminary work in anticipation of the lifting of the ban. It has included commissioning extensive research into export market opportunities and assessing the export potential of Northern Ireland companies; the provision of access to Food From Britain's world-wide network of international buyer contacts; and funding a three-year, &pound;1.2 million beef market restoration programme, carried out by the Livestock and Meat Commission, a major element of which aims to assist local companies develop successful export businesses in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.5/3">Under current EC state aid rules, the spending of public money on any promotional activity is severely restricted, and government support for promotion based solely on product origin is banned. However, I can assure the noble Lord that the Government will continue to make every effort to facilitate the complex and lengthy state aid approval process in order to maximise benefits to industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.2/1">Individual support orders (ISOs) are already widely available for the courts, and they are obliged to consider making the orders in every case where a stand-alone anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) is issued to a person aged 10&ndash;17 years. There are currently no plans to expand the scope of ISOs or extend them for use with adults. We are keen to increase the uptake of ISOs and are working both with the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) to ensure that local areas are aware of the benefits of this support. Drug intervention orders will be available later this year. Although there are currently no plans to extend the drug intervention orders to adults whose behaviour is not drug-related, we are keen to see what more we can do to support adults with ASBOs who have special support needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.2/1">The Urban Regeneration and Community Development Group within the Department for Social Development utilises different policies and regeneration tools to tackle disadvantage and deprivation and consequently promote economic regeneration and employment opportunities. The department's comprehensive development schemes and urban development grants unlock development opportunities by releasing underused or derelict land and buildings to encourage economic and physical regeneration and promote job creation, inward investment and environmental improvement. In addition, the department launched the neighbourhood renewal strategy in 2003, aimed at tackling deprivation in the top 10 per cent. most deprived areas in Northern Ireland.

	<p pid="b.24.2/4">The overall aim of the EU programme is to move Northern Ireland to a state of sustainable prosperity in a competitive modern economy by focusing on the restructuring of its businesses and the key skills development of its people while maintaining a quality environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.3/1">The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) has a range of plans in place to improve access to emergency ambulance services throughout the Province that take account of the particular needs of rural areas. They include the introduction of single-manned paramedic vehicles (rapid responders) capable of responding more quickly to an emergency and enable life-preserving treatment to be administered until a conventional ambulance arrives to transport the patient to hospital. The implementation of the advanced medical priority despatch system allows ambulance control to target resources to life-threatening calls and incorporates caller advice whereby callers are given advice on life-saving techniques until an ambulance arrives.</p>

NIAS is also working with a range of stakeholders, including the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, to introduce first and co-responder schemes whereby members of the public are trained in life-preserving first aid and can be called on in an emergency to stabilise a patient until an ambulance arrives.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.6/1">The helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) feasibility study, commissioned jointly by DHSSPS and the Department of Health and Children in the Republic of Ireland to assess the costs and benefits of any future all-Ireland helicopter emergency medical service, found no advantage for a dedicated HEMS in Ireland. Although the report concluded that the most feasible option for an air ambulance service would be in a non-emergency role, providing inter-hospital transfers for patients requiring specialist care, it did not make a recommendation to that effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.6/2">In its response to the report, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety indicated that it would give priority to the modernisation of ground services in order to improve emergency response times. The department continues to work with NIAS and the four health and social services boards to achieve that aim. An additional &pound;400,000 has been provided in 2006&ndash;07 to enable NIAS to secure additional ambulance deployment points. Some &pound;29 million of strategic investment programme funds have been earmarked to modernise and upgrade ambulance fleet, estate and communications systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.3/1">The Home Office has had a public service agreement (PSA) since 2002 to bring about measurable improvements in race equality and community cohesion across a range of performance indicators, as part of the Government's objectives on equality and social inclusion. This PSA target was rolled forward in 2004 to &quot;reduce race inequalities and build community cohesion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.3/2">In 2005, the Government published <i>Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society</i>, the first cross-departmental strategy to increase community cohesion and race equality, which includes a focus on ensuring that racism is unacceptable by improving the way in which the police and other agencies handle reports of racist or religiously motivated incidents; improving the reporting of racially motivated incidents; ensuring vigorous prosecution of racially and religiously aggravated offences; reducing racist reoffending; and providing greater support for victims and witnesses. In addition, for example, we have passed the new Racial and Religious Hatred Act; introduced citizenship education in secondary schools; launched a non-statutory framework for religious education; and established Holocaust memorial day. All of that will help with tackling racist attitudes.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.3/3">The Government are also ensuring that community cohesion is mainstreamed into all areas of work. For example, it has been embedded into the comprehensive performance assessment process. The Home Office and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are also working with Government Offices to incorporate community cohesion into the local area agreements. An action guide on community cohesion was revised in 2004 to assist local authorities and their partners. An &pound;18 million Connecting Communities Plus grants programme over three years was launched in October. It will provide funding for race equality and community cohesion projects from 2006&ndash;07 to underpin the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.3/4">Measures have been taken to tackle ethnic segregation, particularly in housing, education and the workplace. In housing, one of the practical measures preventing communities becoming more segregated is a choice-based lettings scheme, which crucially has provided people with practical support in moving into areas that they may not traditionally have seen as being for them. In addition, we are looking at a new approach to creating what we call &quot;mixed communities&quot; in areas of disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.3/5">We want schools to have well balanced intakes, and we endorse the use of banding in the schools White Paper, as it tends to produce genuinely comprehensive school populations. Building on the good work that already takes place in many areas, the White Paper also sets out our plans to develop further networking and collaboration between schools, such as between schools with very different ethnic populations.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.3/6">The Government's ethnic minority employment task force is committed to increasing the percentage of people from ethnic minorities and reducing the difference from the overall employment rate. Also, the ethnic minority outreach programme, funded by Jobcentre Plus, involves private and voluntary organisations reaching people who do not normally engage with Jobcentre or other services and helping them to find a job or become more employable. Progress against the current PSA target is published in the annual autumn performance report. We will publish an annual review of progress against the strategy in summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.2/1">These issues are important themes in the Government's work to build community cohesion and empower people to influence decisions. <i>Community Pride, not Prejudice</i> highlighted how perceptions by one group that it is treated less favourably than another can lead to community tension. To help overcome this, the Home Office and the ODPM jointly published, in 2003 and 2004, advice for people responsible for designing area-based initiatives and for local residents and practitioners who deliver such initiatives. The advice emphasises the importance of preparing established residents for change; involving local people in deciding funding priorities; and keeping residents fully informed of the reasoning behind the allocation of funding. The ODPM is encouraging stakeholders to take account of these principles, particularly in the Thames Gateway programme and the mixed communities approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.2/2">The Government have supported the publication in 2004 and 2005 of guidance by a number of agencies to help ensure that the media report matters affecting cohesion in a way that avoids inflaming tensions and to help councils work with the media to achieve that. The Government believe that that engagement with all sections of local communities is vital to the successful delivery of public policies and services and contributes to the building of cohesive communities. <i>Together We Can</i> is a cross-government initiative to empower more people to influence decisions. Practical measures include the establishment of the &quot;civic pioneers&quot; network of local authorities to share good practice on engagement and the &quot;Active Learning for Active Citizens&quot; programme, which provides citizenship education to adults. Youth engagement initiatives include a project with the UK Youth Parliament to explore the use of video to capture community views and to present young people's views.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.5/1">In response to decisions to reform post-primary education in Northern Ireland, the Government have received representations from grammar schools and members of the public. These have contrasted the levels of educational achievement attained by some pupils in Northern Ireland with those in England and attribute it to the system of academic selection. However, they fail to acknowledge that, although the current arrangements for post-primary education in Northern Ireland do well for some pupils, they do less well for others.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.5/2">The new arrangements for post-primary education will raise standards for all pupils by ending a system of academic selection where a child's future is determined on the basis of two tests at age 11.

	<p pid="b.35.3/2">Our corporation tax regime is a UK-wide system, and introducing different rates in different parts of the UK could distort competition. It would also result in a system that would place a significant administrative burden on businesses and on the Government. Many companies trade in different regions of the UK, and it would not be easy to determine which proportion of their profits was liable at which rate. In addition, such a measure could also create opportunities for some companies to manipulate the rules simply to benefit from a lower rate.</p>
