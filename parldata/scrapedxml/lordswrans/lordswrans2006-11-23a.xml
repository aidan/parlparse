	<p pid="a.13.2/1">Guidance for the police on investigating serious sexual offences, including rape, published by the National Centre for Policing Excellence in 2005, sets out the principles for investigative interviewing, including the use of bad character evidence where the suspect has a propensity to be untruthful. The guidance also advises officers to work on the premise that victim reports are accurate unless the victim informs them otherwise or unless an officer uncovers information that contradicts the victim's account. Where there is evidence that a complaint is false, the CPS should consider whether the person who made the allegation should be charged with wasting police time or perverting the course of justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.2/1">I understand from my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health that the common law of confidentiality limits the circumstances in which personal health information can be disclosed without the consent of the patient concerned. Breaches are allowed where there is a mandatory statutory obligation to do so or where an overriding public interest exists. The Department of Health has issued guidance (<I>Confidentiality: NHS Code of Practice</I>), which advises that public interest disclosures should be made only where it is necessary to help to investigate or prevent serious crime, e.g. child abuse, murder or rape. A copy of this guidance is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/2">A number of statutes also impose a duty to disclose personal health information in certain circumstances. The Terrorism Act 2000 (Section 19) places a statutory obligation on health professionals to disclose relevant personal health information where they believe an offence under the Act has been committed. In addition, where information is disclosed to the Serious Organised Crime Agency under the guidance described above, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Section 34) exempts disclosure made to the agency from any obligations of confidentiality.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.5/1">General Salah Abdallah Gosh applied to visit the UK for urgent medical treatment on two separate occasions. He was granted single-entry visas to travel in March and August this year. While he was here, UK officials took the opportunity to raise the issue of Darfur with him. He is an influential member of the Sudanese Government and it therefore makes sense to raise matters of concern with him. At present he is not subject to any UN or EU sanctions or travel restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">Meetings between US and Sudanese officials are a matter for the US and Sudanese Governments.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.2/1">Some progress has been made on implementing the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA). However, implementation needs to be accelerated. We are pressing both sides to overcome the main obstacles to this, including resolution of the Abyei boundary and the oil commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/2">Any progress on the CPA risks being unravelled by the ongoing crisis in Darfur. There have been far too many unfulfilled promises from all sides to the Darfur conflict. The international community cannot stand by and allow this appalling situation to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/3">The UK has been at the forefront of efforts to help to find a lasting solution to the Darfur crisis. This will be achieved only through a political process to which all sides are committed. We welcome the agreement reached in Addis Ababa on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-16">16 November</phrase>. This will allow for more and better-resourced peacekeeping troops on the ground and for a renewed political process for Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/4">We will keep up the pressure on the Government of Sudan and the rebel movements to fulfil their commitments on Darfur. We will also continue to press the Government of Sudan to speed up implementation of the CPA and the eastern Sudan peace agreement for the rest of Sudan. These political processes offer the best hope for peace across Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.5/1">It is unacceptable that the Government of Sudan have not done more to carry out their obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution (SCR) 1556, which was passed in July 2004, and subsequent SCRs to disarm the Janjaweed. The disarmament of the Janjaweed became a key part of the security arrangements contained in the Darfur peace agreement (DPA), which the Government of Sudan signed in May this year. However, the Government of Sudan have failed to honour their commitment. Together with our international partners, we have raised the issue repeatedly with the Sudanese Government and at the joint commission, the body responsible for overseeing implementation of the security arrangements set out in the DPA. We will continue to do so until the Government of Sudan take their obligations seriously.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.0/1">(a) Contravention of a weight restriction imposed by a local traffic regulation order carries the standard fixed penalty for a non-endurable offence. This was increased from &pound;20 to &pound;30 on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-01">1 November 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/2">(b) The penalty levels associated with all fixed penalty offences are kept under review by the Home Office-chaired fixed penalty procedures working group.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/3">In reviewing the level of fixed penalties, the group takes account of many different factors. Inflation is only one of these. Others include the importance of traffic control and road safety, the overall fixed penalty structure and effect of any changes in government policy, the level of court-imposed fines for the same offences, the impact on low-income groups, and the need to set penalties at levels that offenders will pay without contesting but which will also act as a deterrent. To date, the group has not considered that there is a sufficiently strong case to recommend to Ministers an increase in the fixed penalty level.</p>
