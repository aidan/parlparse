	<p pid="a.121.5/2">While bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has not been found in the United Kingdom sheep flock, and the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) has advised that the prevalence of BSE in the UK sheep flock may be zero and in the worst case that no more than 10 flocks would be affected, SEAC has also advised that maintenance of current surveillance levels and risk reduction measures such as the feed ban and specific risk material (SRM) controls would minimise the risk of an epidemic and risk to human health were BSE ever to enter the sheep flock. In addition, a possible human health risk from atypical scrapie cannot, at present, be ruled out. For these reasons, precautionary SRM controls on sheep and goats remain in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/3">The requirement to remove sheep spinal cord as SRM is set out in directly applicable European Union legislation. Any potential changes to these controls would need to be supported by the European Commission and have the support of other member states and the European Parliament before they could be implemented in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.8/1">Article 1 of the text of the convention adopted in Dublin on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-30">30 May</phrase> prohibits future states parties from using, developing, producing, otherwise acquiring, stockpiling, retaining or transferring to anyone, whether directly or indirectly, cluster munitions. It also prohibits future states parties from assisting, encouraging or inducing anyone to engage in prohibited activity. Article 19 prevents future states parties from entering reservations against the convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.8/2">The text offers, for the first time, an internationally agreed definition of cluster munitions, based on certain physical and technical criteria. Munitions not falling under the definition of a cluster munition are outside the scope of the convention and are not subject to its provisions. One such munition is the ballistic sensor-fused munition, which is due to enter service with the UK Armed Forces in 2012. As I made clear in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-03">3 June</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 80), Dublin participants were satisfied that this weapon will serve its military purpose without contributing to the post-conflict humanitarian problems which the convention is designed to address.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.5/2">a hate incident is any incident which is perceived by the victim or any other person as being motivated by hate or prejudice; anda hate crime is any incident which contributes to a criminal offence, perceived by the victim or any other person as being motivated by prejudice or hate.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.5/3">Hate crime is not specifically mentioned in any Act of Parliament. However, any act of violence will be brought under the appropriate legislation as determined by the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.5/4">The law as it stands protects everybody from violence such as assault, criminal damage or harassment. It also protects people from incitement to any offence, including offences such as harassment and criminal damage as well as all forms of violence. Existing legislation ensures aggravated sentencing for any offence which is motivated by hostility on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation and disability. Guidelines ensure that there are a range of further aggravating factors which the court must take into account when sentencing. These include the vulnerability of the victim, additional degradation of the victim, and the offenders working in a group or gang.</p>

However, the Act is designed to help to prevent this deplorable and unacceptable practice from happening in the first place and anecdotal evidence suggests that it is doing this. It is also being used to raise awareness among relevant professionals, including police forces and others in the Criminal Justice System and those involved with healthcare, social services and the education sector so that girls at risk can be identified. And there is evidence that the law is being pursued vigorously. The Metropolitan Police Child Abuse Investigation Command, for example, has specifically targeted female genital mutilation and produced a comprehensive training pack which has been disseminated widely to London's schools and many other agencies. Ultimately, educating communities to abandon the practice is the best way forward to break the cycle of mutilation and the Act continues to be widely used for that purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.3/1">We have no plans to test imported pigs, poultry and their meat for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. The FSA has not previously conducted any surveys for the presence of MRSA in raw meats (whether imported or home-reared) at the point of retail sale. At present, the FSA does not intend to conduct such a survey as the results would not change policy advice on the handling of meat.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/2">The UK is taking part in an EU-wide survey which includes testing for MRSA in breeding pig herds, running from January to December. The issue of MRSA in other livestock species is actively monitored by the Defra Antimicrobial Resistance Co-ordination (DARC) group. At present, there is no evidence that food-producing animals form a reservoir of MRSA infection in the UK and the organism has not been detected in farmed livestock in the UK. The sub-group concluded that broadening the scope of work in this area should only be considered if recommended by colleagues specialising in public health and that, in the absence of such recommendations, speculative investigation of other species for MRSA was not an appropriate use of the limited resources available.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.5/1">We are not aware of an Interpol red notice against Colonel Siagian Burhanuddin, but we do know that Colonel Burhanuddin was indicted by the UN's Serious Crimes Unit in East Timor. However, both Indonesia and East Timor have insisted that it is for their respective countries to resolve these human rights issues between them.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/2">The UK has consistently expressed concern to both the Indonesian and East Timorese Governments about impunity for those responsible for human rights abuses in East Timor. These issues are pursued through their bilateral Commission for Truth and Friendship. We have encouraged both Governments to make the Commission for Truth and Friendship a process that enjoys the confidence of the victims and the international community. A report on events during the 1999 independence vote is expected to be published by the Commission for Truth and Friendship shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/2"><I>Letter from Colin Mowl, Director of Macroeconomics and National Accounts, to Lord Tebbit, dated June 2008.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/3">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your Question on our assessment of the reliability of our estimate of the population of the United Kingdom. I am replying in her absence. (HL3904)</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/4">The accuracy of the United Kingdom (UK) mid-year population estimate is dependent on the quality of data available to measure components of population change (births, deaths and migration). International migration is the hardest component to measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/5">Of the data sources used to estimate population estimates:</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/6">the Census provides a reliable base; estimates of the reliability of the latest Census have been published and are available here: <a href="http://www.statistics">www.statistics</a>. gov.uk/census2001/annexa.asp;birth and death registrations are considered to accurately reflect numbers of events occurring in this country; andinternational migration is difficult to estimate, though good use is made of available sources, but estimates are subject to a margin of confidence (as is discussed below).</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/7">The principal source of international migration data is the International Passenger Survey (IPS). As with all surveys, the IPS is subject to sampling variability. Standard errors, a measure of how much a sample estimate differs from the true value because of random effects, can be calculated from IPS estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/8">All sources also have non-sampling errors, such as non-response and errors in the answers given by respondents to surveys. In common with all national statistics institutes that estimate population change from a census, the ONS does not currently provide a single error measure to summarise the sources of uncertainty in estimation.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/9">Each time data become available from a new census, the ONS is able to review the accuracy of population estimates made since the previous census by using the newly available information. The comparison that followed the census in 2001 highlighted the difficulty of estimating migration accurately.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/10">It is considered that errors accumulated particularly in the latter half of the decade as the volume of migration flows increased in the late 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/11">The need to improve migration and population estimates and provide more information on their accuracy has been recognised by the ONS for some time. In particular, the National Statistician commissioned an interdepartmental task force to look at how international migration estimates could be improved. It made recommendations in five broad areas to improve the compilation and presentation of international migration statistics, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/12">improving the data available on numbers entering and leaving the United Kingdom;making effective use of new and existing administrative and survey data sources;improving local population estimates and projections used in allocating resources and developing services;improving the public reporting of population and migration statistics; andestablishing a wider range of timely indicators and analysis to inform the evidence base on migration and its impacts on policy and public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-04">4 February 2008</phrase>, the Minister for Local Government announced to the House that a cross-government programme would be put in place to improve population and migration statistics, driven by senior officials from central government and the Local Government Association, and led by the National Statistician. It will take forward the recommendations of the 2006 interdepartmental task force on migration statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/14">This is high priority work for the ONS and other government departments and is being progressed with due pace. Future progress will be reported through the improving migration and population statistics page on the website: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/specific/population/future/imps/updates/default.asp">www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/specific/population/future/imps/updates/default.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/15">Some changes have already been put in place. For example, the sample size of the International Passenger Survey was increased to collect more information on the flows of emigrants and further changes have been made to the IPS to enhance the coverage of migrants as they enter or leave the UK. Improvements were also implemented in 2007 to the methodology used for distributing migrants to the local authority level in the mid-year population estimates.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.5/1">I am informed by the Environment Agency Wales that the Environment Agency has not yet formally concluded its &quot;appropriate person&quot; determination in respect of Brofiscin Quarry. It expects to do so shortly in compliance with the relevant legislation and statutory guidance. Encouraging voluntary remediation is an important objective of the contaminated land regime and the Environment Agency is currently exploring opportunities for such an approach.</p>
