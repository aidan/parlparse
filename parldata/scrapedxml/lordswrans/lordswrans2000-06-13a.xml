<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-06-13a.191.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="191"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000613/text/00613w01.htm#00613w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.191.2/1">I am today launching the Quinquennial Review of the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/2">Reviews of Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) are an important part of our modernisation programme to modernise government. The Government are committed to achieving better public services that are of higher quality and are more responsive to the needs of the people who use them. Regular NDPB reviews are an important element in ensuring that we have in place the right structures to deliver the Government's agenda effectively and to provide a strong focus on improving future performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/3">The terms of reference for the review of the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils are:</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/4" class="indent">CCLRC was established in February 1995 and so it is due for review in the course of 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/5" class="indent">The review of CCLRC will have two stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/6">The first stage will examine the role, organisation and composition and funding mechanisms for CCLRC, by reference to its charter and mission, its past performance, recent CCLRC-instigated studies on future vision and funding, current best practice for NDPBs and contribution to the work of other Research Councils. All relevant options for the future of the Council will be considered, including abolition, continued NDPB status, rationalisation, privatisation or strategic contracting out.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/7">The conduct of the second stage will be dependent on and informed by the outcome of the first. If the first stage confirms the continued operation of CCLRC in its present or another form, this stage will examine the opportunities for improving performance by reference to such issues as management structures, aims and objectives, performance targets and service standards, use of new technology, levels of delegated authority and effective accountability. In that event, the review will take account of evidence of work already undertaken to review and improve performance. Opportunties for expanding the present range of users of facilities and services and optimising the contribution of facilities and services to exploitable research will also be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/8">The review will be conducted in accordance with the latest Cabinet Office guidance (published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-31">31 January 2000</phrase>) and will include consultation, either in person or in writing, with members of council, staff of the Executive and CCLRC's customers and key stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/9">The review team will report at intervals to a review board. It will be the task of the review board to respond flexibly to the reviewer's proposals during the progress of the review, each member contributing guidance and knowledge, including, where appropriate, the good offices of his or her department or organisation. The review board will ensure that Ministers, the Treasury, the Cabinet Office and the staff and customers of the CCLRC are kept informed of the progress of the review and will facilitate the gathering of information for the reviewer and his or her communication with staff and customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/10">The review will be supported by officials in the Office of Science and Technology, with specialist advice as appropriate. The review board will be chaired by Sir Peter Williams and will include key stakeholder representatives. The aim will be to complete each stage of the review within a period of approximately three months, as recommended in the Cabinet Office guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/11">As indicated in the terms of reference, the Review Team is seeking the views of interested parties. A questionnaire is available from the CCLRC website (http.//<a href="http://www.clrc.ac.uk/qreview">www.clrc.ac.uk/qreview</a>) or from:</p>

	<p pid="a.193.8/1">The turnout figures for the Mayor and London Assembly elections include all those who spoiled their ballot papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.8/2">In the Mayor and Assembly election on <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-04">4 May</phrase>, each elector had four opportunities to vote--first choice for Mayor, second choice for Mayor, constituency assembly member and London member. If an elector chose not to vote in any one of the four ballots by leaving the ballot paper &quot;blank&quot;--as they have every right to do--this was recorded as a &quot;rejected&quot; vote. Other &quot;rejected&quot; votes were &quot;multiple votes&quot;, where the voter had voted more than once, papers where marks identify the voter and &quot;uncertain votes&quot;, where the voter's intention was not clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.8/3">Thirty eight thousand, one hundred and forty-one ballot papers for the Mayor election were rejected; 293,168 voters did not give a valid second preference for Mayor. For the London Assembly, 161,972 ballot papers in the Constituency Member election were classified as rejected and 88,142 ballot papers in the London Member election were classified as rejected. The vast majority of rejected papers were left blank, so it is clear that whilst most electors gave a first choice for Mayor, a large number decided not to give a second choice for Mayor, or vote for the Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.8/4">The number of rejected ballot papers at GLC elections were:</p>
	<p pid="a.193.8/5" class="indent">1964* 8,213</p>

The amendments will make provision for the creation of Conservation Boards for individual, larger AONBs where this would benefit their cohesive management and where there is local support for such a move. They will also require the adoption of a Management Plan for each AONB.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.2/2">The Government have already indicated their support for AONBs through increasing the budget available to them via the Countryside Agency almost threefold over three years (from &pound;2.1 million in 1998-99 to &pound;5.9 million this year). We will continue to ensure that Government funding is available to work alongside local authorities in managing AONBs in partnership.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">The Government accept the view put by the then Countryside Commission in Section 4 of their publication Protecting our finest landscapes: advice to Government (1998), that the landscape qualities of National Parks and Areas of Oustanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) are equivalent. Conserving and enhancing the beauty of the landscape are objectives for both types of designation. The Government therefore believe that the protection given to both types of area by the land use planning system should also be equivalent.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/2">The Government's planning policies for AONBs are set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 7: The Countryside--Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development (Revised February 1997). PPG7 states that &quot;The Government regards National Park Designation as conferring the highest status of protection as far as landscape and scenic beauty are concerned.&quot; This reflects the National Park Authorities' primary objective to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the Parks. It does not mean that the landscape beauty of AONBs is in any way inferior to that of National Parks. AONBS should therefore share the highest status of protection in relation to landscape and scenic beauty.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/3">In relation to major projects, it is the Government's view that, henceforth, the assessment required in paragraph 4.5 of PPG7 in National Parks should also apply to proposals for major development in AONBs. Such proposals should be demonstrated to be in the public interest before being allowed to proceed. Consideration of applications should therefore normally include an assessment of:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/4" class="indent">(i) the need for the development, in terms of national considerations, and the impact of permitting it or refusing it on the local economy;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/5" class="indent">(ii) the cost of and scope for developing elsewhere outside the area or meeting the need for it in some other way;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/6" class="indent">(iii) any detrimental effect on the environment and the landscape, and the extent to which that should be moderated.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/7">The guidance in the preceding paragraph therefore replaces the last two sentences of paragraph 4.8 of PPG7.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.5/2">Political agreement was reached by the Council on a directive implementing the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of their racial or ethnic origin.

I have also today laid before the House the Government's response to the committee's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/2">The Government are very grateful to the committee for the report of its inquiry. Mr Mitrokhin's information is uniquely valuable. Its authenticity has been proved beyond doubt. The Government have drawn a number of conclusions from the information itself, from the publication project and from the findings of the Intelligence and Security Committee's inquiry. The most significant are:</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/3" class="indent">(i) The KGB posed a major threat to British interests but the United Kingdom's security and intelligence agencies were notably successful in containing this threat. After the expulsion of more than 100 Soviet intelligence officers in 1971, the KGB found the United Kingdom an extremely difficult target and operational environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/4" class="indent">(ii) Mr Mitrokhin himself is a brave man who was determined in his efforts to expose the KGB. The Government pay tribute to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/5" class="indent">(iii) Credit is due to the Secret Intelligence Service for its role in getting Mr Mitrokhin and his material safely to the United Kingdom. This was a tremendous intelligence coup. Credit is also due to the security and intelligence agencies for their work in exploiting the material. This has been beneficial not only for the UK but also for many other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/6" class="indent">(iv) The publication project, leading to The Mitrokhin Archive, allowed Mr Mitrokhin's material to be made available to a wider readership. The Government believe that it was right to put this historic record into the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/7" class="indent">(v) Lessons have been learnt from the handling of Mrs Norwood's case.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/8">Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our intelligence and security agencies for their dedication and professionalism in protecting our vital national interests.</p>
