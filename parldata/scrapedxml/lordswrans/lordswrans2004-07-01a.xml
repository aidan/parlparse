Under Article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, if an occupying power considers it necessary for imperative reasons of security, it may intern individuals as security internees.

	<p pid="a.47.2/1">The Strategy Unit report <i>Waste Not Want Not</i> estimated that nappies comprised around 2 per cent of household waste, equivalent to 350,000 tonnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/2">Following the publication of <i>Waste Not Want Not</i> the Government accepted the recommendation that the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) should take forward (as part of an overall waste minimisation initiative) work on supporting reusable nappies through the provision of support for new businesses and information to parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/3">The aim of the WRAP programme is to achieve an average diversion of 225kg per year per participating household. WRAP's target is to convert 155,000 households to reusable nappies by end of fiscal year 2006. This is an ambitious target and if achieved would create a reduction in household waste of 35,000 tonnes (per annum).</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/4">The WRAP budget for its nappies work for 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;1.2 million.</p>

They are, however, subject to the main principles of the European treaty of non-discrimination based on nationality (i.e. equality of treatment), transparency and mutual recognition.</p>

A planned replacement programme has been delayed but the lifts are now due back in service at the end of August 2004.
