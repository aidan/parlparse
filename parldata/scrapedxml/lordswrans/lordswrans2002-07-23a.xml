	<p pid="a.37.2/1">Over the course of the last year, a number of African leaders have been working together to draw up the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) which seeks to put in place the policies necessary in Africa for sustainable development. In response to this initiative, G8 leaders prepared an Africa Action Plan, which was finalised at the G8 Summit in Kananaskis.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">The G8 plan includes a commitment that half or more of the new development funds announced at Monterrey (ie 6 billion dollars) could be used in African countries, but only if they put the NEPAD principles into practice and create the right policy environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/3">NEPAD itself is not a funding mechanism, and is not envisaged as a body that will implement projects. It is not therefore something that the UK will fund directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/4">We are, though committed to increasing significantly the levels of development assistance provided to Africa. We have already doubled our bilateral assistance to Africa since 1997, and will increase it by a further 50 per cent so that by 2006 we will be spending &pound;1 billion in Africa each year.</p>

At Kananaskis, the G8 agreed on an Action Plan for Africa as an initial response to NEPAD. The plan is a good first step in what we see as a long-term process of building a new partnership with Africa. There is more to be done to implement the commitments expressed by both the Africans and the G8.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-23a.45.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="45"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020723/text/20723w03.htm#20723w03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.45.5/1">Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 requires local housing authorities to secure suitable accommodation for homeless applicants who are eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and have a priority need for accommodation for particular applicants having regard to the circumstances and needs of the applicant and their household. In determining whether accommodation is suitable for an applicant, authorities must have regard to Parts 9, 10 and 11 of the Housing Act 1996 which deal with slum clearance, overcrowding and houses in multiple occupation, respectively. Applicants have the right to ask for a review of the suitability of accommodation offered to them and, if dissatisfied with the authority's review decision, can appeal to the county court on a point of law.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/2">Where authorities secure accommodation for a homeless applicant under Part 7, they may require the applicant to pay reasonable charges for, or a reasonable contribution towards, the cost of the accommodation. Applicants on a low income may claim housing benefit towards the accommodation costs. The net costs to local authorities of securing accommodation for homeless applicants are funded through general grant. Costs related to the use of authorities' own housing stock which fall within the housing revenue account are supported by housing revenue account subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/3">The annual general grant for English local authorities has already been increased by &pound;8 million in respect of legislative changes that will be introduced by the Homelessness Act 2002 and the proposed Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) 2002. A further &pound;10 million will be allocated to English authorities this year to help them implement the priority need order.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/4">In March this year, a &pound;35 million programme was launched to help local authorities ensure that by March 2004 no homeless family with children is in B&amp;B other than in an emergency, and even then for no more than six weeks. Statutory guidance issued by my department makes it clear that if authorities do have to use bed-and-breakfast accommodation they should ensure that the accommodation meets statutory standards for houses in multiple occupation. My department is currently consulting with specialist bodies on draft proposals for minimum acceptable standards of B&amp;B accommodation in advance of a wider consultation in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/5">In London, over 450 hostels provide around 19,600 beds for single homeless people. Hostels are funded in several ways. These include rent/housing benefit, supported housing management grant (SHMG) which is provided through the Housing Corporation revenue grant and other funding such as Section 180 grant funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/6">As part of a drive to improve the information available to policy makers and service providers, the Homelessness Directorate set up within my department in March 2002 will investigate the range of accommodation available to homeless people. This will involve defining, and establishing, the number of different sorts of accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/7">Supporting People and the Homelessness Act 2002 requirement for local authorities to conduct homelessness reviews will also improve the information collected on hostel use. In addition, to ensure that best practice is replicated thorough the country we are exploring the feasibility of ensuring that hostels are inspected in a structured way, by either the voluntary or statutory sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.3/14">(1) Full resource budgeting basis, net of depreciation.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/15">(2) Consistent with previous control basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/16">When Defra was created, the objective was to have a step change in the way environment, agriculture and rural issues were treated in government. The aim was to create a department with sustainable development at its heart&mdash;and with responsibility for supporting sustainable development across government. For Defra this means working to achieve a better environment at home and internationally. It also means a food and farming industry working within a prosperous countryside, producing the food that consumers want in harmony with the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/17">For the Government as a whole, sustainable development goes much further. The vital importance of sustainable development for government as a whole underlay the decision to make it a central theme of the Spending Review. As custodian of the Government's sustainable development strategy, I particularly welcome the elements of the settlement, for my own department and for others, which will deliver significant improvements in key policy areas. These include.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/18" class="indent">Climate change&ndash;&ndash;where we will invest in innovation to meet our climate change objectives, building on existing funding for renewable energy sources with an additional &pound;38 million in 2005&ndash;06 compared with 2002&ndash;03, and make further progress towards our greenhouse gas emissions targets;</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/19" class="indent">Health&ndash;&ndash;where we have announced the biggest ever sustained spending growth in the history of the NHS, to improve health outcomes and the quality of care for patients;</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/20" class="indent">Education&ndash;&ndash;where increased spending and further reforms are aimed at getting and helping 16&ndash;19 year olds into further education;</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/21" class="indent">And Crime&ndash;&ndash;where extra funding for the police will help them target reductions in vehicle crime, domestic burglaries and robbery, and reduce the gap between the highest crime local areas and the best comparable areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/22" class="indent">In addition, new spending on transport and regeneration will improve the quality of our local environments. For example, capital expenditure on capital transport plans&ndash;&ndash;which includes expenditure on home zones, cycling, walking and local safety schemes&ndash;&ndash;is doubling in real terms from 2001&ndash;11 as part of the Ten Year Transport Plan. The neighbourhood renewal fund is being increased from &pound;400 million in 2003&ndash;04 to &pound;525 million in 2005&ndash;06, in part reflecting an increased commitment to safer and cleaner communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/23">Let me now explain how the Spending Review settlement will impact on Defra's programmes over the next three years and will assist the department in pursuing its aims and objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/24">Sustainable Farming and Food</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/25">When Defra was created, the farming industry was in crisis. Foot and Mouth disease, coupled with the lowest farm incomes in many years, had destroyed farmers' confidence, and in some cases, their livelihoods. The review provides Defra with the resources to make progress&ndash;&ndash;working together with the industry&ndash;&ndash;towards a more sustainable future for the farming and food industries. Investment totalling over &pound;500 million over three years will be available to support the key recommendations of the policy commission chaired by Sir Don Curry, and to improve animal health and welfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/26">Action through the England Rural Development Programme, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/27" class="indent">A new broad and shallow agri-environment scheme which will reward farmers for delivering environmentally friendly outcomes to be piloted over the next two years and then rolled out in full in 2005&ndash;06;</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/28" class="indent">An expansion of schemes such as the Rural Enterprise Scheme, the Processing and Marketing Grants Scheme and the Vocational Training Scheme to assist people in rural areas retrain, diversify and extend their businesses;</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/29" class="indent">A more efficient food chain;</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/30" class="indent">Enhanced farm advice; and</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/31" class="indent">Further measures to improve animal health and welfare, including livestock identification and tracing systems, enhanced testing for TSE-type disease (such as BSE); and further action to prevent illegal meat imports.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/32">The additional funding will rise to &pound;200 million in 2005&ndash;06, of which &pound;75 million has been specifically allocated to fund, alongside equivalent EU funding, the full roll-out of the new agri-environment scheme in England. Additional funding will also be made available to the devolved administrations to allow them to increase expenditure on their rural development programmes. In return for the investment in their industry, farmers will be expected to play their part in making the industry sustainable, for example by acting to reduce the risks of animal disease. I know they will co-operate with us fully in achieving these joint goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/33">The Government will continue to press for radical reform of the common agriculture policy (CAP) in the negotiations on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 which began earlier this week. But the resources allocated in the Spending Review allow Defra to press ahead with reform and modernisation of the farming industry now. The department will publish its strategy for sustainable farming and food in the autumn. I am very pleased that Sir Don Curry has agreed to chair a group which will act as a driver and overseer of change in the farming and food sectors through the implementation of the farming and food strategy, to ensure that we move rapidly towards a more sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food industry which contributes to a thriving rural economy. The group will report to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/34">The settlement recognises the need to prevent, control and manage the risk of animal disease, where we are driven by the memory of last year's outbreak of foot and mouth disease as well as the legacy of BSE. The additional resources provided will allow funding of a wide range of work on animal health issues. These measures will be set in the context of a comprehensive animal health and welfare strategy, as recommended by the policy commission. This will address ways in which the industry should bear its share of the costs of animal health controls and services. I am also pleased to be able to announce that we have secured additional funds to deal with bovine TB this year. These will be used to pay for the extra staff and resources already committed to work on the TB testing backlog and control measures, and additional casual staff who will be recruited to supplement this work. Testing is being carried out on the basis of a veterinary risk assessment, with those posing the greatest risk being tested first.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/35">A countryside for all to enjoy</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/36">In addition to the new agri-environment scheme, which will play an important role in making the countryside more attractive and in helping to preserve biodiversity, the Spending Review has allocated an additional &pound;5 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;10 million in 2005&ndash;06 for work in bringing our major wildlife sites into favourable condition. In addition, the extra funding of &pound;5 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;10 million in the two following years to implement the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act will increase public access and enjoyment of our beautiful countryside landscapes.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/37">Thriving rural economies and communities</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/38">The investment in sustainable food and farming, in improving the condition of sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and in opening up access to the countryside will benefit the wider rural economy. However, Defra's leadership role on rural affairs goes beyond this and our new rural PSA target reflects this. It commits us to reducing the gap in productivity between the least well-performing rural areas and the English average and making services more accessible for rural people. Defra will work with other government departments and agencies to deliver this and to ensure that the rural-proofing of their policies and programmes helps to deliver real improvements in prosperity and access to public services. The Spending Review White Paper sets out a range of commitments from other departments to deliver key services in rural areas and ensure that rural people benefit from the extra resources delivered through the review. The extra &pound;25 million allocated in the Settlement over three years will further increase the additional funds announced in the Rural White Paper to help regenerate in market towns and improve the ability of rural communities and the rural voluntary sector to deliver services in support of the socially excluded and progress towards solutions to key rural concerns in each region.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/39">Protecting our communities from flooding</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/40">Government investment in flood defence has increased significantly in real terms since 1997. Additional funding of &pound;15 million a year was made available in the wake of the autumn 2000 floods. The new funds over and above this which have been allocated in the Spending Review will ensure that this growth will now accelerate to reach 8.6 per cent a year in real terms over the SR2002 period. The further allocation to the department of &pound;15 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;40 million in 2005&ndash;06, together with the amounts available for grants to local authorities and the revenues we expect to be able to raise from new funding mechanisms, will deliver an increase of &pound;150 million in the third year of the review. This level of resources, together with simplification of the administration of flood defences and effective partnership working with homeowners, local government, the Environment Agency, scientists and the insurance industry, will allow us to reduce the risk of threats to life and damage to property from flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/41">Sustainable use of resources: the challenge from waste</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/42">The Spending Review settlement takes into account the pressures on local government and provides for spending on environmental, protective and cultural services, including waste management, to rise by &pound;671 million by 2005&ndash;06. The funds will also enable them to deal with the short-term problems of fridge disposal and changes to the legislation on hazardous waste. Final decisions on additional resources for addressing the challenge of growth in municipal waste and moving away from landfill disposal and on other policy measures will be made available when the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) publishes its report into sustainable waste management in the autumn. These decisions and those on landfill tax and the future of the Landfill Tax Credit Schems (LCTS) will deliver a step change in performance. Defras PSA target of 25 per cent recycling and composting of household waste by 2005&ndash;06 demonstrates the Government's commitment to radical reform of municipal waste management.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/43">Science</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/44">Evidence-based policy work is central Defra's approach. I want, at the very least, to maintain the department's expenditure on research in real terms over the Spending Review period. This is consistent with our commitment to the development of a strong and high quality science base. It will ensure that Defra's policy-making continues to be based in the latest evidence and scientific and economic analysis. We will aim to increase science spending in our identified priority areas. These include: environmental horizon-scanning, climate change and extreme weather, a supercomputer to strengthen the UK climate change research capability, non-food crops, organic food production and animal disease. We will also examine the findings of the foot and mouth disease inquiries closely and determine if any additional funding for research is required in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/45">Investment in the department</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/46">A theme of the Spending Review across all departments has been ensuring that they have the necessary capacity to deliver. That has been a primary focus of the developing Defra change programme that was set up after the department was created last year. Additional funding of &pound;140 million over the Spending Review period for investment in the department will enable it to take forward the next phase of the change programme flowing from the recent joint strategic review carried out with the Office for Public Service Reform (OPSR). The investment will give staff the tools they need to change their ways of working, focus on customers and deliver the high quality services that will build Defra's reputation as a respected, high performing, and efficient department.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/47">Forestry Commission</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/48">The Forestry Commission is funded on a net basis after taking account of the income it received, mainly from sales of timber from the public forests. Its timber income has fallen significantly in recent years due to a worldwide slump in timber prices. The Spending Review settlement provides additional funding of</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/49">&pound;5 million a year on top of the 2003&ndash;04 baseline to enable the commission to continue to drive forward the Government's England Forestry Strategy despite the reduction in timber income. This new money underlines forestry's important place in England's rural affairs and will allow the commission to extend sustainable forests management, restore more native woodlands, increase community forests and the role of forests in tackling industrial dereliction. In addition to the funding shown in the White Paper, the commission is also benefiting from special funding from the Capital Modernisation Fund and the Invest to Save Budget amounting to almost &pound;11 million in the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/50">Conclusion</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/51">Spending by the department in 2005&ndash;06 will be more than &pound;400 million higher than in 2002&ndash;03, supporting a programme of reform. It fulfils the Government's pledge to introduce a significant programme of measures to move the food and farming industries to a long-term sustainable basis, to create thriving and prosperous rural economies and communities and to improve the environment. And it takes full account of the department's lead role in promoting sustainable development across government for the good of our citizens, both now and in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.3/1">Tables 5.1 to 5.5 in the departmental report for 2002 contain a number of errors. These arose from differences in the way information is loaded on central databases, complications with compiling historical information following the recent machinery of government changes and the restructuring of Defra with the revised objectives that followed. Unfortunately, the tight timetable for producing these tables interfered with the quality assurance procedures that would normally have applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/2">The department's quality assurance procedures are being revised to prevent similar errors in future. Meanwhile, work is in hand to re&ndash;issue corrected tables. This is a signifiant task involving the re&ndash;loading of central databases which are subject to a number of timetable constraints. The intention is to provide revised figures by the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/3">Meanwhile, it is possible to clarify that underlying provision for resources available to control animal disease have risen in real terms over the period as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.58.3/6"> <td>1999&ndash;2000</td> <td>2000&ndash;01</td> <td>2001&ndash;02</td> <td>2002&ndash;03</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.58.3/11">These figures exclude expenditure incurred on foot and mouth disease, given that this was funded centrally out of the reserve. The drop seen in 2001&ndash;02 can be explained by the diversion of state veterinary staff to tackling foot and mouth disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/55">* Data for 1984 and earlier years have been combined as these pre-date the availability of the first HIV antibody test.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/57">Source:</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/58">Public Health Laboratory Service: data to the end of March 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/59">A number of trends are apparent from these data. It is important to note, however, that diagnosed infections may not reflect contemporary transmission patterns, as many years may elapse between infection and diagnosis. For example, a very high proportion of infections acquired through sex between men and women were recorded as probably acquired abroad, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, although more infections have been diagnosed among heterosexuals for the past three years, sex between men remains the predominant route of HIV transmission within the UK. Around half of all HIV-infected individuals currently living in the UK were infected by this route.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/60">The Sexual Health and HIV Strategy for England prioritises the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. In line with the epidemiology, HIV prevention and health promotion targets those groups most at risk, particularly men who have sex with men and heterosexuals from or with close links to African countries. For a number of years we have funded the Terrence Higgins Trust to undertake national HIV prevention work for gay men through the CHAPS project (Community HIV/AIDS Prevention Strategy). As part of the implementation of the Sexual Health and HIV Strategy we are working with the African HIV Policy Network and the National AIDS Trust to develop a strategic framework for HIV prevention. The strategy also announced a new information campaign for the general population in England to raise awareness of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV) and how they can be prevented. We plan to launch the new campaign later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/61">Furthermore, the routine offer and recommendation of an HIV test to all pregnant women is enabling women to benefit from treatment for themselves and for their babies to reduce the risk of mother to child transmission. An estimated 75 infections in infants were averted in 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.3/1">The Government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy recognises the importance of helping young people resist peer pressure to have early sex while seeking to ensure that those who are sexually active have easy access to high quality contraceptive advice. Under-16s are at particular risk of unprotected sex. Although over a quarter are sexually active, they are less likely than older teenagers to access services and use contraception. Teenagers who become pregnant often delay seeking advice from a health professional and are more likely to have late abortions and miss out on antenatal care.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/2">Improving access to professional advice by sexually active teenagers is a central strand of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. General practitioners have a key role to play in this. Best Practice Guidance on the Provision of Effective Contraception and Advice Services was issued in 2000 setting out the criteria against which services should be commissioned and provided. The guidance includes the provision of contraceptive advice to under-16s within the established legal framework and highlights that health professionals' duty of confidentiality to under-16s is the same as that owed to older patients. Services are also expected to provide early pregnancy testing, non-judgmental advice and, where abortion is the agreed option, quick referral to NHS funded abortion in line with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists evidence based guideline The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2000). General practitioners are expected to work to the principles of the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/3">Section 4 of the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, which relates to conscientious objection to abortion, does not extend to giving advice or performing the preparatory steps to arrange an abortion where the request meets the legal requirements. Such steps include referral to another doctor, without delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/4">Local teenage pregnancy strategy partnerships have been auditing services against the guidance to identify gaps in provision and plan improvements. Each area is developing plans with the relevant PCTs to support general practice in meeting the needs of their teenage patients. The Teenage Pregnancy Unit is also working closely with the Royal College of General Practitioners to develop relevant training materials.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">The draft Mental Health Bill does not define particular categories of mental disorder. This means that no particular clinical diagnosis will have the effect of limiting the way the powers are used. The same conditions will be used to determine whether an individual falls within the scope of the legislation whatever their diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/2">The Government have not attempted to produce new definitions for the terms described, but would accept those in general usage and agreed clinical definitions. There is an internationally recognised classification system for personality disorder and these clinical definitions are accepted in relation to the term personality disorder where it is used in the consultation document attached to the draft Mental Health Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/3">The World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric Association have produced definitions of personality disorder. The International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (ICD-10) (World Health Organisation 1992), defines a personality disorder as: &quot;a severe disturbance in the characterological condition and behavioural tendencies of the individual, usually involving several areas of the personality, and nearly always associated with considerable personal and social disruption&quot;. The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association 1994) defines a personality disorder as: &quot;an enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/4">The classification system does not distinguish between &quot;personality disorder&quot; and &quot;severe personality disorder&quot;. The term &quot;dangerous and severe personality disorder&quot; is not a recognised clinical classification.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/5">The term &quot;severe personality disorder&quot; is now in general use as a means of identifying, from within the millions of people with a degree of personality disorder in this country, the relatively small number whose condition is so serious as to require specialist interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/6">It is acknowledged that dangerous and severe personality disorder does not exist as a condition in its own right. The DSPD Programme has adopted the term DSPD as a working title and is currently developing&mdash;with clinicians and others&mdash;a supporting description that will be more meaningful to clinicians, lawyers and the general public. Any definition and description will be considered as part of the evaluation of the pilot projects.</p>

The Department of Health's Medical Devices Agency is responsible for enforcing regulations which cover safety and quality aspects of disability equipment. The agency investigates adverse incidents involving these products in conjunction with the manufacturers. Resultant design or material changes generally improve product quality.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">This Government are intent on securing the best value for money in its IT procurements by encouraging the development of a flourishing IT industry which supplies both proprietary and open source software solutions to the public sector. Government procurement decisions will be based on the ability of the solutions to deliver effective and economic systems and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">I am pleased to announce new policy on the use of open source software within UK Government. It explains how we will consider open source software solutions alongside proprietary ones in IT procurements and award contracts on a value for money basis, seeking to avoid lock-in to proprietary IT products and services. In addition, the UK Government will consider obtaining full rights to bespoke software code or customisations of COTS (commercial off the shelf) software it procures wherever this achieves best value for money. It will also explore further the possibilities of using OSS as the default exploitation route for government funded R&amp;D software.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/3">The open source software policy has been formulated for use within UK Government because we seek to embrace the fast moving pace of the software industry and to acknowledge the clear potential for open source software to change the software infrastructure marketplace. It also serves as an appropriate response to the recent European Commission's action plan for the initiative eEurope&mdash;An Information Society for all. UK Government, in joining with its European partners to explore the availability of open source software solutions, will seek to realise the significant potential for cost-savings in the future and to achieve an increased flexibility in the development, enhancement and integration of our IT systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.5/1">The Government have published the report of the review which was jointly sponsored by the Cabinet Office and the Treasury. Pam Alexander led the review. Copies of the review's report and recommendations have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/2">The review has far-reaching implications for improving the delivery of central government services. It concludes that the agency model has been a success in improving, and in some cases transforming, services and functions delivered by central government and has brought customer focus and a performance culture into the civil service. However, it finds that agencies have in some cases become detached from Ministers and from departments' increasing focus on strategic aims; controls over processes have reduced effectiveness and responsiveness without providing a shared strategic direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/3">The report makes 12 recommendations to achieve and maintain strategic connection and improve service delivery. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/4" class="indent">departmental leadership which values equally policy and delivery skills and agency management with a clear understanding of ministerial objectives;</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/5" class="indent">simpler governance structures providing strategic direction from departments and external challenge from non-executive directors on management boards;</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/6" class="indent">alignment of departmental and agency key targets and a cycle of reviews to ensure that structures and processes across departments support the achievement of key objectives; and</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/7" class="indent">maximum use of financial and managerial delegations to support responsive, flexible and effective delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/8">The Cabinet Office and Treasury will be working with departments to put the review's recommendations into effect over the coming months as part of the wider drive to improve the effectiveness of public services and place a culture of delivery at the heart of government.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-23a.69.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100395" speakername="Lord Macdonald of Tradeston" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020723/text/20723w07.htm#20723w07_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.69.2/1">Under the provisions of the Superannuation Act 1972, three amendment schemes have been placed before Parliament. The first of these amends the rules of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) and introduces new provisions for those joining the pension scheme on or after <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-01">1 October 2002</phrase>. The second amendment scheme makes consequential changes to the Civil Service Compensation Scheme, and the third amendment scheme removes the injury benefit provisions of the PCSPS to a separate scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">Pension arrangements for civil servants (and those in employments and offices listed in Schedule 1 to the Superannuation Act 1972) will change on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-01">1 October 2002</phrase>. New entrants joining after that date will generally be given the choice of a final salary pension or a stakeholder pension with an employer contribution. The new arrangements are being introduced on a cost-neutral basis for employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">We recognise that pensions form a significant part of the Civil Service remuneration package, and we want civil servants to be able to choose the pension that suits them best. Today's Civil Service does not offer a job for life and is benefiting from greater interchange with other sectors at all levels within the organisation. Final salary pensions may be good for those who spend a long period with one employer, but those who change jobs frequently during their career may prefer their employer to contribute to a stakeholder pension. By giving our new staff a choice of two good quality pension alternatives we aim not only to support a more diverse Civil Service but also to raise awareness and appreciation of the value of the pension element of the pay package.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/4">The new final salary option will be known as the premium scheme. It will provide a pension based on one-sixtieth of final pensionable earnings for each year of service. Other features of the premium scheme include:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/5" class="indent">option to exchange part of pension for lump sum on retirement;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/6" class="indent">ill-health pensions varying in amount depending on the extent of incapacity;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/7" class="indent">death-in-service lump sum of three times pay;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/8" class="indent">pensions for surviving spouses of 3/8ths of the member's pension;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/9" class="indent">pension payable to a surviving eligible unmarried partner if the member does not leave a spouse;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/10" class="indent">pensions for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/11">Existing members of the PCSPS will have the option of joining the premium scheme or remaining with the current provisions (to be renamed the classic scheme). Members opting for classic will continue to earn a pension based on 1/80th of pay for each year of service, plus a retirement lump sum of three times pension. Members opting to join the premium scheme will have their past service reduced&mdash;typically to 92 per cent of its previous amount&mdash;to reflect the improved benefit structure. Members may also opt for classic plus; this option effectively provides premium scheme benefits for service from <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> with service before <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> continuing to be pensioned broadly on the classic model.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/12">We are moving to the new arrangements on a cost-neutral basis, with the entire cost of benefit improvements being met by increased contributions by members. None of the cost of the benefit improvements will fall on the taxpayer. All premium and classic plus members will pay the new contribution rate of 3.5 per cent. Members opting to remain in the classic scheme will continue to pay contributions of 1.5 per cent of pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/13">The stakeholder pension alternative will be known as the partnership pension account. Employees will choose their pension provider from the following panel:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/14" class="indent">AMP Corporate Pensions</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/15" class="indent">Scottish Widows</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/16" class="indent">Standard Life</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/17" class="indent">TUC.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/18">Employees opting for a partnership pension account do not need to contribute but will be encouraged to do so by having their contributions matched up to 3 per cent of pay. In addition, the employer will pay contributions based on age, varying from 3 per cent of pay for those under 21, to 12.5 per cent of pay for those aged 46 and over. Lump sum benefits of up to three times pay on death in service and on ill health retirement will be provided separately and will be the subject of future schemes under the Superannuation Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/19">Civil Service remuneration is set having regard to the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff of the appropriate quality. Full account is taken of the value of pension arrangements, including the cost of index-linking, in setting the balance between the pay and pension elements of the reward package.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/20">The Civil Service unions have been involved throughout the development of the new pension options, both in negotiating the terms and also in appraising their members of the options open to them. The unions' constructive involvement throughout this process stands as a testament to the value of partnership working.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">The Northern Ireland Act 1998 required the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to advise the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the scope for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. The consultation is still ongoing, and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission will send the final advice to the Secretary of State in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/2">Section 69(2) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 required the commission to make recommendations to the Secretary of State as to the commission's effectiveness within two years of its inception. The Secretary of State received the commission's recommendations in March 2001, and has recently published, for consultation, the Government's response to the review document. Replies to the consultation document are expected in mid-August, at which time the Government will consider the replies received prior to issuing a response to the commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/3">The Government have also referred two Bills to the commission for comment, the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill and the Terrorism Bill. The commission offered advice to the Government on both those Bills. The Government have considered carefully the advice they have received from the commission in framing their policies and legislation. The advice given by the commission is a matter for the commission to make public, if it wishes.</p>
