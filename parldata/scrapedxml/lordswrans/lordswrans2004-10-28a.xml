	<p pid="a.138.8/1">The numbers of apparently self-inflicted deaths and numbers of self-harm incidents reported at Wakefield Prison between 2002 and 2004 to date are shown in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<caption>Wakefield Prison</caption>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.138.8/5"> <td>Year</td> <td>Number of<br/>    apparently self-<br/>    inflicted deaths 1</td> <td>Number of reported<br/>    incidents of self-<br/>    harm</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.138.8/8"> <td>2004</td> <td>(3)3</td> <td>(4)37</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.138.8/11"><sup>1</sup> The Prison Service employs the term &quot;self-inflicted death&quot; rather than &quot;suicide.&quot; This includes all those deaths where it appears the person may have acted specifically to take their own life.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/12"><sup>2</sup> In December 2002, a new form for reporting self-harm (the F213SH) was introduced across the prisons estate in England and Wales, which is known to have improved reporting practices. Please note therefore that much of the increase in reported self-harm from 2003 onwards might result from the change in reporting procedures rather than reflect an actual increase in incidence of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/13">(3) Figure covers the period up to and including <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-07">7 October 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/14">(4) Figure covers the period up to and including <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/15">Suicidal intent is not easy to establish. The reasons why people self-injure are highly complex, and it is difficult to distinguish between acts of self-harm that were attempts at ending life, and those that occurred for other reasons. It is not possible, therefore, for the Prison Service to determine from the general figures recording incidents of self-harm those acts that could be described as attempts at suicide. The figures for self-harm above therefore include all acts of self-harm, however serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/16">Wakefield takes very seriously any suggestions of prisoner on prisoner, staff on prisoner, prisoner on staff or staff on staff bullying. Between <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-10">10 October 2004</phrase>, 24 incidents of staff bullying have been investigated and 31 prisoners have been made subject to Wakefield's formal anti-bullying procedures. Other bullying incidents are dealt with informally through the work of Wakefield's suicide prevention anti-bullying (SPAB) officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/17">Wakefield has a local anti-bullying strategy in place and its anti-bullying committee meets monthly to discuss the strategy's application and effectiveness. Prisoner representatives attend these meetings and have been invaluable in identifying potential weak areas upon which the prison can concentrate its efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/18">Wakefield will, by November 2004, have in place a local violence reduction strategy appropriate to its needs. The Prison Service's violence reduction strategy was launched in May 2004, and aims to reduce violence and fear of violence. A whole prison approach, focusing on personal safety, supporting victims, and repairing the physical and emotional harm caused by violence or abuse links closely with the suicide prevention strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.0/2">The Prison Service in England and Wales is investing &pound;14 million a year in the custody-to-work initiative, to help more prisoners to secure a job or education or training place on release. From information collected by prisons in 2004&ndash;05, 31 per cent of prisoners currently have a job or education or training place to go to on release. Others are connected through the Freshstart initiative with the employment programmes and other support available through their local Jobcentre.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.0/5">In Northern Ireland, staff at each Jobcentre and jobs and benefits office can provide advice on improving employability, essential skills, and other issues. Ex-prisoners are eligible to participate in early entry to programmes such as New Deal, Worktrack and Training for Work and can access other specific programmes, such as Jobtrack, that are tailored to the needs of offenders.

	<p pid="a.141.3/1">A working interpretation of &quot;proselytising&quot; is included in the Prison Service performance standard on religion, and in the Prison Service order on religion. These provide that prisoners must not be visited by a Chaplain or Minister against their will and that unwanted persuasion of a prisoner to change religious affiliation must not take place.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.2/1">The detention of a family with children is a very serious step and is not one that is taken lightly. Where it proves necessary to detain a family we consider that it is in the best interests of a child to be detained as part of their family group rather than separating members of the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/2">Unaccompanied children are only detained for their own safety in extreme circumstances, and usually only overnight while alternative arrangements for their care are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/3">We believe that these measures, which play a key part in maintaining an effective immigration control, are consistent with the UNHCR guidelines on the detention of asylum seekers. The guidelines accept the detention of children as members of a family group and in order to maintain family unity, provided such detention is a measure of last resort and is for the shortest period of time. The guidelines also recommend that, while in detention, children should have access to education, recreation and play. These principles are reflected in the basis under which families with children may be detained and in terms of the facilities provided to children in immigration removal centres in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/4">The UK has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child subject to a reservation which the Government believe is necessary to maintain an effective immigration control. We have no plans to withdraw this reservation.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/2">Current government policy follows the approach adopted by SIAC and upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) adopted the common law approach to evidence which may have been obtained through the use of torture&mdash;save for evidence that is obtained from a party (usually the defendant in a criminal trial), that all evidence is admissible, however unlawfully obtained. However, SIAC held that where that evidence may have been obtained by torture this will bear on the proper weight to be given to the evidence. The means by which information is obtained therefore goes to its reliability and weight and not to its admissibility.</p>

The company's guidelines for the development of the asset register, inherited by Network Rail, were approved by the Rail Regulator in August 2002. These require twice-yearly plans on progress and Network Rail reported last time that it expects the objectives of the licence condition largely to be met by Autumn 2005. Network Rail's latest plans, covering the period to <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase>, are currently being considered by the Office of Rail Regulation.

	<p pid="a.152.7/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.7/2" qnum="HL4450">Why no regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for the Draft Scotland Act 1998 (Modifications of Schedule 5) Order 2004, laid before Parliament on 9 September, given that exercise of the proposed transfer of powers provisions will impact on business and other bodies in west central Scotland and in view of the key role played by the provision of railways in economic development.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.0/1">The decision not to provide a regulatory impact assessment is in accordance with the guidance <i>Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment </i>issued by the Cabinet Office. The draft order varies the competence of the Scottish Parliament. The draft order does not in itself have a direct or indirect impact (whether benefit or cost) on business, charities, the voluntary sector or the provision of railways in economic development. It would not therefore have any regulatory impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.3/1">If agreed, the draft order laid before the House on the <phrase class="date" code="">9 September</phrase> (and which is also being considered by the Scottish Parliament) will extend the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. It has no impact on the transfer of staff from regional bodies into the Civil Service in Scotland. Nor does the order have any bearing on the Government's pledge to reduce numbers in the Home Civil Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/1">Paragraph 21 of the Explanatory Memorandum states that the draft order will allow the Scottish Parliament to legislate for the existing rail powers of the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive/Authority to be transferred to the Scottish Ministers. The Government will introduce a Railways Bill when parliamentary time allows to provide for those measures that require primary legislation.</p>
