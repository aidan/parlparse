	<p pid="a.221.5/1">The penalty payments imposed by the European Union are intended to encourage the member state to bring its law into conformity with Community law. They apply from the date of judgment and not retrospectively. It can be expected that the member states will respect the decision of the Court to impose a penalty payment in accordance with their duty under Article 10 of the Treaty Establishing European Community to take all appropriate measures resulting from actions taken by the institutions of the Community. Although the Commission regularly takes member states to court, there have been only two cases where fines were imposed. The countries in question were Greece and Spain and they paid the fines as imposed by the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.5/2">Enforcement in relation to member states and commercial enterprises is dealt with in the EC Treaty. Article 244 provides that judgments of the Court of Justice shall be enforceable under the conditions laid down in Article 256. Article 256 gives detailed provision for the enforcement of financial obligations in accordance with the rules of civil procedure in the relevant member state. The Microsoft ruling is not the first of its kind; many commercial enterprises have been fined before and the fines have been paid.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.2/1">Details of the total budget of the Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre are a matter for the centre and are not routinely reported to government. There is no direct National Health Service involvement in the funding of the Wolfson Centre. However, the centre has received funding from National Translational Cancer Research Network (NTRAC) Manchester to appoint three core posts, radiochemist, radiographer and a data analyst/modeller. Further funding from NTRAC Manchester will be decided at local level. In 2002 the Department of Health announced that NTRAC nationally will receive &pound;11.16 million over five years.</p>

The applicants Professor David Gordon (Manchester) and Dr Christopher Hall (Daresbury Laboratory) refer to this investment forming an institute for functional and molecular imaging (IFMI). Co-applicants include Professors Pat Price and Terry Jones, and researchers from Liverpool and Salford. Total investment is &pound;5.7 million split equally between MRC and EPSRC. The applicants are also involved in an MRC e-science award of a little over &pound;1 million and a MRC co-operative.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.6/1">The chairman of the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority wrote to ministerial colleagues earlier this month seeking amendments to the Traffic Management Bill. This would place a requirement on the face of the Bill for passenger transport executivies to be notified when utility street works are carried out in their area. I understand that colleagues will be replying shortly, setting out their views on whether primary legislation is needed to achieve this goal, or whether it is more appropriate for secondary legislation and statutory guidance. Officials in the Department for Transport met with representatives of the passenger transport executives, including those from Manchester, earlier this week to discuss the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.6/2">Over the coming months we will be looking at the notification of all works in the highway as part of drawing up the secondary legislation and guidance underpinning the Bill.
