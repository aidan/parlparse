The UK plays an active role in the Tripartite Commission process, chaired by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which seeks to resolve these cases. That process has, however, been hampered by persistent Iraqi obstruction, demonstrated most recently by Iraq's refusal to attend commission meetings. In addition, Her Majesty's Government support the work of Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the UN Secretary General's High Level Co-ordinator for Kuwaiti missing and property issues.</p>

In Inner London, starting pay for a new nurse will be &pound;19,178, including London Weighting and the new cost of living supplement--an increase of 7 per cent. on the April 2000 figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/6">The pay of an experienced ward sister or charge nurse on the maximum of grade G will rise by 5.5 per cent. to &pound;25,420. This reflects the 3.7 per cent. award and the consolidation of one discretionary point. An equivalent nurse in inner London will earn &pound;29,535, including also the new cost of living supplement--a 9 per cent. increase over the April 2000 figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/7">On the issue of midwives' grading, the NPRB has endorsed the agreement reached between the parties and recommended that it be implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>. This means that all midwives will be able to move through to the maximum of grade F without needing to be promoted.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/8">This year the largest increases go to the most experienced nurses, midwives and health visitors who are in the vanguard of delivering the modern NHS--providing leadership, assuring clinical and environmental standards and getting all aspects of basic nursing care right for the patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/9">The NPRB has also recommended an across the board increase of 3.7 per cent. for physiotherapists, radiographers and other professions allied to medicine (PAMs). Starting pay for basic grade PAMs with a degree after four years' training will increase on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> to &pound;15,920. PAMs in the pay ranges of the Senior II, Senior I and Chief/Head/Superintendent IV, and the Chief/Head/Superintendent III grades are also to have one discretionary point consolidated in recognition of the extra responsibilities placed on them by the NHS Plan. In addition, the qualifying period for discretionary points will be reduced to one year in line with the arrangements for other NPRB staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/10">These awards are fair and reflect the contribution of the key staff in the review body groups to the delivery of the NHS Plan and the whole modernisation agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/11">The Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB) has recommended an overall pay increase of 3.9 per cent. for salaried doctors and dentists and general medical and dental practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/12">To encourage the retention of general medical practitioners, the DDRB has also recommended a 7 per cent. increase in seniority allowances, worth in the region of &pound;500 for a general medical practitioner with 25 years' service. This is in addition to the 3.9 per cent. increase in intended average net remuneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/13">For consultants, this 3.9 per cent. increase comes on top of the &pound;50 million package to recognise increased workload, contribution to NHS and intensity of work. Within this, over &pound;40 million will be paid out in intensity supplements to consultants this year, paid in January 2001 backdated to April 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/14">The DDRB pay rise takes the starting consultant salary to &pound;50,810 and a consultant on the maximum of the scale with maximum distinction award to &pound;128,935. The number of distinction awards has also been increased by 176, which will support the Government's proposals to reform the existing schemes to give more opportunity to reward consultants for their commitment and contribution to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/15">Doctors in training will benefit from this increase as well as from the new pay and banding system introduced in December 2000. This deal replaced the old, unfair system of half pay for extra hours with a banding system to reflect total hours worked. As well as giving doctors in training significant increases, the pay deal acts as an incentive for employers to reduce excessive hours. With the addition of this pay increase, a Pre-Registration House Officer (PRHO) on minimum of scale working more than 48 hours at most unsocial times (band 2A) will receive &pound;26,903 and a Senior House Officer (SHO) on the maximum of the scale, again in band 2A, will receive &pound;44,820.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.3/1">A report published by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee in 1995 estimated the brown rat population in England at 5&deg; million. No figures on trends over recent years are available. Information on the level of rodent infestation was collected as part of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' 1996 English House Condition Survey and published in January 2000. The results show that, in general, the level of rodent infestations is low, and is lower compared to a previous survey in 1993. Overall, the 1996 survey found that 1.7 per cent of properties had rats present outside and 0.4 per cent had rats inside. The detailed results are available in the report XRodent infestations in domestic properties in England&quot;, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/2">Under the provisions of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949, local authorities are responsible, as far as is practicable, for keeping their district free of rodents. They also have powers to require occupiers of land to keep their land free from rodents.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/3">Surveillance by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has shown that in some parts of the country rats are resistant to warfarin; however, stronger Xsecond generation&quot; anticoagulant rodenticides are available for the control of warfarin-resistant rats. In addition to lethal methods of control, heavy emphasis is placed throughout the pest control industry on the need to maintain hygiene and to proof premises against the entry of rodents.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/1">We are considering improved approaches to the current arrangements for the management of people in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. The aim of these changes which have been instigated by the Navy Board is to alleviate overstretch by lessening the impact on the individual of a high operational tempo and to reduce the turbulence which existing arrangements may produce. The benefits should include greater stability for members of the Naval Service and their families, both in geographical terms and in the predictability of their employment, and hence enable them to plan their lives with greater certainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/2">The project is known as TOPMAST (Tomorrow's Personnel Management System). A basic concept has been outlined and will now be further developed. The concept is designed to provide the individual with quality sea time and properly managed time ashore, determined by reference to the individual rather than to the ship or unit, as under present arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/3">TOPMAST will apply to all members of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines and is designed to enhance their quality of life while bringing greater flexibility to their employment. It is planned that these improvements will be implemented in phases, beginning to take effect from as early as late 2001, subject to the outcome of the next phase of development.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">I draw a number of conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/2">First, the level of debt being borne by the telecommunications sector indicates that a high level of investment is being undertaken. Additional investment, be it in networks, equipment, software and applications, must be to the ultimate benefit of the consumer and the telecommunications sector itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/3">Second, the level of financing being provided by the financial markets indicates that they believe they understand the telecommunications sector and can model risk and return. Of more concern would be an industry sector which was unable to raise affordable finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/4">Third, efficient companies will always leverage their equity and, provided that it is properly managed, debt is a cheaper form of financing than issuing equity.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/5">Finally, I believe that the apparent willingness of telecoms firms to invest; the readiness of financial markets to provide finance to the sector; and the efficiency with which telecoms firms are managing their equity is positive for the future development and advancement of information technology. While there are continuing concerns voiced about debt in the telecoms sector, these seem as much to be about the exposure of lenders to the telecoms market as about the level of debt being borne by the sector as a whole.</p>
