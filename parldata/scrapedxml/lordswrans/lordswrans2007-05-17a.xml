	<p pid="a.55.2/1">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">The Family Resources Survey records the number of hours someone is reported to be caring. It does not, however, link all carers with the people for whom they care. Therefore, we cannot say whether the carer is a relative, grandparent or otherwise of the person receiving care or whether that relative is accruing state pension entitlement. Neither can we say whether the relative's care allows the child or children's motherto work.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/4">We intend to use the Pensions Bill to introducea new carer's credit in 2010, which will ensure that those providing necessary and significant care ofat least 20 hours a week continue to build up state pension entitlement while they are caring. The carer's credit is not, however, intended for those providing care for a child without disability.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.0/1">The pack, which has been distributed to secondary schools in England, is a wallet containing digital resources. In addition to the film &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, it has a DVD with four short films produced by Defra, information on Sustainable Schools and links to web-based teacher guidance. This guidance, accessible through the Sustainable Schools website <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/sustainableschools">www.teachernet.gov.uk/sustainableschools</a>, reminds teachers about the duties contained in Section 406 and 407 of the Education Act 1996. We recognised that &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, together with the other resources in the pack, provides a stimulating resource for teachers and pupils. We consulted a number of people with teaching expertise, including representatives of the Royal Geographical Society and the Association for Science Education, and experts in the science of climate change, including the Met Office, when developing the teacher guidance. Where teachers decide to use the pack, the guidance provides ideas for using the resources to teach about climate change in geography, science and citizenship as part of the national curriculum.We will not be sending a copy of &quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot; to schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">The Government, through the regional assemblies and Housing Corporation, are working with local authorities and registered social landlords to make all their homes decent. In 2001,1.2 million social homes were below the decent homes standard; in 2006, this had fallen by 41 per cent and by 2010 it will have fallen by 90 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/2">The decent homes standard comprises four elements, one of which is the thermal performance of homes. Landlords are expected to ensure that homes have effective insulation and efficient heating systems. Research by the Building Research Establishment on the implementation of the decent homes programme indicates that the majority of improvement works under the decent homes scheme include work to improve energy efficiency. The same research also indicates that most landlords, when implementing energy efficiency works, deliver to high standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/3">Defra also supports the energy efficiency commitment (EEC) which is run by Ofgem. The EEC requires obligated electricity and gas suppliers to achieve targets for the improvement of energy efficiency in domestic properties in Great Britain. This involves energy suppliers working with householders and housing providers (both social and private) to implement energy efficiency measures, which are funded mostly by the energy suppliers themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/4">Social housing providers, builders and householders can access a number of grants for energy efficiency works under the DTI's low-carbon buildings programme, covering up to 50 per cent of costs of installing microgeneration or other energy efficiency technology.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/1">The 2004 report of the High-Level Panel onThreats, Challenges and Change outlined a series of recommendations for the UN architecture including for,</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/2" class="indent">&quot;a more effective United Nations for the twenty-first century&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/3">The report inspired the then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's own <I>In Larger Freedom</I> report in which he outlined a series of reforms for the UN. At the subsequent world summit in September 2005, heset world leaders the challenge of agreeing a broad package of reforms for the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/4">A number of these reforms have been implemented, including the establishment of the new Peacebuilding Commission, Human Rights Council and Central Emergency Response Fund. We continue to press for further progress on Security Council enlargement and management reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/5">A further recommendation of the world summit was that the secretary-general launch work to strengthen the management and co-ordination of UN operational activities to make a more effective contribution tothe achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including the millennium development goals. Kofi Annan subsequently established a high-level panel on system-wide coherence to identify ways of improving the performance of UN operations in development, humanitarian assistance and the environment. The panel launched its report, <I>Delivering as One</I>, in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-09">9 November 2006</phrase>. The secretary-general set out his proposals for implementing some of the panel report's recommendations on <phrase class="date" code="">20 November</phrase>, followed by his successor Secretary-General Ban's response to the other, more substantive elements of the report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-04">4 April</phrase>, with the intergovernmental process starting in the General Assembly on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-16">16 April</phrase>. These initial discussions have generally been constructive and positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/6">A key recommendation from the report wasbetter co-ordinated development activity in-country, particularly consolidation of various overlappingUN bodies to form &quot;One UN&quot;. Eight pilot countrieswere announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January</phrase> (Vietnam, Pakistan, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Cape Verde, Albania and Uruguay) to start implementing in-country these &quot;One UN&quot; reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/7">Other key recommendations that the UN is keen to implement as a priority include:</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/8">one UN for development at the headquarterslevel through the establishment of a sustainable development board and millennium development goals funding mechanism;strengthened global environmental governance, through an enhanced UN environment programme;augmented UN humanitarian action in emergencies through a fully funded central emergency response fund; andimproved action on gender and women's empowerment with a central agency headed by an undersecretary-general.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.2/1">The 2005-06 figures from Waste Data Flow, the web-based system for municipalwaste data reporting by UK local authorities to government, show that there were 41 civic amenity (CA) sites in the geographical area of the Greater London Authority. The 2006-07 data are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/2">The data held by Defra for 2000-01 from thejoint Defra/Greater London Authority annualsurvey returns show that there were 40 CA sites. The Government do not hold a full set of data for each of the intervening years, as 2005-06 was the first year of full reporting on Waste Data Flow.</p>
