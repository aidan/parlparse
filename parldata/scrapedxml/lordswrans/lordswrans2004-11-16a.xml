	<p pid="a.129.5/1">When there is a road traffic fatality in circumstances which suggest an offence has been committed, the police will investigate. Whether an offence has been committed will depend on the circumstances of each case and sometimes the weather may be a factor to take into account. The Crown Prosecution Service will decide whether or not to prosecute in accordance with the principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/2">The code sets out two stages in the decision to prosecute. First, there must be sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. This is an objective test which means that a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged. Secondly, the circumstances must be such that a prosecution would be in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/3">Following a road traffic incident involving a fatality, a number of criminal offences may be considered. They range from the most serious offences of murder, manslaughter and death by dangerous driving to summary offences such as careless driving or speeding. Each case will be considered on its own particular facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/4">The weather may play a part in some road traffic fatality incidents, but how much depends on individual cases. The circumstances of the particular case will need to be assessed to determine the significance of any adverse weather conditions. One of the issues will be the driver's response to the weather conditions. Any adverse weather conditions create obvious dangers and drivers are expected to drive appropriately to the weather. The Crown Prosecution Service will prosecute cases when there is a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to do so. In cases where a fatality has occurred and there is sufficient evidence to prove the ingredients of the offence the public interest will almost invariably demand that a prosecution follows.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/2">The Government fully supported the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) decision in November 2003 to launch an inquiry into persistent and serious violations of labour rights in Belarus. The inquiry recently concluded that many of the basic civil liberties of trade union members and leaders have been seriously infringed. Serious and systematic violations of the principles referred to in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work can result in the temporary withdrawal of trade preferences under the EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) scheme. The European Commission, with the backing of EU member states, is currently investigating trade union rights in Belarus and may recommend withdrawal of preferences.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.0/1">At the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) Summit on <phrase class="date" code="">8 October</phrase> the UK exchanged views with our EU and Asian ASEM partners on a wide range of issues, and issued Declarations on Closer Economic Partnership and on Dialogue among Cultures and Civilisations. These are available online at <a href="http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/external-relations">www.europa.eu.int/comm/external&ndash;relations</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/2">My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister, representing the UK, urged ASEM partners to discuss ways in which developing and developed countries could meet their energy needs in a sustainable way. ASEM partners agreed to pursue this. The UK, in partnership with Indonesia, also launched an initiative promoting interfaith dialogue, which received support from a number of EU and Asian ASEM partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/3">Following EU and Asian ASEM countries' agreement that Burma attend the summit, but at a level no higher than Foreign Minister, the Burmese were represented by Minister for Labour, U Tin Win. In the presence of U Tin Win, the Deputy Prime Minister, together with several of our EU partners, raised the unacceptable lack of progress towards democratisation in Burma. The Deputy Prime Minister called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, the lifting of restrictions on the National League for Democracy, the start of genuine dialogue and an early visit by the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative, Razali Ismail. The UK also worked closely with EU and Asian ASEM partners to build general consensus on the inclusion of language on Burma in the ASEM chair statement, which calls for all political groups in the country to be able to participate in national reconciliation and democratisation. We believe that this sends the regime a clear signal that ASEM partners share serious concerns about the situation in Burma.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/4">The UK fully supports greater EU-Asia dialogue, such as that within ASEM, and greater EU-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) dialogue. We see such dialogue as an important means of tackling the key challenges which the international community faces, including terrorism, proliferation, drugs and crime, climate change and energy security, and economic issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/5">We will also continue to encourage ASEAN to press the Burmese regime to begin a genuine process of reform leading to national reconciliation.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.5/1">Since June 2003, the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has on average met its public service standards of delivering 90 per cent of standard disclosures within two weeks and 90 per cent of enhanced disclosures within four weeks. However, during the period June to August 2004 the CRB operated outside these service levels, for enhanced disclosures only. This was primarily due to the fact that a small number of police forces were experiencing staffing and operational difficulties within their disclosure units. The CRB has worked very closely with these forces to help them improve their performance. This has enabled the CRB to recover its position and once more meet its service standards for enhanced disclosures for September 2004. The CRB is now able to process more checks, more quickly than ever before, with a capacity to process over 50,000 disclosures a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/2">However, as the CRB has no remit in the recruitment decision it does not record whether an individual is recruited following the issue of a disclosure. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the number of prospective volunteers that have been unable to undertake their work, or who have withdrawn their voluntary services, where a delay occurs in the processing of an individual disclosure application.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/3">Subsequently it is also not possible to estimate the cost of delays to voluntary organisations. However, it is worth pointing out that disclosures for voluntary positions are issued free of charge, and it is estimated that at current levels this will save the voluntary sector some &pound;16 million in the 2004&ndash;05 financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/4">The CRB consults widely with its service users and is already working closely with voluntary organisations. A Voluntary and Community Sector Working Group regularly meets to address and reflect the interests of volunteers and voluntary and community organisations. In particular, the group monitors the implications of the disclosure service and considers how that service should best meet the needs of the voluntary and community sector. It also encourages and supports on-going dialogue between the Home Office, the CRB and the voluntary and community sectors on issues of mutual interest with regard to the disclosure service provided by the CRB.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">Information is not held centrally on the number of foreign-registered cars and lorries caught speeding by speed cameras. Enforcement of road traffic law including speeding offences is a matter for the police of the country where the offence is committed but the Government do not believe that those who commit offences in this country should evade justice simply by returning home. The Government have agreed with our EU partners a framework decision on the mutual recognition of financial penalties. This will allow the UK to ask another EU member state to enforce any fine imposed here totalling 70 euros or more, and for the UK to enforce fines imposed abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/2">A number of offending foreign drivers stopped by the police following detection by speed camera and charged with a speeding offence do opt for a court appearance rather than leave the country. In general the courts collect the fine from convicted foreign drivers at the court appearance either by cash or credit card.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.12/1">PPG17 sets out the Government's policies for open space, sport and recreation. It provides protection for that land and those facilities which communities need. As a part of this protection, it directs that existing recerational buildings should not be redeveloped for other purposes unless they have first clearly been shown to be surplus to requirements. Authorities are expected to do this by assessing the needs of their population and by auditing existing facilities and the use made of them. PPG17 further advises authorities to use appropriate policies in plans to protect facilities that are of particular value to a local community. This provision could be used to protect individual sites and buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.12/2">At present demolition of sports buildings does not require planning permission. However, the Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-27">27 July 2000</phrase> their intention to introduce legislation to ensure that planning permission is required for the demolition of sports buildings. When it is enacted, this measure will prevent developers from demolishing sports facilities before the need for them has been tested by the planning process. Therefore it will be a further safeguard to protect sports facilities for which there is a community need.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.12/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects to consult early next year on the proposal to amend the law on demolition of sports buildings by means of a draft amendment to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">The Ministry of Defence were first made aware of the presence of sarin and cyclosarin at Khamisiyah upon publication of a CIA paper entitled <i>CIA Report on Intelligence Related to Gulf War Illness</i> on <phrase class="date" code="1996-08-02">2 August 1996</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/2">The US Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently commissioned modelling of the possible exposure levels in 1997. Following the publication of the DoD work, the MoD published a paper in December 1999 entitled <i>Review of Events Concerning 32 Field Hospital and the Release of Nerve Agent Arising From US Demolition of Iraqi Munitions at the Khamisiyah Depot In March 1991,</i> based on the DoD modelling of the Khamisiyah plume footprint and including the views of MoD scientists. This paper concluded that approximately 9,000 British servicemen could potentially have been exposed to sarin and cyclosarin, but at levels too low to have any biological detectable effect. Both the DoD and MoD assessments concentrated on the levels of exposure on British troops to fall-out from Khamisiyah.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/3">The MoD is currently considering the 2002 modelling work by the DoD (and a subsequent review by the General Accountability Office) and we will publish a final assessment in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.2/1">As announced by the Chancellor in the 2004 Budget, the Government will introduce, from next April, a package of measures that will be a first step in an overall programme designed to simplify the rules surrounding entitlement and take-up of both housing benefit and council tax benefit, and the way in which the rules align with those for other support such as tax credits and pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">While local authorities have a statutory duty to promote awareness of council tax benefit, we launched a campaign earlier this year, supported by new posters, flyers and press advertising, to help local authorities encourage those who may be entitled to claim. And we will continue to support local authorities in raising awareness of council tax benefit in the run-up to the 2005 billing round.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">From this week we will also be issuing a copy of the council tax benefit flyer in with the winter fuel payment notification letters. We anticipate that around 12 million pensioners in around 8 million households will be sent a copy of the flyer during November and December, which will encourage them to &quot;Cut your Council Tax&mdash;Find out if you should be paying less.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4">We have already introduced a shorter claim form for pensioners, reducing the current form by a third, and propose to introduce an even shorter form for those wishing to claim CTB only. And we are considering how we can make this shorter still. We are also looking at how we can streamline the application process even more; for example, where claims are made for a number of benefits, such as pension credit, ensuring that common information on personal and financial circumstances is only given once.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/5">The Pension Service is also already doing much to promote council tax benefit take-up, issuing housing benefit/council tax benefit claim forms to everyone who calls the Pension Credit Application Line and wishes to claim and helping people fill in their council tax benefit claim form when visiting pensioners to take a claim for pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/6">We are well aware of the pivotal role that the voluntary sector can play in helping to promote take-up. We know some older people prefer to deal with organisations like Age Concern and Help the Aged. As part of developing a third age network, we are building closer and more effective partnerships with the voluntary sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.2/1">The &quot;Choose and Book&quot; service will greatly assist local health communities in achieving the national performance requirements for booking and choice set out in <i>National Standards, Local Action</i>, and we are making good progress towards roll-out of the new service. Achieving the December 2005 performance targets&mdash;or any interim milestones that local health communities choose to set&mdash;does not necessarily depend on the electronic system being used in all parts of primary and secondary care.

Higher education institutions in England were reminded of this recommendation when they were invited, in January 1999 and September 2000, to submit proposals to provide extra medical school places by the Higher Education Funding Council for England and Department of Health. The allocations of extra places announced between 1999 and 2001, including those to the four new medical schools, made no provision for any increase in the number of overseas students to be admitted in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.2/1">We do not know exactly how many local authorities offer no facilities for the disposal of withdrawn pesticide products. However, I understand that a survey in 2003 of county councils throughout Great Britain by the Pesticides Action Network indicated that about 58 per cent provided facilities at civic amenity sites for these products or offered collection facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/2">Where pesticides are discarded by households they are classified as household waste. Section 45 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 places a statutory duty on local authorities to collect household waste and Section 51 of the 1990 Act requires waste disposal authorities to provide readily accessible places (usually known as civic amenity sites) where householders can bring items of household waste for disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/3">Defra will be writing shortly to all local authorities in England to remind them of their statutory obligations.</p>
