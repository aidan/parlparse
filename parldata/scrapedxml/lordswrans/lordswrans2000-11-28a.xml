These involve changing the final location of HQ 101 Bn REME (V) from Harry Weale Hall, Queensferry to Hightown Barracks, Wrexham; changing the location for 59 Sig Sqn (V) from Deysbrook to Aintree and sell Deysbrook Barracks complete; and changing the location of A (The Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment)) Company, 52nd Lowland Regiment from TAC Dalmeny Street to TAC East Claremont Street.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">These changes are being made because they represent more cost-effective solutions to locating the units in question.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.5/1">There are no specific by-laws and no general legal requirement for premises to display their numbers in any particular way. However, under the Town Improvement Clauses Act 1847 local authorities are able, by means of a local Act, to take special powers which enable them to require premises to maintain their number and display it conspicuously.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/2">I understand from the British Standards Institute that there is no British standard for house and commercial numbering. Nevertheless, Appendix C of the Department of Transport Circular Roads 3/93 sets out recommended best practice regarding the style and location of premises' numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/1">The Home Office Court Proceedings Database does not identify such offences separately from other summary offences. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers' Wildlife and Environmental Crime Adviser surveyed a number of police forces following the first season's operation of the Environmental Protection (Restriction on the Use of Lead Shot) (England) Regulations 1999. The responses suggest that a very small number of potential infringements were reported to the police, that all were dealt with by advice and no court proceedings were undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.5/1">The Government are already reviewing these regulations on the basis of the first season's experience and convened earlier this year the Lead Shot Legislation (England) Review Group which will specifically review Schedule 1 to the regulations, the list of sites, as well as considering other issues relating to the effectiveness of the legislation. Representatives from shooting, farming, land-owning and conservation organisations and gun and ammunition industry interests are included in the group. The review group is expected to report early next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.8/2">It is inherent in the principle of devolution that there will not necessarily be consistency of regulation throughout the United Kingdom and that measures will not necessarily be implemented on a consistent timetable. However, the Environment Minister for Wales, Sue Essex, announced on <phrase class="date" code="">9 November</phrase> that regulations would be introduced for the next shooting season in September 2001 to restrict the use of lead shot over wetlands.</p>
