The various professionals involved with a pupil then give the school advice and guidelines on how best to support the pupil.

This is to the benefit of the North/South bodies as it does not require a case to be made every year to NSMC for routine increases in salary ranges.

	<p pid="a.110.5/1">Official government statistics show observed differences in unemployment rates between denominations within the Protestant community. Research in this area is affected by both measurement difficulties and the complexity of labour market dynamics. Measurement instruments such as sample surveys disaggregated by Protestant denonimation usually cannot be sufficiently precise to separately identify real differences and differences due to sampling or other survey features. This is particularly so when we are seeking to comment on marginal changes in unemployment based on Labour Force Survey data.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.5/2">Therefore under these circumstances any speculation regarding the factors responsible and their relative impact will remain inconclusive. The results from the 2001 Census will enable a comparison of the unemployment rates between the Protestant denominations; however this will require the sample of anonymised records, due to be released later in 2003. Further, while such an analysis will enable comparisons of observed unemployment rates, it may not explain any such differences.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">I am pleased to be able to announce that the UK has taken a significant step towards ratification of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT). On <phrase class="date" code="">8 September</phrase>, my honourable friend, Mr Rammell laid before Parliament an Explanatory Memorandum, which explains how the UK meets the provisions of the protocol.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">We hope that the ratification process can be completed with the United Nations by the end of this year. This will make the UK one of the very first UN member states to have ratified the Optional Protocol. We signed the protocol on <phrase class="date" code="">26 June</phrase>, becoming one of only 6 countries worldwide to have done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/3">The UK is committed to the fight against torture. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's anti-torture initiative, launched in 1998, continues to provide a focus for us on this issue. The follow-up to our ratification of the OPCAT will be an important part of the current phase of the initiative. We will undertake a lobbying campaign urging other countries to sign, ratify and implement both the Convention Against Torture and the Optional Protocol.</p>

This conclusion reflects the changed risks to food supply since the drive for self-sufficiency was launched after the Second World War, and against the current risks and the current level of self-sufficiency, the negative effects of further increasing production need to be taken into account.</p>

The reference to world leaders in food production and the figure of 20 per cent is a reference to competitiveness in the UK's food processing sector.
