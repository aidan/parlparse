	<p pid="a.165.5/1">DEFRA regional staff are actively seeking to resolve all these outstanding claims and aim to pay them as appropriate once current investigations have been completed. Although we cannot give a specific date by which we can guarantee to have cleared all 26 claims, we will ensure that all claimants are kept informed.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>, the day of publication of my noble friend Lord Haskins's report, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, announced the provision of an additional &pound;24 million for the Business Recovery Fund, designed to help small businesses recover from the effects of foot and mouth disease and the measures to control it. On <phrase class="date" code="">6 November</phrase> my right honourable friend, the Minister of State for Rural Affairs (Mr Alun Michael), announced the provision of an additional &pound;2 million for matched funding of charitable donations towards relieving hardship arising from foot and mouth disease. Both measures were in response to Lord Haskins's recommendations. The Government are still considering his other recommendations and will respond shortly. A number of practical issues raised by my noble friend Lord Haskins in his report and by the Rural Task Force and by others have been taken up in the normal course of business.</p>
