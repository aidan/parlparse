	<p pid="b.49.3/1">The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has established standard contracts for credit default swaps (CDS). Where two counterparties decide to use these contracts, they can also commit to use the procedures that determine if a credit event has occurred. These procedures cover the composition of the credit event determinations committee, the process for considering a credit event and the publication of decisions. The decisions of the committee are based on, among other things, the facts of the event and the terms of the standard contracts, which include standardised definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/2">For the purpose of calculating capital requirements, the regulatory framework requires firms to have systems in place to assess all the risks to which they are exposed and to hold capital to mitigate those risks. This would include the risk that trigger events for CDS contracts are such that they do not perfectly hedge other exposures the firm may hold.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.5/2">These showed that the average household energy bill was estimated to rise by &#163;136 (12 per cent) over the period 2010-20, from &#163;1,103 in 2010 to &#163;1,239 in 2020 (all in real 2009 prices), driven mostly by increases in international gas prices and rising network costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.5/3">This assessment of the trend over the period does not take into account potential annual fluctuations in weather, which can have a significant impact on energy bills. It is also based on fossil fuel price and policy assumptions as correct at July 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.5/4">Since July 2010, DECC has published updated projections of fossil fuel prices (available online at <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/ec_social_res/analytic_projs/ff_prices/ff_prices.aspx">http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/ec_social_res/analytic_projs/ff_prices/ff_prices.aspx</a>).</p>
	<p pid="b.50.5/5">Moreover, the coalition Government have made a number of policy announcements since July 2010 which mean that the average household energy bill will rise by less over time compared to a scenario where there were no energy and climate change policies. These announcements include:</p>
	<p pid="b.50.5/6">proposals on Electricity Market Reform and the Green Deal;the introduction of the Carbon Price Floor;consultations on new cost-effective levels of support for large-scale renewable electricity and lower tariffs and energy efficiency eligibility requirement for solar PV under the feed-in-tariff scheme;the decisions to fund the Renewable Heat Incentive from general taxation rather than through a levy on fossil fuel suppliers;the decision to consider several alternative funding options for the Government's CCS commitments rather than through their own levy.</p>

This means that even where public money has been made available to banks, the Government do not intervene in commercial matters, such as pricing or product design. To do so would be contrary to this principle of independence and may be anti-competitive or distort the market.</p>

The specific levels of representation within given practice areas at the Bar are primarily the responsibility of the Bar, as is the need to ensure equality of opportunity to all areas of practice. Although MoJ is mindful of the need to encourage those with a protected characteristic to participate fully in public life and the need to advance equality of opportunity generally, MoJ does not believe that legal aid is the most appropriate policy instrument by which to achieve diversity within the profession.</p>

The latest Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey highlights that the black population experiences highest rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide attempts, psychotic disorder and drug use and drug dependence, while the white population experiences the highest rates for suicidal thoughts, self-harm and alcohol dependence. The results of the survey can be found here: <a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/mental-health/nhs-specialist-mental-health-services/mental-health-bulletin--fourth-report-from-mental-health-minimum-dataset-mhmds-annual-returns-2010">www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/mental-health/nhs-specialist-mental-health-services/mental-health-bulletin--fourth-report-from-mental-health-minimum-dataset-mhmds-annual-returns-2010</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/2">People from some black and minority ethnic (BME) groups are more likely to be admitted to mental health services under the Mental Health Act. The reasons for this are not fully understood but there are likely to be many factors which play a part. Work is under way to better understand the complex reasons for these differences.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/3">The Government's Mental Health Strategy <I>No Health Without Mental Health</I>, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, acknowledges the lower well-being and higher rates of mental health problems of some BME groups. It is explicit about ensuring that health promotion and ill-health prevention approaches must be targeted at high-risk groups. This means that programmes must be delivered in such a way that they are accessible to families from black and minority ethnic groups. Such approaches, which combine targeted and universal approaches, will lead to a narrowing of the health inequality gap between groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.3/2">The vast majority of NHS trusts are expected to achieve foundation status by April 2014. A small number will require additional time to develop a solution which is right for them individually and the patients they serve. Alongside these local plans, national solutions and support are being developed which trusts may use to support meeting the authorisation criteria needed to achieve foundation trust status.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.3/3">Plans are in place for all the remaining NHS trusts to achieve foundation trust status. Where such an organisation is deemed clinically or financially unsustainable in their current form, plans will be agreed for them to move forward to be a foundation trust on some other organisational basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.3/4">The wider objective remains to proactively make the changes needed in the remaining NHS trusts to support them to achieve foundation trust status. There may be some cases however where the unsustainable provider regime, as laid out in current legislation, may be required to be enacted to address issues in relation to the provision of safe and sustainable healthcare services.</p>

However, there are a number of safeguards in place including a requirement that healthcare staff visit all young people within 24 hours of them being subject to use of force to assess any injuries, which are recorded on a body map with an accompanying narrative. Monthly statistics on injuries and the number of injuries that occur are collected from this data so that trends can be identified and analysed with appropriate action taken forward.

The Youth Justice Division will be responsible for overseeing the delivery of youth justice services, identifying and disseminating effective practice, commissioning a distinct secure estate and placing young people in custody.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.2/2">Increasing direct ministerial accountability for youth justice will create a strong impetus for improvement. Ministers are better placed to influence policy across government and they will ensure that other departments, such as education and health, play their part in stopping young people from becoming involved in crime and reoffending. The Government anticipate that the impact of the changes to the national governance on the work undertaken by the youth justice system will be minimal. The front line delivery of youth justice by youth offending teams will not be affected by this change and a distinct secure estate for young people will remain in place.</p>
