</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-12b.81.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="81"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60112w01.htm#60112w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.81.2/1">The standards in cataloguing of art collections are maintained by the Government through the Museum Accreditation Scheme, which is administered by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/2">The accreditation standards scheme is open to all publicly funded or charitable museums in the UK. It was set up in 1988 and is administered by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA). The accreditation requirements for documenting collections in museums and galleries can be summarised as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/3" class="indent">each item must be entered into an accession register which gives the item a unique number and records from whom the item was acquired;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/4" class="indent">sufficient information to identify it (in the case of a work of art this would be the artist's name, title of the work, medium and measurements);</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/5" class="indent">in addition, the accession register number must be marked on the item, there must be a security copy of the register and a record of the item's location.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/6">If any of the requirements are not in place, the museum must provide a plan with dates for completing the work.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/7">Some 1,848 UK museums now participate in the accreditation scheme, including all art collections in public ownership. MLA's research in 2001 indicated that the inclusion of documentation requirements in the scheme was an important factor in ensuring that work on improving documentation of collections continued to take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/8" class="italic">Designation Challenge Fund (DCF)</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/9">This fund, set up in 1999, is available to museums holding designated collections in England. The DCF is financed by DCMS and administered by MLA.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/10">About 61 museums have designated collections&mdash;of these 28 have designated fine or decorative art collections.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/11">Since 1999 approximately &pound;6 million has been allocated to museums to enable them to improve the documentation of these fine/decorative art collections.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/12">The Public Catalogue Foundation (PCF) is a charity that is producing a photographic inventory of paintings in public ownership across the country. The MLA is working closely with the PCF and funding is being considered for an IT solution to the current glossy catalogue approach. The MLA and PCF are working jointly to work out how to create a web resource that will be widely accessible, using the latest digitisation technologies.</p>

	<p pid="b.82.5/1">The Department of Health has been advised by the Health Protection Agency that there are many different types of cancer the causes of which are multifactorial rather than there being a single cause for any particular type of cancer, and this should be recognised. It is known that lifestyle factors such as smoking, consumption of alcoholic beverages, physical activity/obesity, and also occupational exposure to certain chemicals in the past, especially asbestos, have a major influence on cancer incidence. It is very difficult to estimate the burden due to environmental factors but the available data are summarised as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/2">Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to produce leukaemia and other cancers, although there is little direct data available on the burden of disease from this cause. Exposure to radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is a cause of lung cancer and there is a markedly increased risk in smokers. It has been estimated that about 2 per cent. of cancer deaths in Europe may be due to radon. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/3">There is little convincing evidence to indicate that environmental exposure to chemicals in the United Kingdom causes cancer. However exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (passive smoking) is known to be associated with a 10-30 per cent. increase in lung cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/4">Additionally, dietary factors are estimated to account for approximately 30 per cent. of cancers in industrialised countries&mdash;making diet only second to tobacco as a preventable cause of cancer. In particular, obesity is associated with an increase in risk of some cancers such as colorectal and breast cancers while increasing the intake of fruit and vegetables and physical activity is associated with decreased risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.83.8/1">The Government agree that Article 308 of the treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) contains a limited power to act but they are satisfied that the proposed regulation fulfils all of the criteria of this treaty provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.8/2">The importance of fundamental rights in Community law has been accepted for many years. While ensuring respect for fundamental rights is not specifically listed as a Community objective in Articles 2 and 3 of TEC, the European Court of Justice has found that ensuring respect for fundamental rights is a condition for the lawfulness of Community acts and that respect for fundamental rights thus forms an underlying or implied objective of the Community.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.8/3">In 1997 Article 308 (then Article 235) was used, in conjunction with Article 284 (then Article 213), as the legal base to establish the Vienna-based EU Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. As the centre will be converted into the Agency for Fundamental Rights, the use of Article 308 to establish the latter is a consistent approach in terms of legal base.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.2/1">The Youth Justice Board has recently agreed the provision of new special units for young women under the age of 18 at the secure training centres at Rainsbrook and Hassockfield. Like the new units in the Prison Service estate, these units will accommodate 17 year-old girls. In addition, there will be a small number of places for mothers under 18 and their babies and for pregnant girls. This is the first time special provision has been made for this group. Capacity will increase by a total of 27 beds. The Rainsbrook unit is scheduled to open in July 2006 and the Hassockfield unit in October 2006.</p>
