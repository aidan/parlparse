	<p pid="a.103.8/1">The Government's policy on electronic records management was published in April. It is called the Framework for Information Age Government: Electronic Records Management, an Annex to e-government, A strategic framework for public services in the Information Age. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The report is also available on the Internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.8/2">Effective management of electronic records is essential to the information age government programme. The replacement of manual and paper-based processes with electronic processes requires the development of effective records management, covering existing as well as new electronic records. In government such records must be managed so as to retain their integrity, authenticity and accessibility through migrations as hardware and software change and to conform with the relevant data protection and freedom of information regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.8/3">Any electronic government record is potentially a public record and for this reason all such records will be subject to additional controls, including retention and disposal scheduling and prevention of content alteration.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.8/4">The development of a common system of electronic records management will facilitate collaboration between government departments and agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.2/1">I am delighted to publish today a working draft of the code of practice on the management of records under the Freedom of Information Act. Copies of the draft have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The report will also be available on the Internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/2">The aims of the code are twofold. The first is to set out practices which bodies subject to the Freedom of Information Act should follow in relation to the creation, keeping, management and destruction of their records. The second is to provide guidance on the review and transfer of public records to the Public Record Office, to places of deposit for public records appointed under the Public Records Act 1958 and to the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland. The code covers records in all technical or physical formats.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/3">Any freedom of information legislation is only as good as the quality of the records to which it provides access. Such rights are of little use if reliable records are not created in the first place, if they cannot be found when needed or if the arrangements for their eventual archiving or destruction are inadequate. Consequently, all public authorities are encouraged to pay heed to the guidance in the code. Authorities should note that if they fail to comply with the code they may be in breach of their statutory obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/4">The code would satisfy a duty proposed in the Freedom of Information Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.8/1">The cost of administering ordinary accounts in 1970-71 as a percentage of total balances was 1.6 per cent. In real terms the cost of administering ordinary accounts reduced significantly during the period 1970-71 to 1999-2000; however the total amounts invested during the same period have reduced at an even greater rate in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.8/2">National Savings does not believe that average administration costs of 4.2 per cent would reduce significantly if the &pound;10,000 limit was increased to take account of inflation. Less than 0.01 per cent of ordinary account customers have &pound;10,000 invested and even if all these customers increased their investments fully up to the inflation adjusted limit, the cost of administering the ordinary account would reduce to 3.9 per cent. However, it is unlikely that customers would invest up to the new limit in an ordinary account as there are a number of more appropriate accounts for such sums of money offering higher rates of interest from both National Savings and other financial institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.2/1">The Government's 1997 policy statement Gulf Veterans' Illnesses: A New Beginning set out a number of commitments to help address the health concerns of Gulf veterans. One of these commitments was to review specific incidents of suggested biological or chemcial warfare exposures. As part of this commitment, my honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces is today publishing the third paper looking at incidents where veterans have suggested they were exposed to chemical warfare agents. This paper is entitled A Review of UK Forces Chemical Warfare Agent Alerts during the 1990-1991 Gulf Conflict. We are placing a copy in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">This paper looks at the general pattern of chemical alarms during the conflict. The review has shown that there was usually a straightforward explanation given at the time for chemical warfare agent detection equipment alarming. There is no evidence to suggest Iraqi use of chemical weapons or the presence of chemical weapons in any of the UK alarms.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">The paper reviews in detail two specific incidents: Dhahran on the night of the <phrase class="date" code="1991-01-20">20 January 1991</phrase> when a SCUD was destroyed by a Patriot missile close to the airfield there and Al Jubayl on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="1991-02-16">16 February 1991</phrase> when a SCUD landed in the water in the port area.

	<p pid="a.108.2/1">Peer reviewed scientific data comparing the mortality of UK Gulf veterans to an era group of service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf was published for the first time in the Lancet on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-01">1 July 2000</phrase>. The Ministry of Defence will now continue to monitor the mortality of both Gulf veterans and the era group and will publish updated figures on a regular basis. The figures as at <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-30">30 June 2000</phrase> are shown in the table. Overall, in the period <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-01">1 April 1991</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-30">30 June 2000</phrase> the mortality of UK Gulf veterans was only slightly greater than that of the comparison group. The number of Gulf veterans dying from disease related causes is rather less than for the comparison group, whereas the number of Gulf veterans dying of external causes is rather higher than for the comparison group. The Ministry of Defence will conduct a more detailed analysis of road traffic accidents to establish whether there are any underlying trends that might help explain this excess.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.5/1">The ability to fly fast and low continues to be an essential skill in our armoury of tactics. Training for aircrew to achieve and maintain these skills is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/2">The amount of low flying training carried out in the UK low flying system during the training year April 1999 to March 2000 was the minimum necessary for aircrew to reach and maintain these skills. Hours booked for low flying training during this period amounted to some 15 per cent. less than for 1998. Some of this reduction can be attributed to the number of aircraft and crews committed to overseas deployments. Since detailed records of hours booked began in 1995, the total overall has reduced by 36 per cent. (some 24,200 hours) with fixed-wing activity showing the greatest reduction 42 per cent (19,800 hours).</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/3">The distribution of low flying training across the UK has not changed significantly. We continue to try to spread it as widely as practicable but for a variety of operational, geographical and climatic constraints some parts of the country will see more than others.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/4">The paper published for 1998 (Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-28">28 April 1999</phrase>, col. 147) made clear that for the future this information would be published on a financial year basis. We have today placed in the Library of the House a paper giving a detailed account of low flying training in the UK low flying system. It provides information for the transitional period January 1999 to March 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.5/1">Medicines dispensed on the National Health Service in the community are purchased by community pharmacies and dispensing doctors at various prices. The cost to the NHS is generally the drug tariff price--the price at which community pharmacies and dispensing doctors are generally reimbursed--less a deduction which reflects discount obtained on medicines purchases. Prices paid by hospital pharmacy departments for use in hospitals or for dispensing to outpatients will often vary from those applicable in primary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/2">The current (July) drug tariff price for allopurinol 300 mg in patient packs of 28 is 529p. A price for a 100-tablet pack (which may have been based partly or fully on the price of packs where the tablets were available in loose rather than strip and blister format) was last listed in the drug tariff edition of November 1999 at 571p.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/3">It is possible that packs containing tablets in loose format are available from some suppliers. Because only the 28-pack is listed in the drug tariff, reimbursement will be at a price pro rata to the 28-pack regardless of the pack size actually used in dispensing.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/4">Under the Government's maximum price scheme for generic medicines, the maximum price of supply of allopurinol 300 mg (28-pack) to community pharmacies and dispensing doctors for NHS use will be 218p. The cost to the NHS will depend on the drug tariff price which will be no more than the maximum price of supply, but could be less, depending on competition in the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/5">As a prescription only medicine, allopurinol cannot be sold by retail without a prescription. Where it is dispensed against a private prescription the price is a matter for the individual pharmacy concerned. The Government do not collect any information on prices charged for medicines dispensed privately.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">We have placed in the Library a copy of the report Tracking Progress in Children's Services: An Evaluation of Local Responses to the Quality Protects Programme Year 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/2">When we launched the Quality Protects programme in September 1998, we required local authorities to submit annual management action plans to show how they were intending to improve the management and delivery of children's social services. This report presents the key messages and findings from the second round of management actions plans (MAPS) which were received in January 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/3">Councils have made a good start over the past year in implementing the Quality Protects programme. For example we have seen: more corporate working across councils and more partnership working with voluntary organisations; an increase in the proportion of children looked after in foster care or placed for adoption; a reduction in re-registrations on the child protection register; more support being given to care leavers; an increase in education support being given to looked after children; more councils listening to children and young people in their care; and improvements in the collecting and using of management information.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/4">But if there are to be real and lasting gains for children, these early improvements must be built on and further substantial progress made in 2000-01. The Government's determination to support this change is demonstrated by the significant increase in special grant available for funding this year (from &pound;75 million to &pound;120 million). We will expect progress in 2000-01 to be commensurate with this increase in funding.</p>
