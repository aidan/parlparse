	<p pid="a.15.5/1">At the time that the Hedgerows Regulations 1997 were introduced it was estimated that some 20 per cent of countryside hedges in England and Wales would qualify as important. Information collected by ADAS during its research into the Hedgerows Review Group's proposed criteria defining importance suggests that the figure could be at least 57 per cent. The higher figure includes hedges which are an integral part of a field system dating from before 1845 or, in the case of an enclosure field system, from before 1870, and where the system is substantially complete. A copy of the ADAS research report, which was published in November last year, has been placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The Government have made it plain that the enforcement of the regulation will primarily be carried out by the police. This is in line with other legislation concerning the protection of birds and notices have been sent to the Chief Constables of all police forces in England, authorising them to enforce the legislation. As we have previously stated, there may be very rare occasions where another competent organisation such as the Environment Agency or English Nature is better placed to enforce the regulation, and the regulation needs to contain this element of flexibility. In these circumstances, authorisation may need to be given at short notice for a particular incident, therefore not allowing sufficient time for advance notice to be given to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.8/1">Performance targets for London Underground were not set at the beginning of this financial year because of discussions about London Transport's funding requirements, which culminated in the allocation of &pound;517 million of additional resources for this year and next. Since then the Government have been developing performance targets to be met by the Underground by the end of financial year 2000-01, with milestones to be achieved along the way. These targets will be announced in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.8/2">The Government receive regular reports of London Underground's performance against a number of indicators, both objective performance measures and results of customer satisfaction surveys. In addition, I take a close personal interest in the performance of the Underground through the London Transport Taskforce, which I chair. The Taskforce is the forum for London Transport to report to me on performance and delivery of their investment programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.2/1">The Government have raised this matter both directly with the French authorities and within the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and will continue to seek a resolution of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/2">Under Council Regulation 3922/91 on the harmonisation of aviation technical standards, the national aviation authorities of member states are required to be members of the JAA. The Regulation also adopted some of the JAA's Joint Aviation Requirements (JARs) as the European Community's harmonised standard and established a procedure to adopt future JARs as the EC standard. Where a JAR has not yet been adopted under EC law, JAA member states implement them under national law and are obliged, under the JAA Arrangements, to use their best efforts to implement JARs by the due date.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/3">Requirements affecting the age of pilots are contained in the Joint Aviation Requirements on Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL), which was adopted by the JAA in 1996 with the implementation date of <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-01">1 July 1999</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/4">JARs generally set standards that are compatible with those set by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) under the terms of the Chicago Convention, but can introduce differences, so long as member states notify the differences to ICAO. In drawing up the JAR-FCL, the JAA determined that commercial pilots can safely be licensed to the age of 65, provided that only one pilot in a multi-pilot aircraft may be over 60: this differs from the ICAO standard, under which a person can only act as a pilot in command if they are under 60. The UK and most other JAA member states are, or are in the process of, applying the JAR-FCL age limits. However, the French authorities are continuing to apply the ICAO age limits within French airspace, although co-pilots up to the age of 65 are permitted. The French authorities have said that they are not opposed to a joint approach from the JAA member states to ICAO seeking a revision of the ICAO provisions in line with those in JAR-FCL, and we will pursue this with the JAA.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">It is Government policy to support artistic excellence, innovation and access at all levels through the Arts Council of England, which is directly responsible for funding contemporary visual artists and their work. In addition, the Arts Council Collection is the largest national loan collection of post-war British art. The collection aims to buy new and challenging work from artists working in Britain and possesses the work of over 1,700 artists. The collection is used by universities, colleges, local authorities, law courts and hospitals as well as by art galleries.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">Over the last two and a half years the amount of contemporary art on display in British Government buildings has increased. The Government Art Collection (GAC) displays works of art by British artists of all periods from the 16th century to the contemporary in major British Government buildings at home and throughout the world. This helps to promote the image of Britain and to reflect its culture, history and creativity in the visual arts. The GAC supports the work of contemporary artists by purchasing and commissioning works of art.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.6/1">It is not the normal practice of the Home Secretary in extradition cases to invite representations from parties other than those directly concerned--i.e. the accused and the requesting state--although such representations are sometimes volunteered and, where relevant, considered. The reason why, on this occasion, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary allowed time for representations, and specifically invited representations from human rights organisations, was that he was aware that certain of these organisations had been regarded by the House of Lords on both the first and second hearings on the immunity appeal as having sufficient interest in the principles governing the extradition of persons accused of international crimes to warrant their being allowed to intervene and be heard on the appeal. After the first decision of the House of Lords, they asked to be allowed to make representations to my right honourable friend the Home Secretary on the question whether an Authority to Proceed should issue, and such representations were received and considered both at the time when he was deciding whether to issue the first Authority to Proceed, and again when a fresh Authority to Proceed had to be considered in the light of the second decision of the House of Lords. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary assumed that human rights organisations would wish to make representations on this occasion also, and, therefore, allowed a period of time in which they could do so.</p>

The HSE has complete data for the financial years 1997-98 and 1998-99. Table 1 therefore records the number of injuries to police officers in England in those financial years.</p>
