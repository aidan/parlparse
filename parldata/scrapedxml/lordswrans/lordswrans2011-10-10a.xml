	<p pid="a.219.0/1">Her Majesty's Government do not provide direct funding to South Sudanese non-governmental organisations. However we do fund three programmes that use South Sudanese non-governmental organisations to undertake peace-building activities or to dispense delivery of basic services. The three programmes are: the South Sudan Basic Services Fund, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) South Sudan Recovery Fund and the South Sudan Peace Building Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/2">The BSF has served 20 per cent of the national population (about 2 million people) through BSF funded primary health care clinics and 21 out of 31 targeted new schools have been built and 30,008 students now enrolled. Over 670,000 people have benefited from safe drinking water and improved sanitation through BSF programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/3">Since the inception of round 2 small grants mechanism, 69 local organisations have received grants and have been trained in project management and proposal writing (43 in agriculture, 16 in education and 10 in water and sanitation) funded by the UNDP. The grants have focused on grassroots or localised initiatives in agriculture, education and water and sanitation in all 10 states in South Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/4">Through the South Sudan Peace Fund approximately 5,494 people have participated in peace building and conflict mitigation activities such as dialogues, civic education courses and livelihoods support such as three pilot projects which work with demobilised women soldiers to assist their social reintegration in to host communities.</p>
