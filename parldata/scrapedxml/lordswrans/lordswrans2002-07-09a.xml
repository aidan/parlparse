	<p pid="a.76.6/1">The Youth Justice Board annual review for 2001&ndash;02 has today been laid before Parliament. Copies have been placed in the Library. The Youth Justice Board was established in 1998 by the Crime and Disorder Act to reform the youth justice system. The annual review provides evidence of success in meeting the principal aim of the reformed youth justice system to prevent offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.6/2">The Government's pledge to halve the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders has been achieved. It has been reduced from an average time of 142 days in 1997 to 67 days in the first quarter of 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.6/3">The review shows that effective use has been made of police final warnings, bail supervision and support programmes, robust new sentences and the new intensive surveillance and supervision programme to reduce reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.6/4">The review also presents evidence that targeted prevention work with young people at risk, use of parenting programmes and education, employment and training initiatives are effective to prevent and reduce offending rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.5/1">The UK recognises the damaging impact of trade distorting agriculture subsidies on developing countries' agriculture sectors. The EU's heavy use of subsidies encourages over-production, which depresses world prices and so constrains agriculture investment in developing countries. In 2000 alone, the EU spent 98 billion euros on agriculture subsidies. At the Doha ministerial meeting last year it was agreed that agriculture negotiations would aim to achieve ''substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a vew to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support''. We are committed to ensure that these negotiations result in liberalisation that will benefit the world's poor. Further, we are committed to pushing for significant reform of the common agriculture policy in order to achieve, amongst other objectives, a reduction in export and domestic subsidies.</p>

Schools will be under new duties not to treat disabled pupils less favourably than their non-disabled peers without justification and to take reasonable steps to ensure that disabled pupils are not placed at a substantial disadvantage. However, explanation of the new duties was beyond the scope of the draft revised guidance and readers, especially those involved in exclusion decisions or appeals, were strongly recommended to read and familiarise themselves with the code of practice produced by the Disability Rights Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.2/1">The directive on food supplements has now been adopted. It establishes a framework for harmonised controls on vitamin and mineral content of food supplements and introduces a number of useful labelling measures. The Food Standards Agency argued strongly in negotiations for a safety-based approach to this directive rather than the more restrictive approach favoured by the majority of other member states. The text represents a compromise which secured a number of hard-won concessions and which the Government finally supported as the best achievable outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/2">There are widely acknowledged weaknesses in the current regime in the United Kingdom for unlicensed herbal remedies placed on the market under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968. The proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products potentially redresses deficiencies in relation to quality and safety standards and systematic product information for the consumer. A large number of herbal remedies should be able to demonstrate traditional use under the terms of the directive. In the light of a consultation exercise on the directive carried out by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the Government recognise that, while there is considerable support for many of the provisions of the directive, there are also significant concerns, particularly in parts of the health food sector. These relate principally to the issue of whether some of the proposed quality and manufacturing standards are over-regulatory and whether some products currently legally sold under Section 12(2) might fall outside the scope of the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/3">We have extended the consultation period until the end of July in order to allow those expressing concerns to identify specific examples where they believe the directive to be over-regulatory or too restrictive. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health (Ms Hazel Blears) and I will also be meeting representatives of the herbal sector in July. We will review the Government's negotiating priorities on the directive in the light of the additional points that may emerge from this further consultation and dialogue during July.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/4">The European Commission made proposals for wide ranging changes to the body of legislation that regulates medicines for human and veterinary use, of which the Medicines Code (Directive 2001/83/EC) is part, in November 2001. These changes are designed to improve the regulation of licensed medicinal products, including homoeopathic products. The Government support the overall objectives of the European Commission's review but there are some specific proposals about which we have concerns. In particular, the Government are concerned about a proposal that would extend the scope of the medicines legislation to products that fall within the definition of a medicinal product, even if that product is already regulated under other sectoral legislation. The United Kingdom is firmly opposed to this proposal and is resisting it strongly in the negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.2/1">There have been guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry to follow on the use of certain animal materials in the production of vaccines and other medicines since 1989. The latest version of the guidelines was drawn up by the European scientific committee, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP), and adopted in May 2001. The latest version of the guidelines became legally binding from <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-01">1 July 2000</phrase> for new applications for a licence for a medicinal product and from <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March 2001</phrase> for products that were already licensed.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">The scope of guidance at any one time, and its implications for pharmaceutical companies, have often been unclear. Following a thorough review of the information supplied to Parliament on bovine spongiform encephalopathy-related issues in vaccines, the Government have established that, regrettably, incorrect and misleading information was given to Ministers by the Medicines Control Agency and thus has been given in response to a number of Parliamentary Questions. My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Blears), made a Statement in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-05">Friday 5 July</phrase> setting out the reasons for these errors and the current state of compliance with the guidelines. An account of the questions incorrectly answered and the correct information has now been placed in the Library, and letters sent to Members of both Houses who asked those questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">We have also placed in the Library:</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4" class="indent">a copy of the Government's Chief Medical Officer's report on the withdrawal of the Medeva-Evans oral polio vaccine in October 2000;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5" class="indent">a copy of the Committee on Safety of Medicine's (CSM) consolidated review of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents and the safety of United Kingdom authorised human medicines;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/6" class="indent">a report by the MCA that explains in detail the development of the guidance for the pharmaceutical industry to follow on the use of certain animal-derived materials in the manufacture of medicines, and the approach taken by the agency to its implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/7">For all practical purposes, nothing in the reports that have been published changes the safety profile of any vaccine licensed for use in the UK. In particular, the CSM's review is reassuring in concluding that there are no TSE-related issues arising from the use of animal materials in the manufacture of UK licensed vaccines.</p>
