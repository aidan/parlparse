	<p pid="a.67.1/3" qnum="HL4106">Whether Northern Ireland Civic Forum staff have been reallocated to other departments since October 2002; if so, whether their salaries and expenses are scored against the new department; and how was such expenditure approved and by whom.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">In the financial year 2003&ndash;04 costs incurred in relation to the Northern Ireland Civic Forum amounted to some &pound;128,000. This may be broadly broken down in terms of maintaining accommodation to allow for the swift restoration of devolution (approx &pound;88,000), salary costs for redeployed staff (approx &pound;37,000) and sundry costs (approx &pound;3,000) in respect of maintenance of equipment contracts, professional fees etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/2">The redeployment of Civic Forum staff was anticipated to be a short term step with staff returning to Civic Forum duties immediately upon restoration. Budgetary provision for these staff was therefore retained within the Civic Forum salary allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/3">This arrangement was not satisfactory in bookkeeping terms for a protracted period of suspension and has now been resolved. No salaries will be charged against any Civic Forum allocation for the year 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/4">All expenditure incurred on behalf of the Civic Forum since October 2002 was authorised by officials operating within normal departmental accounting practices.</p>

When a child enters the country alone and claims asylum or there are concerns that he or she may have been trafficked, the Immigration Service should immediately refer the child to the relevant local authority's social services department. The social services department will undertake a needs assessment and will provide services in the light of the outcome of that assessment. These services should be tailored to the individual needs of the child, just as they should be for any child in need.</p>

The Government are seeking to introduce flexibility into the fixed penalty system for speeding offences to address this link by ensuring that the more extreme the speed, the greater the penalty that applies. Our aim is to address the risks that arise from inappropriate speeds wherever they occur&mdash;in 30 mph limits and elsewhere.
