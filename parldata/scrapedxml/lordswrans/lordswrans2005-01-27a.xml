For example, in December 2004, in an operation co-ordinated by PSNI, police on both sides of the border and in GB conducted a number of searches as part of an investigation against organised criminals suspected of illegal waste dumping and smuggling operations.</p>

Specifically, we indicated that we could not accept changes designed to include favourable elements of current arrangements alongside the improvements in the new schemes or which sought to tie the new schemes to unaffordable pensions legacy issues. It was our clearly stated policy to introduce improved schemes for the Armed Forces as set out in our proposals.

	<p pid="a.181.8/1">The number of looked after children in England, either in a foster placement or children's home, based outside the area of the placing authority in England was 13,900, out of a total of 47,000 at <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>. This represents just under 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.8/2">The Government are determined to work with local authorities to reduce this figure. We know that, while some children need to be placed out-of-authority, many looked after children placed a long way from home suffer poorer educational and other outcomes than looked after children living in or near their own communities. That is why I shall be writing shortly to all local authorities in England to press them to develop strategies to ensure that they place looked after children out-of-authority only where their assessed needs clearly justify it.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.2/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Transport (Mr David Jamieson) is considering applications from two hauliers for permission to trial longer and heavier, but not wider, goods vehicles. His officials are investigating the safety issues surrounding the vehicles, such as the manoeuvrability of the combination, stability and braking performance, and the impact of the vehicle on other road users.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/2">Longer and heavier goods vehicles are, however, used in Sweden and Finland where they are deployed for a unique purpose. They are also being trialled in the Netherlands.</p>
