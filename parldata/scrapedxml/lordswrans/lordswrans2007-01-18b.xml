	<p pid="b.172.2/1">Winter fuel payments are worth &pound;200 to households with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to households with someone aged 80 or over. Estimates suggest that making winter fuel payments fully taxable would raise revenue of around &pound;465 million. This would represent an increase of around &pound;55 for each of the 8.5 million households that receive winter fuel payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.172.2/2">The estimation of revenue raised excludes those in residential care and relies on a number of simplifying assumptions such as 100 per cent take-up of winter fuel payments and no behavioural change. Taxing winter fuel payments would be administratively complicated, and this administrative cost is also not taken into account.</p>

It did not focus specifically on children in care because the Government have published two key documents on these issues in recent months.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.8/2">New proposals on children in care were set out in the <I>Care Matters</I> Green Paper, which was launched for consultation in October.

In addition, the report of the Options for Excellence Review published in October 2006 provides a framework for future developments for the social care workforce. This focuses on five key areas: continuing professional development, recruitment and retention, new ways of working, strengthening leadership and management and improved commissioning.

	<p pid="b.175.0/3">Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) can include in their design small wetlands. They can intercept pollution from storm drains and run-off from hard surfaces, such as roads and car parks. They are an integral part of the pilot projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/4">Wetlands, as functioning biological systems, can clean water by a mix of physical and biological mechanisms. Natural wetlands are shallow, permanently flooded or wet marshy ground populated with macroyphytic vascular plants (that is, reeds). Constructed wetlands are now a very widespread and quite well understood form of soft engineering for pollution mitigation. However, the primary function of wetland systems in the UK and Europe is now the provision of biodiversity. Most wetlands are under conservation designation, which may compromise their function to clean water. Many would benefit from clean water entering the system, because pollutants can compromise the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>

The Republic of Cyprus has EU rights and obligations in this matter, reflected in a regulation adopted at the time of accession, as well as national law. However, we recognise that the green line regulation is still very limited in scope and that there are a number of obstacles which hinder trade across the green line. We continue to encourage both sides to lift all restrictions to allow for unhindered exchanges of goods, which we believe is in the interests of all Cypriots and all EU member states, and would promote reunification of the island.</p>

	<p pid="b.178.5/1">We have had discussions with the Metropolitan Police Service in the light of the representations from Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur on the policing of demonstrations. We keep public order legislation under review and would always consider representations from the police service on changes. We would also consult the police service as a whole on any proposed changes to legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.5/2">It is already a criminal offence for a person to display or deface a national flag if such activity is likely to pose a real risk to public order or the activity constitutes incitement to racial or religious hatred. For example, under Sections 4A and 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, a person may be guilty of an offence if they display any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.5/3">In determining whether a person has committed such offences the court is required to respect a person's right to freedom of expression, while balancing that freedom with the need to maintain public order and protect the rights of people who may be offended by the activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.5/4">In addition to the offences under Sections 4A and 5, the Public Order Act 1986 gives the police the power to impose conditions on, or to prohibit, processions and to impose conditions on assemblies. The types of conditions that may be imposed on an assembly are limited to those relating to its place, the numbers taking part and its duration. There are no restrictions on the type of conditions that may be placed on processions.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.5/5">There are already powers in place to allow the police to require the removal of face coverings. Section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was inserted by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. It enables a police officer of inspector rank or above to authorise police officers within a given area for a period of up to 24 hours to require the removal of face coverings worn for the purpose of concealing identity and to seize any such items. Before authorising an area, an inspector must reasonably believe that activities likely to involve the commission of offences will take place in that area and that it is expedient, in order to prevent or control the activities, to give an authorisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.181.0/1">(a &amp; b) There is no legislation that governs the form, shape or size of the union flag or the English flag (St George's cross). There are no rules about the permitted use of the union flag or English flag (cross of St George) on non-government buildings, provided the flag is flown on a single vertical flagstaff and neither the flag nor the flagstaff display any advertisement additional to the design of the flag as explained under the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992. Government departments are restricted to flying flags on 18 fixed days a year in compliance with rules issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Consideration should also be given to flag protocol, which considers it improper to fly the union flag upside down and requires that the flag should not be defaced by text or symbols and should be treated with respect.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.0/2">(c &amp; d) There is also no legislation that governs the form, shape or size of the Royal Arms of Scotland (here referred to as the Scottish royal lion flag) or the St Andrew's cross, but the design is firmly specified in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland. The Royal Arms of Scotland can only be used by the Sovereign or her Great Lieutenants when acting in their official capacity. The Scottish flag (St Andrew's cross) may be flown by Scots and to represent Scotland on all occasions; however, under The Act of Lyon King of Arms Act 1672, cap. 47 individuals may not deface the flag by placing a symbol on top of the flag or use it in such a way that suggests it is his/her personal property.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.0/3">(e) There is no specific legislation about the Welsh flag design or rules about permitted use.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.0/4">(f) The union flag is the only official flag that represents Northern Ireland. The Flags (NI) Order 2000 empowered the Secretary of State to make the Flags Regulations (NI) 2000, which governs when and where the union flag can be flown from government buildings in Northern Ireland on specified days. The legislation does not define the form, shape or design of the union flag. Flag flying from non-governmental buildings is unregulated.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.0/5">For all flags, consideration should also be given to flag protocol, which requires flags to be treated with respect, not to be defaced by text or symbols or flown upside down.</p>

	<p pid="b.181.3/1">The Government's position on the closure of Guantanamo Bay is clear. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has said, Guantanamo Bay should be closed. The US Government are fully aware of our position.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.3/2">We welcome President Bush's public statements expressing a wish to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility as soon as practicable and the US Government's efforts to reduce numbers at the camp. However, we recognise that this is a complicated task and that there are issues, including trials of detainees under the recent Military Commissions Act, which still need to be resolved. Careful consideration needs to be given to how numbers at the camp are reduced to ensure international security is maintained and the human rights of detainees respected&mdash;including if they are to be transferred back to their countries of nationality.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-01-18b.182.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="182"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70118w0002.htm#07011847000158">
	<p pid="b.182.2/1">Work previously undertaken by the prescription pricing division of the National Health Service Business Service Authority has shown that quantities prescribed already match that of an available pack size in the majority of cases. For example, sample statistics show that drugs available in a pack size of 28 are prescribed in multiples of 28 nearly 78 per cent of the time. Further, it is unlikely that standard packs sizes would always represent the best or most clinically appropriate quantity for every patient. We are therefore not convinced that further encouragement for prescribers to prescribe in line with patient pack sizes will significantly increase the dispensing of patient packs.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/2">However, we are fully supportive of increasing the use of patient packs and new services provided as part of the new community pharmacy contractual framework&mdash;such as repeat dispensing and medicines use review&mdash;are giving community pharmacists and general practitioners new opportunities to work together. These two services may give rise to the opportunity to consider the optimum quantities in which medicines should be prescribed for an individual patient, taking into account, amongst other things, the ability to dispense using a patient pack.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/3">Further, at the end of 2005, we consulted on proposals to simplify the reimbursement arrangements for NHS dispensing contractors. These included measures designed to further promote patient pack dispensing, such as allowing pharmacists a limited dispensing discretion with regard to the quantity prescribed to be able to dispense a full patient pack on more occasions. We are currently considering how we take this forward in light of responses.</p>

We will carefully consider the findings of this review, which is expected to report by the end of February, before proceeding with any plans to introduce dental analysis as supplementary evidence in assessing age for immigration purposes. An interview with the child or young person and consideration of information submitted will remain important factors in the final decision on their age. We are planning to publish a consultation paper soon on this and other possible reforms in the context of processing applications for asylum from unaccompanied minors.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.0/1">The level of skill required varies depending on the role of the individual. A competent member of staff who could cook, prepare and finish meals from scratch, which meet the new school food standards, would be working at level 2 of the qualifications framework, and would be a competent cook able to work with a high degree of autonomy. A head chef or someone with supervisory responsibilities would be working at level 3 of the framework, and be able to manage staff and resources and have significant operational responsibilities for work in kitchens.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/2">Training is currently provided in a number of ways. Local authorities and contract caterers provide significant amounts of in-house training. In addition, there are colleges and private training providers which offer courses leading to nationally recognised qualifications such as the certificate in providing healthier school meals, the support workers in schools qualification and national vocational qualifications in professional cookery and food processing and cookery. The department will also be investing &pound;2 million in 2007-08 in the establishment of a network of regional training centres for school catering staff to act as centres of excellence. The department has asked the School Food Trust to take the lead on developing this proposal. Further work is under way, including looking at how this network will fit into existing provision in schools and colleges, and by private providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.195.3/1">The Private Security Industry Act 2001 requires contract security guards to hold a personal licence issued for that purpose by the Security Industry Authority. There is no exception from this requirement in respect of guards at government offices. Where a security firm has been granted approved status by the SIA under the voluntary approved contractor scheme and has the required authorisation from the SIA, they may deploy up to 15 per cent of staff who are unlicensed but have licence applications being processed by the SIA.</p>
