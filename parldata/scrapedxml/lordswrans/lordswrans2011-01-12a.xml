	<p pid="a.445.9/1">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-13">13 December 2010</phrase> details of the school funding settlement for 2011-12, including the level of the pupil premium which will be set at &#163;430 per eligible pupil. We agree that improving the home learning environment in poorer families, such as through providing internet access, can be important in helping to close the gaps in attainment between deprived and non-deprived children. It will however be for schools to decide how best to use the funding for the benefit of their deprived pupils.</p>

In particular, we want a stronger focus on closing the gap in achievement between the richest and poorest by supporting the most vulnerable young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.5/2">The young people's workforce needs a distinct set of skills and knowledge to engage young people, facilitate their personal and social development and to deliver effective interventions. We have recently published our intention to appoint a strategic partner in the voluntary and community youth sector and a key function will be to support front-line professionals to develop the knowledge, skills and confidence that they need. We intend to publish a policy document in early 2011 which will set out our plans for youth services.</p>
