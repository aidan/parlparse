	<p pid="a.1.5/2">Any major changes, such as the cancellation of a carrier, to the QE class contract would first require a period of negotiation between the MoD and Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) to agree what changes would need to be made to the programme.

	<p pid="a.2.8/1">The risk factors and lessons learned from all outbreaks of avian influenza, whether of low or high pathogenicity in birds, have been taken into consideration in the formulation of our contingency plans for, and response to, outbreaks of avian influenza in the United Kingdom. The last outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of type H7 (H7N7) in the UK was in June 2008. It is considered highly likely that this highly pathogenic infection derived from a pre-existing low pathogenicity infection (LPAI) of type H7, as was the case in the outbreak of Italy in 1999, which was caused by avian influenza type H7 (H7N1).</p>
	<p pid="a.2.8/2">Spain has reported this month its first ever outbreak of HPAI in chickens caused by type H7. There remains a constant low risk of the introduction of both HPAI and LPAI into the UK via wild birds, though there is negligible likelihood of introduction of HPAI into the UK through legal trade with Spain.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/1">The regulations governing the supervision of branches of European economic area (EEA) banks are set out in European legislation. These regulations apply equally to banks headquartered in the UK and outside the UK, but within the EEA. Under the single market legislation, a bank authorised in one member state has a right to establish a branch in another member state. Day-to-day supervision of branches of EEA banks trading in the UK is a matter for the Financial Services Authority (FSA).</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/2">The FSA's responsibilities over EEA branches are set by EU law and include shared responsibility for liquidity but exclude all other areas of prudential monitoring. Recent changes to the EU's capital requirements directive permit the supervisor of a significant branch to be a member of a supervisory college. This should provide supervisors of branches with a better picture of the health of the financial group and alert them to emerging problems the group may be facing.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/3">The Government believe that the rules and safeguards for cross-border branching within the EEA should be strengthened to reduce the likelihood, and cost, of the failure of a foreign branch. The European Economic and Financial Affairs Council agreed, in October 2009, to invite the European Commission to further review the home-host arrangements for branches under the EU single passport. The Government will play an active role in proposing appropriate changes to the framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/4">Financial institutions outside the EEA wishing to establish an authorised presence in the UK can open either a branch or a subsidiary. The FSA will authorise institutions as a branch once the home regulator has been assessed for equivalence to UK and EEA supervisory standards, and once the whole firm has been assessed as meeting the FSA's threshold conditions for authorisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.0/1">The 2005 Whole Farm Approach business case was reviewed in 2008, and the estimate for savings expected by 2009-10 was revised downward from &pound;3 million to &pound;2 million to reflect lower than originally anticipated farmer take-up. The system is working well and receiving positive feedback from those farmers who use it.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">The system is now providing online access to the cattle tracing scheme and access to the single payment scheme is scheduled to be available in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">Taken together with other online services and a rapidly growing number of users, we expect the current review of the business case to confirm delivery of the forecast benefits and for further benefits to be identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">Savings are achieved through pre-populated online forms, immediate validation, improved advice and guidance, and similar facilities which should make the online system quicker and easier for farmers and their agents to use. These savings will be reflected in the annual simplification plan, due to be published each December.</p>

Decisions in these difficult cases should be taken in accordance with professional guidance. If artificial hydration might prolong a patient's life, and the patient has the capacity to make decisions about their care, the clinician is expected to discuss with the patient the benefits, disadvantages and risks so that they can make an informed decision about their future treatment. If artificial hydration might prolong the patient's life and the patient lacks capacity, those close to the patient should be fully involved in making a decision which serves the patient's best interests.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.5/2">The configuration of stroke services will depend on a number of factors, for example the geography of the area and the age profile of the local population. Commissioners will therefore need to decide which configuration of services best meet the needs of their locality. This could range from fully specified free-standing rural hospitals, through networked groups of units across regions to hub and spoke arrangements in dense urban areas. New technologies, such as telemedicine, can afford solutions to providing services in rural areas.</p>

The RPA logotype is included because it is the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate of the RPA which enforces the marketing standards in England. The enforcement labels assist in quickly identifying the breach identified to all concerned. In the case of the regraded label, they indicate to the holder of the produce that the labels on the produce containing the class information required by the marketing standards need to be corrected.

	<p pid="a.17.3/1">Procurement of the primary supplier contracts under the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) was completed between February 2003 and February 2004. Since that time there has been no renegotiation of these contracts, and no changes to their terms and conditions. There have, however, been resets of the contracts. Reset is a normal, repeatable process for contracts with a long lifetime to ensure that their ongoing delivery reflects progress to date, current priorities, and deployment plans for the future, and that they continue to support the evolving needs of the National Health Service. However, reset allows for the option of agreeing enhancements to existing services or functionality that does not effect a change in contract scope or risk allocation. The contracts contain provision for the termination of the whole contract or a part of the services provided by a supplier.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/2">In 2008, the department finalised a range of framework contracts through open competition to provide additional capacity and capability in the supply of information technology (IT) services to the NHS. The contracts will enable the streamlined procurement of IT systems and services from suppliers who have demonstrated experience in the health sector and can be used to support both NPfIT-related work and wider IT-related projects. The procurement of the framework contracts was initiated with the publication of an <I>OJEU</I> notice in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/3">These contracts are not intended to replace the contracts already let for the National Programme for IT. They supplement the existing supply capacity, and enable new requirements to be met through a readily available approved framework, while mitigating any risk of existing suppliers being unable to meet contractual commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/4">The framework arrangements provide for NHS bodies with specific requirements to conduct a further competitions procedure, engaging suppliers who have been awarded a framework contract in the appropriate service category or categories. Should changes to requirements be necessary in due course there may be an opportunity to amend the defined terms and conditions of supply, depending on the scope and type of these changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.2/1">Education and sport have a very important role to play in helping to tackle racial and homophobic hate propaganda. The Government's view is that there is no place for racism or homophobia in any aspect of our society, whether in the education system, the sporting world or the wider society.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/2">Schools, sports partnerships, sports clubs and national governing bodies of sport are supported by the Youth Sport Trust and Sport England to help ensure that their programmes and provision are totally inclusive and free from all bias and prejudice in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/3">For example, the terms and conditions for county sports partnerships require that they operate fair procedures in relation to any individuals and that they should not exclude anyone from participation on the grounds of race, religion, colour, sex (except where the programme relates to participants of one gender only, for example, women's football), occupation, disability or political persuasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/4">The sports plans of national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport are scrutinised by Sport England's equality officers to ensure that there is appropriate reference and emphasis on equality. For example, NGBs are required to include an equality/inclusion statement in their constitution, by-laws or official handbook and must ensure equal access to participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/5">More specifically, &quot;Let's Kick Racism out of Football&quot; and &quot;Show Racism the Red Card&quot; are two community programmes run by the Football Association and the Football Foundation which use the powerful image of football, clubs and players to tackle racism head on and to present an anti-racist message to young people and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/6">In partnership with the Youth Sport Trust and Sport England, the Government have introduced two athlete mentor programmes. The Respect Athlete Mentor Programme (RAMP) and the Changing Lives Scheme each uses elite sports men and women as role models to engage with young people from disaffected backgrounds and to provide a positive influence. Athletes are selected from a wide range of contrasting backgrounds and demonstrate how they have had to overcome significant challenges such as bullying, dyslexia, exclusion or disability on their way to sporting success.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/7">The British Council's International Inspirations programme is dedicated to improving cultural relations with other countries and is creating lasting opportunities for children and young people of all abilities in schools and communities across the world, particularly in developing countries. The programme encourages an international dimension in school development planning to raise whole school standards and achievement and explores issues such as cultural diversity, inclusion, religion, ethics, global communication and the Olympic and Paralympic values.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/8">The national strategy for PE and sport was introduced in 2003 and has increased the percentage of 5 to 16 year-olds taking part in at least two hours' high-quality PE and sport each week from 62 per cent in 2003-04 to 90 per cent in 2007-08. We are building on this success and now want all 5 to 16 year-olds to have access to five hours of PE and sport per week whatever their ability or circumstances, with three hours for 16 to 19 year-olds. In delivering on our targets, the Government will continue to work to promote inclusion throughout the education and sporting worlds and will seek to ensure that we do not become complacent in this respect.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">In the past few weeks there has been some progress on the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs); unconfirmed UN figures as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-26">26 October 2009</phrase> are that 32,000 people to date have been returned to their home areas, mainly to Jaffna, and 228,000 people remain in closed camps, mainly in Vavuniya. We are advocating at all levels with the Government of Sri Lanka freedom of movement for IDPs so that they can return to their areas of origin and be provided support when they return home. We are also encouraging the Government of Sri Lanka to co-operate constructively with the UN and other international humanitarian agencies. The monsoon season underlines the importance of progress on returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">The European Commission published its report into its investigation of Sri Lanka's compliance with GSP plus conventions on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-19">19 October 2009</phrase>. The report raises serious concerns about the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, which we share. The report is a precursor to the Commission's recommendation to EU member states on whether Sri Lanka should continue to benefit from the GSP+ trade preference scheme. We are clear that to do so Sri Lanka must respect its international human rights obligations under GSP+. We continue to urge the Government of Sri Lanka to engage with the Commission and to take immediate action to address the issues outlined in its report.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">A sustainable political settlement will depend upon genuine reconciliation between all of Sri Lanka's communities. The Sri Lankan Government have made some progress, through for example opening up a dialogue between the President and the Tamil National Alliance, but more needs to be done in this regard in advance of any elections in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/4">Implementation of the Government of Sri Lanka's own commitment to return the bulk of the IDPs to their homes by the end of the year will also be crucial for the long-term peace and stability of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.0/2">Immediate implementation of the retro-reflective tape requirements would not prevent all such accidents. It will be some years before all relevant heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are so fitted, and although fitment is expected to reduce side/rear HGV impact accidents involving poor conspicuity, there are many other contributory causes which it cannot address. These include excess speed, drink-driving, ice, mechanical failure, driving while tired, driver distraction etc.</p>
