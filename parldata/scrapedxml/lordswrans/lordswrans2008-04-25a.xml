	<p pid="a.323.5/1">Airspace planning and regulation is the responsibility of the independent Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The process for making changes to airspace is governed by the CAA's airspace change process. Under this process it is for airspace change sponsors to develop and consult on proposals. Detailed guidance is given on what impacts are to be taken into account, how they should be measured and who should be consulted. Informed by the consultation, the sponsor submits the proposal to the CAA's Directorate of Airspace Policy for assessment against regulatory requirements. In determining whether to accept or reject a proposal, the CAA's process reflects the Secretary of State's directions and guidance to the CAA on the exercise of its statutory duties and environmental objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.327.2/1">In February this year, the Government made a renewed commitment to build community cohesion, as part of our response to the Commission on Integration and Cohesion's report. Community cohesion is about much more than preventing violence&mdash;it is part of building sustainable active and empowered communities. Central to this is the principle that cohesion must be understood and built locally by local authorities and the local partnerships which they lead. Central government's role is to set the national framework within which local authorities and their partners operate. We are working with EHRC in developing our policies and approach. We are providing both funding and support to do this: &pound;50million over the next three years and a cohesion delivery framework in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.2/2">The findings of the MORI poll of just 1,000 people contrast sharply with those of the citizenship survey of 10,000 people. The citizenship survey found that 81 per cent of people feel that individuals from different backgrounds get on well together in their local area and that 83 per cent of people agree that people in their local area respect ethnic differences, an increase from 79 per cent in 2003. In its final report, published in June 2007, the Commission on Integration and Cohesion, also found that cohesion rates only fell below 60 per cent in 10 out of 387 areas in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.2/3">We work routinely with local authorities and the police to assess where local tensions may arise and we encourage local areas to do the same. We will shortly be publishing guidance for local areas on tension monitoring and contingency planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.2/4">The coverage of immigration and race relations stories by the media is a matter for the relevant regulatory bodies or the courts, not the Government. The Government strongly believe that a press free from state intervention is fundamental to democracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.2/1">Visa categories that have the full right of appeal are considered by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. Other categories that have a limited right of appeal fall under the remit of the Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance, who monitors a sample of applications. We also have internal procedures within the visa section to ensure consistency of decision making.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.5/2">We welcome Dr Manfred Nowak's, the UN Special Rapportuer on Torture, visit to Indonesia in November 2007, at the invitation of the Indonesian Government. In an address to the UN Human Rights Council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-04">4 March</phrase>, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Hassan Wirajuda, expressed appreciation for the importance of the work of the special rapporteurs and undertook to sustain Indonesia's dialogue with them. The report of Dr Manfred Nowak's visit was published at the UN Human Rights Council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-10">10 March</phrase>. It notes the considerable progress made in Indonesia since 1998 and the commitment of the current government to uphold and promote human rights. It also raises concerns about torture and ill treatment in places of detention, particularly in the metropolitan areas of Java.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.5/3">We are continuing to study Dr Nowak's report and are consulting with EU partners on how we might engage with the Indonesian Government on its findings.</p>
