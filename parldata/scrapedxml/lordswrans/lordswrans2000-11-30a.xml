The board noted the PwC view, and took expert advice about the company's solvency position at the end of August.

This was found to be the correct course of action as on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-05">5 September</phrase> the commission approved a grant of &pound;47 million to the NMEC which secured NMEC's ongoing solvency.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.2/1">The e-Envoy's primary responsibility has not changed since Alex Allan was appointed as the Government's first e-Envoy--that is, to meet the Government's aim of making the UK one of the world's leading knowledge economies by getting the UK online. My honourable friend the Minister for e-Commerce and the e-Envoy will continue to report to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister monthly in writing, and quarterly in person, on progress towards the Government's targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/2">However, as the noble Lord is aware, the environment in which the next e-Envoy will operate has evolved. The UK, and the global e-commerce environment have changed, becoming more sophisticated; our e-government strategy has developed; and the office of the e-Envoy's structure has altered to support this.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/3">Therefore, the ways in which this overall responsibility will be achieved, and the skills it requires, have developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.0/1">EU regulations permit the import into the UK, from the USA and Canada, of wild and farmed game meat from animals of the Odocoileus hemionus species and Cervus elaphus nelsoni for human consumption. Consignments must come from EU approved establishments and must be accompanied by official veterinary health certification, which does not, however, specifically refer to freedom from chronic wasting disease (CWD).</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/2">The importation from the USA or Canada of game meat products derived from these animals is not permitted under Community law as there are no EU approved processing establishments. Imports of parts of the animals or materials derived from them (ie. game trophies and hides and skins) may be imported under EU regulations but not for human consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/3">We have been told by the authorities in Canada that elk and mule deer meat are not exported or used in the food chain. There is a depopulation programme in place in respect of those herds affected by CWD. There have been no recorded cases of CWD in red deer in Canada. CWD is present in the USA but is confined to a small geographical region. Six establishments in the USA are approved to export game meat to the UK and they are significantly distant from this region.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.2/1">Through our programmes to promote sustainable development and poverty elimination DFID is helping to reduce the circumstances which give rise to trafficking and sexual exploitation of women and children. This is an international problem which requires co-ordinated international action. DFID is supporting national governments and international bodies in such efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2">In the Greater Mekong Sub-region we are supporting the International Labour Organisation's project to reduce trafficking of women and children in Loas, Thailand, China (Yunnan), Cambodia and Vietnam. In the Balkans we are working with the International Organisation for Migration to train agencies dealing with trafficking, such as police, social workers and the legal profession. We hope to create models of best practice which can be adopted elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.0/1">The common position on the Takeovers Directive adopted by the Council of Ministers in June this year is being considered by the European Parliament under the co-decision procedure. Under this procedure the Parliament, acting by an absolute majority of its members, may propose amendments to the common position. It is expected to vote on possible amendments at its plenary session beginning on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase>. At this stage, it is not clear whether the Parliament will vote in favour of any proposed amendments to the common position. If it does so, it is not clear what those proposed amendments might be. Under the co-decision procedure the Parliament cannot unilaterally make amendments to the text of a draft directive--they must be agreed by the Council. If the Council does not agree amendments proposed by the Parliament, a conciliation procedure between the Parliament and Council begins with a view to reaching agreement on the text. The Government, in consultation with the Takeover Panel, and together with the other member states, will consider any suggested changes to the text of the common position arising from this process, in order to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.</p>

Section 111 applies where an offender, after <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-30">30 November 1999</phrase>, is convicted of an offence of domestic burglary, having previously been convicted on two separate occasions of offences of domestic burglary also committed after <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-30">30 November 1999</phrase>. It is entirely possible that there have been no occasions in the seven months at issue when an offender has gone through the sequence of committing an offence, being apprehended and convicted on three separate occasions (where he must also have been sentenced and served any period of imprisonment imposed in relation to the first two occasions.)</p>

	<p pid="a.173.3/1">the YouGov article incorrectly asserts that under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), &quot;lesser public authorities such as local councils, the benefits office have the power to intercept anyone's emails&quot;. The only agencies which are empowered to seek interception warrants (which do not include those bodies quoted by YouGov) are set out in Section 6(2) of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/2">RIPA does not, as the YouGov article suggests, place the burden on the person served with a disclosure notice to prove that an encryption code has been lost innocently. Sections 53(2) and (3) of the Act refer. This offence was amended following discussion in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June</phrase>. The changes were welcomed by spokesmen for the Opposition parties (cols. 1011-1012).</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/3">It is not true that the regulations, made under Section 4(2) of the Act, give employers &quot;carte blanche&quot; to monitor their employees' communications. They establish rules, for the first time, governing this activity with a civil liability for those who breach the regulations (Section 1(3)).</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/4">The suggestion that the Act would be in force from <phrase class="date" code="">5 November</phrase> is also wrong. The Government do not envisage commencing parts of the Act--the provisions in Part I, Chapter II and Part III--until early and late 2001 respectively. This is to allow sufficient time for detailed discussions with interested parties on the implementation of these crucial provisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.2/1">The Secretary of State for the Home Department announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-04">4 October 2000</phrase> that temporary authority would be granted for competitors to compete in shooting events at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The Home Department and the national governing bodies of shooting, the National Rifle Association, and the National Small-Bore Rifle Association in association with Surrey police, have agreed an arrangement within the current firearm legislation which will enable British and foreign competitors to bring their firearms into the country for the duration of the Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.2/2">The legislation will require that all visitors to this country will have to apply for a visitors firearms permit and those visitors must have a sponsor. The National Rifle Association will act as sponsors for all visitors firearms permits. This means each participating country's team manager will have to apply to the 2002 Commonwealth Games Office for an application form. Details will need to be provided on the numbers and types of all Section 1 and Section 5 firearms and shotguns to be brought into the country. Air rifles and air pistols do not need any form of visitors permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.2/3">Applications for permits will be cleared within one month of receipt, accepting that Surrey police will have to deal with 42 countries. In this respect, the 2002 Commonwealth Games Office will expect applications to be returned to them no later than mid-May 2002. The Commonwealth Games Committee have already sent general guidelines on the use of firearms to all the participating countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.2/4">All firearms will have to enter the country via London Heathrow airport and no exceptions to this rule will be allowed. Competitors will not be allowed to take firearms beyond Customs control at Heathrow, as they will be transported in special vehicles to the National Shooting Centre at Bisley. Once on the site at Bisley, these firearms will have to be transported from their armoury to the range by Commonwealth Games officials, and competitors will therefore only have access to them on the range for shooting or maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.2/5">Her Majesty's Government will endeavour to treat all competitors equally whether from abroad or the UK in regard to the receipt of firearms into the country. However, the Home Office have confirmed that there will be no additional arrangements in place for them to compensate British competitors who incur travelling costs while practising abroad for shooting events.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.2/6">However, in order to compliment the likely UK Sport funded World Class Performance Programme for UK Shooting (Olympic disciplines only), Sport England may continue with a specific Commonwealth Games preparation programme of Lottery funding to English shooters who are not covered by the UK Plan. It is possible therefore that if there are potential English medalists for the Commonwealth Games in the pistol shooting disciplines, they may be supported up to Manchester 2002 via some form of training and targeted competition programme overseas which are appropriate. This would be for Sport England to decide in conjunction with the English Target Shooting Federation.</p>
