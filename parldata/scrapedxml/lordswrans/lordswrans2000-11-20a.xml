<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-11-20a.53.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100688" speakername="Lord Williams of Mostyn" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001120/text/01120w01.htm#01120w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.53.2/1">His Honour Gerald Butler QC delivered his report to the Attorney General on 18th August 2000. The report recommends the retention of the Treasury Counsel system but makes important recommendations to open up and modernise the Treasury Counsel arrangements. The Government will be accepting most of the recommendations without modification. The system of selecting barristers to be monitored for appointment as Treasury Counsel will be reformed with the aim of encouraging applications from a broader cross-section of the bar (and solicitor advocates) and there will be a higher quality of monitoring so that able barristers have the best chance of an appointment. There will be clear rules as to the maximum permitted length of service for Junior and Senior Treasury Counsel. There will be new criteria governing the ambit of work sent to Treasury Counsel with the aim of reducing their considerable workload and giving other barristers more opportunity to be instructed in cases being prosecuted at the Old Bailey. Murder and manslaughter cases not falling within the criteria will not normally be prosecuted by Treasury Counsel at the Old Bailey in the future. Consideration will be given to instructing Counsel from the provinces in cases at the Old Bailey and, with a reduced volume of work, Treasury Counsel will be freed up to prosecute some cases in the provinces and to be instructed to defend in some cases. The practice whereby Junior Treasury Counsel are paid a brief fee of two-thirds of that of Senior Treasury Counsel leading him or her, whatever work is to be done, will cease. I believe these reforms will be of considerable benefit to the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">The report and the Government's response have been placed today in the Libraries of each House for the information of members. It is also being published today on the Attorney General's website (<a href="http://www.lslo.gov.uk">www.lslo.gov.uk</a>), with copies being made available to interested parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.3/1">Emission standards for waste incineration--including those for dioxins and heavy metals--are currently tight and will get even tighter with the proposed Waste Incineration Directive, due to be adopted very shortly. The Environment Agency currently sets a dioxins limit of no more than 1ng <sup>3</sup> m--i.e. no more than 1 part in a billion--whilst the proposed directive will tighten the limit 10-fold to 0.1ng/m <sup>3</sup> . But no emission from any source--e.g. road traffic, domestic appliances, industry, or waste management--will be completely risk-free. The Chief Medical Officer's expert advisory Committee on Carcinogenicity has considered two studies of effects in populations living around the older generation of incinerators--now closed or fully refitted to modern standards--and concluded that any potential risk of cancer from living near a municipal waste incinerator for periods in excess of 10 years was exceedingly low and probably not measurable by the most modern epidemiological techniques. Any consideration of the environmental effects of incineration needs to also take account of the effects of alternative courses of action.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/1">The Electronic Communications Act 2000 contains in Section 8 a power to amend legislation by statutory instrument, to authorise or facilitate electronic communication or storage.

	<p pid="a.60.5/3">In her memorandum submitted to Parliament during the passage of the Electronic Communications Bill in January 2000, my honourable friend the Minister for Small Business and e-Commerce said, &quot;The Government envisages that the first Order would be subject to an affirmative resolution, but that Orders under clause 8 would normally be subject to a negative resolution. After the first Order therefore the affirmative resolution procedure would be used only exceptionally, with any Orders that raised major issues of principle.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/4">As no major issues of principle are raised by the DETR order, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, DETR, has made it subject to the negative resolution procedure.

The order has therefore been made, and is likley to come into force, before the company law order.</p>

Over 900 young people have already received Millennium Volunteers Awards. Young people also receive a Millennium Volunteers Certificate after 100 hours' voluntary activity in recognition of their achievement. We have contracted with 160 projects throughout England.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">The Commission's revised proposal for a Community Regulation on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters includes in Article 15 consumer provisions which in certain circumstances would allow consumers to sue in their home courts when in dispute with traders in other member states. In particular, consumers would be entitled to do so where the trader, &quot;pursues commercial or professional activities in the Member State of the consumer's domicile or . . . directs such activities to that Member State&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.2/2">The Government's approach is to seek to avoid placing significant extra burdens on business, while taking into account the need to build consumer confidence in e-commerce. In the light of this we welcome the Commission's proposal to delete Recital 13 of its original proposal, which defined &quot;directs such activities&quot; in such a way that all transactions involving Internet websites would automatically have been covered by Article 15. Member states have provisionally agreed that this recital should be deleted.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.2/3">The Government agree with the Alliance for Electronic Business (AEB) that it would be desirable to have a new definition of &quot;directs such activities&quot;. One possibility would be to provide that Article 15 would only apply where websites are intentionally targeted at particular member states. The fact that a website is accessible in different countries, or uses languages or currencies which are in common use in several countries, should not by itself indicate that a trader's activities are directed to those countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.2/4">The Government also agree with the AEB that it would be desirable for the Presidency to allow more time for member states to discuss the implications of Article 15 for e-commerce, and for the five-year review period for the regulation to be shortened. We have proposed that the Commission be required to review the impact of Article 15, particularly on smaller firms, at the same time as the review of the Directive on Electronic Commerce, which is to be completed by July 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.2/5">The Government believe that in many future cases the best way to resolve contractual disputes will be through low cost, user friendly alternative dispute resolution (ADR) schemes such as arbitration and ombudsmen. We support proposals from other member states that the regulation should be accompanied by a joint statement from the Council and the Commission drawing attention to the importance of developing cross-border ADR in the single market.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">This seems to confirm the findings of our own survey on information security breaches, which the DTI published in April 2000, where a thousand organisations of all sizes and across a range of sectors were interviewed. Internet security is clearly a matter for business but the Department of Trade and Industry promotes good information security practice to UK business. In particular, the department has promoted the use of British Standard 7799, which gives a management and organisational framework for implementing best practice in information security. This framework is grounded in the assessment of risk and the application of appropriate controls to counter those risks.</p>
