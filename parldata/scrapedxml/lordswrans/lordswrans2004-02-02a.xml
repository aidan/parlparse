As part of the review process, the Belfast Institute has put forward proposals for a centre, adjacent to the Outreach Centre, that will focus on workforce development and business start-up.

	<p pid="a.66.2/1">The Government are committed to improving security for older people in Northern Ireland. The Minister with responsibility for Criminal Justice issues in Northern Ireland, John Spellar, launched two initiatives in October 2003. The Lock Out Crime Scheme will supply and fit free of charge over the next two years, physical security measures for people aged 75 and over in receipt of benefits, living in areas of high domestic burglary. A television advertisement giving information to older people about the most appropriate way to answer their doors to unknown callers was screened, also in October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/2">In addition, a community safety strategy for older people will be issued for consultation in February 2004. Already through the Community Safety Challenge competition, 14 projects have been funded within local areas which include improving security for older people as one of their key themes. These projects are valued at &pound;400,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/3">Finally, the police have developed a number of initiatives to tackle crime against older people including, holding a conference in early March 2004 which will focus on crime issues relating to older people, the development of a control strategy covering crimes against older persons, the introduction of vulnerable persons registers in some district command units, the analysis of crime patterns to improve information about those criminals targeting older people and supplying advice as required.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.3/1">It is clear from the recent consultation on A Shared Future&mdash;improving relations in Northern Ireland that people in Northern Ireland want action to eliminate sectarianism and racism and to be able to live and work without fear of intimidation. Also, consultees urged government to take action to reduce tension and conflict at interface areas and support the development of integrated/shared communities where people wish to learn, live, work and play together.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/2">Government are considering the outcome of the consultation and will bring forward proposals later this year on a new policy for improving relations in Northern Ireland. In the mean time, government will continue to harness actions across departments and agencies, working closely with its social and economic partners, to achieve measurable improvements in equality, poverty and disadvantage, and community cohesion. They will also demonstrate their commitment to tackling race crime and sectarian crime by bringing forward draft legislation shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.6/3">The Government will pursue these priorities through a broad range of policies and programmes which are set out in the published document Priorities and Budget 2004&ndash;06. These include the putting in place of a new policy and strategy to promote good relations, further measures to combat poverty and social exclusion, a neighbourhood renewal programme, the development of targeted employment initiatives tailored to meet local needs through partnership working and steps to facilitate the growth of the community and voluntary sector to increase its business strength and create a supportive enabling environment.

Additional funding amounting to &pound;7 million has been made available for 2004&ndash;05, through the Voluntary and Community Unit in the Department for Social Development, to support capacity building in the voluntary and community sector and to support essential services delivered by the sector.

	<p pid="a.71.6/2">The UK encourages all permanent members of the Security Council to use the veto with restraint and only in accordance with the values of the United Nations. The UK last used the veto in 1989, jointly with the US and France, and has not used it alone since 1972.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.6/3">Formally changing the scope of application of the veto would require a change in the UN charter. This is unlikely and we are not pursuing such a change.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.5/1">The Department of Health would broadly agree with the description of the psychiatric effects of cannabis described in paragraph 4.11 of the Report from the Science and Technology Committee&mdash;Cannabis (HL Paper 39, Session 1998&ndash;99). We recognise that while a causative link between early cannabis use and later development of schizophrenia is not conclusively proven, recent epidemiological research has shown a stronger association than was evident at the time of the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.5/2">The department recognises that confirming a clinical diagnosis in the context of continuing psychosis and persistent cannabis use can be a complex process. This needs to be made on a case-by-case basis by consultant psychiatrists and the multi-professional clinical teams involved with the care of particular patients to minimise any risk of mis-diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.5/3">The department notes that neither antipsychotic medication nor the provisions of the Mental Health Act (1983) are exclusively used for the management of schizophrenia. These interventions, in certain circumstances, are used to manage symptoms of psychosis or to detain a patient with &quot;psychosis&quot;, so that use of these interventions does not itself equate with misdiagnosis. In fact use of powers under the Mental Health Act does not depend on identifying specific diagnoses (such as schizophrenia) but rather on the presence of &quot;mental disorder&quot;. lynne</p>

The proposed amendment in respect of the admission of students to the colleges does not impact on matters connected with the employment of staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">The performance of travelators at Heathrow is primarily a matter for the airport operator. However, following an adverse finding by the Competition Commission, the Civil Aviation Authority imposed last year a scheme of standards and rebates for a number of services and facilities at Heathrow, including travelators. The standard for travelators is that in each month they should be available for 98 per cent of the time during the core period of the day from 05:00 to 23:00. The scheme came into effect in July 2003 and applies to each of the four terminals at Heathrow. For the six months from July to December, the airport met the standard in Terminal One, but failed to achieve it in two of the months in Terminal Two, in all six of the months in Terminal Three and in one of the months in Terminal Four. Where the terminals failed to reach the standard, travelator availability was above 90 per cent on seven occasions and above 80 per cent on the other two.</p>

Where there are signficant redundancies in the manufacturing sector, the Rapid Response Service works to move people quickly into new jobs, preventing them becoming detached from the labour market.

	<p pid="a.85.0/2">There have been contacts at both ministerial and official level between the UK and Irish Governments since this announcement was made.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/3">The Government's announcement set out a two-stage approach to implementing a scheme. It would be compulsory to obtain a card only in the second stage which would require full debate and a vote in both Houses of Parliament following a rigorous evaluation of the first stage. A compulsory scheme would not allow for any group to opt out of its requirements.</p>

The Government do not create new criminal offences without full consideration. All proposed offences are subject to careful scrutiny to ensure that they are necessary and appropriately formulated.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.6/1">The Government's decision to seek to reclassify cannabis as a class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was taken in the light of the advice we received from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs on the harmfulness of cannabis relative to that of other drugs in class B. That advice was based upon a wide-ranging review of the available research.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.6/2">The advisory council considered in some depth possible links with mental illness, and concluded that a clear causal link between cannabis use and the development of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, has not been established. However, cannabis use can unquestionably worsen a mental illness which already exists. We continue to monitor the situation carefully.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.2/1">The impact of population pressures is kept under careful review and we continue to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity over the coming years as part of the Government's modernisation strategy.

	<p pid="a.86.2/2">Funding has been provided for around 3,000 additional public sector prison places to be built at existing prisons by 2006. Two new private sector prisons providing 1,290 places are also due to be opened at Ashford (near Heathrow) and Peterborough in June 2004 and March 2005 respectively. Together with building programmes in progress, and new accommodation such as 450 additional places at Birmingham, this will increase the total useable capacity of the prison estate to around 78,700 by 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/3">However, the Government are alert to the risk of a growing population and aim to minimise the effects through the provision of additional places and the reforms announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-06">6 January</phrase> in the Reducing Crime, Changing Lives document which aim to improve the management of offenders and reduce re-offending.
