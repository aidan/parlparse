	<p pid="a.198.2/1">These issues were taken fully into account by the Intervention Board in letting contracts for the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) services. As a consequence of the tender, some journey times will inevitably increase, but will remain within animal welfare guidelines. Some journey times will decrease. Similarly, some farmers will face increased costs in transporting their animals to an OTMS abattoir; for others the costs will be lower. Sufficient slaughtering capacity has been contracted to deal with the animals coming forward for slaughter in each region. Since the overall slaughtering capacity available to the scheme will remain broadly the same, it is not envisaged that waiting lists or times in lairage will increase. Animals with diseases such that they are certified by a veterinarian as unfit to travel to a slaughterhouse can access the OTMS through the casualty service, which has worked well since it was introduced in 1996. In other cases, such as where an OTMS animal is held under TB restriction, abattoirs are required to process such animals as a priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.2/1">The Government are committed to achieving a step change in race equality in this country. The Race Relations (Amendment) Bill is part of our programme to ensure that the public sector sets the pace in this drive towards equality. We want to send the clearest possible message that discrimination is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. The Government are, therefore, proposing two changes to strengthen the provisions of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/2">First, after very careful deliberation we have decided to extend the indirect discrimination provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976 to the functions of public authorities to be newly caught by the Act and we will bring forward an amendment to provide for that. The Government have always been in favour of this in principle, but were concerned to ensure that such a provision would be effective without leaving public bodies open to routine legal challenge in circumstances where their policies were entirely proper. Since the Bill was published, however, we have listened carefully to the arguments put forward about the issue and have concluded that, on balance, the risk of spurious challenge is outweighed by the principle of including indirect discrimination in respect of public sector functions in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/3">Direct and indirect racial discrimination is already prohibited under the Race Relations Act 1976 in the fields of employment, training, education, housing and the provision of goods, facilities and services in respect of the public and private sector. The Act is already being extended by the Bill to new fields in the public sector which have previously been determined by case law not to be a &quot;service&quot; and to which prohibitions on direct or indirect discrimination did not, therefore, apply. The Act will now extend to areas such as the implementation of central and local government's regulatory, economic and social policies and law enforcement in respect of indirect discrimination as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/4">Secondly, the Government also see the promotion of equality as a positive way of eliminating unjustifiable indirect discrimination in these and other fields. Our setting of targets for ethnic minority recruitment, retention and promotion and our guidelines for mainstreaming race equality into policy development and implementation are examples. We are already committed to placing the promotion of equality by public bodies on a statutory footing. We will reinforce that commitment by bringing forward a government amendment to the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill to enshrine the principle on the face of the Bill as a positive duty, leaving room for consultation on how the duty will operate in practice and how it will be enforced.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/5">The amendments will be brought forward at Commons Committee stage. We are meanwhile considering whether there should be any procedural safeguards consistent with the principle of non-discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.4/2" qnum="HL482">Whether in the light of the statement by the Lord Burlison on 8 December (H.L. Deb., col. 1275) that the Ministry of Defence will welcome any assessment of ill health in Iraq, they will now press the United Nations to authorise an independent expert epidemiological investigation into the reported increase in birth deformities, leukaemia and cancer in Southern Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.5/1">Officials from the Department for International Development (DfID) have been in discussion with the World Health Organisation (WHO) concerning possible projects to improve epidemiological surveillance in Iraq, to establish links between medical teaching institutions in Iraq and similar institutions outside Iraq, and to improve Iraq's cancer registration system. It is understood that the Government of Iraq has now approved these projects and WHO will shortly be requesting funding from governments. Her Majesty's Government will consider this very carefully when it is received.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.0/1">Since 1997, the Medical Research Council (MRC) has received seven full proposals for research into whether the health of Gulf veterans has been adversely affected by their service in the Gulf conflict. Two proposals have been accepted for funding. Decisions to recommend proposals to MoD for funding are based on a full scientific assessment of the proposals through peer review. Scientific feedback, including the reasons for rejection, is provided direct to the applicants, in confidence, by the MRC.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.3/1">Section 64 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act will allow people who left Incapacity Benefit (IB), having originally qualified for it under the new incapacity in youth provisions, to re-qualify in certain circumstances where they do not have enough National Insurance contributions to re-establish entitlement and they also fall outside the normal linking rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/2">Under the normal linking rules, the right to return to the same level of IB without having to satisfy the relevant qualifying conditions is lost after eight weeks. The linking period is extended to 52 weeks for people who leave benefit for work, and to two years if they claim Disabled Persons' Tax Credit or left benefit for a training for work course.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/3">The new rule, which will allow those who qualified for IB under the incapacity in youth provision to re-claim benefit after the age of 20 without having the National Insurance contributions required of others over the age of 20, is intended to protect those who leave benefit for work but who earn below the lower earnings limit (LEL), and those who go abroad. Regulations to be laid before Parliament in the early summer will set out in detail how the provisions will operate and comprehensive guidance will be provided for benefit decision makers.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.0/1">Both the department's Chief Medical Adviser (CMA) and the Medical Director in Medical Services which are delivered by SEMA Group on behalf of the Benefits Agency have received copies of the reviews Denigration by Design. As the views expressed in the reviews were two people's personal views on an individual and his work, as opposed to a scientific review of the available published literature, neither the CMA nor the Medical Director felt it appropriate to comment on the reviews.</p>
