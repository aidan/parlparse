	<p pid="a.63.5/4">Research carried out for the Regional Strategic Transportation Network Transport Plan, indicates that it would cost approximately &pound;5 million per kilometre (at 2004 prices) to construct a dual carriageway. This figure contains an element for land costs. The cost of dualling the 66 kilometres of the A6 between the western end of Toome bypass and the City of Londonderry would therefore be in the region of &pound;300 million to &pound;400 million (at 2004 prices).</p>

	<p pid="a.71.3/1">The internal costs of administering war pensions claims, including the department's processes for preparing cases for hearing at the Pensions Appeal Tribunal, are not separately identified by individual case or category of claim. Gulf War cases are administered as part of the normal arrangements for administering war pensions claims and resources are not provided specifically for these cases, either for assessment of claims or arising out of appeals to the Pensions Appeal Tribunal. Individual cases only incur separately identifiable additional costs if they progress to the High Court. The final external legal costs for the one Gulf War illness war pensions case heard by the High Court are expected to be approximately &pound;150,000; the department's challenge to the Pensions Appeal Tribunal decision on this case was not successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.6/1">The Government established the Gulf Veterans Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP) in 1993 to address the health concerns of individual veterans: as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-16">16 July 2004</phrase>, 3,235 Gulf veterans had attended the GVMAP. The GVMAP does not provide treatment; it assesses patients' health and recommends treatment if appropriate. The cost of the GVMAP since it began in 1993 is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.6/2">The Defence Medical Services are responsible for the health of those veterans of the Gulf conflict who are still serving, while the NHS is responsible for treating Gulf veterans who have left the Armed Forces. No central estimate has been made of the costs of support for sick Gulf veterans and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.6/3">Gulf veterans who suffer illness or injury as a result of their service are eligible to claim a war pension and an attributable pension under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS). Widows' pensions can similarly be claimed where the spouse's death was caused or hastened by service. War pensions are paid on the basis of an assessed level of disablement which is causally linked to service.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.6/4">The rate of pension paid therefore depends on the circumstances of the individual case. The maximum war pension (including allowances) for a severely disabled person is currently over &pound;460 per week. Substantial AFPS pensions are paid on top of this at a level dependent on rank and level of disablement. Other support is also available, for example to assist transition back into civilian life on leaving the Armed Forces. Information is not kept on the costs of internal administration of individual claims.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">As the noble Lord is aware, the requirement under Section 39 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 for a central register of certificate holders is being met through the provision of a National Firearms Licensing Management System (NFLMS). The contract awarded to Anite was for the development of this system with an interface to a national register of certificate holders situated on the police national computer (PNC). I understand from the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO), which is taking the project forward, that it is expected to be ready for service at the end of August 2004 and to be fully operational by February 2005. The final cost of the project will not be available until then.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/2">Unplanned but essential changes to the user requirements were required to prevent any degradation in the service currently employed by forces. In addition to the additional time needed to test these changes, it was also necessary to extend the rollout schedule to prevent any adverse impact on the &quot;live&quot; PNC service.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/3">Local force records have not yet been converted to form a compatible service with NFLMS. This will be done in accordance with a back records conversion schedule and rollout plan which has been agreed with all forces and will start in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/4">The consultation paper issued in May is the first step in our comprehensive review of firearms control and gun laws and will not affect the setting up of a central register of certificate holders.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">The UK takes its international obligations very seriously and, within what the law permits, stands ready to render maximum assistance to all of its extradition partners. For good and obvious reasons, however, it is our policy and practice not to comment, ahead of any arrest, on whether an international arrest warrant for a particular individual has been received or is under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">Assuming that no arrest warrant exists in respect of a person who seeks to visit this country, then such a person, if subject to immigration control, must meet the necessary conditions for admission; and, once admitted, may travel freely. Again, it is not appropriate to comment upon visits made by individuals.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.8/1">Defra has funded several projects on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.8/2">The Central Science Laboratory completed the last formal assessment of the anticoagulant resistance status of rats in 1998 under Project VC0309, geographical distribution and incidence of anticoagulant resistance in rats. A summary of the results can be found in the scientific paper: Kerins, G.M.; Dennis, N.; Atterby, H.; Gill, J.E. &amp; MacNicoll, A.D. (2001) Distribution of resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides in the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus Berk.) in England 1995&ndash;98. In: Advances in Vertebrate Pest Management II (Eds. H.-J. Pelz, D.P. Cowan &amp; C.J. Feare) pages 149&ndash;159, Filander Verlag, Furth.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.8/3">Subsequently a limited amount of ad hoc screening in the Yorkshire/Humberside area has been undertaken by the Central Science Laboratory during projects aimed at developing techniques that reduce reliance on anticoagulant rodenticides and thereby reduce the selection pressure favouring resistance (Project VC0321, Control of rats without the use of pesticides). The final report can be found on the Defra website. A further study (VC0330) on the development of novel techniques for improving the effectiveness, humaneness and safety of managing rat populations, is also currently underway.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.8/4">Ad hoc screening of rural rat populations was also undertaken during projects PV1015 and PV1016 by CSL on behalf of PSD. Final reports of these projects, which looked at the efficacy of rodenticides and the development of guidelines on best practice for rodenticide use, can both be found on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.8/5">With regard to plague, the Central Science Laboratory reviewed the risk of an outbreak in the UK in a report considered by the UK Zoonoses Group (UKZG) in 2002. The former Public Health Laboratory Service's Advisory committee on Zoonoses (ACZOO) was asked by the UKZG to assess the report. The ACZOO identified a number of issues, some of which had already been considered by a working group on rodent control chaired by Defra. A protocol on rodent management control was also agreed in 2001 with local authorities, water companies and the Local Government Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.8/6">Reference to the UKZG's consideration of the plague report is contained in the summary of the second UKZG meeting, available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www2.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/zoonoses/ukzg/minutes.htm">http://www2.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/zoonoses/ukzg/minutes.htm</a>.

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">The Environment Agency uses the term &quot;poor&quot; to describe navigation assets on its waterways which present health and safety risks. It estimates that 43 per cent of the assets on the non-tidal Thames, 32 per cent of the assets on its Anglian waterways and 47 per cent of the assets on the waterways in its Southern Region fall into this category. The agency estimates that it will need to spend about &pound;54 million over the next six years to address these risks though bringing them up to a modern standard would cost considerably more.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.5/1">The Commission's latest communication on its preferred option for reform of the CAP sugar regime was presented to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="">19 July</phrase>. The proposal calls for significant cuts in EU price support with a further review of the regime in 2008. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State gave a general welcome to the proposals as a step in the right direction, while urging a swifter end to quotas and emphasising the need to address urgently the impacts on those developing countries which currently enjoy preferential access to the EU market.</p>
