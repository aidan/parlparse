	<p pid="a.1.2/1">In accordance with the Open Government Code, it is the Public Record Office's policy to provide a comprehensive catalogue of records accessioned by the PRO, including those which are not yet available for public inspection. Of the 9,458,022 records listed on the Public Record Office computerised catalogue (PROCAT), some 344,274 (3.6 per cent) fall into this category. Over two-thirds of these (243,087) are records that are subject to the 30-year rule, in accordance with the Public Records Act 1967, and are not due to be opened until 2003 or later. The remainder (101,187) are subject to extended closure beyond the standard 30-year period, a procedure that requires the authorisation of the Lord Chancellor through a statutory instrument.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">The Lord Chancellor has asked the Keeper of Public Records to start work with other government departments on the need for a review of the Public Records Acts, and other legislative provisions for records and archives. This review will not affect the closure period applying to public records which, from January 2005, will be governed by the Freedom of Information Act rather than the Public Records Acts.</p>

At present, no budgetary provision has been made for such a project.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.2/2">The development of a rapid transit network is being further considered in the context of the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan, which is currently being prepared.

This is an innovative concept and a dedicated project team will be established to undertake further work on it, subject to the availability of resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.2/1">The HIPC initiative was launched in 1996 and substantially enhanced at the G7 Cologne summit in 1999. Under the enhanced initiative six countries&mdash;Bolivia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Burkina Faso and Mauritania&mdash;have moved from decision point to completion point with a minimum time of three months and a maximum time of two years four months. The UK Government have always pressed for the enhanced HIPC initiative to be implemented quickly, but conflict and corruption also impede progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">To reach decision point a country must prepare an interim poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP). To reach completion point they then need to develop a full PRSP and make progress in implementing it for at least one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/3">In September 2000 the International Monetary Fund (MF) and the World Bank made changes to enable quicker progress: greater flexibility on the length of the track record for performance; and paring down conditionality to those essential for poverty reduction. In particular these changes stressed that interim-PRSPs need only be a plan of action to develop a full PRSP. The UK Government continue to promote these reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/4">These plans, including policy reforms, are drawn up by the country, with the participation of civil society, to show how debt relief and other resources will be targeted on reducing poverty and increasing growth. The country must also be on track with its IMF programme for which there will be a range of conditions, for example on macroeconomic stability or public sector management.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/5">Hence the timing of the completion point is primarily linked to progress in implementing the PRSP. For those countries that had already reached completion point under the original HIPC initiative the time taken to move from decision point to completion point can be quick, eg three months in the case of Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/6">The UK Government strongly support the PRSP framework introduced by the IMF and the World Bank in 1999. A priority for the HIPC initiative is to ensure that the gains from debt relief are used effectively to reduce poverty, and the time taken to reach completion point reflects that commitment. However, it is important to note that a country receives full interim debt relief on any payments due from decision point, and debt is irrevocably cancelled at completion point.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.5/1">Today we are publishing a biodiversity strategy for England. The document, Working with the grain of nature, is being placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/2">The undertaking to prepare a biodiversity strategy for England was made in the rural White Paper, Our Countryside, the future: a fair deal for rural England. The strategy is intended to build on the progress that the Government have already made in protecting and enhancing biodiversity in England, for example with greater protection for sites of special scientific interest under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the implementation of 436 biodiversity action plans for priority habitats and species. We recognise that we can only secure the long-term health of biodiversity that is needed to bring a truly sustainable future by also achieving fundamental changes to public policy and the behaviour of people across the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/3">The strategy sets this process in train by seeking to embed biodiversity considerations into all the main sectors of economic activity, public and private. The strategy sets out a vision and programme for the next five years for five important policy sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/4">In agriculture, we aim to encourage the management of farming and agricultural land so as to conserve and enhance biodiversity as part of the Governmment's sustainable food and farming strategy. In water, we aim for a whole catchment approach to the wise, sustainable use of water and wetlands. In woodland and forestry, we are looking for the management and extension of woodland so as to promote enhanced biodiversity and quality of life. In marine and coastal management, we aim to achieve the sustainable use and management of our coasts and seas using natural processes and the ecosystem-based approach. In urban areas, we want biodiversity to become a part of the development of policy on sustainable communities, urban green space and the built environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/5">The strategy also identifies a number of cross-cutting themes, with the aim of involving society as a whole in the achievement of biodiversity improvements. For example, we aim to encourage business to act for biodiversity in the boardroom, through the supply chain, in their management systems, in their annual reports and accounts and on the ground. We will also help make biodiversity part of people's everyday lives through information, communication and education and establish a mechanism to involve children and young people in the development of biodiversity policy. In addition, we will continue to encourage partnerships for biodiversity at local and regional levels in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/6">It will be essential to ensure that we measure biodiversity trends and the effects of our policies. Much work is already under way to improve the information that is available to understand the status of habitats and species, and the strategy announces the development of a new web-based biodiversity action reporting system to be launched in 2003 and the adoption of a set of biodiversity indicators to measure our progress. These indicators will be published in full within a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/7">This government strategy has been prepared, uniquely, with the active contributions of a large number of partners and stakeholders. We shall continue to rely on the widest possible partnership as we move forward to implementation. The partnership will be represented through the England Biodiversity Group, which will review the strategy annually and publish a report on progress in 2006.</p>

If a woman decides that this is her preferred option, she receives full advice on what to expect and a 24-hour telephone number to call for further advice if needed.

In line with our commitment in The NHS Plan, we are seeking to bring the scheme up to date in line with the latest expert advice on nutrition. Our proposals for this &pound;142 million scheme will broaden the nutritional base of the scheme and offer a wider choice to families. We propose to do this through the introduction of a fixed face value voucher that can be exchanged for fruit and vegetables, cereal-based foods, other foods suitable for weaning, as well as milk and infant formula. We are also proposing to line the scheme more closely with the National Health Service through ante-natal and post-natal clinics.
