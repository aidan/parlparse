	<p pid="a.105.2/1">Clause 14 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill establishes a single-tier tribunal to replace the current two-tier system. We have not yet settled the arrangements for dealing with pending appeals, but I can confirm that they will provide for a fair and effective remedy. Transitional arrangements will be made by order under Clause 34(3)(a) of the Bill. I will write to the noble Lord when arrangements are settled.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">In 2001&ndash;02, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport allocated an additional &pound;3.8 million to the English Tourism Council in order to help tourism to recover from the impact of foot and mouth disease (FMD). Of these additional funds, &pound;2 million was spent on regional activity, including activity in Cumbria, Lancashire, Cheshire and Cornwall. Figures are not available by county, but are broken down by regional tourist board (RTB) area as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.105.5/4"> <td>RTB</td> <td>Funding &pound;</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.105.5/10">In addition, the South West Regional Development Agency launched a &pound;3 million recovery fund, of which &pound;900,000 was dedicated to tourism recovery for the south-west region.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/11">During 2001&ndash;02 the Northwest Development Agency (NWDA) awarded &pound;1.85 million to Cumbria Tourist Board, &pound;557,500 to the North West Tourist Board and &pound;120,000 to North West Farm Tourism Initiative. Since then, Cumbria Tourist Board has received &pound;1 million per annum from Rural Regeneration Cumbria, which is supported by NWDA to assist in longer-term recovery measures for the tourism industry, and &pound;1.2 million will be available to Lancashire tourism businesses over the next three years from the Lancashire rural recovery budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/12">The Government also announced a package of help for businesses affected by FMD, including rate reliefs, deferral of tax and national insurance contributions, and help under the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme. This assisted businesses in Cumbria, Lancashire, Cheshire and Cornwall, as in the rest of England.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.8/1">Scottish students attending English universities from 2006 will continue to be liable to pay the same level of fees as English students who attend those institutions. English students at Scottish universities currently pay a means-tested fixed fee up front; Scottish and EU students at Scottish universities pay no fee up front as the Scottish Executive pays this directly to institutions on behalf of these students. Some Scottish and EU students are liable to make a one-off graduate endowment payment after they have graduated.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.8/2">Our intention is to offer English students studying in Scotland the same package as English students studying in England in 2006&ndash;07: a loan to cover their fees, and the same grant and loan support for living costs. Student support for Scottish domiciled students is the responsibility of Scottish Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.8/3">The Scottish Executive is currently considering funding arrangements following the outcome of the third phase of its higher education review and we understand the Scottish Executive will be announcing its conclusions early in the summer. We will confirm the position for English students in Scotland in the light of the Scottish Executive's decisions.</p>
