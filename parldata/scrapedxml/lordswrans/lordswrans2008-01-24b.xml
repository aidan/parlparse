	<p pid="b.57.2/1">Under the EU Bluetongue Regulation (EC No. 1266/2007), susceptible animals are permitted to move out of bluetongue restricted zones into bluetongue free areas for intra-community and domestic trade, provided that all the necessary conditions have been met. In most cases, animals must undergo pre-movement testing and these tests must indicate negative results for virus infection. The conditions in the EU Bluetongue Regulation are being applied by the UK and other EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">21 December</phrase>, my officials announced that the UK is now in a period of low-vector activity as winter temperatures mean that midges are either dying off, inactive and/or unable to transmit virus. This means that, upon receipt of negative test results, farmers can move their animals out of the surveillance and protection zones to the bluetongue free area. It is hoped that the relaxation of movement restrictions during the vector-free period will alleviate some of the problems the industry has been facing during the bluetongue outbreak.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.2/1">The Data Protection Act 1998 covers all processing of personal data by automatic means, including those closed circuit television (CCTV) systems where it is possible for the operator to identify distinct individuals from the footage or information relating to individuals, such as vehicle registration marks. The Act provides an exemption for any processing carried out purely for personal, family or household affairs. There are no plans to remove that exemption. It is the data captured by the CCTV systems that are covered by the Act, not the systems themselves. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) publishes a code of practice on the use of CCTV. The ICO has reviewed this code of practice and a revised version is due to be launched on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-28">28 January</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.75.0/1">Under the EU subsidy scheme, school milk is available to all children between the ages of five and 11 in primary and nursery schools in participating local authorities. It is a matter for local education authorities and schools to decide whether they will participate in the scheme although it is open to all to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.75.3/1">Prohibited weapons, including tasers, can only be possessed with the authority of the Secretary of State given under Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968. Such authority is not issued for purposes connected with employment in the security industry. Nor is personal protection or the guarding of premises accepted by the police as good reason for granting a firearms certificate needed to possess other types of firearm.</p>
