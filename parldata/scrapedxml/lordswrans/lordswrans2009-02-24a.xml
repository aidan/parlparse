	<p pid="a.37.12/1">Research into understanding climate change and its impacts is a high priority for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.12/2">At present, the Government consider that geo-engineering options are speculative. It is important, though, to keep them under review, particularly those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as geo-engineering might ultimately have a role to play in helping to ameliorate climate change; particularly if emissions reductions are not achieved quickly enough or climate change turns out to be worse than projected.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.12/3">The Government thus have no plans at present for funding any significant research on geo-engineering. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has however been funding, as part of the Integrated Climate Programme at the Met Office Hadley Centre, a small set of modelling studies on the impacts of geo-engineering options on the climate system, to help assess their environmental implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.12/4">The Government welcome the Royal Society's current study on geo-engineering which is aimed at helping policymakers decide which options, if any, should be researched and deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.12/5">Research Councils are funded by DIUS but under the Haldane principle they set their own detailed research priorities. The Natural Environment Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council support a wide range of research that is relevant to geo-engineering, particularly in the areas of climate dynamics, which helps us understand potential environmental effects of large-scale geo-engineering, and carbon capture and storage, an accepted way of removing atmospheric carbon dioxide, at source.</p>

The Treasury and the various money-laundering supervisory bodies, such as the FSA or Institute of Chartered Accountants, routinely advise regulated business on the need to apply the regulations in a risk-based way, which enables resources to be targeted at the greatest threats, and the minimum burden to be placed on law-abiding citizens.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.2/1">The Hajj Advisory Group (HAG) was established in July 2001 and abolished in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/2">The Hajj Advisory Group charter contained the criteria for appointment of members to the group. This was based on the particular skills and contributions an individual could bring to the group in terms of professional experience in relative fields (eg fund raising, medical, welfare, administration and communication) and their work within established communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/3">Members from various Muslim organisations were appointed to the HAG. The composition of the group reflected the diversity of traditions within the Muslim community. Our records do not hold the details of which organisations were consulted when the HAG was established. However, they show a variety of Muslim organisations were consulted reflecting the diversity and geographic locations of the Muslim community in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/4">The permanent members of the HAG were drawn from the following organisations:</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/5">Islamic Cultural Centre;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/6">Union of Muslim Organisations;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/7">Muslim Council of Britain;</p>

	<p pid="a.47.2/9">World Federation of Khoji Shia Ithna-Asheri Muslim Community;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/10">Association of British Hujjaj;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/11">Muslim College; and</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/12">Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/13">The charter established four working groups as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/14">Fund Raising;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/15">Publicity;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/16">Strategic Planning; and</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/17">Medical and Social.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/18">The primary aim was to act as a fund-raising body to finance the important work of the British Hajj Delegation (BHD) from voluntary contributions by members of British Muslim communities. By 2004 it was clear that the HAG was unable to raise these funds, necessitating further investment from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to ensure the maintenance of exceptional medical support to British pilgrims, in addition to the FCO provision of core consular support to this event.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/19">In 2004 and 2005, the FCO provided a grant of &pound;20,000 to the HAG. The grant was administered by the group's secretariat based at the Islamic Cultural Centre in London. The secretariat received &pound;12,000 to cover its administrative costs. Funding was withdrawn in 2006 when the group was abolished.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/20">In the past five years the FCO has provided the BHD with &pound;40,000 in 2004, &pound;60,000 in 2005, &pound;70,000 in 2006, &pound;80,000 in 2007 and &pound;90,000 in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/21">Logistical and administrative support is provided for the BHD from FCO administrative resources (eg organising meetings, circulating documents, answering letters from members of the public etc).</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/22">The FCO currently funds a full-time Hajj desk officer to support arrangements for the BHD.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.3/1">This would in theory be possible. Article 57 of the European Convention on Human Rights (which applies to the Fourth Protocol by virtue of Article 6 of that Protocol) permits a state to make a reservation in respect of any particular provision to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision. Reservations of a general character are not permitted. However, under Article 19 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, any reservation to a treaty must not be incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty, so it would depend on the terms of the reservations required.</p>

The Northern Ireland Office has offices in both Belfast and London and due to the nature of the work it carries out, travel to Great Britain by its staff is sometimes unavoidable. Where this is the case, the most cost-effective means of travelling is sought.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">In HMRC between 2005 and 2008 in grades AA to grade 6 only one permanent member of staff accepted voluntary redundancy due to personal circumstances (below Senior Civil Service). I can confirm that the officer concerned has not been re-employed by the department. There were no compulsory redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/2">Of the 13,874 staff recruited between 2005 and 2008 some of this number will have been employed previously on a fixed term contract with HMRC. Staff in this position who are offered permanent contracts are either recruited through fair and open competition or are successful in a internal promotion exercise. Fixed-term appointees are eligible to apply for posts offered in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/3">Fixed-term appointees are not offered severance payments but are entitled to a small payment as statutory compensation where they have been made redundant at the end of their contract. They will have received an average of two weeks salary. This payment is not at the discretion of HMRC. Around 1,000 staff received the statutory compensation. This may include some of the staff now permanently employed but exact numbers are too costly and resource intensive to obtain.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.5/1">It is in our interests to work with Russia to address a range of global issues, including the economic crisis, the Middle East peace process, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and security in Afghanistan. To this end we have increasingly regular high-level bilateral contact. Deputy Prime Minister Kudrin visited London on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-04">4 February 2009</phrase> for discussions on the global economic crisis, including meetings with my right honourable friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary. The Chancellor and Deputy Prime Minister Kudrin issued a joint statement after their talks. President Medvedev is also expected to come to the UK for the G20 Summit in April. It is particularly important to engage with Russia on economic issues, to achieve a co-ordinated global response to the current crisis, and to maintain our important trade and investment relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/2">However, significant differences remain. In our bilateral relationship, we have outstanding issues over the refusal of Russia to provide real co-operation with the investigation into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko and over the closure of British Council offices in St Petersburg and Ekaterinburg. Internationally we remain deeply concerned by Russia's breach of its international obligations in Georgia. We will continue to press Russia to resolve these issues.</p>

For example, a total of &pound;222 million has been made available for a three-year period from 2008-11 to provide activities for disaffected young people at risk of antisocial behaviour and crime. The total amount of ring-fenced funding (excluding schools) will reduce from 11.2 per cent in 2008-09 to 8 per cent in 2010-11. The Government are also investing heavily in activities and facilities ensuring that they are available at times when young people need them. Investment of more than &pound;200 million in the myplace<I></I>initiative will transform the facilities available for young people alongside strong encouragement to LAs to open facilities and provide activities on Friday and Saturday night. To help ensure that services are responsive to young people's needs, the Government are also investing more than &pound;60 million a year until 2010-11 to allow young people to make decisions on what positive activities and facilities should be funded in their local area.</p>
