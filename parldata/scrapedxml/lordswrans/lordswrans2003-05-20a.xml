	<p pid="a.73.0/1">The Department of Health does not collect information about the number of life support ventilators available for operation in each of the public and private sectors. There are currently 3,097 adult critical care beds in the National Health Service in England. As a minimum standard there will be one mechanical ventilator for each bed area. Each critical care unit will have additional ventilators available to be used in rotation for cleaning, decontamination, and maintenance purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/2">Trusts have contracts for purchasing and maintenance of ventilators with their preferred manufacturers. It is likely that additional ventilators could be made available quickly should a trust require additional equipment in the case of a sudden influx of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) needing respiratory support.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/3">Nurses working in critical care units are trained to look after patients needing mechanical ventilation. Generally, patients requiring mechanical ventilation require one to one care and supervision. Critical care units normally operate with an overall establishment of 6.0&ndash;7.0 whole-time equivalent nurses per bed. There will be local variations in staffing levels depending on the size of the unit and case-mix.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/4">None of the four probable SARS cases reported so far in the United Kingdom has required ventilation. The number estimated to require ventilation would depend on a number of factors such as the length of time the patient had been ill, along with any other secondary illness. Patients admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed SARS will be transferred to a cubicle in the critical care unit, and isolation procedures will be put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/5">The Department of Health does not collect information on the number of cubicles or isolation facilities available. This information will be available to local major incident planners.</p>

However, a large number of women aged 20 and over also reported using emergency contraception and the data in the report can be used to calculate an average age of all women using emergency contraception, which is 26.5 years. In my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="">7 May</phrase> about the average age of women using emergency contraception I was referring to research commissioned by Schering, the manufacturer of Levonelle (emergency contraception pill), which found that the average age of a woman purchasing Levonelle was 28 years. As both the surveys were based on relatively small samples of women, the data need to be interpreted with caution. However the average age of women supplied with emergency contraception in both surveys were broadly similar.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.5/1">Most testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is currently undertaken in genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics. We understand, though, that an increasing number of general practitioners are offering testing for STIs and may choose, where appropriate, to test for infection during a request for emergency contraception. However the incubation period for the most common STIs is often longer than the 72 hours within which requests for emergency contraception should be made. For example the incubation period for gonorrhoea can be up to 10 days and for chlamydia up to three weeks. Any infection resulting from the incident of unprotected sex leading to a request for emergency contraception is not likely to be detected at that time. GPs who do not provide STI testing, and other health professionals who supply emergency contraception, should advise women of the risk of infection from unprotected sex and provide appropriate advice on attendance at a GUM clinic for screening at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.2/1">HM Customs and Excise, which took responsibility for anti-smuggling controls on meat from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-11">11 April 2003</phrase>, will deploy additional mobile anti-smuggling detection teams and trained dogs with particular responsibility for tackling smuggling of meat and animal products from non-EU countries. Its existing detection staff also include illegal meat in their responsibilities. Customs will prosecute in the most serious cases. Conviction on indictment for offences under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 attracts a higher maximum sentence than the previous legislation&mdash;seven years as opposed to two.</p>
