Five competitions were launched in November. Further savings will be made by improving the management of cases through the system and making better use of the court estate. Twenty magistrates' courts will be closed in the first phase of this work. Reforms to legal aid will include means-testing for Crown Court cases from April 2010, and proposals to restructure the criminal legal aid market by consolidating the number of providers and increasing competition, as set out in Restructuring the Delivery of Criminal Defence Services;improved targeting of housing growth and regeneration funding, saving &#163;340 million: including &#163;40 million by concluding the New Deal for Communities, and a further &#163;300 million from rationalising regional development agency regeneration spending and programmes, including the Working Neighbourhoods Fund, the Local Enterprise Growth Initiative, and the Housing and Planning Delivery Grant;reducing a range of budgets across the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), saving &#163;350 million: for example, &#163;25 million from the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (BECTA), &#163;40 million from the Training and Development Agency, &#163;71 million from the end of extended schools start-up funding and &#163;10.5 million from central administration and communications budgets;improving the concessionary travel scheme, saving &#163;180 million: legislation has been laid to move responsibility for administering the scheme to county councils from April 2011 and to re-establish the link between eligibility for concessionary fares and the state pension from April 2010;reforming or eliminating allowances that are no longer relevant for staff posted overseas: for example by ending the use of business class air travel for journeys lasting less than five hours, saving a total of &#163;13 million; andreducing unlawful occupation of social housing, saving at least &#163;35 million in housing benefit costs; ending smaller Communities and Local Government (CLG) funded time-limited communities programmes, saving &#163;25 million; and rationalising other smaller CLG programmes, saving a total of &#163;160 million.</p>

Stroke, therefore, continues to be a high priority for the National Health Service as demonstrated by its tier 1 status in the vital signs in the NHS Operating Framework for 2010-11. This requires that 80 per cent of patients spend 90 per cent or more of their time on a stroke unit by 2011. Primary care trusts' performance in improving stroke services will be measured against this. The Stroke Improvement Programme provides support to the NHS in improving stroke services. Over the next year, it will work with the NHS to go further and faster in achieving improvements in stroke services, including ensuring the timely admission of stroke patients to a dedicated stroke unit, that the strategy seeks to achieve.</p>

	<p pid="a.457.6/1">The stroke strategy set out a 10-year plan to improve and deliver world-class stroke services from prevention through to life long support. It encourages the effective assessment and management of vascular risk factors, and improvements in the information and advice given to people on lifestyle so that they have a better understanding of how to reduce their own risk of having a stroke. The NHS Health Check programme is a systematic programme for everyone between the ages of 40 and 74 to assess their risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease and will support people to reduce or manage their risk through individually tailored advice. Phased implementation of the programme began in April 2009. It has the potential to prevent at least 1,600 heart attacks and strokes each year when fully implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.6/2">The Stroke Improvement Programme, which provides support to the National Health Service in improving stroke services, is also working on prevention projects. For example, it is working with the Heart Improvement Programme, which similarly provides support to the NHS to improve heart services, and has developed commissioning guidance for stroke prevention in primary care, focusing on the role of atrial fibrillation. We estimate that earlier detection and better management of atrial fibrillation could prevent 4,500 strokes per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.6/3">More generally, the department has run a series of campaigns to raise both public and professional awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle in reducing the risk of a number of diseases, including stroke. These include Change4Life; Smokefree marketing to motivate people to stop smoking and direct them to NHS information and support; and a campaign on the unseen damage that drinking can cause to long-term health where the link between alcohol and stroke was one of its key messages.</p>

This requires a new approach by prison officers that is being developed as part of a comprehensive programme of workforce reform.

	<p pid="a.471.0/1">It is for the operator to decide the best course of action for their business and to meet the cost of fulfilling the regulatory requirements. The Environment Agency does not reimburse operator costs associated with complying with the law. The Environment Agency is reviewing its current position and the way that bioaerosols are monitored and regulated. Should a further revision be required, the need for a financial impact assessment will be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/2">The Environment Agency has a duty to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.472.0/1">Efficient operation and value for money are clear priorities for the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) and the identification of opportunities to improve value for money and excellence of delivery will be an important part of the successful delivery of their remit.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/2">The YPLA came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>, and 2010-11 will therefore be its first year of operation. YPLA budgets will be confirmed annually in a grant letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/3">The administration budget contained in the grant letter for 2010-11 will already reflect the level of efficiency at which we want the YPLA to operate in its first year and will form a baseline against which subsequent efficiencies can be determined.</p>
