	<p pid="a.149.2/1">ContactPoint is an online directory to enable the delivery of co-ordinated support for children and young people. It will be the quick way for practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child. ContactPoint will contain basic identifying information about all children and young people in England up to their 18th birthday and contact details for their parents/carers and for services working with the child or young person&mdash;nothing more. It does not and will not contain any financial information (such as bank details) or case information (such as case notes, assessments, medical records, exam results, comments or subjective observations).</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/2">We have always sought a balance between children's and families' rights to the services to which they are entitled, and their individual rights to privacy, and we take our responsibilities under the European Convention on Human Rights very seriously. We have ensured that ContactPoint complies with the relevant legal obligations and had a public consultation on the draft ContactPoint regulations in 2006. The primary legislation and ContactPoint regulations were scrutinised by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/3">ContactPoint has a significant set of security measures and controls in place and meets recognised industry and Government assurance levels for security. We have an ongoing commitment to security and regular testing will be carried out. All ContactPoint users have to state clear reasons for access and all use of the system will be subject to monitoring and audit. Sanctions are in place for misuse under the provisions of the Data Protection Act and Computer Misuse Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.5/2">The proposed family advocacy scheme in the consultation proposes paying the same fee for the same work regardless of whether the advocate is a self employed, or in-house barrister or solicitor, and we proposed an intermediate rate which we believe is fair to all advocates. The scheme includes higher fees for more complex work: for example, by paying for additional interim hearings or paying extra for lengthy final hearings. Some respondents to the consultation were concerned that the proposed scheme did not contain sufficient graduation to reward more complex cases. The LSC has been working closely with stakeholders on further development of the scheme. It is likely that the final scheme will have more graduation and complexity, than that originally proposed.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families is working closely with the Personal Finance Education Group (PFEG) in helping schools to plan and teach personal finance relevant to students' lives and needs. It is widely recognised as a leading force in the delivery of personal finance education within schools in England covering the 4 to 19 age range and receives cross sector support from business, government and the educational establishment. It currently receives private sector support through a number of projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/2">The What Money Means is a ground-breaking research and development project funded by HSBC Bank plc (&pound;3.4 million). This is in addition to the &pound;10 million committed by the DCSF over three years (2008-11) to support personal finance education in schools through the My Money programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/3">During the five year project (January 2007 to December 2011) What Money Means works with local authorities to develop and deliver a range of different approaches to personal finance education in primary schools, and offers training and support to local authorities and schools in how to translate these approaches into classroom practice and integrate them into the authority's future strategic planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/4">A minimum of 36 local authorities over the five years of the project will be engaged in this project directly and receive support from a dedicated (PFEG) consultant.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/5">There is also a ground-breaking volunteering programme and partnership between PFEG and the financial services sector titled &quot;Use Your Expertise&quot;. It aims to match the unique skills of people working in financial services with schools to help make financial education real and relevant for young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/6">The following organisations have currently signed up to this scheme:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/7">Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW);the Personal Finance Society;the Coventry Building Society;Rathbones; andthe Co-op.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/8">Finally, the PFEG Quality Mark accreditation system which is sponsored by Prudential also ensures that resources and materials for teaching financial capability are suitable, effective and of the highest educational quality&mdash;whether for year 1 or year 13. To date, more than 50 carefully selected resources have been awarded the Quality Mark, a number of which have been provided by financial service organisations as part of their corporate and social responsibility programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.0/1">The latest available figures for the Armed Forces pension scheme (AFPS) relate to financial year 2007-08. This period has therefore been used for the figures given for the average monthly payments made under both schemes:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/2">Gurkha pension scheme&mdash;&pound;122.64; and AFPS&mdash;&pound;578.41.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/3">The figures are based upon average pensions paid to former members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, and dependants. These averages are not comparable because of different lengths of service, different rank structure between the Brigade of Gurkhas and the wider Army and, chiefly, because Gurkhas begin drawing on their pensions much earlier than British soldiers with equivalent service. For example, a Gurkha rifleman or corporal with 15 years' service (approximately 85 per cent of those receiving GPS payments) can claim an immediate pension after 15 years' service (from age 33) whereas equivalent service under the AFPS would not attract pension payments until age 60.</p>
