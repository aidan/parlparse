	<p pid="a.196.2/2" qnum="HL563">What account they took of genocide in Darfur when they supported the decision of the international community in April 2005, in Oslo, to pledge more than $4 billion in aid and debt relief to Sudan; and whether the meeting of the G8 Finance Ministers in London on 12 June considered the government of Sudan's role in Darfur as a factor when including Sudan on the list of countries whose debts could be cancelled in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.3/1">This year started with hope of a new beginning for the people of Sudan, with the signing in Nairobi of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) by the government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.3/2">The CPA is a huge achievement and deserves international support to ensure that it is fully implemented. It is clearly the best hope for peace across the whole of Sudan, and we cannot risk this failing. Early and visible dividends are key to consolidating support behind the peace agreement. Donors at the Oslo meeting discussed how they would work together to support the priority areas contained in the Sudan Joint Assessment Mission report, to help the people of Sudan realise their own futures, and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. At the same time they made clear that the situation in Darfur had to be resolved; some (including ourselves) made some or all of their support conditional upon progress there.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.3/3">The UK remains gravely concerned about the humanitarian and human rights crisis in Darfur. We have committed &pound;90 million to the humanitarian response in Darfur/east Chad since September 2003, and &pound;32 million to support the African Union's monitoring operation in Darfur. We sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1593, which referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC has now launched a formal investigation into these crimes. We are also playing a leading role in supporting the African Union's efforts to end the conflict in Darfur, in their mediation at the peace talks in Abuja.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.3/4">We have made clear to the government in Sudan that the full benefits of a peace dividend, including work on debt relief, will not be achieved without peace in Darfur. The UK has stated that it is willing to chair a group of donors to look at the restructuring of Sudan's external debt. This is however conditional on significant progress by the government of Sudan in resolving the Darfur conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.3/5">G8 countries have agreed to complete the process of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) by making available additional development resources for such relief. This relief will provide significant support for countries' efforts to reach the goals of the Millennium Declaration, while ensuring that the financing capacity of the international financial institutions is not reduced. For International Development Association and African Development Fund debt, 100 per cent stock cancellation will be delivered by relieving post-completion point HIPCs that are on track with their programmes of repayment obligations. Sudan is by definition, a heavily indebted poor country, and will be eligible for some HIPC debt relief when it reaches decision point within the initiative. Only when Sudan has reached completion point, has a proven track record of sound financial management and of using funds for poverty reduction, and has received full HIPC debt relief, will it receive multilateral debt cancellation under the G8 debt agreement. The UK will not take forward work in the international arena on Sudanese debt relief until progress on Darfur is made.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.2/1">Jan Egeland estimated in March that 10,000 Sudanese civilians were dying each month in Darfur. Estimates of deaths in Darfur vary from 70,000 to 300,000 and above. Accurate figures are not available and even though the World Health Organisation is undertaking a second crude mortality survey, it will only give a snapshot of the situation. We are unlikely ever to get a full and wholly accurate picture of deaths from this conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/2">There are 2.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Darfur and many of these would be put at great risk if humanitarian operations were suspended by any organisation for reasons of insecurity. This is why the Government fully supported the African Union's (AU) decision to increase their troop numbers from 3,000 to 7,700 and why the Government recently announced a further &pound;19 million in funding to the AU mission in Darfur. This brings the UK's total funding to the AU to almost &pound;32 million.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-06-23a.206.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="206"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50623w04.htm#50623w04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.206.3/1">UKTI employed consultants to advise on its sector prioritisation exercise in 2004. The consultants looked at sectors both (a) in terms of their contribution to the UK economy and their potential for international growth and (b) the extent to which sector teams in UKTI (and their private sector advisory groups) could add value nationally. The result, which was validated by a private sector-led panel, was a reduction in the number of national sector teams responsible for taking forward national strategies. These teams have retained their industry advisory groups. Some sectors have been absorbed into wider sector teams, and others will be co-ordinated on a national basis by an international trade team in one of the English regions. UKTI has used separate advisory panels to make recommendations, on a sector-by-sector basis, for the distribution of funds under the support for exhibitions and seminars abroad (SESA) scheme. The future of these panels will depend on the arrangements UKTI will make for a revised SESA scheme, and on which they are currently conducting consultations.</p>
