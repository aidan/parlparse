This affects their ability to meet the requirements for naturalisation as a British overseas territories citizen (and thereafter become a British citizen) as the conditions applying to their stay mean that they are not regarded as &quot;settled&quot; for the purpose of naturalisation.

	<p pid="b.125.3/1">The Home Office has been working closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the National Centre for Policing Excellence (NCPE) to raise the awareness of police officers and staff in relation to the identification and investigation of honour-based violence. As part of this work a risk assessment toolkit for domestic violence incidents has been developed, which includes the presence of factors in relation to honour crimes. Guidance on investigating domestic violence, produced on behalf of ACPO and CENTREX, the national police training provider, in 2004, covers the investigation of cases which may be committed in the name of honour. In October and November 2006 the Attorney-General and Baroness Scotland jointly hosted two seminars on honour killings with community leaders. Within all police forces there should now be measures in place to ensure that officers are aware of domestic violence and related issues, and have the knowledge to deal with it effectively.</p>

Section 28A enables the party to register up to 12 descriptions of six words or fewer to be used on nomination papers or ballot papers. The commission must register a description unless it is more than six words in length or in its opinion falls into one of several categories; for example, is the same or confusingly similar to another party's registered description, is offensive, or would be misleading or confusing to the voter if it appeared on the ballot paper.</p>

As with any research project licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority at present, the regulatory authority must consider whether the research is necessary or desirable for that purpose.</p>

This could aid understanding of genetic pathways involved in implantation and the mutations resulting in failure of implantation. For example, modifying a specific gene thought to affect the ability of an embryo to implant will allow scientists to learn about its function by looking at the effects on other genes in the early embryo. This approach could identify potential targets for treatment without the need to place the modified embryo in a woman.</p>

	<p pid="b.132.8/1">The Government have invested approximately &pound;4 billion across England since 1996-97 to manage the risk from flooding and coastal erosion. Around &pound;600 million will be spent by Defra and local authorities this year. The larger part of this has been allocated to the Environment Agency as the principal operating authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.8/2">Defra is leading on the cross-government making space for water strategy development programme. This is taking a holistic approach to risk from all forms of flooding (river, coastal, groundwater, surface run-off and sewer) and seeking to develop an integrated portfolio of approaches to managing it. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.132.8/3">identifying improvements in managing urban drainage;a new strategic overview by the Environment Agency of all flood and coastal erosion risk management;encouraging better resilience and resistance for buildings and emergency infrastructure, improved stakeholder and community engagement; risk mapping and improved emergency planning; strengthened policy guidance for planning authorities with respect to development and flood risk; andrevised policy guidance for operating authorities, including the agency, to ensure flood risk management decisions take full account of all economic, environmental and social impacts, including climate change.</p>

The Government agreed with the Committee's recommendation that research undertaken on embryos using the cell nuclear replacement technique for the purpose of studying mitochondrial diseases should be permissible in law, and undertook further consultation on this point. The regulation making power in proposed new Section 3ZA(5) is intended to provide a mechanism, should research lead to a safe and reliable method to prevent the avoidance of serious mitochondria) disease, for its use in assisted conception treatment,. subject to the agreement of Parliament through the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

	<p pid="b.140.6/1">The National Black Police Association (NBPA) is one of a number of staff associations to receive grant-in-aid funding from the Home Office. Other associations include the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Police Federation, the Superintendents Association, the British Association for Women in Policing, the Gay Police Association and the National Disabled Police Association. Each of these associations carries out a number of projects that support the aims and objectives of the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.6/2">The police staff associations represent police officers of all persuasions. However, in a large organisation such as the police, the needs of minority groups can sometimes be overlooked. The NBPA offers support to minority ethnic police officers and staff and aims to improve the working environment of minority ethnic personnel within the police service and to help improve race relations within the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.6/3">The NBPA's main objective is to enable the benefits of membership to be enjoyed by members of the police service who are African, African-Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Asian and Asian sub-continent origin. The NBPA also offers support to associate members, whatever their ethnic group, and is therefore inclusive. Associate membership is open to those persons whose aims are compatible with or supportive of the aims of the NBPA, but who are otherwise ineligible for full membership of the NBPA.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.6/4">A review of the diversity staff support associations will take place later this year to review their effectiveness and to determine whether they are equipped to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders in the police service in relation to equality and diversity.</p>

	<p pid="b.143.2/1">Practical details of the initiative are currently being worked on by DfID officials, the co-chairs of the fund and stakeholders in the Congo basin region. NGOs and officials in other HMG departments (Defra, FCO, HMT) are being kept informed of progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.2/2">Two co-chairs, Professor Wangari Maathai, former winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and Congo Forest Goodwill Ambassador, and the right honourable Paul Martin, Canada's former Prime Minister and Finance Minister, have been selected. They will help develop a clear governance framework to ensure that the fund has strong African ownership.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.2/3">Decisions on fund policies and on where and how to allocate resources will be taken by the steering board during the design phase. The steering board is likely to include the two co-chairs, as well as two DfID officials, two representatives from the Central Africa Forests Commission (COMIFAC) secretariat, environmental NGO representatives, as well as African Development Bank and World Bank representatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.2/4">There have also been technical working sessions with the officials of the COMIFAC secretariat based in Cameroon to determine which specific components of COMIFAC's convergence plan the fund will support.</p>

	<p pid="b.144.5/1">Guidance to the telecommunications industry is a matter for the independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom).</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/2">The Communications Act 2003 enables Ofcom to impose general conditions of entitlement for customers on specified classes of communications providers. General condition 15 requires communication providers which are providing publicly available telephone services to provide certain special services for their customers who have a disability. General condition 15.5 requires such providers to &quot;provide a priority fault repair service as swiftly as practicable to any subscriber with disabilities who has a genuine need for an urgent repair. Charges for a priority fault repair service shall not exceed the communication provider's standard charge for a fault repair service&quot;. In other words, there already is a mandatory urgent fault repair service for vulnerable and at-risk users.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/3">In the case of BT, this service is provided to customers with a long-term illness or disability who are unable to leave the house unaided and whose telephones are a vital lifeline. The process for registering for the priority fault repair is simple and does not require a doctor's letter. The time to become registered is usually one day from the time an order is received. A confirmation letter is sent to the customer by the following day. There are currently approximately 180,000 customers registered with this service. The general condition does not specify a target time within which faults will be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/4">Registration with priority fault repair means that when customers report a fault on their line the adviser will be alerted to the fact they have the service and BT will prioritise the fault accordingly. The service does not have guaranteed response times, but does ensure that repairs for these customers go to the top of the queue. BT's targets are that faults requiring an engineer are cleared within two days; faults that do not require an engineer are targeted to be cleared within four days.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/5">BT also offers customers a free divert to a number of their choice for the duration of the fault, and &pound;1 a day towards the cost of their calls.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/6">There are currently no obligations placed on broadband providers to supply broadband nationally. But we do have a universal service obligation (USO) in the UK for basic telephony and functional internet access. The scope of the universal service obligation is defined by the EC universal services directive 2002/22/EC (&quot;USD&quot;), which is put into UK law by the Communications Act 2003. Universal service ensures that basic fixed line and functional internet access are available at an affordable price to all citizen-customers across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/7">The latest Ofcom figures reveal that broadband is available to more than 99 per cent of UK households. Thirty-seven per cent of households can choose between four wholesale broadband providers, 8 per cent can choose between three wholesale providers, 12 per cent between two wholesale providers and the remainder can access a BT wholesale offering. At the retail level, consumers have access to a very wide choice of retail broadband products provided by more than 60 internet service providers currently operating in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.5/8">The EU Commission is reviewing the scope and future of universal service next year and we expect a Green Paper to be published in the autumn, on which we will consult widely in preparing our response.</p>
