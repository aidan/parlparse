Our statutory nature conservation body, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), has put forward proposals for a SAC at Dogger Bank within UK waters. The proposals are currently being considered by Defra. JNCC plan, subject to approval, to conduct a formal consultation on the proposals before the end of 2009. If, following that consultation, any part of the Dogger Bank requires designation as an SAC, Defra plans to submit the site to the European Commission in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/2">As no SAC has yet been designated in UK waters, no detailed discussions have taken place with the Netherlands and Germany regarding any enforcement measures that may be required to protect the area. However, as the Dogger Bank is a cross-boundary feature, officials from Defra and the JNCC have met regularly with their Dutch and German counterparts regarding the scientific justification for the designation of the Dogger Bank as an SAC, and the human activities that may affect its conservation status.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.0/1">Under the terms of the BBC's charter and agreement, it is the responsibility of the BBC Trust to ensure that arrangements for the collection of the licence fee are efficient, appropriate and proportionate. The BBC has informed me that it does not have any legal right to demand that people without a television receiver contact them.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/2">The BBC has informed me that TV Licensing nonetheless asks such people to do so in order that they will not receive regular mailings intended for unlicensed viewers. Furthermore, this helps to ensure greater accuracy with the TV licensing database.</p>
