Natural England leads on the advice delivery and the Environment Agency leads on catchment appraisals, monitoring and evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.5/2">Current figures collated by the Environment Agency, which cover approximately 90 per cent of catchment sensitive farming officer (CSFO) delivery between 2006 and 2007, indicate that the initiative held 324 workshops or similar events.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-11-28b.118.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="118"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71128w0001.htm#07112866000032">
	<p pid="b.118.2/1">The information is not available in the form requested. Data are held by the Police Service of Northern Ireland on the number of recorded offences of rape and attempted rape that have been cleared by means of charge or summons. This information, for the calendar years 2001-02 to 2006-07, is set out in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3 detail the number of prosecutions and convictions for rape and attempted rape recorded in the calendar years 2001 to 2005 (the latest years for which such data are currently available).</p>
	<p pid="b.118.2/2">It is not possible routinely to reconcile both sets of data. The PSNI data relate to the number of offences, whereas data on prosecutions and convictions relate to the number of offenders brought before the courts. Additionally, an offence that is initially recorded as rape or attempted rape may differ from the offence for which a suspect is subsequently prosecuted and convicted. Thus, for example, in 2005 there were four convictions for rape out of 21 prosecutions (19 per cent), while the number of persons directed for prosecution for rape or a related offence and whose trial concluded with a conviction for at least one of those offences was 17 out of 27 prosecutions (63 per cent).</p>
	<p pid="b.118.2/3">The Government are committed to improving the rates of successful prosecution in rape cases. Specialist police units, staffed by highly skilled and trained personnel, are dedicated to enhancing the service to victims of rape and sexual assault, and both PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service are seeking to develop models of best investigative practice so that more offences can achieve the threshold for prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.2/4">The Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety have also jointly developed and consulted on a draft regional strategy for addressing sexual violence in Northern Ireland, which will specifically examine the factors that contribute to the attrition rate in relation to sexual offences. The strategy is scheduled to be published in early 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.2/5">As part of that process, we have already made significant progress, in partnership with the medical profession and voluntary sector, in developing proposals for a sexual assault referral centre (SARC) in Northern Ireland. The SARC will deliver a more co-ordinated response to the needs of victims by providing immediate medical aftercare and individual counselling and other support services, while also facilitating the preservation of forensic evidence to assist in the successful prosecution of offenders.</p>

	<p pid="b.120.3/1">Defra has a responsibility to manage its budget with care and to provide best value to the taxpayer. The department takes this responsibility very seriously and strives to use the most cost-effective means to continue to deliver in its key business areas. Consultancy and professional services expenditure occurs where business units take an informed decision that the private sector represents better value for money than developing equivalent capacity in-house. Additionally, these decisions are taken in the context of meeting the Gershon target to reduce the number of Civil Service posts by 2,400 by the end of financial year 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.3/2">The core department has recently completed a root-and-branch review of its expenditure on consultancy and professional services, which has led to a new commissioning approvals process being implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-03">3 September 2007</phrase> and the competition of several new framework agreements for key segments of consultancy and professional services expenditure. The department is also an active supporter of and participant in the OGC's consultancy value programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.3/3">Additionally, the National Audit Office has recently completed an assessment of the core department's expenditure on consultancy using the NAO's assessment toolkit for the use of consultants. Recommendations made in its draft report are being considered by the department.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.3/4">Further, the CSR07 business planning process is placing a major emphasis on reducing expenditure on consultancy and professional services. Until this process is complete, it is neither possible nor sensible to estimate expenditure on consultancy and professional services in future financial years. Where resource numbers or resource skills are not available internally, the department will consider consultancy and professional services provision subject to value-for-money considerations. The department will continue to publicise its expenditure on consultancy and professional services in its annual departmental report.</p>

	<p pid="b.122.0/1">The GB security and quality of supply standard recognises two levels of electricity generation infeed to the power system, mainly for the purpose of determining the level of power system reserve that should be held. These are defined as the &quot;infrequent infeed loss risk&quot; and the &quot;normal infeed loss risk&quot; and they are set at 1,320 megawatts and 1,000 megawatts respectively. In the event that larger electricity generating plants become available in the future, the Government would expect that the implications for the standard would be considered through existing and well established governance arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.122.6/1">The most significant factor contributing to increases in UK carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions seen in 2005 and 2006 is greater electricity generation from coal burning. The price of gas has been at a level that means that it has been more profitable to generate electricity through the increased use of coal.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.6/2">The introduction of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has put a price on CO2 emissions. Power stations are covered by the scheme and must account for their emissions by surrendering allowances.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.6/3">In phase I of the EU ETS, the price of allowances fell significantly due to oversupply in the market. It is still more profitable for electricity generation to come from increased use of coal even when factoring in additional carbon costs of burning coal compared to gas.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.6/4">In phase II of the EU ETS, the European Commission's decision to request significant reductions on several member states' caps will help to ensure greater scarcity of allowances in the market. This should deliver a carbon price that incentivises cost-effective emission reductions and investment in clean technology.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.0/2">I am advised by LUL that agreement was reached between LUL and Olympia &amp; York (later Canary Wharf Limited (CWL)) in 1993 that CWL would provide &pound;398 million in total towards the JLE.

These improvements include the additional capacity at Canary Wharf station provided in 2004, the seventh car for existing trains provided in 2005 and the introduction of new signalling and train control systems by 2009.</p>
