	<p pid="a.249.5/1">DfID does not provide direct funding for Bhutanese refugees in Nepal. However, DfID contributes &pound;17 million of unallocated support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which has an operational budget of approximately $3.1 million for Bhutanese refugees this year. DfID also contributes through our support for the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). In 2006, 18 per cent. of ECHO's budget of &euro;2 million for Bhutanese refugees will come from DfID.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.5/2">The assessment of our embassy in Nepal is that prospects for repatriation are currently poor. Despite the fact that the Bhutanese Government recognise that some of the refugees are bona fide Bhutanese, there has been no progress on the issue since an incident when missiles were thrown at Bhutanese officials visiting a camp in December 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.5/3">The UK fully supports the UNHCR's position on the issue; that is, that there should be negotiations between the Nepalese and Bhutanese Governments leading to a repatriation for the majority of refugees. Bhutan is covered from the High Commission in New Delhi. The last formal representations to the Bhutanese on the refugee issue were made to the King and Foreign Minister during the High Commissioner's visit to Bhutan in May 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.2/1">In a Statement I made to the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase> I referred to the agency budget as &pound;400 million. That is an approximate figure and relates to expenditure for which Stephen Geraghty, the agency chief executive, is accountable, and excludes the expenditure incurred by the department on behalf of the agency and later allocated to the agency's accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/2">A change in accounting policy proposed by the Department for Work and Pensions and confirmed by National Audit Office will lead to a restatement of 2004&ndash;05 expenditure reported in the agency's annual accounts. This reflects the incorporation of costs associated with the modernisation programme in the accounts of individual agencies rather than charging such costs directly to the central departmental resource account. It is expected that the restated 2004&ndash;05 figure will increase expenditure to around &pound;425 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/3">The agency accounts for 2005&ndash;06 will be presented on the same basis and are estimated as &pound;403 million. This figure excludes expenditure incurred by the department on behalf of its constituent agencies. These costs are apportioned to each agency in line with standard accounting practice at the end of each financial year. Last year's recharges were &pound;58 million; figures for 2005&ndash;06 are not yet available. The overall costs of the agency will be confirmed when the audited agency accounts are published in July 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.5/1">Under the provisions of Clause 31, which have been discussed with HM Revenue and Customs, the restrictions will apply to both the seller and the purchaser. The law can be enforced in respect of the seller only where he is resident in this country. The offence of purchase is cast in terms of failure to hold a certificate and not failure to produce. A person who buys presses or dies from an overseas source and does not fall into the categories listed in Clause 31(5)(a) to (g) will be liable to prosecution. We think the risk of certificates being lost in the post is small and that it is appropriate to align the provisions in the Bill with current firearms legislation which is predicated on the actual production of certificates because of the possible misuse of photocopies.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.2/1">Following a policy review on 2005, the DfID bilateral aid allocation for Nepal in 2005&ndash;06 was reduced from &pound;40 million. In 2006&ndash;07, DfID plans to disburse &pound;30 million. These reduced allocations reflect the inability of the Government of Nepal to make a strong case for higher levels of development assistance in the current conditions of political instability and conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/2">The 2005 policy review also led to some reprioritisation of the programme and to the allocation of resources for support to democratic institutions, to help ensure that a return to multi-party democracy is sustained.</p>
