	<p pid="a.250.2/1">In a Statement I made to the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase> I referred to the agency budget as &pound;400 million. That is an approximate figure and relates to expenditure for which Stephen Geraghty, the agency chief executive, is accountable, and excludes the expenditure incurred by the department on behalf of the agency and later allocated to the agency's accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/2">A change in accounting policy proposed by the Department for Work and Pensions and confirmed by National Audit Office will lead to a restatement of 2004&ndash;05 expenditure reported in the agency's annual accounts. This reflects the incorporation of costs associated with the modernisation programme in the accounts of individual agencies rather than charging such costs directly to the central departmental resource account. It is expected that the restated 2004&ndash;05 figure will increase expenditure to around &pound;425 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/3">The agency accounts for 2005&ndash;06 will be presented on the same basis and are estimated as &pound;403 million. This figure excludes expenditure incurred by the department on behalf of its constituent agencies. These costs are apportioned to each agency in line with standard accounting practice at the end of each financial year. Last year's recharges were &pound;58 million; figures for 2005&ndash;06 are not yet available. The overall costs of the agency will be confirmed when the audited agency accounts are published in July 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.2/1">Following a policy review on 2005, the DfID bilateral aid allocation for Nepal in 2005&ndash;06 was reduced from &pound;40 million. In 2006&ndash;07, DfID plans to disburse &pound;30 million. These reduced allocations reflect the inability of the Government of Nepal to make a strong case for higher levels of development assistance in the current conditions of political instability and conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.2/2">The 2005 policy review also led to some reprioritisation of the programme and to the allocation of resources for support to democratic institutions, to help ensure that a return to multi-party democracy is sustained.</p>
