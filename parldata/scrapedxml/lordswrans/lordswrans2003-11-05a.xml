	<p pid="a.107.2/1">The Department for Employment and Learning has taken action to reduce the waiting times for tribunal hearings by recruiting additional full-time tribunal chairmen and administrative staff and providing additional accommodation and a new IT system.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">Future action will include:</p>

	<p pid="a.107.2/10">In addition the draft Employment (NI) Order, which has just completed its passage through Parliament, will strengthen conciliation and require statutory minimum dispute resolution procedures to be introduced in every workplace in Northern Ireland. The aim is to help people to settle disputes in the workplace and so reduce the number of applications being made to the tribunals, which in turn should facilitate earlier listing of those applications already in the system.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-05a.108.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="108"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031105/text/31105w01.htm#31105w01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.108.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">4 November</phrase> the Executive Board of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) agreed to provide a loan to help fund the Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline. The IFC decision was taken by the IFC Executive Board on which 175 shareholders are represented by 24 directors, including the UK. The IFC loan, which will be at commercial rates of interest, is for around 4.5 per cent of the total cost of the BTC pipeline and accompanying Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) Phase 1 oil field development projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/2">The BTC pipeline will provide an export route for oil from Azerbaijan's Caspian oil fields. The Governments of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey&mdash;the countries through which the pipeline passes&mdash;strongly support the project and have negotiated agreements with BTC Corporation, the pipeline company. Azerbaijan, a low-income country, will benefit from significant revenues from the ACG oil field development. Georgia, also a low-income country, will benefit from transit revenues of up to 10 per cent of current GDP per year. The pipeline will help to strengthen cooperation between the three countries and increase their links to global markets. It will provide local employment and demonstrate the potential for foreign investment. The construction of the pipeline, which will be buried underground, has already started.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/3">Responsible and transparent management of oil revenue will be vital if the BTC project is to achieve real development benefits for the people of the region. Working to achieve this will need to be a priority for the governments of the region, with support, assistance and oversight from civil society, the private sector and the international community. The agreement of BTC to &quot;publish what it pays&quot; and in turn the agreement of Georgia and Azerbaijan to &quot;publish what they receive&quot; are welcome steps. The UK will continue to work to increase transparency and build local capacity in decision making on the use of revenues, including through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/4">The Department for International Development (DfID) is not providing any direct funding for the BTC project. DfID's role is as a shareholder of IFC and of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)&mdash;whose executive board will consider finance to BTC on <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase>. The institutions carried out rigorous social and environmental, integrity, legal and commercial due-diligence procedures. In accordance with standard practice, DfID did not duplicate the due diligence undertaken by these institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/5">Over the past year, DfID officials have met with local and international NGOs, staff from IFC and the EBRD, BTC and representatives of the governments involved to build better understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the pipeline. In view of the project's complexity, DfID commissioned consultants to do an assessment of the BTC Environmental Assessment. They confirmed compliance with the IFC and EBRD policies and procedures. DfID will place a copy of this report in the House of Lords' Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/6">The Government recognise that large-scale pipeline projects such as the BTC pipeline present risks as well as potential benefits. Project risks include the weak governance environment and the potential social and environmental impacts of the pipeline. The multilateral institutions have thorough environmental and social safeguards procedures and genuine expertise of working in the region. We believe that their engagement provides the best prospect that the BTC pipeline will be constructed and operated to the highest standards. The UK director at IFC therefore supported the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/7">We are now focusing on ensuring that the project is implemented properly. In particular we recognise the importance of very strong monitoring including NGO and community representatives. We therefore pressed IFC to:</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/8" class="indent">Ensure regular independent consultation on monitoring the implementation of the project&mdash;IFC will set up a mechanism that brings together IFI staff, the sponsors, governments from the region, civil society (local and international) and representatives from the IFI executive boards in order to resolve issues arising during project implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/9" class="indent">Encourage enhanced transparency of revenue management&mdash;IFC will support the IMF and the World Bank in their efforts to promote the transparency of revenues in both Azerbaijan and Georgia and to encourage the use of these revenues to support Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/10" class="indent">Demonstrate how IFC has learnt from the BTC/ACG projects&mdash;IFC will ensure that these lessons are properly reviewed and inform future policy development, including in discussions of the Extractive Industries Review (EIR), and report back to the Board. We made clear that we would strongly support the use of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for future infrastructure projects on this scale. IFC agreed to include in its review an assessment of the potential for SEA in future large scale and cross border projects. Other shareholders supported the UK points.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.5/11">The challenge now is to ensure that the people of the region benefit from the opportunities offered by the Caspian's natural resources. This will require concerted effort by the countries of the region, and also by civil society, the private sector and the international community. The UK Government will work to ensure that risks, which might impact on this project's contribution to sustainable development, are addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/2">The main area that has had particular difficulties with recruitment is CPS West Midlands (specifically Birmingham). A study has recently been undertaken to identify the issues involved and a report and recommendations are currently under consideration.

We want to build on the successes of the existing reform programme in moving towards a modernised, truly representative, more responsive police service delivering, consistently, core national standards of policing that the public has a right to expect, within a framework which allows for local flexibilities.

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">I am today announcing the start of the public consultation period for Planning Policy Statement 22, which sets out this Government's planning policy for renewable energy projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/2">Increased development of renewable energy resources is vital to facilitating the delivery of the Government's commitments on both climate change and renewable energy. This new draft planning policy statement clearly sets out positive planning policies, which will facilitate renewable energy developments and contribute to all four elements of the Government's sustainable development strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/3">This statement makes clear:</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/4" class="indent">that local planning authorities should set clear criteria in their plans on which renewable energy projects will be judged rather than identifying any specific locations suitable for certain types of development. We believe that the past emphasis on identifying specific areas of search within development plans has proved unsuccessful;</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/5" class="indent">that targets for renewable energy generation should be set within regional planning guidance, as indicated in the energy White Paper. Such targets may be disaggregated subregionally if appropriate, but the aim should always be to exceed any targets set, rather than just meet them;</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/6" class="indent">the latest government planning policy relating to renewable energy developments and the additional safeguards for national parks or other national and internationally designated areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/7">Due to the need for clearer and more concise statements of government policy this PPS does not include technical advice or good practice guidance. The intention is to publish separately a companion guide containing the technical details of what was originally in the annexes of PPG22. We are also keen to include evidence of good practice from both developers and local planning authorities within this guide. Work on the guide will commence shortly and it will be published alongside the final version of PPS22.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.5/1">In financial year 2003&ndash;04, military assistance provided by the United Kingdom to the Colombian armed forces focused primarily on explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and provision of training courses to members of the Colombian armed forces both in Colombia and in the UK. The cost of this assistance was about &pound;120,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.5/2">The assistance is aimed at reducing the number of deaths, both civilian and military, from explosive devices, and at introducing Colombian military personnel to British defence concepts in key areas such as rules of engagement and the democratic and accountable control of the armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">I refer my noble friend to the Ministry of Defence paper, Medical Records in the Gulf, dated October 2001, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. It is also available on the Internet at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/medical/bwa.htm">http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/medical/bwa.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">A mandatory operational medical record form (F Med 965) is now in use whenever service personnel deploy on non-maritime operations during which time they are not required to have their permanent service medical record (F Med 4) with them. The F Med 4 is held on board ship for the RN ship's company and embarked Royal Marines and thus is available to medical staff. The F Med 4's of deployed Army and RAF personnel are retained at their home base. The F Med 965 has been used in the Army since July 1998 and on a tri-service basis where appropriate from <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-20">20 January 1999</phrase>. It comprises a 12-page booklet in a waterproof cover and should be held by the individual to whom it relates at all times while deployed on operations. Since January 1999, medical centres have been required to record the fact that F Med 965s have been issued to individuals so that forms not returned after the operation can be hastened. On return from deployment, the information recorded on the F Med 965 is to be transferred to the individual's F Med 4. When not being used, the F Med 965 is retained within the individual's F Med 4 and should be reviewed for accuracy at each medical examination and updated following vaccinations and significant health events. An audit procedure is in place to ensure that the information on the F Med 965 is transferred to the F Med 4.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-05a.118.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="118"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031105/text/31105w03.htm#31105w03_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.118.8/1">Overbooking is an accepted practice among full-service scheduled airlines. On any particular flight there is likely to be a proportion of passengers, mainly from those holding flexible tickets, who do not check in. On the basis of statistical evidence from previous flights, airlines estimate the probable number of no-shows and overbook accordingly. On the great majority of flights no passengers are denied boarding, and by reducing the number of empty seats overbooking keeps fares lower than they would otherwise be. This practice is widely accepted by passenger organisations and by regulators as being in the best interests of consumers generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.8/2">In the comparatively small proportion of cases where denied boarding occurs, existing Community legislation requires Community air carriers to provide prescribed minimum levels of financial compensation, in addition to offering passengers a choice between re-routeing and reimbursement. One of the aims of the legislation is to incentivise airlines to estimate the numbers of no-shows accurately. In December 2001 the European Commission presented a proposal for a regulation to increase levels of compensation to passengers denied boarding, as well as to require the provision of assistance to travellers affected by cancellations for commercial reasons or delays. Political agreement on this proposal was reached at Transport Council in December 2002. Final amendments to the draft text were agreed during recent conciliation between the Council and the European Parliament. Subject to ratification of these amendments, the regulation will be published and, 12 months later, have direct application in all member states. It is not for the Government to inquire into Air France's booking practices.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.2/3">The sale of through tickets covering both a rail and bus journey seldom has competition implications because the operators of each stage of the journey are not normally competing with each other for the passengers making the journey.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/4">The public transport ticketing schemes block exemption allows transport operators to agree to through or joint ticketing schemes, subject to certain conditions, notwithstanding the general prohibition on pricing agreements in the Competition Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/5">The Transport Act 2000 gives local authorities powers to make ticketing schemes for local buses which may include connecting rail or tram services. Even where a scheme has a significantly adverse effect on competition, but secures improvements in local bus services, or reduces congestion or pollution, it satisfies the competition test in that Act if the benefits achieved are proportionate to the restrictions on competition.</p>
