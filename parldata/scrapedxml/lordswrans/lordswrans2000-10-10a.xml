	<p pid="a.17.2/1">It is important that we draw the right conclusions for public policy in this country, especially as the Alliance for Childhood's research was conducted in the USA. This is why the department is investing in a programme of research looking at the impact of Information and Communications Technology on learning, teaching and institutional effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/2">The Government believe that computers are a valuable and important addition to the resources available in primary schools. They are not a substitute for effective teaching of the basics, which is why we have introduced the daily literacy and numeracy lesson. But, effectively used, they can enhance teaching and learning. It is also essential that young people start to learn about ICT from an early age, as they are increasingly such an important part of everyday life. That is why we have invested in ICT as well as providing considerably improved resources for teaching, books and school buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.5/1">The Government's health strategy for England is an action plan to improve health and is set out in the White Paper Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation. As part of this, hepatitis C initiatives may be taken forward under the umbrella of wider action on public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">Studies suggest that the prevalence (current level) of chronic carriage of hepatitis C may be around 0.5 per cent of the general population in the United Kingdom. The incidence (new infection) of hepatitis C is not known, as the virus is usually acquired without symptoms. There is likely to be an increase in the diagnosis of hepatitis C in the next 10 years as individuals who have carried the virus for some time are identified through wider testing of groups who have been at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/3">Two drug treatments for hepatitis C are currently licensed; monotherapy with alpha interferon and combination therapy with alpha interferon plus ribavirin. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is considering the use of combination therapy to treat hepatitis C, and will issue recommendations on its clinical and cost effectiveness shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/4">Evidence-based clinical guidelines on the management of people infected with hepatitis C are being developed by a group from the British Society of Gastroenterology, the British Institute for the Study of the Liver and the Royal College of Physicians. The authoritative guidance provided by NICE and by the guidelines will ensure that combination therapy is provided consistently throughout the National Health Service, and that the most effective treatment is delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has today written to Sir Michael Perry, the Chairman of the Senior Salaries Review Body, in the following terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">&quot;In 1996 the Senior Salaries Review Body undertook a comprehensive review of the pay of Members of Parliament. One of your recommendations, which the then Government accepted, was that pay should be reviewed every three years, beginning in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/3">You are about to start work on that review. I am therefore writing to confirm that the Government would like to see the following areas covered in your report:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/4" class="indent">(i) the salary of Members of the House of Commons</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/5" class="indent">(ii) the salaries of Ministers and other office-holders</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-10-10a.20.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100395" speakername="Lord Macdonald of Tradeston" colon=":" colnum="20"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001010/text/01010w02.htm#01010w02_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.20.2/1">The Transport Council met in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-02">2 October</phrase>. I represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">The Council adopted a resolution on air passenger rights, setting out desired improvements, to be achieved principally through voluntary commitments by airlines, backed up if necessary by Community legislation. I emphasised the importance of better treatment for passengers, pointing out that the UK competition authorities had recently secured improvements in IATA's recommended conditions of carriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/3">A number of other aviation issues were discussed. The Commission reported on its proposal for an EU Aviation Safety Agency to help draw up Community aircraft safety standards. The Presidency undertook to make progress as soon as possible and the December Council will address the issue again. During discussion of airport slot allocation, the Commission noted the need for progress on better use of airport capacity and invited delegations to submit written comments to help it formulate a revised proposal. The Commission reported on the continuing discussions with Russia on the issue of royalty payments for flights over Siberia, and on progress in the High Level Group on a Single European Sky.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/4">There was a debate on the Commission's recent Communication on road transport. During discussion of the need for a specific working time directive on road transport, I made clear that UK support for the directive depended on the way it dealt with our concerns on night work, the maximum working week, and individual opt-outs. A particular concern of ours has been coverage of the self-employed. I, with a majority of other Ministers, was able to accept the provisional exclusion of the self-employed from the directive, pending a review two years after transposition. There was general agreement with the Presidency's suggestion that limiting driving time (rather than working time) rules should be clarified and simplified to ensure consistent application across the EU. All of the Ministers were in favour of greater efforts to combat illegal employment of third country drivers. There was similarly broad support for Commission ideas on the enforcement of existing rules and on driver training. The Presidency concluded that consensus existed for action on those points. It also concluded that there was broad agreement on the provisional exclusion of the self-employed from the road working time directive. Work will continue with a view to reaching common position on that Directive at a future Council on this basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/5">The Council further debated two of the legislative proposals arising from the loss of the Erika tanker off the Brittany coast last year. The debate opened with a discussion of the proposal on port state control of shipping, which would give the Commission responsibility for recognising member states' appointed ship inspection organisations. The Presidency noted that there was general agreement among member states. The Commission was concerned that Council had weakened the impact of its proposal. The matter will be further debated in the light of the European Parliament's first reading. The Council agreed a common EU approach to negotiations in the International Martime Organisation on the timetable for the accelerated phasing out of single-hulled tankers, with the objective of alignment with current US legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/6">The Council went on to discuss the proposals contained in a Presidency paper on further measures in maritime safety (the &quot;Erika II&quot; package). During that debate, I joined other Ministers in emphasising that, because of the international nature of shipping, it was necessary for negotiation to take place at global level. Following the debate, the Presidency drew the following conclusions: surveillance of ships with hazardous cargoes should proceed in accordance with international law; improvement in levels of compensation for oil spills was necessary, with appropriate action being taken within existing international conventions, but with the possibility of an additional EU compensation regime if necessary. The Commission would make further proposals on maritime employment and training, and on a European maritime safety structure, which would work with national authorities and improve co-operation and transparency. The Erika II package will be further discussed at the European Council in Biarritz on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-13">13 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/7">The Council discussed the proposed Galileo satellite navigation system, concentrating on four issues--financing, system architecture, management structure and services to be provided--which will need to be agreed if the project is to continue. The Commission presented some figures on the costs and benefits of the system, suggesting that it will be funded primarily from EU budgets and through the European Space Agency until the launch phase in 2006-2007. I joined other Ministers in stressing the need for more detailed information on all aspects of the project, including a thorough cost-benefit analysis, in good time for the Council's decision in December on whether to proceed beyond the current definition phase of the project. The Commission promised to submit a Communication on Galileo in the course of the next few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/8">There was discussion of a draft regulation on allocation of Swiss transit permits for HGVs. The Presidency noted the remaining disagreements and concluded that Coreper should aim to reach a decision by November on the permit allocation question.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/9">The Commission presented two linked legislative proposals on public transport services. The intention of the proposal on public service requirements was to address the reality of the Single Market in the provision of public transport services. The other proposal relates to state aid in public transport. In its statement on this, the Commission said that it would look favourably on infrastructure investment, and the proposal would take into account the needs of small islands. The Presidency concluded that there would be an orientation debate at the December Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.0/1">This incident is currently the subject of an official investigation, a summary of the results and recommendations arising from which will be published by London Underground in due course. A factual account of the timescales of the operation follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-04">4 September</phrase>, a train broke down at Liverpool Street Station. Two further trains, containing approximately 2,100 passengers, became blocked in the tunnel behind it. The process began with the first blocked train being moved up to the defective train, as soon as it was apparent that the latter could not move under its own power. The initial intention was to couple the trains so that the defective train could be pushed forward, enabling the first blocked train to move up to the platform and its passengers simply to disembark there.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/3">However, after approximately 20 minutes it became clear that, due to the angle of the trains in the tunnel, coupling would not be possible. The decision was taken to commence a &quot;through train&quot; evacuation. This involves running the trains up to each other and the passengers walking through both trains until they reach the platform. This evacuation began as soon as all required safety precautions could be put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/4">The first train, containing 1,147 people, was evacuated in 35 minutes in this way (one passenger every 1.8 seconds). Once the first train was empty, the evacuation of the second blocked train began, taking passengers through all three trains. Approximately 1,000 people were thus evacuated at a similar rate to those on the first train.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.0/1">London Underground management operates in accordance with procedures agreed by the Health and Safety Executive and carries out rigorous, routine checks on all its escalators as part of its programme of continuous safety monitoring. Where equipment is found to be defective, London Underground will, where necessary, take such equipment, including escalators, out of service so as to avoid hazard to its passengers. This is an appropriate and responsible management response. Most escalators thus taken out of service are not new ones. Where defects have occurred on recently installed escalators, such as on the Jubilee Line extension, London Underground has undertaken careful analysis of faults to identify any recurrent trends or problems, which are then addressed in conjunction with the manufacturer and the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

At the end of June, following consultation on a range of measures to improve the control of outdoor advertisements, we announced our proposal to limit the geographical scope of Areas of Special Control of Advertisements (ASCAs) to land within National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Broads, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and conservation areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/2">Areas of the countryside which would no longer be included within ASCAs would still be subject to the Control of Advertisements Regulations. Applications to display an advertisement would be considered by local planning authorities on the basis of amenity and public safety, taking account of national planning policy guidance. This makes clear that poster advertising is out of place in the open countryside and should not normally be allowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/3">There are good reasons why local planning authorities should decide these matters at local level, just as they decide other important planning matters. We are, nevertheless, giving careful consideration to representations received about ASCAs since the June announcement before coming to a final decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/4">The proposals relate only to England.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">Remediation of the site has been carried out in stages. British Gas, the original landowner, carried out the statutory remediation, removing all substances which could be a danger or harmful to health.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">The second phase has been carried out by English Partnerships to make the site fit for known planned developments. This has involved either the removal of any remaining contaminated material or works to contain and isolate it. Approximately 1.3 million m <sup>3</sup> of soil has been affected by earth moving operations on the Greenwich Peninsula, of which 260,000m <sup>3</sup> of fill has been removed by English Partnerships from the New Millennium Experience Company site, and 230,000m <sup>3</sup> from the southern site.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">The remaining 850,000m <sup>3</sup> was deemed suitable for retention on site, in some cases after treatment. Approximately 30,000m <sup>3</sup> of material has been subjected to &quot;soil washing&quot; to remove the finer, more contaminated material; and about 245,000m <sup>3</sup> of crushed concrete and similar material has been recycled for use on site.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/4">The depth to which materials were removed and treated varies across the site. In some areas material was removed to a depth of 14 metres, with the deepest area of bulk excavation being approximately 8 metres under the English Partnerships contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/5">The containment of any residual contamination after treatment has involved the construction of surface and vertical barriers. Such barriers vary according to the end use but in landscape areas, for example, they are typically about 1.5 metres thick. In other areas, particularly areas used for coach parks and other uses which incorporate a hard solid capping layer themselves, the depth of material used in construction and as a barrier is approximately 450 mm thick.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/6">Both British Gas and English Partnerships employ WS Atkins as their remediation consultants, who secured the agreement of the Environment Agency and the Environmental Health Department of the London Borough of Greenwich to the remediation solutions which were carried out on site.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/7">The whole of the 300 acre Greenwich Peninsula site has been remediated fit for its purpose. Any further remediation will depend upon the final use to which the land is to be put and will relate to the form of construction used, for example, where piles and/or other foundations may need to break through the barrier layer they will have to be treated in accordance with the regulatory bodies' standards to ensure the integrity of the capping layer.</p>

Indications of the incidence of disability obtained from the 1996-97 Family Resources Survey were used to make broad estimates of take-up rates for those benefits at that time and suggested that perhaps 30-50 per cent of those entitled to the Disability Living Allowance care component, 50-70 per cent of those entitled to the mobility component, and 40-60 per cent of those entitled to Attendance Allowance were actually claiming the benefit.

	<p pid="a.33.12/1">It is difficult to make direct comparisons between the rates of tax charged on the disposal of shares in publicly quoted companies across the Euoprean Union. This is because in many countries there is no distinction made between capital gains and other income, for corporate disposal of shares in publicly quoted companies. Instead, in such cases, all income is taxed at the corporate rate.</p>

It outlines, for each country of the EU, the means by which the capital gains on the disposal of shares are taxed. The tax rates shown all relate to those in effect as at the end of December 1999, the most recent period for which comparative data are available. Since there is a distinction between taxation of corporate and individual disposal of shares in publicly quoted companies, the table includes a column for each.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.12/23">*The 1998 Budget introduced a taper for capital gains tax on non-business assets, which replaced the previous capital gains tax indexation allowance. For non-business assets the taper reduces the effective rate of tax on capital gains for a higher rate taxpayer from 40 per cent in the first three years down to 24 per cent after the tenth year.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.12/24">For business assets there is also a taper, which reduces the effective rate of tax for a higher rate taxpayer from 40 per cent in the first year to 10 per cent after the tenth year. From April 2000 the taper increases, so that the effective tax rate for a higher rate taxpayer falls from 40 per cent in the first year to</p>
	<p pid="a.33.12/25">10 per cent after the fourth year.</p>
