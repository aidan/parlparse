Whilst each of these organisations has a role to play, we believe it is important that the United Nations, which has already agreed 11 international terrorism conventions, should remain the principal forum for multilateral discussion of terrorism.</p>

The Government have said that the constitutional issue is a factor in the decision about whether to join the single currency but not an over-riding one. Rather, the determining factor in the decision is whether the economic benefits are clear and unambiguous. If they are, there is no constitutional bar to British membership of EMU.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.5/1">The feasibility study has concluded that compulsory mobilisation is feasible in both legal and practical terms. This will enable the TA to make a major contribution to front-line operations and reflects and supports the intent of the Strategic Defence Review that the Territorial Army should be usable. At the same time, as a result of the reduction in UK force levels in the Balkans, we judge that compulsory mobilisation is not operationally necessary at this time. We will keep the possibility of compulsory mobilisation under constant review in the light of the prevailing operational conditions.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-01-13a.133.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="133"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000113/text/00113w01.htm#00113w01_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.133.0/1">In principle it is already possible for decisions of the Takeover Panel to be referred to the UK courts in an application for judicial review, and for other matters connected with a bid to come before the UK courts in the usual way. However, at present the scope for judicial review of the panel's decisions is extremely limited, and the Court of Appeal has indicated in particular that it is only in exceptional circumstances that it would intervene so as to affect the outcome of a bid. Similarly, at present it is very unlikely (although not impossible) that any point of EC law could arise in connection with a panel decision which was the subject of UK court proceedings, so as to make it necessary for the UK court to refer a question to the European Court of Justice. The concern has been raised that the adoption of the directive could make it more likely that points of both domestic and EC law would arise which required adjudication by the UK courts or by the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/2">Her Majesty's Government have therefore negotiated the inclusion of a clause in the draft directive which is intended to allow the courts in the United Kingdom to continue their practice of not intervening in takeover bids, and, by implication, of not referring questions to the European Court of Justice. This clause-- Article 4.5--includes a provision stating that the directive does not affect the power which courts may have in a member state to decline to hear legal proceedings and to decide whether or not such proceedings affect the outcome of the bid. The Government have said that they would intend to make maximum use of the flexibility provided by Article 4.5 in order to maintain so far as possible the present legal position established by the courts with respect to takeover bids, and that they will consult widely on draft implementing legislation to ensure that it achieves this result in practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">The provision of milk banks is a matter for local decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/2">Donated milk can help pre-term and sick babies. However there remain concerns about the transmission of infectious agents from human milk. Although mothers and their donated milk are screened before use, there remains a theoretical risk. It is for these reasons that mothers and fathers should make their own decisions about whether they want their baby to receive donated human milk.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/3">The Government are fully committed to the promotion of breastfeeding, which is uniformly accepted as the best form of nutrition for infants. We firmly believe that it is important that women and their partners are able to make a fully informed choice on how to feed their babies based on accurate and consistent information. This means that women should have access to information about all infant feeding practices through the relevant health care professional.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.5/1">After extensive consultation, I have decided to restore &quot;price paid&quot; to the Land Register. This is consistent with the Government's policy to improve the house buying process by making important information more readily available, particularly at an early stage of the process. Information included in the Land Register should be as comprehensive as is practical and proper--property value is of great interest to people and there is no good reason why it should not be made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/2">The information will not be inserted retrospectively. All applications received by the Land Registry on or after <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> will have the price paid entered on the Land Register where it is practicable to do so. As with other data, the Land Register will provide the current information. Hence, on a subsequent change of ownership, the original price paid will be removed from the register.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/3">This change in practice will bring the Land Register for England and Wales into line with many other jurisdictions where the price paid for property is a matter of public record. This includes most of Europe and, notably, Scotland, where this information has been publicly available since 1617 without appearing to cause any problems.</p>
