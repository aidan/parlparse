	<p pid="a.116.5/1">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Green-top Guideline No.5, on the management of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), contains detailed information on the symptoms, diagnosis and classification of severity of OHSS. This is a markedly different document from the public consultation document issued by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which gave a general description of the risks associated with egg donation. The HFEA has advised me that it does not believe there is anything contradictory between the two documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/2">Information on the incidents of adverse clinical effects associated with OHSS occurring in each HFEA licensed centre, and whether treatment was discontinued where OHSS was suspected, is not routinely collectedly by the HFEA. However, I have asked the HFEA to make an analysis of the incident reports referred to in my Answer given on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WA196</I>) and I will write to the noble Lord with the result, and place a copy in the Library.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-12-18a.123.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100960" speakername="Lord Darzi of Denham" colon=":" colnum="123"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71218w0003.htm#07121851000194">
	<p pid="a.123.2/1">As I said in my earlier reply of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-23">23 October</phrase>, I am very sorry that the department's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> to Mrs Bullock was open to misinterpretation, and an apology has been sent to Mrs Bullock, copied to the Archer inquiry team. However, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I can assure the noble Lord that at no time did anyone in the department claim that Lord Archer of Sandwell had &quot;ignored the department's offer of a meeting with the inquiry&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/2">The letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> was prepared by the department's customer service centre, using information supplied by the blood policy team. The letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Department of Health officials met with members of the inquiry team on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-25">25 April</phrase> to discuss how the Department may assist. In the months since April, the Department has suggested further meetings with the inquiry team, but as yet Lord Archer's team has not arranged to meet again&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/4">This was intended to convey that the department remained ready to meet Lord Archer's team and I am sorry if any other interpretation was possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/5">Mrs Bullock replied to the department on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-24">24 August</phrase>. Mrs Bullock's letter alerted us to the possibility that our own letter may be capable of different interpretations, as Mrs Bullock's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-24">24 August</phrase> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/6" class="indent">&quot;You have written that for five months the Dep. of Health has, 'suggested further meetings with the enquiry team', but that these requests have been ignored or refused by Lord Archer's team&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/7">Mrs Bullock requested information about contacts between the department and Lord Archer's inquiry team and her request was brought to the attention of the blood policy team. A reply to Mrs Bullock, copied to the Archer inquiry team, was sent from a freedom of information officer in the department on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-17">17 September</phrase> and stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Thank you for your further letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-22">22 August</phrase> requesting information on the dates the Department wrote to Lord Archer's inquiry team suggesting a meeting. We are treating your letter as a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Your letter has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/9" class="indent">I am sorry if our reply of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> to your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-09">9 July</phrase> to Alan Johnson was misleading in this respect. For your information, I attach two e-mails between the inquiry team and the Department suggesting a meeting once the inquiry team has had an opportunity to hear all the evidence and review relevant documentation which we are making available. No criticism of the inquiry team was intended and I apologise for the unfortunate wording of the previous letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/10" class="indent">As you know, officials met with the inquiry team on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-25">25 April</phrase>. We appreciate that the inquiry team is currently occupied in hearing evidence, and will no doubt contact the Department once it has completed this process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/11">During the time that this further reply was in preparation, the department's head of blood policy received a letter from Lord Archer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-04">4 September</phrase>, stating that his attention had been called to the department's first reply to Mrs Bullock of <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase> and that he was concerned that the letter could be taken to imply that requests for a meeting had been ignored by the inquiry team. He asked that the department take steps to avoid repeating any misconception in future correspondence.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/12">The head of blood policy immediately spoke to Lord Archer to apologise for any misunderstanding. When a reply had been sent to Mrs Bullock, the head of blood policy contacted Lord Archer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-18">18 September</phrase> to repeat his apology in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/13" class="indent">&quot;The department's initial response to Mrs Bullock was written by our customer service centre and they have written again to Mrs Bullock apologising for the misleading impression they gave that your inquiry team had ignored our offer of a further meeting. I apologise that the erroneous impression was given, in the original letter, that your team had ignored our offer: this is not the case and I too was concerned when I saw the initial reply to Mrs Bullock&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/14">The department has now met the inquiry team again, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-19">19 September</phrase>. The department has also copied to the inquiry team, in stages from June to October, several thousand official documents identified in the <I>Review of Documentation relating to the Safety of Blood and Blood Products (1970-1985</I><I>)</I>, which was issued in May 2007. I can therefore assure the noble Lord that our officials are co-operating fully with the inquiry team.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/15">Officials have traced 11 pieces of correspondence in July and August that used the same information. These were received and replied to before we were aware of any possible misunderstanding from the wording used. A follow-up letter has been sent to clarify our position and prevent any further misunderstanding.</p>
