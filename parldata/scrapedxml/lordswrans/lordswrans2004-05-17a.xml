	<p pid="a.55.2/1">As I stated in my Answer to Lord Lyell, during the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-06">6 April</phrase>, &quot;the GR7/9 is not an air defence aircraft&quot; (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-04-06.1722"><i>Official Report</i>, col. 1722</phrase>) and therefore would not provide air defence to the fleet.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">Air defence of the fleet is structured in a series of layers. These layers are currently provided by platforms such as Type 42 Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers armed with Sea Dart missiles. This capability will be gradually replaced by the new Type 45 Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers, equipped with the Principal Anti-Air Missile System, the first of which is already under construction. These systems will provide an appropriate level of air defence prior to Joint Combat Aircraft entering service (currently planned for 2012).</p>

Forty-five personnel have been identified as carrying out activities in which there may have been a significant risk of exposure to depleted uranium. At least 70 per cent of these have been reminded post-conflict of their eligibility for the tests, and around 40 per cent have undertaken a test. Efforts continue to be made to remind the remainder of this group about the tests.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.0/18">There has been no recorded degradation to UK military readiness; the systems affected by the LOVGATE virus did not have a direct impact on operational networks. Analysis of the incidents recorded indicates that over one-third involved standalone computers or training systems. The MoD system and network infrastructure is continually monitored with defence in depth at key points to prevent cross-infection.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.3/1">Ministers are in discussion with all of the main food industry sectors on salt reduction plans and arrangements to report progress on them. The consultation <i>Choosing Health? Choosing a Better Diet</i> asks for views on the role that industry can play in tackling salt, fat and sugar in the diet. The White Paper to be published in the summer will address these issues. The Food Standards Agency is also currently consulting on the promotion of foods to children.</p>
