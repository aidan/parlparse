	Afghanistan: Casualties

	<p pid="b.183.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.183.1/2" qnum="HL4520">What is their response to the statement by the Agency Co-ordinating Body for Afghan Relief (ACBAR) on 19 June that at least 230 civilian deaths have been caused by international and Afghan government forces since the start of 2007; which of the recommendations they accept; and what action they will take, unilaterally, through NATO and through liaison with Operation Enduring Freedom and Afghan military forces to ensure conformity with international humanitarian and human rights law and to protect civilian lives.</p>

	<p pid="b.183.2/1">All civilian casualties are a source of profound regret. Any loss of innocent lives is a tragedy. The UK joins the Agency Co-ordinating Body for Afghan Relief in condemning the actions of armed insurgents causing civilian casualties. The Taliban is responsible for the vast majority of civilian casualties, deliberately launching attacks from civilian locations such as schools and using suicide bombs and improvised explosive devices. The Taliban is quick to exaggerate and exploit any deaths caused by international forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/2">International forces, including UK forces, seek at all times to avoid loss of civilian life. The targeting process, weapons selection, doctrine, training and rules of engagement are all in line with international humanitarian and human rights law and the law of armed conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/3">The Afghan security forces operate alongside two international forces, the International Security Assistance Force and Operation Enduring Freedom. Co-ordination between these groups is therefore key and has been the subject of further work over recent weeks. We are satisfied that there are sensible, pragmatic command and control relationships between the forces and that these are reassessed regularly.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/4">All reports of civilian casualties are investigated promptly and thoroughly, in co-ordination with the Afghan authorities. Where the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan chooses to investigate an incident, it is entirely free to do so.</p>

The Environment Agency and the National Farmers' Union are currently considering options, including what greater use might be made of assurance scheme visits.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.0/2">The Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 require permit applications to be accompanied by the prescribed fee. The Environment Agency must seek to recover its full costs in accordance with HM Treasury guidance. The agency will review the costs when the majority of the applications have been assessed and the full extent of the work is known.</p>

	<p pid="b.187.5/1">The most relevant powers are those contained in Section 125 of the Finance Act 1990 and Section 174 of the Finance Act 2006. The UK's normal domestic information powers for the purposes of administering VAT and excises may also be used for the purposes of administrative co-operation with other EU member states in those fields, in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.</p>

	<p pid="b.187.8/1">A number of such safeguards exist. In particular, all requests must conform to the terms of the appropriate instrument governing exchange of information. There is no obligation on the UK authorities to carry out measures that would be at variance with the laws or administrative practice of either the United Kingdom or the overseas country or territory. There is no obligation to supply information that would be contrary to public policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.8/2">The UK authorities are not obliged to provide any information unless the overseas tax authority is bound by, or has undertaken to observe, rules of confidentiality with respect to the information which are not less strict than those applying to that information in the United Kingdom.</p>
