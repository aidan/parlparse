	<p pid="a.26.0/1">To date, the Government have made available a significant package of up to &pound;57 million to support areas affected by the flooding of June and July 2007. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/2">&pound;20 million in flood recovery grant for local authorities affected by the floods to support their work in helping those in greatest and most immediate need. Full details of the grant paid out to local authorities is available on the Communities and Local Government website at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/floodrecovery">www.communities.gov.uk/floodrecovery</a>;&pound;14 million for schools and children's services affected by the floods. Full details of the grants made to local authorities are set out in the table at the foot of this answer;&pound;10 million for repairs to the local highway with more to come for affected local authorities as claims are submitted;over &pound;11 million from regional development agencies for businesses affected in their regions. Regional development agencies continue to assess the needs of business in the affected regions and have adapted or expanded their support to meet such demand. Further information is available on the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) website <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/regional/regional-dev-agencies/flood-recovery/page40623.html">www.berr.gov.uk/regional/regional-dev-agencies/flood-recovery/page40623.html</a>;&pound;l million which can be drawn on as contingency reserve for use by JobCentre Plus to support additional demand for social fund community care grants. As of <phrase class="date" code="">5 October</phrase>, the Department for Work and Pensions had paid community care grants totalling &pound;695,000 to 1,225 people on qualifying benefits to meet the cost of replacing essential household items; and&pound;1 million to support rural tourism in England through promoting rural destinations and visitor attractions and a targeted marketing campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/3">This is additional money to that provided under the Bellwin scheme, which provides emergency financial assistance from government to local authorities, to help meet the uninsurable costs of immediate action to safeguard life or property or prevent severe inconvenience to inhabitants in the case of an emergency or disaster. In recognition of the exceptional nature of the recent flooding, we have made it easier for local authorities to claim back additional costs from government by significantly extending the period for which authorities can claim and increasing the proportion of costs they can receive in support grants to 100 per cent above threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/4">In addition, on <phrase class="date" code="">20 August</phrase> the UK Government lodged an application with the European Commission seeking support from the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) to help recovery from the floods. A decision might be expected towards the end of the year or early in 2008.</p>
