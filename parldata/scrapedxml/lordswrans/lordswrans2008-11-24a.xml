	<p pid="a.229.2/1">The department commissioned the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the University of Sheffield to produce an independent review of the effects of alcohol price, promotion, consumption and harm. The review has 2 phases:</p>
	<p pid="a.229.2/2">phase 1 systematically identified, appraised and synthesised international evidence on the relationship between alcohol price, promotion, consumption and harm. Summary of the first phase, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July</phrase>, found significant links between price and youth and heavy drinkers, but it has less of an impact on moderate and occasional drinkers; andphase 2 explored the potential impact of potential policy changes in this area, especially the population-based impact on health, crime and the wider economy for the population as a whole and also with a focus on young people under 18 who drink alcohol; 18 to 24 year-old hazardous drinkers; and harmful drinkers whose patterns of drinking damage their physical/mental health or cause substantial harm to others.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.2/3">Findings from the review are expected to be published this year and are intended to inform understanding of retail practices and whether they are linked to excessive drinking and whether government intervention, including controls on price and price-based promotions, is likely to be proportionate and have a significant beneficial impact.</p>

The decision to create a separate War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Chamber came about after the Armed Forces community raised serious concerns about the Government's initial proposal to transfer the PAT (E&amp;W) jurisdiction into the Social Entitlement Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.6/2">Following discussions with the Confederation of British Service and ex-Service Organisations (COBSEO) and other stakeholders, the Government were convinced that the best outcome for service and ex-service men and women was to establish a separate chamber. The Government believe this approach properly reflects the special nature of the relationship between service personnel and the Government and that the War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Chamber should therefore continue as a separate chamber within the First-tier Tribunal.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.2/1">It has been clear since the publication of MOJ's CSR07 settlement that the department and its constituent bodies, including HMCS, would have to reduce budgets. Work on implementing the efficiency savings plan for MOJ for 2008-09 is under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/2">We are currently developing the performance and efficiency plan for MOJ and its constituent bodies, including HMCS and TS, to cover 2009-10 and 2010-11. When that plan is agreed for 2009-10 and 2010-11, we will be in a position fully to understand the impact on HMCS and TS. However, our top priority remains running our courts effectively and efficiently, prioritising front-line services to court and tribunal users.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/3">We expect there to be a reduction in head count in parts of MOJ, but we anticipate that a large part of that will come from reductions in agency staff and contractors. Exact numbers will only be available once we have completed our planning exercise.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.5/1">Transforming the military, police and justice sectors into professional, competent and accountable institutions capable of delivering security and justice for Congolese citizens is a key priority. On security sector reform, the UK has focused its support on the police and justice systems. This included a &pound;9 million support package for elections security, of which &pound;4 million went to the UN Development Programme basket fund for training and equipping the police to provide security for the elections and &pound;5 million to the South African Police Service to provide a nationwide radio network for the police.</p>

Key areas of support include improving the basic living conditions of soldiers and their families in integrated brigades, delivering human rights training and supporting measures to ensure the delivery of pay (&pound;7,200,000 overall between 2006 and 2008). The Department for International Development has also supported key justice sector reforms providing both legislative and technical assistance. In the longer term, we have initiated the design of a five-year security sector accountability and police programme (&pound;80 million), which will be taken forward in partnership with Congolese stakeholders and international partners. We are working closely with Congolese stakeholders to take this programme forward and have agreed to put in place a high-level steering committee (including senior senate, national assembly and government representatives) to oversee implementation and act as a forum for high-level dialogue on key issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.5/22">Information on the expected maintenance time and downtime for other reasons is a commercial matter for the developers. However, for the purposes of our offshore wind capital grants scheme, all developers of round 1 demonstration projects are required to submit operations and maintenance reports for three consecutive years following commissioning of the wind farm. Each report details the efficiency and availability of the turbines, including information on downtime. There are currently four offshore wind farms in operation which have produced annual reports&mdash;North Hoyle, Scroby Sands, Kentish Flats and Barrow. Annual reports for the first operational year for the other offshore wind farms will be published in 2009. The reports can be found on the BERR publications website at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/publications/reports/index.html">www.berr.gov.uk/publications/reports/index.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.5/23">There are no formal requirements to publish this information for onshore wind farms.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-11-24a.239.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="239"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81124w0002.htm#81124w0002.htm_spmin12">
	<p pid="a.239.0/1">The Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 enables anyone to apply for a forced marriage protection order on behalf of a victim to protect them from forced marriage with the court's permission. The Act also enables the Lord Chancellor to make an order specifying a relevant third party (RTP) to make applications on behalf of a victim of forced marriage without the requirement to obtain the court's permission. It does not specify who should act as a relevant third party, when they should act or what safeguards might be needed for a victim of forced marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/2">Relevant third parties take on a significant responsibility for making an application on behalf of a victim of forced marriage in the absence of judicial scrutiny, so it is important that only appropriate and competent persons or organisations act. The Government therefore consulted to establish what need there was for relevant third parties, what type of people or organisations should act and what safeguards were needed. The response to this consultation was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-13">13 November 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/3">The response to consultation showed that generally respondents favoured local authorities as a relevant third party for both adults and children. There was also some support for voluntary sector organisations to act as relevant third party for adults, although no voluntary organisation nominated itself. Respondents recognised that the absence of a leave process could place a victim at significant risk of harm. Therefore, it was seen as important that safeguards were in place to ensure that the victim was protected from possible misuse and that the applicant always acted in the victim's best interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/4">The response outlined the Government's decision to specify local authorities as relevant third parties. This will complement the existing role that local authorities have to protect children and vulnerable adults and will ensure that all victims, no matter where they live, have access to a local relevant third party.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/5">The response also outlined the Government's view that local authorities should actively seek advice from and work with voluntary organisations where possible and that a multi-agency approach could be used to support the victim. This will help to ensure an integrated and holistic approach to providing support for victims and recognises the different and complementary types of support that the public sector and voluntary sector provide. As outlined in the response, the work to prepare local authorities to become a relevant third party will look at defining the role of the relevant third party, when it should act, establishing what knowledge it requires to make an informed judgment and look at existing systems of accountability to ensure that applications are made in the best interests of the victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/6">The Government recognise the role that the voluntary sector plays in supporting victims of forced marriage. The success of the independent domestic violence advisers (IDVAs) has shown how the voluntary sector can play a key role in a multi-agency-based response to domestic violence with the victim at the heart of the process. Most IDVAs currently operate in the criminal magistrates' court, where there are specialist domestic violence courts (SDVCs), and many already have expertise in dealing with issues like forced marriage and are experienced multi-agency workers. Their work is carried out in accordance with recognised national standards and an accredited training programme. Services are subject to a monitoring and evaluation process, along with other agencies in the SDVC partnership, but specifically those receiving funding from this department towards the IDVA service are required to submit annual data about their workload. The response therefore outlined that there will be a pilot using a local existing IDVA service as an RTP.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/7">Broadly, we anticipate that concurrent schemes will run to assess the effectiveness of local authorities and IDVA services to act as a relevant third party. Appropriate safeguards will be built in to the process for each agency. We estimate it will require nine to 12 months, working together across government and with local government and the voluntary sector, to ensure everyone involved has the necessary guidance and information to act appropriately and effectively as a relevant third party. In the mean time, we will monitor the use of the Act in court and use any emerging information to shape and develop the RTP pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/8">We intend to carry out a formal evaluation after a year of the provisions of the relevant third party coming into force. If this proves successful, we would look at extending the RTP provisions more widely across IDVAs as well as other voluntary sector organisations. There has been no decision taken as yet on which IDVA service will take part in the pilot scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/9">It is important to emphasise that, pending the development and operation of the pilot, it will be possible for anyone, including local authorities and IDVAs, to apply for a protection order on behalf of a victim if they obtain the court's permission. This will ensure that victims of forced marriage can obtain the protection of the court where they cannot apply for a forced marriage protection order themselves. The court's scrutiny of an application for permission to apply for an order will ensure that the victim's best interests are safeguarded.</p>

	<p pid="a.241.6/1">There are several systems in place to aid compliance with the code of practice on consultation. Consultation co-ordinators in departments work with policy officials to help them run consultations that are in line with the code. Officials in the Better Regulation Executive in BERR also work with departments on the development of many policies and are therefore often sighted on draft consultation documents where any potential deviations from the code might be spotted.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.6/2">Transparency also plays a significant role in aiding compliance. In accordance with the code (criterion 6.6), consultation documents cite the criteria of the code and give the contact details of the departmental consultation coordinator so that he or she can be contacted by anyone who feels that the exercise is not in line with the code. Moreover, departments are required, in the better regulation chapter of their annual reports, to describe their consultation activity over the year and the compliance of their consultation activities with the code.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.2/1">Each EU member state has the right to define its own healthcare arrangements. The healthcare concession in Valencia was an exception in Spain, and its withdrawal brings Valencia into line with the rest of Spain. The new arrangements are compliant with EU law.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/2">When withdrawal of free healthcare was announced in June 2008 by the Valencian authorities, our embassy in Madrid intervened to ensure British citizens did not suddenly find themselves without cover. As a result, existing arrangements were extended until <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-15">15 January 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/3">British citizens in receipt of a UK state pension or certain other benefits or who pay British or Spanish national insurance will not be affected by the change and will continue to have access to free state healthcare. The new, contributory Valencia scheme, due to come into effect in 2009, is open to all (including early retirees) and will accept individuals with pre-existing conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.11/3">The choice of transport is the responsibility of the contractor responsible for the removal of the material and is determined, in the first instance, by the location on site, the efficiency with which it can be removed, and, subject to arrangements between the contractor and the rail, road or water carrier concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.256.2/1">No instruction was issued to staff employed by the Identity and Passport Service or by their contractors, Siemens IT Solutions and Services Ltd, in the Belfast Passport Office that it was forbidden to wear a poppy. Reports in the media about this were inaccurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/2">It appears that these reports were connected to an incident in the work area of the contractor, Siemens IT Solutions and Services Ltd (SIS), which handles the receipt of passport applications and fees and creates the computer record of these. I understand that a member of its staff complained about a colleague who they believed was wearing a poppy disrespectfully. After taking advice from the Equality Commission, SIS management discussed the matter with the individuals concerned and believed that the matter was resolved at the time. At no time was the staff member told to remove her poppy.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/3">The Identity and Passport Service policy adheres to the Equality Commission's advice on the matter of flags and emblems in the work place, and ensures that this is reflected in practice across the organisation. The commission's advice is that the wearing of poppies by individuals in the workplace, in a respectful manner and within the appropriate period, should not be something which would cause offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/4">As part of the Home Office, the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) is committed to promoting equality, fairness and respect among its customers, staff and partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.2/5">The Home Secretary and James Hall the chief executive of IPS have received assurances from the chief executive of Siemens PLC that their policy and practice mirrors that of IPS; that is, that all their employees can wear or not wear a poppy as they choose.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.3/1">Equality of opportunity in employment makes business sense and is an economic necessity. The Government consider it to be an important issue and that is why on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-26">26 September</phrase> the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport invited the Cultural Diversity Network to set out proposals on how to move forward more effectively in the broadcasting industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/2">The Government have not made any assessments. The public service broadcasters are subject to obligations under the Communications Act and BBC Charter and Agreement to promote equality of opportunity in employment between men and women, for disabled people and between persons of different racial groups. This is a matter taken very seriously by the broadcasters, which monitor such matters closely. The obligations are enforceable by Ofcom or the BBC Trust as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/3">Separately, I understand that the Equality and Human Rights Commission has indicated that it intends to conduct assessments of the extent to which the BBC and Channel 4 have applied, among other things, equality duties to the development and implementation of their public functions. The terms of reference concerning the scope and nature of the assessments have yet to be determined.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/4">The UK Film Council and the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (PACT) published a study in 2004 on the problems faced by black and minority ethnic professionals in the film and television sectors about difficulties in developing their careers. In 2007 the UK Film Council published <I>Barriers to Diversity in Film</I>, which considered institutional barriers to recruitment in the film sector. The UK Film Council regularly monitors lottery applications and, with Skillset, monitors workforces in terms of equality issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/5">More generally, <I>Creative Britain</I>, which was published in February 2008, included a commitment that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will work with its non-departmental public bodies, and through them with its sectors, to agree actions to promote a more diverse workforce.</p>

	<p pid="a.272.9/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-10">10 November</phrase>, the General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed preparations for the EU-Russia summit, in particular proposals, including from the UK, to ensure that the resumption of negotiations on the successor to the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement was put in the proper context. Following the council, the presidency issued a declaration which made clear that negotiations would be taken forward in the light of an ongoing examination of relations between the EU and Russia. The declaration underlined that dialogue was the best means of defending the EU's interests, and that negotiations on the basis of the agreed EU mandate in no way legitimised the status quo in Georgia, nor Russian action contrary to the Union's values and principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.9/2">In a joint statement issued prior to the council, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary and the Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt expressed deep concern about Russia's actions and failure to withdraw to pre-<phrase class="date" code="2008-08-07">7 August</phrase> conflict positions and reiterated support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The UK/Swedish statement made clear that isolation was in no-one's interest but that the resumption of negotiations with Russia was not a return to business as usual, nor was the EU turning the page on the conflict in Georgia. The EU would stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations. The joint statement expressed confidence that this hard-headed approach would help maintain the unity of the Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.0/1">The Government believe that the exclusion of those appointed under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 who become Justices of the Supreme Court will have minimal impact on the House, as the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary play little active part in the work of the House while they sit full-time in the Appellate Committee. Retired members of the Supreme Court who are Members of the House will be able to resume sitting and voting in the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.3/1">Under current EU agreements, there is no scope for applying a reduced rate of VAT to repairs on buildings and the Government have therefore made no specific estimate of the potential costs or employment impacts of this. However, the Government keep all taxes under review and as part of this process broader estimates have been made of the wider application of reduced rates in the housing sector. Such estimates take into account a number of factors including: total relevant expenditure sourced from BERR's construction statistics annual; the estimated amount of spending already reduced rated; the price elasticity of demand; the expected rate of pass-on of the VAT rate cut; and the current size of the informal economy and its potential for reduction. The Government have noted the experiences of other member states in their experimental application of limited reduced rates to certain labour-intensive services, which the European Commission first evaluated in 2003 in Commission Staff Working Paper COM(2003)309.</p>

	<p pid="a.278.0/1">We have no plans to conduct a campaign as there is a risk that existing vehicle cab and door construction may not be designed to cope with the weight and wind loading created by fitting additional mirrors. This could lead to premature failure and liability claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/2">However, we understand that some of the existing mirrors on the passenger side of these earlier large goods vehicles may already comply with the field of view requirements for the new legislation.</p>
