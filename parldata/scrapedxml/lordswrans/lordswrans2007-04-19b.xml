The Chinese Government rejected the allegations when we raised the report at the UK-China human rights dialogue on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February</phrase>. The Chinese Government acknowledge the practice of organ harvesting from executed prisoners and introduced regulations on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase> to ban the sale of organs. We welcome the adoption of draft legislation in March which aims to give a firmer legal status to the July 2006 regulations and further tighten controls over organ transplants in China, as well as to encourage more members of the public to become donors.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.5/1">The EU had much to celebrate on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the treaties of Rome. The Berlin declaration is a political statement that celebrated the event, recalling the historic achievements of the last 50 years, and looking ahead to the challenges that we, the countries of the EU, need to face together. It was right that the event was marked in this way and that the UK was part of that celebration.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.5/2">The declaration identifies, for example, some of the future challenges facing the EU&mdash;climate change, energy security, poverty and global terrorism. We welcome this focus on areas of real relevance to the citizens of the EU and that are at the heart of the UK's priorities. Most recently, the spring European Council demonstrated the EU's capacity for leadership on the key issues of energy and climate change. These are issues on which we can only make progress by working with our European partners.</p>
