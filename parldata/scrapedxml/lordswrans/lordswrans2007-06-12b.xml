	<p pid="b.239.29/2">In conducting this review, a key objective has been to maintain and improve the quality of patient care. Given the volume of the responses to the consultation, the department has decided that it needs more time to analyse the information provided. Consequently, no changes will be implemented in July 2007 as proposed in the consultation documents.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.35/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Question asking whether the transfer of the Office for National Statistics to Newport will result in the terms and provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations being applied to any employees who do not accept the invitation to transfer; and, if not, what terms of compensation will apply to any staff declared redundant in the course of this relocation. [HL4166]</p>
	<p pid="b.239.35/4">As a result of ONS contribution to government relocation, we have committed to transferring up to 600 posts by April 2008 and 250 posts by April 2010 from London and the south-east to Newport. It is our intention that between 50 and 100 posts will remain in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.35/5">TUPE or the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations is a form of legislation designed to protect the terms and conditions of employment if an organisation, or services of that organisation, changes hands. This will not happen as part of the relocation of posts from London and therefore TUPE does not apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.35/6">However, employees who are unable to relocate to Newport will, where possible, transfer to other government departments or find alternative employment elsewhere in London. The office has a robust support programme in place to enable this transition. Where such solutions cannot be found, employees whose posts are redundant will be entitled to the Civil Service pension scheme terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.59/1">There are a number of ways in which the Government influence the practice of teachers and teaching assistants. Education legislation provides the context in which teachers and teaching assistants work and may make specific requirements of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.59/2">Other examples that relate specifically to influencing teachers' practice include: the school teachers' pay and conditions document which sets out the details of the teacher contract and professional standards which set out the standards teachers need to meet to progress in their careers. Examples in relation to the practice of teaching assistants include: regulations which set out the specific circumstances in which support staff, including teaching assistants, can carry out &quot;specified work&quot;; a set of professional standards against which teaching assistants and higher level teaching assistants can be assessed; and a variety of training support for teaching assistants, such as an induction programme and national vocational qualifications at levels 2 and 3. The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) working with the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group, the national strategies, and other specific initiatives promote good practice and provide guidance and training and development in various ways. Ofsted's judgments about teaching and learning also influence practice in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.59/3">A revised framework of professional standards for teachers will be introduced from September 2007 which sets out requirements about teachers' professional attributes, their professional knowledge and understanding and their professional skills at each career stage. They include, for example, that all teachers from induction onwards should have a good, up-to-date knowledge and understanding of a range of teaching, learning and behaviour management strategies and know how to adapt and use them. Having an awareness of relevant education research would be consistent with achieving this standard. The standards for Excellent Teachers and Advanced Skills Teachers also require teachers to draw on research outcomes and other sources of external evidence to inform their own practice and that of colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.59/4">The Government have given the TDA a remit for teachers' continuing professional development (CPD) that includes monitoring the quality and coverage of CPD and providing clear, high quality guidance to schools on CPD and giving leadership to local authorities. The TDA's latest advice to Ministers included proposals for a range of measures that will help schools to plan and evaluate CPD and quality assure CPD. The TDA is now taking its work forward with social partners.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.65/1">Following guidance issued to all posts on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-24">24 August 2006</phrase> our consulate-general in Hong Kong suspended the issue of five-year and 10-year multiple entry visit visas. This was in preparation for the introduction of a world-wide biometric identification process, designed to protect an individual's identity, facilitate future entry to the UK, combat visa fraud and abuse of the UK's immigration and asylum systems. The suspension was designed to limit the number of long-term, non-biometrically enabled visas which would have validity beyond the introduction of biometrics.</p>
