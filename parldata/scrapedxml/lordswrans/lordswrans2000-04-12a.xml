	<p pid="a.43.2/1">Diamorphine is controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and classified as a schedule 2 Controlled Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985. Accordingly there are strict controls over its prescription, requisition, storage, and supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/2">Department of Health guidance (Guidelines for the Safe and Secure Handling of Medicines, commonly known as &quot;the Duthie report&quot;) issued in 1988, recommends that a register of the receipt, supply and use of Schedule 2 Controlled Drugs is kept at ward level as good practice. More recently, the controls assurance initiative, launched by my honourable friend the Minister of State of Health, Mr Denham, in November 1999, sets out the &quot;organisational&quot; controls expected to be in place in hospitals across a range of areas. In March of this year, the National Health Service Executive issued a revised controls assurance standard to NHS hospitals--Safe and Secure Handling of Medicines (Medicines Management). This reflects the principles of the Duthie report and can be utilised by hospital personnel and independent auditors to check compliance with statutory, mandatory and best/good practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.9/1">Strain typing would not identify the nature of the presumed agent: it identifies the strain of TSE present. Scientists working in the field have concluded that there is one strain of BSE as identified by mouse bioassay and molecular typing of the prion protein. The link with vCJD was strengthened when it was shown that the molecular typing of vCJD was the same as BSE. The strain of BSE identified by mouse bioassay and PrP typing remains constant when animals other than cattle are infected with BSE. In addition, the lesion profile within the brains of cattle with natural BSE has been monitored in birth year cohorts starting with the 1992 cohort. The lesion profile in cattle has remained constant, indicating that only one strain is present.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">The Government have no immediate plans to lift this reservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/2">Incitement of racial hatred is an offence under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986. For the purposes of this offence &quot;racial hatred&quot; is defined as hatred against a group of persons in Great Britain defined by reference to colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. This means that the law does not cover all religious groups. The Government are listening to the concerns of minority faith communities about the issues of religious discrimination, and to the case for it to be made subject to the law. This issue raises many difficult, sensitive and complex questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/3">We have commissioned a team from the University of Derby to conduct research to assess the current scale and nature of religious discrimination. The results, due in autumn 2000, will help to inform our thinking about the appropriate response regarding religious discrimination and incitement of religious hatred. In the meantime, we intend to maintain the reservation.</p>
