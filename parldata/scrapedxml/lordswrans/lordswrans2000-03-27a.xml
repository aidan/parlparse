I am advised that the possibility of including the 200th anniversary of the creation of the United Kindom in the 2001 stamp programme was considered in early 1998--and research was conducted into the 200th anniversary of the Union Flag, the physical icon of the creation of the UK. The Post Office receives some 2,000 suggestions for over 300 subjects. Detailed research suggested there was no strong support for a stamp covering this anniversary. Only 10 subjects were chosen for the 2001 programme and the creation of the United Kingdom was not one of them. However, the entire Millennium stamp programme is a celebration of the United Kingdom past, present and future.</p>

The survey showed that overall 4.1 per cent of magistrates classified themselves as belonging to an ethnic minority community. There has, however, been an increasing percentage of appointments of people from ethnic minorities in recent years; in 1995, 6 per cent of those appointed were from an ethnic minority and last year the figure rose to 7.6 per cent. Figures for the total number of magistrates from ethnic minorities will be available later this year and I am confident that the percentage will show an increase over 1997.

It will speed up the recruitment of new officers; create more opportunities for local partnerships to tackle crime and disorder; provide further scientific and technological support to increase their effectiveness; and will develop and modernise the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/3">Crime Fighting Fund</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/4">3. The first deployment of resources from the &pound;91 million fund for modernising policing will be utilised to enhance the Crime Fighting Fund. Under the Crime Fighting Fund, police forces have been allocated their shares of the 5,000 additional recruits over the next three years. This programme will now be brought forward with the aim of delivering all 5,000 within two years. Doubling the number to be recruited during the coming financial year will cost in the region of &pound;11 million, above and beyond the &pound;35 million which has already been provided for the current allocation. A further significant portion of the new &pound;91 million funding will be used to assist the Metropolitan Police and other forces which are having particular difficulties with recruitment and retention, including the development of a national police recruiting campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/5">Partnerships</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/6">4. This new fund will also be an important contributor to strengthening the services which the police deliver, including cutting crime. In that context, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary will also want to look closely at the resources available to support the work with which the police are involved on local partnerships for tackling crime. In particular, he wants to look at the resources to deal with local problems of anti-social behaviour, to improve information sharing between partner agencies, and to provide more effective training in the development and implementation of local crime reduction strategies. One specific new development in this area is that Capital Modernisation Fund moneys will provide &pound;950,000 to Operation LION. This is a programme being piloted in London which will encourage the development of integrated strategies to reduce crime and improve community safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/7">Police--Science and Technology</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/8">5. The Capital Modernisation Fund will also boost the programme of work we already have in hand to roll out the latest and best in science and technology to the Police Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/9">6. We shall be applying &pound;40 million of new capital modernisation funding, together with &pound;6 million already set aside, to roll out a new suite of information technology applications to support police operations as part of the National Strategy for Police Information Systems. The new systems, one on case preparation, the other for custody suites, will reduce considerably the burden of paperwork and bureaucracy, releasing police manpower to their primary duties. These projects will also be at the heart of a network of information technology systems connecting the criminal justice system and improving the efficiency of the whole process.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/10">7. We are also using &pound;25 million of the capital modernisation funding to establish a new Government Technical Assistance Centre (GTAC). GTAC will enable us to respond to the threat to public safety from criminal use of encryption and will provide law enforcement agencies with the capability to derive intelligence and evidence from new information and communication technologies. It will make a difference between serious crime being prevented or punished and criminals going unpunished and free to continue their activities by providing techniques for lawful interception of modern multimedia communications. It will also improve facilities for deriving evidence from lawfully seized computer data.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/11">8. The programme to expand the national database of criminal DNA profiles which the Prime Minister announced last September will also start delivering on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April</phrase>. The capital modernisation funding includes &pound;14 million specifically for the DNA database, as part of the &pound;34 million envelope of funding for the DNA project which has already been announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/12">9. A further &pound;21 million has been allocated for the roll-out of equipment to police forces for the video recording of interviews with suspects. The full roll-out is subject to the evaluation of an initial pilot scheme and the necessary parliamentary legislation. But, in principle, video taping will offer the prospect of an end to disputes in court about what actually happened during police interviews and thus deliver fairer administration of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/13">10. Another significant project using the latest technology will receive funding to help the fight against property crime. &pound;4.5 million is being provided to develop the electronic &quot;chipping&quot; of goods. These electronic data tags will assist police officers or investigators in identifying and recovering stolen merchandise and be a powerful deterrent to would-be thieves, not only by increasing the risk of being caught but also making it more difficult for them to find purchasers of stolen merchandise.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/14">Modernising and Developing the Criminal Justice System</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/15">11. In addition to investing in science and technology for the police, the extra resources announced in the Budget will provide additional investment right across the criminal justice system. The aim is to help modernise the system as a whole and to deliver a more joined-up approach to tackling crime. It will also help to deliver the modern service that the public is entitled to expect from the criminal justice system. The new capital investment includes the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/16">12. Video links: &pound;5.3 million to allow the innovative use of video conferencing technology to allow vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give evidence remotely and also to allow defendants remanded in custody to take part in preliminary court hearings without leaving prison. This will build on the existing pilot schemes for video links between courts and prisons in Bristol and Manchester;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/17">13. Post-release hostels for prisoners after drug treatment: &pound;5 million to allow the establishment of post-release support for prisoners who have served sentences of up to a year and have drug misuse as well as housing problems. This will help in reducing reoffending by a group of high risk offenders;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/18">14. Restructuring the prison estate: an investment of &pound;40 million to modernise the prison estate. This will enable a start to be made on a programme to provide additional prison capacity. It will include creating additional capacity in existing prisons and, as a result of the success of home detention curfew, converting spare capacity in open prisons into closed conditions;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/19">15. Joining up criminal justice system information technology systems: &pound;1.48 million to provide a central resource for the Criminal Justice System Integrating Business and Information Systems (IBIS) initiative. This will be used to ensure that Criminal Justice Service and agency information technology systems are developed so as to allow interoperability between them. Interoperability will support the fast access to information to the key business areas in the criminal justice system, from preparing cases through the court process to serving sentences;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/20">16. Criminal Justice Units: &pound;5 million to enable the Crown Prosecution Service to invest in the infrastructure needed for new joint Crown Prosecution Service/police criminal justice units. These will lead to improved quality and timeliness of prosecution files, involve closer and better working relationships so as to eliminate the duplication of tasks, and will improve the handling of criminal justice casework and get it right first time; and</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/21">17. In addition to these projects, the Lord Chancellor will make an announcement next month about additional investment of &pound;23 million to modernise the Crown Court.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-03-27a.53.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000327/text/00327w03.htm#00327w03_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.53.0/1">At present, the National Health Service contribution to hospices is about 31 per cent or a third of their running costs. Specifying centrally what the proportion of NHS funding should be is not sensible, given the extent of local diversity both of services provided and alternative sources of local support. Therefore issues concerning the financial support for hospices are for local discussion and agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">The Health Improvement Programme (HimP) is and will continue to be the funding mechanism for palliative care services. Further HimPs will be set in the context of the priorities set in the National Priorities Guidance and Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation, and will support the implementaion of National Service Frameworks at local level. These frameworks, together with the recommendations contained within Calman/Hine for cancer services, set out the way in which palliative care is addressed in each area as part of the Health Improvement Programme process. Voluntary healthcare providers are viewed as important players in the planning and provision of services and should be involved in this. From this should flow more detailed plans for commissioning services, which will include arrangements for palliative care and the funding to be made available, giving hospices some long-term financial stability.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/3">Health Improvement Programmes for the period April 2000 to March 2003 are due to be agreed and published by local health communities by the end of March 2000. It is too early to tell how many of these will address the need for hospice and palliative care. It is vital that all stakeholders are offered the opportunity to engage in the HimP process and influence strategy. Regional offices of the NHS Executive will monitor this process to ensure that all are actively contributing.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/4">Health Service Circular 1998/99 stated that commissioners, including primary health care groups, need to work together with providers to develop a palliative care strategy which is right for their population based on health needs assessment. From the recent national survey of palliative care provision we know that at present about 50 per cent of health authorities have developed strategies for palliative care. We believe that a more comprehensive strategy is needed. This is currently being worked on within the wider cancer strategy and encompasses the Supportive Care Strategy, being developed by Professor Mike Richards, which has palliative care as one of the key components. Together these will lay the foundation for a tightly managed implementation programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/5">An essential part of the Supportive Care Strategy is to develop standards and performance indicators for palliative care. This work is being taken forward as part of a quality improvement framework for cancer services and is being developed with the National Council for Hospices and Specialist Palliative Care Services. The standards and performance indicators will be piloted within a number of health authorities/regions over the coming months and will be rolled out nationally in April 2001. We are currently looking at what data items need to be collected to measure access and to develop a project plan for quality measurement of palliative care services. The Commission for Health Improvement will be the champion of high quality standards through a rolling programme of visits to NHS trusts and will also act as a &quot;trouble-shooter&quot; where necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">Although the possibility of person to person transmission of any theoretical Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy infectivity through the use of surgical instruments cannot be ruled out, the National CJD Surveillance Unit, as they investigate cases of CJD, undertake an examination of medical histories to look for common risk factors. Analyses of cases to date do not provide evidence to suggest any increased risk with past dental surgical intervention. Nonetheless, guidance has been formulated on appropriate prudent practice, which is available from the BDA, and which takes into account advice from the Joint Working Group of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens. In addition, a Health Service Circular on best practice on decontamination of medical devices was issued in August 1999 to healthcare organisations, including Dental Postgraduate Deans and Regional Dental Advisors.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.5/1">We are unable to comment on the accuracy of the reporting of any statement by Professor Griffiths. However the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust has advised that Caesarean section itself is considered to be low risk surgery for transmission. The Government agree with advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee that rigorous washing, decontamination and general hygiene practices with regard to surgical instruments are key measures in minimising the risk of any infection being transferred from patient to patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/2">To date, there is no known case of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease having arisen as a consequence of medical or surgical intervention.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">There is strong epidemiological evidence to suggest that classic Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (CJD) is not transmitted through blood. Donors who have received blood or blood products from people who subsequently developed classic CJD are therefore not barred from giving blood. However, there is far less knowledge about the routes of transmission of variant CJD and, as a precautionary measure, no blood from donors who received blood from people who subsequently developed variant CJD enters the blood supply. As an additional precaution against the theoretical risk that variant CJD may be transmitted through blood, all blood taken from United Kingdom donors is leucodepleted (the white cells are removed) and all blood products are made with plasma sourced from outside the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.5/1">The construction of village halls used for charitable purposes is already zero-rated for VAT. During the Review of Charity Taxation, many charities sought more VAT relief, including compensation for the irrecoverable VAT on their purchases. The Government made it clear in the consultation document issued in March 1999 that this was unacceptable on the grounds of both principle and cost. The Chancellor's Budget gave tax reliefs to charities worth &pound;400 million a year.</p>
