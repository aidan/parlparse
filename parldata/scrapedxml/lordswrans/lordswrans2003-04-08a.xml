He indicated that the United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) human-centred reproductive health programme, in which birth targets and quotas have been abolished, would be expanded beyond the 32 counties included in UNFPA's current programme.

	<p pid="a.19.8/1">Existing legislation in Northern Ireland allows a measure of rate relief on any hall where the wider community uses the facilities. Typically uses such as Sunday schools, community based youth clubs, OAP clubs, playgroups and church meetings are considered &quot;charitable&quot; and apportioned out as exempt. The degree of relief available is in direct proportion to the use of the facility for charitable and broad community purposes. There is no upper limit on the amount of relief available if the relevant criteria are satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.8/2">The position in relation to GAA premises, and indeed other sports clubs such as soccer, cricket, rugby etc, is different, as relief for certain properties used for recreation is available under Article 31 of the Rates (Northern Ireland) Order 1977. A reduction of 65 per cent of rates liability is allowed in respect of all, or part, of properties used for purposes of a recreation, specified by the Department of Finance and Personnel. The property has to be occupied by a club or society that is not established or conducted for profit and, broadly speaking, does not employ professional players.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.8/3">The review of rating policy launched by the Executive in 2000 is reaching its final stages and I can confirm that existing reliefs including sport and recreational relief and that which allows exemption from rates for properties used for public, charitable and certain other functions such as &quot;public religious worship&quot; are currently under consideration. No decisions have yet been taken. It is intended that these issues will be addressed in a policy paper to be published later in the year. bern</p>

	<p pid="a.24.8/1">Further to the announcement made by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="">2 April</phrase> in another place, we can now set out the way in which we intend to implement a service to allow families to send packets free of charge to troops deployed in the Gulf. This service will be limited to letters and packets of up to 2kg in weight and will be implemented when the operational situation allows. The priority at this time must remain the operational requirements of our service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.8/2">The system will allow families to send addressed letters and packets to individuals serving in the Gulf through Post Office Counters free of charge. The Royal Mail Group will transport these parcels to British Forces Post Office (BFPO) at Mill Hill. BFPO will arrange onward transportation to the Gulf and distribution in theatre. Mechanisms are being put in place to handle the anticipated increase in mail. Further details will be announced nearer the time when we are ready to implement the new procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.8/3">For the free service to work for the benefit of all, we would ask families to restrict the number of packets they send in order that the system does not become overwhelmed, thus creating delays in delivery of mail.John B</p>
	<p pid="a.24.8/4">This scheme is aimed only at those closest to the service personnel who are serving in this operation. We will not be providing a service for packages which do not have a named recipient. This will help to ensure that the new scheme for letters and packets is well targeted without overloading the logistics support network and delaying vital messages and packages from loved ones. For those who might wish to show more general support for our troops, we would encourage contributions to the UK Forces Gulf Fund (details available at <a href="http://www.ukforcesgulffund.org">www.ukforcesgulffund.org</a> and 0800 107 0200) which has recently been set up to allow the public to support those injured as a result of their deployment in support of military operations in the Gulf and the families and dependants of those who have been killed.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">I regret the reply on children in care I gave on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase> (WA 107&ndash;8) was incorrect. It should have read as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/2">The Department of Health's public service agreement (PSA), published July 2002, included a commitment to review the target on the education of children in care in light of the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) project on that subject. Work on the SEU project is nearing completion and we are now in a position to announce the new target, which is to improve life chances for children, including by substantially narrowing the gap between the educational attainment and participation of children in care and that of their peers by 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/3">This target will have been achieved if by 2006: outcomes for 11 year-olds in English and maths are at least 60 per cent as good as those of their peers; the proportion who become disengaged from education is reduced so that no more than 10 per cent reach school-leaving age without having sat a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) equivalent exam; and the proportion of those aged 16 who get qualifications equivalent to five GCSEs graded A*-C has risen on average by 4 percentage points each year since 2002; and in all authorities at least 15 per cent of young people in care achieve this level of qualifications. John B</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/4">The elements of the PSA target relating to the level of education, training and employment outcomes for care leavers aged 19, the proportion of children in care who are cautioned or convicted and the under-18 conception rate remain unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/5">In developing the target we have been keen to encourage action to support attainment by all children in care. This includes younger children, those who are able to and have the potential to achieve at a high level and those with difficulties who need support to remain engaged with education at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/6">We therefore welcome the SEU's proposal that as part of the existing planning process individual education targets should be set for all children in care and local authorities should monitor both the appropriateness and the achievement of these targets. We will be consulting stakeholders on how best to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/7">In order that the target reflects the influence of the care system on attainment, it will apply only to children who have been in care for one year or more. Nonetheless, we believe that promoting the attainment of children who spend a shorter time in care is important. We have therefore agreed with the Secretary of State for Education and Skills that he will put in place arrangements to analyse data from the Pupil Level Annual School Census in order to improve our understanding of outcomes for those young people who have spent any time in care. The results of this analysis will be used to inform the development of future policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">Following changes made to the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill, my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Local Government, the Regions and Fire is writing today to all Members in the English regions outside London to follow up his earlier letter about the soundings exercise on the level of interest in holding a referendum about establishing an elected regional assembly. Voters in two-tier local authority areas will now have a say about the form of unitary local government relating to their area that would be introduced if an elected assembly is established.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/2">Those who have already responded to this exercise are also being contacted again. In both cases, we are making it clear that we will consider further evidence or comments if people's views have changed in light of the amendments. We do not expect this to cause many people to change their minds about their response to the soundings exercise, but if people have changed their minds we would be happy to receive further views, information and evidence on this matter. If their response remains the same, they do not need to take any action; their original response will be considered as before. Additionally, any individual or organisation who did not previously submit comments but now wishes to put forward views, information or evidence on the level of interest in a referendum can do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/3">Copies of the revised pro forma have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. They are also available from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website via <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a>. Responses to this additional phase of the soundings exercise are requested by <phrase class="date" code="">16 May</phrase>, since the Secretary of State is likely to take his decision shortly after that. bjc</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">This Government are already taking a number of steps to address the needs and risks associated with young people who sexually abuse. The Home Office-sponsored Youth Justice Board issued in November effective practice guidance to youth offending teams to help to ensure that current work with young sexual abusers is as effective as possible. We are also funding a study into the characteristics of children and young people who sexually abuse. This is due to report in December 2005. In addition, we have established a two-year pilot developing assessment tools and programmes in three juvenile establishments for 15 to 21 year olds; and the Youth Justice Board is currently mapping services for young sexual abusers nationwide in conjunction with the National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. This is due to report in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2">The Home Office and Youth Justice Board have also set up an interdepartmental working group with the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills to look at the whole issue of young people who sexually abuse.

Such arrangements are appropriate to existing and anticipated threat levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/2">These major emergency information procedures are separate from the National Attack Warning System (which my right honourable friend Lord Macdonald of Tradeston described on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-12">12 March</phrase>). This system is maintained by the Government for use in general war to alert the public. However, plans also provide for a considerable amount of public education material to be produced in the period of tension which would precede the need to invoke use of the system. This would ensure that no members of the public were disadvantaged by disability or language needs. John B</p>

	<p pid="a.34.2/1">The European Union is continuing to make progress on the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The detailed arrangements inplementing the Berlin plus agreement for the EU to make use of NATO assets and capabilities were recently agreed. This agreement has enabled the EU to launch the first military ESDP operation in Macedonia. Differences over Iraq have not prevented, and need not prevent, European nations working constructively together to achieve shared objectives in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and ESDP.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.5/1">The military action against Saddam Hussein's regime has seen various levels of support by a broad coalition of over 40 countries. Some 20 countries are providing, or have offered, military forces to the coalition and supporting activity. Some other nations are providing logistical support. It is for the individual countries concerned to decide if they wish to declare publicly the nature of their involvement. The UK's overall objective for the military campaign is to create the conditions in which Iraq disarms in accordance with its obligations under UNSCRs and remains so disarmed in the long-term. bjc</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/1">The White Paper Your Region, Your Choice [Cm 5511] sets out the functions that elected regional assemblies will have in chapter 4. The policy areas of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are addressed in paragraphs 4.49&ndash;4.53. Rural policy</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/2">4.49 The Government's aim is to sustain and enhance the distinctive environment, economy and social fabric of the English countryside for the benefit of everyone. In order to ensure this aim is met, all major policies are assessed for their rural impact. It will be important to ensure that elected regional assemblies &quot;rural proof&quot; their activities fully to take the rural dimension into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/3">4.50 An elected assembly will:</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/4" class="indent">be responsible for delivering rural regeneration programmes (including the Market Towns Initiative);</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/5" class="indent">actively engage with the regional rural affairs forum;</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/6" class="indent">be the lead partner in implementing the regional elements of the England Rural Development Programme, through involvement in the regional programming groups which monitor and influence delivery by the Rural Development Service (the specific details of this role might be expanded once proposals come forward for a successor programme in 2006); and</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/7" class="indent">have a responsibility to ensure that countryside, landscape, recreation and rural issues are addressed in other regional strategies, for example through regional planning guidance and regional cultural strategies. Environment</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/8">4.51 The Government's aim is to protect and improve the environment and to integrate the environment with other policies across all levels of governance within the UK and in international fora. Effective protection of the environment requires activity on many wide-ranging fronts&mdash;for example, from acting to limit global environmental threats (such as climate change) to safeguarding individuals from the effects of poor air quality or toxic chemicals.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/9">4.52 An elected assembly will:</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/10" class="indent">make appointments to the Environment Agency's regional committee;</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/11" class="indent">prepare and implement a regional strategy for biodiversity in conjunction with other relevant regional strategies;</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/13" class="indent">be consulted by the Environment Agency, Countryside Agency, English Nature and other relevant public bodies on their strategies, and consult them in turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/14">4.53 Defra has undertaken a major consultation on flood defence arrangements. That consultation canvasses opinions on a regional role in flood defence responsibilities, taking into account the proposed establishment of elected regional assemblies. The findings of this consultation exercise will be considered as part of the Government's ongoing process of decentralising relevant responsibilities to elected assemblies.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/15">The Government recently concluded from the Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review that the responsibility for flood and coastal defence funding should not be passed to the future elected regional assemblies. But the Government announced that the new approach to flood and coastal defence funding will be subject to review after three years of operation, taking account of the Government's regional agenda among other factors.</p>
