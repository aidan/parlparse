	<p pid="a.86.11/1">The shelf life of small arms ammunition varies and is dependent on the stability of the energetic (explosive) components it contains. Stability is affected by a number of factors including the environment in which the ammunition is stored and transported, the terrain across which it is transported, the vibration to which it is subjected and the extremes of temperature to which it is exposed. Small arms ammunition deployed on operations has a shelf life of up to six months. Stocks held in conditioned (environmentally controlled) storage generally have a shelf life of five to 10 years, which can be extended provided the ammunition remains safe and suitable for service. This is demonstrated through a rigorous in-service surveillance programme.</p>

The bank, which will be independent of government, will act as a wholesale bank and will thus invest in providers via products developed by financial intermediaries. Some of the bank's functions will be in place by April 2011 and we expect the first investments to be made by mid-2011. The bank will be capitalised with around &#163;400 million from dormant accounts as well as a &#163;200 million injection from the largest UK banks.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.5/1">Local authorities have a statutory duty-under Section 7 of the Childcare Act-to secure nursery places free of charge, effectively prohibiting top-up fees. This ensures that there are no barriers to accessing the benefits of nursery education for all children, but particularly the most disadvantaged. Parents are free to purchase additional hours and services outside the hours for which providers receive funding from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/2">The issue of top-up fees was debated (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/.212"><I>Official Report</I>, col. 212</phrase>) by the Committee considering the Education Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-08">Tuesday 8 March</phrase> when the Minister of State for Schools confirmed the existing position that top-up fees are not allowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/3">The Government are listening to the views of early years providers and their representative bodies concerning funding. In response we are seeking to improve the efficiency with which funding is distributed to providers, through the early years single funding formula, as well as through reducing bureaucratic burdens on providers who deliver free nursery education. Many providers will also be benefiting from other support that local authorities provide for early learning and care and providers will want to take into account this whole package of support before deciding whether delivering free places fits with their business model. Providers around the country are offering an excellent service to parents and their children within existing funding levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.6/1">The coalition is committed to introducing measures to increase energy from waste through anaerobic digestion (AD). Our policy is focused on the use of waste to reduce the amount going to landfill, and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from methane: capturing the biogas from one tonne of food waste will save up to 1 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. We also recognise the part AD can play in tackling energy poverty in rural areas where it may not be cost effective to connect to the gas grid. The Government are currently working with industry to draw up a joint programme of work to tackle the barriers to deployment of AD. This will be published in May 2011. We have already taken action to encourage AD by grandfathering support under the renewables obligation. This provides the certainty that investors are looking for. We are also looking at the feed-in tariffs scheme to see if the tariff rates are enough to make farm-based AD worth while. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-10">10 March</phrase> we announced details of the renewable heat incentive which will support AD plants below 200 kWth.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.8/1">The Retail Distribution Review (RDR) is an initiative of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), an independent body, and as such it is responsible for considering the impacts of the RDR.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.8/2">The FSA published an assessment of the impact of the RDR that it commissioned from Oxera, <I>Retail Distribution Review P</I><I>roposals: Impact on </I><I>M</I><I>arket </I><I>Structure and C</I><I>ompetition</I>, in March 2010. The report considers the impact of the RDR on the price of both advice services and products following the RDR, suggesting that there is a risk of higher product prices in the short term but that in the longer term these higher prices may be competed away.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.8/3">Firms offering investment advice will be able to set their own charges, subject to their duties to act in accordance with the best interests of their clients. The FSA's new rules, which come into force at the end of 2012, require firms that give investment advice to determine and use appropriate charging structures. The FSA will be requiring firms that give advice to take their own decisions about how to price their services, rather than product providers determining how much adviser firms are paid.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.2/1">It would in our view be very difficult to design a research study of a population- based intervention such as fluoridation to meet the level &quot;A&quot; criteria set in the York review. For example, it would be neither ethical nor practical to prevent people in the experimental (fluoridated) area using fluoride toothpaste, which would be an obvious confounding factor. Accordingly we consider we are justified in citing the finding of retrospective cross-sectional studies and epidemiological surveys as evidence of the effects of fluoridation. No persuasive alternative explanations have been offered as to why levels of tooth decay among children in the West Midlands, where the water is fluoridated, are less than half that experienced by children in Greater Manchester where no adjustment is made to the level of fluoride in the water. At a more local level, the 2007-08 National Health Service dental survey of five year-olds shows that children in fluoridated Mansfield had an average of 0.56 decayed, missing and filled teeth compared to a figure of 1.73 in nearby Nottingham where no adjustment is made to the water.</p>

We will shortly be meeting with industry to determine what should be included in the review and no decisions have been made as yet.</p>
