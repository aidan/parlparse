	<p pid="a.215.0/2">We are committed to creating more and better quality apprenticeships for both young people and adults as an important route to skilled and secure employment. Changing demographics and the need to maintain and improve skill levels in the workforce means that it is vital that we continue to invest in the existing workforce, as well as training the next generation. Our decision to redeploy &#163;150 million to create 50,000 new adult apprenticeship places demonstrates our commitment to high-quality, employer-led skills for older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/3">Since the removal of the upper age limit, the adult apprenticeship programme has seen tremendous growth. There was so great a demand for adult places that supply was not able to meet demand and numbers of places were capped. Demand from employers for adult apprenticeships remains very high and adult numbers continue to increase. Our decision will mean that many more older learners are able to benefit from the opportunities offered by high-quality apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/4">167,000 adult apprenticeship starts are currently planned in the 2010-11 academic year. Plans for adult apprenticeships for 2011-12 will be confirmed in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.3/2">The guidance requires that all persons who are detained be asked whether they wish to contact their high commission or consulate. Those who wish to are given the means to do so. Where a person is likely to be detained beyond 24 hours he is required to be asked if he wishes his high commission or consulate to be notified on his behalf.</p>
