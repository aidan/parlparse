	<p pid="a.427.8/1">One hundred and two maintainers were required to support the eight Tornado GR4 aircraft deployed on Operation Herrick between June 2009 and August 2010. In August 2010, the number of GR4 aircraft deployed on Operation Herrick increased to 10, with a resulting increase in the number of maintainers from 102 to 122. The number of GR4 aircraft is planned to reduce to eight by the end of November. Eighty-six maintainers were required to support the eight Harrier aircraft deployed on Operation Herrick between September 2005 and July 2009. In July 2009, the UK withdrew its Harrier aircraft from Afghanistan. In addition, GR4 aircraft in Afghanistan are currently providing approximately 12 per cent more flying hours per aircraft per month than were provided by the Harriers, which makes a like-for-like comparison between numbers of maintainers required by the two aircraft types difficult.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.0/1">Sodium thiopental is a medicine and its primary use is as an anaesthetic. It is not subject to export control as it does not appear on the EU or UK strategic control lists and does not appear in the annexes to the EU Council Regulation 1236/2005 (the so-called torture regulation). There is no suggestion at present that a UK company has acted unlawfully in this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/2">In 2008 we made a commitment to seek an EU-wide end-use control on equipment which could be used for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Following a resolution of the European Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-17">17 June 2010</phrase> the Commission has indicated that it will bring forward a proposal to amend the torture regulation by the end of this year. However, end-use controls only work on the basis of prior knowledge of the ultimate end-use of a specific export. In this case the Government did not have any prior knowledge of the end-use, and the manufacturer of the drug has stated that it does not have information on the specific end-users either. It is therefore unlikely that we could have prevented its export under an end-use control.</p>

This will help to address the issues that underlie the UK's relatively weak productivity and help to get more people back to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.437.8/1">The announcements made in the spending review recognise that science and research are critical to long-term economic growth. Despite pressure on public spending, funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms at &#163;4.6 billion per annum, ring-fenced for the four years of the spending review. In the coming months, decisions on broad allocations will be made between research councils, HEFCE and the national academies. I cannot pre-empt future decisions on these allocations.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.8/2">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is one of the main agencies through which the Government support medical and clinical research, including diabetes research. The MRC is a non-departmental public body which receives its grant-in-aid from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In keeping with the Haldane principle, prioritisation of an individual research council's spending within its allocation is not a decision for Ministers. The MRC will make decisions on its priorities once its allocation is clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.8/3">The MRC funds a broad portfolio of diabetes research amounting to &#163;28.1 million in 2008-09 and supports underpinning research which aims to improve understanding, prevention and treatment. Examples of recent MRC activities relating to diabetes research include the renewal of funding for the MRC epidemiology unit in Cambridge. Research at the unit includes the study of the genetic, developmental and environmental determinants of obesity, type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders and contributes to the prevention of these disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.8/4">The MRC is also working with the Indian Council of Medical Research on a joint initiative to support collaborative research on chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, COPD and diabetes.

	<p pid="a.442.2/1">Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Commission for Human Medicines (CHM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme; the yellow card scheme. Approximately 25,000 reports of ADRs are reported to the MHRA/CHM through this scheme each year. The scheme collects ADR reports from across the whole United Kingdom and includes all medicines, including those from prescriptions, over-the-counter or general retail sales. Reports are also received for herbal medicines and other unlicensed medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.2/2">During the time period <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-28">28 October 2010</phrase>, the MHRA has received a total of 101 UK spontaneous suspected ADR reports associated with the drug substances dimeticone, malathion, phenothrin, permethrin, triethanolamine and carbaryl which are medicinal products for use in the treatment of head lice. It should be noted that these medicines are parasiticidal preparations and are therefore also used for the treatment of other conditions including scabies and crab lice. Information on the indication for use of a medicine is not always provided by the reporter on the original yellow card. Furthermore information on how the medicine was obtained such as by prescription or over-the-counter from pharmacies is not held on our ADR database.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.2/3">It is important to note that a report of an adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease being treated.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.2/4">Products for treatment of head lice are also licensed as medical devices according to their mechanism of action. Adverse incident reports for medical devices are received from healthcare professionals and members of the public. A search of the adverse incident database over the time period <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-28">28 October 2010</phrase> identified 12 adverse incident reports associated with head lice treatments. Many of these head lice treatments are available over-the-counter at pharmacies. It is not possible to identify from these 12 adverse incident reports if they were prescribed by the National Health Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.443.6/1">Over recent years, the Department for International Development (DfID) has increased its aid to fragile and conflict-affected countries. Addressing conflict and fragility is crucial to the success of the UK's development efforts and DfID is committed to expanding its support still further.

	<p pid="a.445.2/1">All prisoners whose mental illness meets the criteria for detention under Sections 47 or 48 of the Mental Health Act 1983 are transferred to National Health Service secure services. In 2009-10, just over 1,200 prison transfers were completed*. This number has remained relatively stable for the past five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.2/2">The Government committed in their spending review to look at options to invest in mental health liaison services at police stations and courts. These services intervene at an earlier stage to divert offenders with mental health problems away from the justice system and into appropriate treatment, either as an in-patient or in the community. Officials are working via the cross-government health and criminal justice programme to take this forward, including a detailed assessment of the outcomes and potential costs of such services.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.2/3">Funding and commissioning responsibility for prison healthcare has been fully devolved to NHS primary care trusts since 2006 and forms part of core NHS funding. As with other NHS allocations, these funds are subject to local commissioning and service provision. Since 2007-08, an additional &#163;4.2 million has been invested annually in the further development of mental health services within local HM Prison Service (HMPS) establishments, with &#163;1.5 million of this for tier 3 child and adolescent mental health services within the HMPS young people estate. The department does not hold information on the cost of in-patient treatment for prisoners. However, reference costs indicate that an NHS medium secure bed costs &#163;481 per day. The majority of transfers are to medium secure care.</p>

We are also cutting the small business profits rate and will be waiving national insurance contributions for new businesses in most areas of the country.
