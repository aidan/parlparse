	<p pid="a.149.1/1" qnum="HL8375">To ask Her Majesty's Government what is their current estimate of how many people do not claim benefits to which they are entitled; what is the value of unclaimed benefits in total and by benefit per year; and what steps they are taking to reduce the number of people not claiming benefits to which they are entitled.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-05-03a.149.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100992" speakername="Lord Freud" colon=":" colnum="149"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110503w0001.htm#1105034000003">
	<p pid="a.149.2/1">The latest estimates of the numbers entitled to but not receiving income-related benefits and of the amounts of unclaimed income-related benefits are published in the report <I>Income Related Benefits</I><I>:</I><I> Estimates of Take-Up in 2008-09</I>. The take-up report is available online at <a href="http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?page=irb_2">http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?page=irb_2</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/2">For the six income-related benefits for which estimates are available there was between &#163;6.930 billion and &#163;12.700 billion left unclaimed in 2008-09; this compared to &#163;38.110 billion that was claimed and represents take-up by expenditure of between about 75 per cent and 85 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/3">We want to make sure that everyone is getting all of the help that they are entitled to which is why the department makes information available in various locations including doctors' surgeries, welfare rights groups and Jobcentre Plus offices to ensure that people are aware of the benefits to which they may be entitled and how to claim them. Information on benefits is also available on the department's website at <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/index.htm">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/4">For pensioner benefits the Pension Disability and Carers Service (PDCS) is working collaboratively at a local level with partner organisations to engage pensioners in a way that is familiar to them. In addition it has developed a free pension credit toolkit providing information guides and templates for people who work with vulnerable pensioners to encourage them to promote pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/5">It also targets activity on engaging with people who may be eligible to encourage them to claim. For example, when a customer makes a claim to state pension or reports a change in their circumstances, a customer adviser will discuss a pension credit application with those who may be entitled.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/6">A modest research study is also being conducted to help build the evidence base on how the information that we routinely collect can be used more effectively to ensure pensioners get the help that is available through pension credit. This study is a first step in seeing if this type of approach might be possible in the longer term. Initial findings of the study are expected later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/7">Finally with the introduction of universal credit from October 2013, which will provide a new single system of means-tested support for people of working age in and out of work, people will be better placed to find out what benefits they can get.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.2/31">Winter fuel payments are paid to most people who have reached state pension age for women. They provide assurance to older people that they can keep warm during the colder winter months because they know they will receive significant help with their fuel bills.</p>

It is also subject to the particular area of English law known as ecclesiastical law. In addition to canon law, this consists of common law and statute law and of subordinate legislation made under various statutory powers. The statutes in question are either Acts of Parliament or Measures passed by the General Synod and its predecessor the Church Assembly under devolved legislative powers, the exercise of which is subject to the approval of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.0/1">Eligibility for feed-in tariffs (FITs) is defined through the Feed-in Tariffs (Specified Maximum Capacity and Functions) Order 2010; and associated modifications to the standard conditions of electricity supply licences made by the Secretary of State under Section 42(3) of the Energy Act 2008. Application of these, which include the definition of &quot;site&quot; and the process for accrediting installations for FITs, is the responsibility of electricity suppliers and Ofgem.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/2">There is currently no pre-accreditation process within the FITs scheme which means that Ofgem cannot accredit an installation, and provide confirmation of its eligibility for FITs, until the installation is fully commissioned.</p>
