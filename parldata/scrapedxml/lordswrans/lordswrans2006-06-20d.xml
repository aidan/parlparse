	<p pid="d.68.5/1">The cost of doubling the adult basic personal allowances (ignoring all premiums) in income support and jobseeker's allowance would be around &pound;15 billion in the next financial year (2007&ndash;08).

The cost is borne across income support, jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>

HMRC officials understand from lawyers practising in family law, with extensive experience of handling divorce and the related issues, that trusts are very seldom used in modern divorce settlements, and are far from standard practice&mdash;other mechanisms are typically used to divide up matrimonial property. The provisions made by Schedule 20 for vulnerable and disabled people are in line with other provisions for the income tax and capital gains tax treatment of trusts. Those arrangements were arrived at following extensive consultation with interested groups.</p>

	<p pid="d.73.3/1">In September 2005 the joint Forced Marriage Unit of the Home Office and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) launched a consultation on whether to create a specific criminal offence of forcing someone into marriage. A summary of the responses to that consultation was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June 2006</phrase> in <i>A Wrong Not a Right</i>. The full text of the document can be found on the FCO website at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/KFile/05062006%20Final%20FM%20Report%20NJA.pdf">www.fco.gov.uk/Files/KFile/05062006%20Final%20FM%20Report%20NJA.pdf</a>. A copy of the report will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.3/2">Respondents feared that legislation would drive the problem further underground and increase the risk of forced marriage victims being taken overseas and held there.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.3/3">We have not ruled out the possibility of developing new legislation on forced marriage in the future but believe that a specific offence should be created only if there are gaps in existing legislation that cannot be filled. However, to tackle the issue more effectively, several recommendations for non-legislative activity will be taken forward. First, we will increase the level of training for professionals in this field. Secondly, we will increase the work done with statutory agencies in sharing best practice and implementing guidelines for dealing with cases of forced marriage. Thirdly, we will ensure that existing legislation is fully implemented, including making better use of civil remedies and the family courts. Many existing criminal offences may be committed during a forced marriage, such as kidnap, false imprisonment, assault, rape and, in some cases, murder. We support forced marriage victims who choose to make prosecutions and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="d.78.12/1">A principal aim of the Government's police reform programme is to provide a citizen-focused service that responds to the needs of individuals and communities and inspires confidence in the police. The police race and diversity learning and development programme (PRDLDP) seeks to help fulfil this aim. It was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-24">24 November 2004</phrase> in <i>A strategy for improving performance in race and diversity 2004-2009</i>, which outlined a five-year plan for forces in England and Wales. The focus of the strategy is to facilitate the development of knowledge, to progress understanding and provide skills, to challenge attitudes and change behaviour. It makes clear that race and diversity is, and must remain, a critical part of every force's core business. While race necessarily remains the primary focus, the strategy explicitly encompasses religion and belief, gender, sexual orientation, disability and age.</p>
	<p pid="d.78.12/2">In a fundamentally different approach to what was previously known as community and race relations training, race and diversity learning and development is now being embedded in all training material and is being contextualised to take into account the needs of local communities as well as the rank or role of the officer or staff member. A crucial programme goal is to ensure that, by 2009, everyone in the police service is assessed as competent against national occupational standards relating to race and diversity.</p>

These will not change as a result of restructuring, although the Police and Justice Bill contains measures to enhance the responsibilities of police authorities. The membership of any strategic police authorities would be determined by an amalgamation order made under Section 32 of the 1996 Act. The number of members will be a matter for discussion between the Home Office and the precursor police authorities. For a transitional period, we would expect the balance of councillor, independent and magistrate members to be broadly as now. The Police and Justice Bill also contains measures to remove the separate category of magistrate members from police authorities.</p>
