	<p pid="a.113.0/1">After financial and other difficulties with its predecessor organisation, Kairos-Apac, the Kainos Community began the operation of Kainos communities in the wings of four prisons in May 1999. The Prison Service Management Board agreed in September 1999 that these should be permitted to continue, without any commitment of public funds and for a limited period, while they were evaluated. The evaluation was to be done by independent researchers and paid for by Kainos. The board would reach a decision on the future of the programme in the light of the evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2">The evaluation was completed in September 2001. The Kainos trustees provided the board with a copy of the evaluation report and asked the board to take an early decision on the future of the programme because Kainos' own funding for the programme would cease at the end of 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/3">Among other matters the evaluation examined the one-year reconviction rates of prisoners who had been through the Kainos programme and a comparison group of nearly 14,000 prisoners with similar sentence lengths and from similar prisons. The reconviction rates for the Kainos sample was 23 per cent and for the comparison sample 26 per cent. This difference is not statistically significant and the evaluation report found that there was no basis for concluding that Kainos community prisoners have reconviction rates that are significantly lower than would be expected for similar released prisoners as a whole. Other Prison Service programmes designed to reduce reoffending typically show statistically significant reductions of 10 per cent in future reoffending against expected rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/4">In the light of this finding, the board decided that the Kainos Community should no longer continue to operate in prisons when its present programmes came to an end. The board respects the commitment of the Kainos trustees and of the staff and volunteers who gave their time to the programmes. But it is determined that effort and scarce resources in prisons are devoted only to programmes which can demonstrate their effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/5">The evaluation report remains the property of the Kainos trustees. On <phrase class="date" code="">9 November</phrase> they kindly gave permission for the executive summary to be placed on the Home Office website and this is being done. I am also placing a copy in the Library. I hope that the trustees will be able to publish the full report soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.0/1">The Government are committed to putting in place effective measures to combat the trafficking in human beings and to penalise those engaged in this abhorrent practice. To this end, the United Kingdom has signed the Trafficking Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime which requires the specific criminalisation of trafficking in human beings.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/2">At the European Union level, we have reached provisional agreement on the text of a European Union Framework Decision on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. The draft framework decision will require member states to adopt a common definition of trafficking in human beings for the purposes of sexual or labour exploitation, to criminalise the defined behaviour and to impose common minimum maximum penalties. Following its adoption by the Council, the framework decision will require that member states implement its provisions within two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/3">A decision will be made on how best to implement the UN and EU agreements after the framework decision has been adopted and a number of measures are currently being considered. The Government will also take into account the outcome of the consultation exercise on Setting the Boundaries, the report of the Sex Offences Review. This made recommendations for a new offence of trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/4">Last year we set up Project REFLEX, which is a multi-agency task force chaired by the National Crime Squad, to co-ordinate anti-trafficking operations and develop the intelligence and strategic planning to underpin them. It is now well established and has resulted in some major successes involving partners overseas in tackling people trafficking.</p>

The review is looking at the objectives of energy policy to develop a strategy that ensures current policy commitments are consistent with longer-term goals. To achieve its aim, the review is considering all sources of energy including nuclear. At this stage, there is no presumption of any change in nuclear industry policies. The review is due to report to the Prime Minister at the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.9/1">The latest available figures indicate that in England 29 per cent of households headed by an older couple or a single person over the age of 60 were in fuel poverty in 1998. This is based on fuel poverty being defined as when a household needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income (including housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest) on fuel in order to maintain a satisfactory heating regime. When fuel poverty is defined using income excluding housing benefit or income support for mortgage interest 35 per cent of households headed by an older couple or a single person over the age of 60 were in fuel poverty in England in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.9/2">An analysis of fuel poverty in England in 1998 was published in August 2001 by DTI and DEFRA, and is available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/pdf/fuelpov.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/pdf/fuel pov.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.5/1">We are pleased to announce that, further to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase> last year in another place, (Offiical Report cols. 414&ndash;15), the Ministry of Defence has concluded negotiations with BAE Systems Marine and has today placed a contract worth an estimated value of &pound;120 million with the BAE Systems Marine Govan shipyard on the Clyde to construct two alternative landing ships logistics. This is in addition to the first two ships in the class which are to be built by Swan Hunter at its Tyneside yard. BAE Systems Marine will build their vessels to Swan's design.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/2">This represents an important enhancement to our amphibious capability as each ALSL has more than twice the carrying capacity of the ships that they will replace. This significantly increases our specialist amphibious lift capacity. The vessels being built by Swan Hunter are due to enter into service in 2004 and 2005. Work at Govan on the further two vessels should commence later this month with a planned in-service date of 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.5/3">This represents positive news for Clyde shipbuilding and should sustain 600 jobs at the Clyde shipyards and 200 other jobs in the region until the planned Type 45 destroyer construction commences.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-09">9 August 2001</phrase> my right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced two independent inquiries into the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak namely the &quot;Lessons learned&quot; inquiry and the Royal Society study.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">The &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; inquiry, chaired by Dr Iain Anderson, does not have a panel of members. Instead a secretariat works directly with Dr Anderson. This inquiry will not formally begin until it is clear that it will not distract from the eradication of FMD and Dr Anderson has been asked to make recommendations six months after its official start.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/3">The members of the committee for the Royal Society study are as follows: Professor Sir Brian Follett FRS (Chairman), Mr Peter Allen, Professor Patrick Bateson FRS, Mr David Black, Professor Fred Brown FRS, Mr Roger Eddy, Ms Suzi Leather, Professor Simon Levin, Professor Karl Linklater, Ms Jeanette Longfield, Professor Ian McConnell, Dr Angela Maclean, Professor Andrew McMichael FRS, Dr Jenny Mumford and Professor Robin Weiss FRS. The committee held its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-03">3 October 2001</phrase> and plans to report its findings by summer 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.2/1">In response to concerns about the design of the Parliamentary website, the House of Lords and the House of Commons set up a joint project to commission a new design in 2000. The contract to prepare the new design was subsequently awarded to EPIC Group plc, who have examined parliamentary websites in Europe, the Commonwealth and the United States of America. The redesigned website is currently under construction, and is expected to be ready in spring 2002. It will deliver substantial improvements in all the areas identified by the noble Baroness.</p>
