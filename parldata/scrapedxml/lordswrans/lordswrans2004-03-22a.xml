The increase, in euros, on the 2002 position was 2.7 per cent, and reflects inflationary pressures on pay and non-pay factors. However due to exchange rate fluctuations the budget in GBP increased by 9.3 per cent from 2002 to 2003. The proportion of the contributions north/south has remained constant at circa 70/30 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.11/1">The UK and the rest of the international community have responded to the security concerns in Afghanistan with additional measures. The UK supports NATO's efforts to expand the role of the International Security Assistance Force beyond Kabul. This includes provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) across Afghanistan, which enable reconstruction by improving security in the regions. The UK is planning to lead a second PRT and run a forward support base for all PRTs in northern Afghanistan. We are also working hard to encourage other nations to contribute to PRTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.11/2">In the longer term, the UK is helping the Afghan Government provide for its own security and law enforcement. We will contribute &pound;18 million for security sector reform (SSR) projects in 2004&ndash;05. Over the past two years the UK has supported a range of SSR projects including work to establish a multi-ethnic national army within a civilian-led Ministry of Defence, and reform of the police force and judicial sector.</p>

We assess that, generally, the &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot; approach enshrined in the joint declaration is working well.

We hope to see early progress towards the Basic Law's ultimate aims of the selection of the chief executive and election of all members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage, at a pace in line with the wishes of the people of Hong Kong. We have made this position clear on many occasions to the Chinese authorities and to the Hong Kong SAR Government.</p>

From the introduction of primary dental services under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, the system of remuneration based on the item of service fees and payments in respect of individual registrations will be replaced with a new base contract. The proposed new contract will help to stabilise and improve access to NHS dental treatment. It will also allow dentists to treat patients on the basis of clinical need, as it will replace the fee for item of service system which dentists tell us feels like a treadmill and which is generally agreed to be the main reason for dentists' dissatisfaction with the NHS. We have guaranteed that dentists working in the GDS will have an automatic right to a contract under the new arrangements and that their gross earnings will be protected over the transition period of three years in return for a similar level of NHS commitment.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.5/1">So far as I am aware, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has not received a report from the Metropolitan Police of the kind described. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-15">15 October</phrase> last year, a joint briefing note about the Licensing Act 2003 and its impact on anti-social behaviour, prepared by Westminster City Council and the Metropolitan Police, was sent to us under cover of a letter from the then Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Andrew Trotter. In his letter, Mr Trotter expressed concerns that the implementation of the 2003 Act may result in increased consumption of alcohol with a resultant rise in crime and disorder. In his reply, the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Richard Caborn) informed Mr Trotter that the Association of Chief Police Officers has generally supported the abolition of permitted hours as they believe it could lead to a decrease in incidents of crime and disorder. The merits of the Licensing Bill were debated by Parliament at length and it received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-10">10 July 2003</phrase>. Since then three commencement orders have been made bringing into force parts of the 2003 Act. We expect to make further orders as soon as possible and we see no reason to delay the implementation of the 2003 Act, not least because of the important contribution we expect it to make to the prevention of crime and disorder.

	<p pid="a.84.3/1">Electricity generated from biomass is eligible for renewable obligation certificates whether the fuel is domestic or imported. This will not change as a result of the 2004 amendments. However, we do expect the amount of such fuels to decline as the amount of home grown energy crops increases. DRAX power station has recently announced trials of UK-sourced biomass for its co-firing; it had previously used imported fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2">It is important to remember that modifications made to the rules on the co-firing of biomass with fossil fuels are the Government's transitional move towards enhancing the prospects for the development of energy crops. When we consulted on changes to the co-firing rules in 2003, we published a study made by Ilex Energy Consulting which analysed several scenarios which took into account the potential sourcing of energy crops from outside the UK and recognised that some biomass fuels would be imported.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/3">The renewables obligation is a market mechanism and the use of imported rather than domestic fuels is a matter for the market. Any restriction on fuel would not be permissible under international trade rules and could also deprive generators of a source of fuel, some of which is a waste with no other end use. We are aware some generators are using imported olive cake and palm husks.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/4">With generators free to obtain their biomass from any source, and regarding some of the information as commercially sensitive, it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the level of imports of their sources. Rebo</p>

	<p pid="a.86.8/1">In order to obtain the information requested by Viscount Goschen the Cabinet Office would have to ask each government department to examine every regulatory impact assessment it has produced since 1997. This would require considerable resources and so I regret that the information required could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
