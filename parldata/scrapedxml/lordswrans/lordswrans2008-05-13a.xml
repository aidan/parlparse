At the time of purchase, it was agreed that the tenants of 1 Millbank would remain in occupation under a new sub-lease until September 2007.

Under the management of the project board, intensive and intrusive surveys were undertaken within 1 Millbank to inform the development of the design work. This led to the production of the final sketch plan for the first phase of the refurbishment which was agreed by the House Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase>. The Administration and Works Committee agreed the detailed design plan for the refurbishment at its meeting yesterday.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.6/1">At its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April</phrase>, the House Committee reviewed the development of the Millbank island site refurbishment project and the associated project to decant the occupants of 2 Millbank during the refurbishment. The committee agreed to align the timetable for the island site refurbishment with the availability of additional accommodation in the Palace of Westminster following the departure of the Law Lords in autumn 2009. I informed the House of this development in my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-24">24 April</phrase> (<I>WS 143</I>). It is anticipated that following refurbishment 1 Millbank will be ready for occupation in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.6/2">Aligning the island site refurbishment timetable with the Law Lords' departure in this way will enable the offices vacated by the Law Lords to be available in Autumn 2009 for Members currently occupying offices in 2 Millbank for the duration of the refurbishment works. It is expected that 50 Members will be accommodated in the Law Lords offices, 13 Members will move into Palace offices vacated by staff of the House (in line with a decision taken by the Administration and Works Committee in January) and seven Members will be accommodated in existing outbuildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.6/3">The House Committee intends to take firm decisions before the Summer Recess regarding the decant accommodation to be provided for staff currently occupying 2 Millbank.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.6/4">Prior to refurbishment, costs in the region of &pound;100,000 per annum will be incurred for the supply of gas to 1 and 2 Millbank (the gas supply to 2 Millbank is served via the 1 Millbank system) and electricity and water to 1 Millbank. Other costs may arise as part of the continuing care and maintenance of the building.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.2/1">In valuing the time costs of two journeys of equal duration&mdash;one by car all the way, and the other using park-and-ride&mdash;it is recommended that a distinction be made between trips made for work and non-work purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/2">For non-work purposes the same equity value of time is applied to in-vehicle time for both journeys. This is &pound;5.04 per hour for commuting and &pound;4.46 per hour for other journeys. Time spent walking (when interchanging and walking to the final destination) should be valued at double these rates. Time spent waiting for the bus should be valued at two and a half times these rates. This reflects research suggesting people place a greater weight on these time savings. As a result a car journey will have a lower time cost than a park-and-ride journey of equal duration. Of course, any appraisal would need to consider all factors. Typically park-and-ride would have lower monetary costs and/or faster access times; for example, through bus priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/3">The value of time for journeys made for work purposes should reflect the average income of relevant business travellers. In cases of staged journeys, the value of working time for the main mode should be used, where the main mode refers to the mode for the longest journey by distance. For a park-and-ride trip, that would usually mean the car driver or car passenger values of time are more appropriate than the bus passenger value.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/4">In the appraisal process, changes in travel time on employer's business are valued the same whatever stage of the journey is involved; that is, there is no weighting applied to take account of the reluctance of passengers to walk to/from or wait for transport services. This is because the time spent or saved is assumed to be lost or gained in productive working time&mdash;the travel activity taking up the time is therefore deemed irrelevant. A car journey for a particular group of business travellers will have the same time cost as a park-and-ride journey of equal duration.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.2/1">It is recommended that for non-work purposes (such as commuting, shopping and education journeys) the time spent waiting should be valued at two and a half times the value of time spent travelling in the vehicle (&quot;in-vehicle time&quot;). This reflects research suggesting that people attach a greater weight on these time savings. For work purposes, the value attached to waiting time is the same as applied to in-vehicle time.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/2">The time spent taken to park a car is assumed to form part of the total journey time for a car based trip. There is no difference in the value of time applied to the time spent parking the car.</p>
