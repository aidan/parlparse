The court certified a point of law of general public importance, but refused Mr Symeou leave to appeal to the House of Lords. Mr Symeou has applied directly to the House of Lords for leave to appeal. As this case is still before the courts it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.0/2">The European arrest warrant (EAW) has introduced a simpler mechanism for the surrender of persons within the EU. Given the number of people who now travel across borders of EU member states, it is essential to have an efficient and effective extradition system in place. The operation of the EAW is closely monitored by both member states and the European Union itself and we are confident that it is working effectively in the interests of justice and the victims of serious crimes.</p>

It provided major replacement centres at Blackpool, Liverpool, Hull, Nottingham, Manchester, Southampton, Plymouth and Bristol which included new wards, outpatient and diagnostic facilities, catheter laboratories, cardiac theatres and critical care beds. The programme also funded smaller schemes, some consisting of a single catheter laboratory suite. The total number of catheter laboratories constructed in this &pound;613 million programme across all of the schemes is 53, of which 40 were additional catheter laboratories and 13 were replacements.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/5">The Big Lottery Fund catheter laboratories programme made its first installations in 2002 and was completed in 2006. The programme has provided 90 brand new catheter laboratories and 72 of these are additional catheter laboratories and 18 replaced old and out-dated technology. Sixty-three of these laboratories have been developed in district general hospitals to provide improved local access (59 additional and four replacement) and 27 have been in tertiary centres cardiac centres (13 additional and 14 replacement) over and above the investment from the revascularisation capital programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.6/69" class="indent">1. Inpatients are defined as patients who are admitted to hospital and occupy a bed, including both admissions where an overnight stay is planned and day cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.6/70" class="indent">2. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.6/71" class="indent">3. Data quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.6/72" class="indent">4. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.5/1">The UK is currently tackling the illegal trade in timber through the European Union's Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. We believe that it is essential that this work continues at the European level&mdash;otherwise the trade in illegal timber and timber products could simply be diverted to, or through, other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.5/2">The EU is currently negotiating voluntary partnership agreements (VPAs) with several tropical timber producing countries, from which all timber products exported to the EU will be guaranteed to have been legally produced.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.5/3">The UK has also long argued for additional EU measures to support the VPA process. We are currently working with EU partners in taking forward negotiation of the due diligence regulation. The UK has been at the forefront of negotiations, calling for a prohibition on the first placing of illegal timber and timber products on the Community market.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.5/4">Finally, we seek to ensure that the Government lead the way in demanding legal products. From April 2009, UK government departments now accept only timber that has been verified as legal and sustainable, or licensed under FLEGT voluntary partnership agreements. The Government are actively promoting responsible timber procurement in the wider public sector and are working with the Governments of other EU member states to generate a common approach to the international market and timber supply chains.</p>
