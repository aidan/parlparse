	<p pid="a.205.2/1">The 2009 National Audit Office report on service family accommodation (SFA), published in May 2009, covered the situation before this Government took office. Since May 2010 this Government have consistently sought to ensure that service personnel and their families are housed in good-quality modern accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">The 2010-11 upgrade programme typically provides a new kitchen, bathroom, heating system and often a new roof and windows and will bring at least 800 SFA properties up to the highest standard for condition. In addition, around 4,000 properties will benefit from smaller-scale improvements such as new boilers, bathrooms, kitchens, loft insulation and double glazing, which may not amount to a full upgrade but will deliver real lifestyle benefits to occupants.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/3">Some &#163;60 million has been allocated in the financial year 2010-11 for the upgrade and improvement programmes in England and Wales. Allocations for future years have yet to be agreed, but the Government will endeavour to improve as many properties as possible from the agreed allocation, together with possible funding from efficiencies found elsewhere within the Ministry of Defence.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.6/1">Well informed, empowered consumers are central to the Government's vision for how a credit market between customers and lenders should work. We want to encourage responsible lending and borrowing decisions and to strengthen protection where necessary, particularly for the most vulnerable. BIS and HM Treasury are currently reviewing the consumer credit and personal insolvency regime. This is a thorough review of consumer credit and personal insolvency, looking at all the measures that could be taken to support people in difficulty and help them resolve their debts, including the impact of any interest rate cap on payday lending. A call for evidence made in connection with the review has recently closed and we are currently considering the substantial number of responses received. The Government will make an announcement on next steps in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">The Government welcome the progress made in Basel towards a final package of new international regulatory standards, including the introduction, for the first time, of international minimum liquidity requirements. Analysis by the Basel Committee and the International Monetary Fund highlights the considerable benefits of these reforms for financial stability. This analysis also suggests that meeting the liquidity standards will be achievable for UK banks and that the impact on lending, both in the long run and during the transition, will be moderate.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/2">The Basel standards are yet to be fully finalised and the committee has stated that it will continue to monitor the proposed liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio during the transition phase to ensure that there are no unintended consequences; this also provides further opportunity to assess the impact on the wider economy. If necessary, revisions will then be made to the standards before they are introduced in 2015 and 2018 respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.0/1">The definition of fuel poverty set out in the Fuel Poverty Strategy was the most widely accepted definition of a fuel-poor household. The definition was consulted upon prior to the strategy being published and was broadly the same as the definition that already existed in academia.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/2">The modelled fuel bill is the sum of annual modelled bills for space heating, water heating, lights and appliance usage and cooking costs for each household. The requirement for each of these is modelled based on the dwelling, the efficiency and structure of the dwelling, the people who live there, their personal circumstances and requirements and the fuels used. Information on householders and dwellings used to calculate these modelled bills comes from the English Housing Survey. The fuel poverty methodology handbook can be found at <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/Media/viewfile.ashx?FilePath=">www.decc.gov.uk/Media/viewfile.ashx?FilePath=</a> Statistics/fueipoverty/614-fuel-poverty&#172;methodology -handbook.pdfandfiIetype=4andminwidth=true.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/3">Consistent with other statistics, Winter Fuel Payments are classified as an addition to recipients' incomes. They make an important contribution to tackling fuel poverty and were responsible for taking around 100,000 households out of fuel poverty in England in 2008 (and up to 200,000 in the UK as a whole).</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/4">Whilst it remains appropriate to consider Winter Fuel Payments in this way for statistical purposes, to gain a full picture of the impact of Winter Fuel Payments on the situation of fuel-poor households it is also useful to consider what effect they would have if used to meet energy bills directly. Taking this approach, around 850,000 fewer households in England (and around 1.25 million fewer households in the UK as a whole) are shown to need to spend more that 10 per cent of their income in order to meet the remaining costs of heating their home adequately.</p>

The Government are committed to balancing these objectives to deliver effective and sustainable funding frameworks for green industries.

	<p pid="a.223.5/1">Demonstration programmes, such as the Government's commitment to continuing public sector investment in CCS technology for four fossil fuel power stations, are necessary to bring forward the commercial deployment of technologies that are needed to reduce the UK's carbon emissions. These programmes also provide UK industry with a first mover's advantage in what are set to become global markets. The value to the UK from global markets for new advanced coal and gas-fired generation plant, including that fitted or retrofitted with CCS, could be worth up to &#163;6.5 billion a year by 2030.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.5/2">These programmes are an essential part of the Government's focus on green growth but we also recognise the need to accelerate and scale up private investment in green infrastructure that is already commercially proven. We are creating a Green Investment Bank that will provide funding for investments in infrastructure projects in areas where private sector investment is currently constrained. These projects will facilitate the entrance of new types of investor into the UK's green infrastructure and provide new opportunities for jobs and economic growth throughout the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.2/1">We are building support for radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) through discussions with the EU Fisheries Commissioner and other member state Ministers, along with representatives of the fishing industry-both large-scale and under-10-metre fleets-MEPs, retailers and non-governmental organisations. Our focus is to simplify and decentralise fisheries management, enabling those closest to fisheries to plan for the long term integrating fisheries management and marine conservation and giving fishermen greater incentive to fish sustainably, including the means to end discards.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/2">The UK Government, however, are not simply waiting until reform of the CFP to take action on discards. We have already undertaken a number of initiatives that have delivered excellent results. Project 50%, a collaborative project between fishermen and the Government, saw discards in the South West sole fishery reduced by over 50 per cent. We are also pioneering an alternative &quot;catch quota&quot; management system that is based on managing and monitoring what is caught, not just what is landed. Cod discards by vessels participating in the 2010 trial were reduced significantly, and we are expanding the trial in 2011 to include more vessels and species.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.2/3">Furthermore, we are taking action through the Fishing for the Market project by seeking to encourage consumption of alternative and sustainable underutilised species that are presently discarded. The aim of which is to provide new opportunities for fishermen, as well as reduce discards.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.5/1">The EU has demonstrated over the past 20 years that it is possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions whilst simultaneously growing our economies. Whilst the macro and micro economic impacts of tighter emissions targets are difficult to model, it is clear that they will stimulate investment and job creation in growing low carbon sectors. There are also a range of other benefits of moving to a 30 per cent target, such as reduced EU dependence on imported oil and gas and protecting economies against spikes in the oil price.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.5/2">We do recognise that decarbonising the most energy intensive sectors will be challenging although the impacts will be limited to a small number of sectors for which appropriate measures will be employed. We should not exaggerate the risk. The Commission's May 2010 analysis of the impact of a move to a 30 per cent GHG target indicates that some of the most energy-intensive sectors (for example ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and some chemicals) would experience an additional production loss of only 0.1 per cent and 1 per cent compared with a 20 per cent EU target, even if other countries remained at the low end of their Copenhagen Accord pledges.</p>

In our review we will also consider any relevant research published since the letter that the Chief Dental Officer published in February 2008 and the comments that the noble Earl has made on the letter.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.2/1">The Forestry Commission allows and encourages public access to the public forest estate wherever legally and practically possible. The proportion of the public forest estate managed by the Forestry Commission that is in leasehold ownership amounts to around 23 per cent (58,000 hectares). Lord Henley was referring to statutory rights of access: less than 1,000 hectares of this leasehold land has been dedicated for access on foot in perpetuity under the provisions in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.2/2">For the remaining leasehold land, the Forestry Commission allows non-statutory access where possible. Approximately 30 per cent of leasehold land permits this, while 66 per cent of leasehold land has some constraints on access, which are set out in the lease. A small area has access by agreement and in some places public access is tolerated by the freeholder.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.5/1">It is for local commissioners to determine how best to meet their population's needs for pain management services, in the light of their assessment of the standards of current services, professional and clinical guidance, and experience in other health communities. From April 2012, subject to parliamentary approval, it will be for the National Commissioning Board to determine what support commissioners will need to discharge their responsibilities. In the meanwhile, the long-term conditions workstream of the Quality, Improvement, Productivity and Prevention programme is producing examples of best practice in delivering community-based multidisciplinary services for managing long-term conditions such as chronic pain. The second phase of the programme, due later this year, will take forward the learning from these projects.</p>

Ministers decide whether an applicant is entitled to compensation under Section 133. For those applicants who are to receive compensation, it is then for an independent assessor to decide how much should be paid, based on claims of loss from the applicant. It is open to an applicant to make a claim in relation to his or her own Article 8 rights-for example, loss of family life. Section 133 fully meets our international obligations to pay compensation in cases of miscarriages of justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.2/1">The latest available figures (Feb 2011) show a total of 83.36 million national insurance number (NINo) records on the department's customer information system (CIS). These consist of:</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/2">63.73 million live NINo accounts; and19.63 million NINo accounts with a date of death applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/3">The Department for Work and Pensions does not withdraw or cancel NINos once they have been allocated except in very limited circumstances. This is because a NINo, even if used only for a limited period, links an individual to their national insurance contributions record which may be relevant in any future claim to benefits or state pension. In the case of deceased individuals, a partner may make a claim for a contributory benefit, which is dependent on the contribution record of the deceased individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/4">A NINo would be withdrawn if it were established that a customer had been inaccurately allocated with more than one number. In these circumstances the NINo allocated in error is retained but is marked to ensure it cannot be used by any other person.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/5">A NINo is cancelled if it is established that an account has been created as a result of an administrative error during the NINo allocation process prior to any notification to the customer.</p>

The figures are Management Information (MI) collected for the purpose of managing DWP business, and therefore have not been subject to the rigorous quality assurance that is applied to DWP official statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/18">The majority of UK nationals receive a NINo automatically from HMRC shortly before their 16th birthday. This is as a consequence of a successful claim to child benefit. In validating claims to child benefit, HMRC confirms the identity of the child or children in question, including checking birth certificates, before making an award. This includes checks against databases of lost and stolen birth certificates.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/19">The Department for Work and Pensions has the responsibility for the allocation of national insurance numbers to adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/20">The department undertakes rigorous checks on the identity of all adult national insurance number applicants. This involves document examination checks to ensure the authenticity of any documentary evidence provided such as passports or foreign national identity card, corroborative checks with third parties (including other government departments) and only when it is satisfied with the identity of an individual will a number be allocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/21">Upon the death of an individual, DWP receives automatic updates from the General Register Offices (GAO) of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on a daily basis. DWP undertakes a rigorous matching process against the updates received from the GROs to ensure that DWP records are annotated with the date of death. Any subsequent claim to benefit using that NINo would be subject to close scrutiny and, if appropriate, be referred to DWP's Fraud Investigation Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.2/1">Data are not collected centrally on the number of prisoners receiving methadone prescriptions. However, data are available on the combined total of substitution treatments for both methadone and buprenorphine for treating heroin dependence in prisons. In 2009-10 there were 60,067 treatments, of which 36,323 were detoxifications and 23,744 were longer-term maintenance treatments. The data show the number of treatments prescribed but not actual prisoner numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/2">Information on actual prisoner numbers receiving methadone prescriptions is available from spot survey data. The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse and the Department applied to the Review of Central Returns to collect these data last year. Data collection will begin shortly, and this information will be available later in the year.</p>

Mindful of the FSA's independence, HM Treasury will consider whether any changes should be made to this process.</p>

The offer of voluntary redundancies to all staff working in Remploy factories and central services is a decision made by Remploy management to help the continuing operation of the businesses within that budget and to help ensure all employees have meaningful work.

This review provides an opportunity for trade unions, disabled people and disability organisations to submit evidence to inform the development of our future strategy.

In 2010 the CHF provided $12.8 million to address urgent humanitarian needs in Eastern Sudan, which covers the areas populated by the Beja people and those displaced and living in Port Sudan. North-eastern Sudan experiences drought almost every year in some parts of the region and the droughts are of varying magnitudes. (Desert locust infestations do pose a threat in north-eastern Sudan, but there has been little damage to crops from locusts in the last few years.

The first reports of ill health in Japanese larch were made in the south west of England during July and August 2009, with laboratory confirmation of the presence of P. ramorum later that month. A survey of woodlands in the area commenced immediately and by December 2009 the pathogen had been confirmed at five sites distributed across Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. The surveillance was extended the following spring once needles had flushed. There are now 129 woodland sites in Great Britain with confirmed, or assumed, infected Japanese larch trees. Further surveillance and resurvey will commence once trees have come back into needle this spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.0/1">There are three such trade and industry councils: with Kazakhstan (KBTIC), Uzbekistan (UBTIC) and Turkmenistan (TUKTIC). An Azerbaijan council has not met since 2002; instead a self-standing business council now exists. These councils' overall aim is to develop strategies that directly support the efforts of firms to win business and maximise investment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/2">There are differing arrangements for Kazakhstan because UKTI has dedicated resources in that market and is able to support KBTIC directly. In 2010-11 the amount spent on KBTIC was &#163;9,000 and on UBTIC was &#163;2,000. TUKTIC was initiated by business with the support of HM ambassador in Ashgabat but does not receive specific UKTI support. There are no officials in the UK dedicated to working on trade and industry councils but they fall within the work scope of UKTI's Russia, Turkey, central Asia and south Caucasus unit which comprises 5.7 officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/3">Meetings are held annually and alternate between London and the partner capital. KBTIC met in London in July 2008 and 2010 and in Astana in 2009. UBTIC met in London in November 2007 and 2009 and in Tashkent in December 2008 and 2010. TUKTIC first met in September 2010 in Ashgabat.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.0/2">The Deputy Prime Minister, accompanied by the Minister for Europe, visited Astana in Kazakhstan for the OSCE summit in December 2010. This provided a range of opportunities to promote British business. The then Minister for Energy in the previous Government visited Turkmenistan in early 2010 to promote UK expertise in the oil and gas sector.</p>

KBTIC is led by the private sector and an action plan in the financial services, education, mining and minerals and nuclear sectors was agreed by the two sides in November 2010. This will be taken forward in the summer when the council next meets. We are keen to develop our bilateral relationship with Kazakhstan further and when an appropriate opportunity occurs, we will explore a trade MoU.</p>

Salary thresholds are not the only condition attached to the intra-company transfer route. For example, transferees who are filling posts must have at least 12 months' previous experience with the company; the post must be on the list of graduate level occupations; and an intra-company transferee will not be able to return with 12 months of the expiry of his previous leave. This ensures that the route is used only to meet business needs for temporary posts that require established company knowledge and experience, not for posts that could be filled by a new recruit from the UK.
