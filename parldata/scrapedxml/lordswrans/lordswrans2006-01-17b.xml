	<p pid="b.99.6/1">The principal issue raised by veterans claiming Gulf War syndrome before the Martin decision was that it should be recognised as a discrete medical condition. There was, and remains, no scientific basis for doing this and this was confirmed in the Pensions Appeal Tribunal decision. The proposal to use Gulf War syndrome in a broader sense as an &quot;umbrella term&quot; is a new one. We have recognised the need to bring an element of closure for those who have sought some acknowledgement that their ill health is connected to their Gulf service. For this reason we have welcomed the decision that Gulf War syndrome should now be used as an umbrella term covering any recognised medical condition caused by service and connected to the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf War.</p>

	<p pid="b.102.2/2">The table below shows the average number of employees over the past three financial years together with the present figures. The increase in staff numbers from 17 in 2002-03 to 51 to date is mainly due to the growth of the School Milk Project, which provides facilitators to encourage milk consumption in schools. The MDC now has 14 school milk facilitators, most of whom operate on a part-time basis. The work is also part-funded by dairy processing companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.2/3">The rise in numbers of extension officers (field-based staff that help to implement the fruits of research and development work on-farm) has been driven by the need to gain better coverage of Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.2/4">The increase in numbers in office-based staff is a result of a move away from use of external consultants to recruitment of permanent staff in the relevant areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.105.6/1">The building projects currently under way at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) at Weybridge are part of a long overdue site redevelopment programme, designed to bring the ageing facilities up-to-date so that VLA can continue to provide the statutory and emergency services that Defra requires.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.6/2">VLA has a number of specialised facilities for work on pathogens dangerous to man. Prior to the redevelopment these were mainly provided in temporary buildings, or in buildings old and unsuitable that could not be adequately maintained to meet the required safety standards. Furthermore, much of VLA's animal accommodation was many years old and unable to meet the current Home Office standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.6/3">None of the new facilities were available elsewhere within VLA's estate and, beyond the planned demolitions of those buildings vacated as a result of the redevelopment, no closures of existing facilities is planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.6/4">So far the redevelopment has provided:</p>
	<p pid="b.105.6/5" class="indent">a new laboratory housing a centralised serology testing facility, which Defra requires VLA to maintain in case of an future outbreak of foot and mouth disease or other exotic animal disease; and ACDP containment levels 2 and 3 laboratories for research and diagnosis work on tuberculosis;</p>
	<p pid="b.105.6/6" class="indent">new accommodation for farm livestock to house cattle, sheep, pigs and goats to support a wide range of research work; and</p>
	<p pid="b.105.6/7" class="indent">a new &quot;headquarters&quot; building to house an emergency animal surgery, and pharmacy as well as the staff who manage VLA's animal services.</p>
