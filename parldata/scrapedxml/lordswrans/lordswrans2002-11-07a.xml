	<p pid="a.129.2/1">It is estimated that by the end of this year the value of PFI/PPP contracts signed will increase private sector capital expenditure on public services to over &pound;25 billion. Revised estimates are published annually in the Budget and updated during the financial year under arrangements agreed with the National Audit Office. This figure represents all signed PFI/PPP signed contracts. In accordance with the substance of individual contracts, some will be accounted for as on the public sector purchaser's balance sheet and some as off the public sector purchaser's balance sheet. But the final determination of the accounting treatment is made only in the financial year in which the contract becomes operational and subject to independent external audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">Information on the accounting treatment of operational PFI/PPP schemes is contained in the accounts of individual public sector bodies. Contingent liabilities arising from PFI/PPP, such as guarantees, commitments or other rights obligations, are also disclosed in the notes to the accounts.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.5/1">I very much regret that the figure for the difference between the cost of public and private finance which I gave in my earlier Answer was based on an assessment given to the House of Commons last year which I am now advised was incorrect. I apologise to the House for this mistake. I am advised that it is not in fact possible to make a direct comparison between the absolute cost of raising PFI finance and the cost of conventionally financing a project, since PFI funding cannot be replaced by conventional funding without other aspects of a scheme changing, for example its capital cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/2">Nevertheless, it remains true that the higher cost of PFI borrowing makes comparatively little difference to the overall cost of projects. Capital expenditure generally constitutes a relatively small part of the total costs of a PFI project (often around a quarter to a third), and the cost of private sector borrowing generally differs from the public sector's cost by between one and three percentage points, depending on market conditions and the risk profile of the project.</p>

This included the circumstances which would lead to the delegation of operations from the local ambulance service to the fire service where mass decontamination is required.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.1/6">Under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries have legally binding targets to limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emission. Developing countries do not have such targets but they do have an obligation to limit their emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/7">Although the UK encourages the use of more environmentally friendly means of power generation, it is up to individual governments to decide their own power generation strategies. Government policy for power generation in the UK is to continue to use a diverse range of energy sources in order to ensure security of supply, and it is not for the UK to deny that option to other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/8">UK companies sell goods and services to coal-fired power stations abroad and some of these exports make use of cover from ECGD. This is in line with the UK Government's policy to promote sustainable development and the use of cleaner coal technologies for coal-fired power generation. Many developing countries (such as China) do not at present have readily available alternatives to coal as their major source of fuel and the UK's aim is to encourage them to adopt high efficiency and cleaner coal technologies to reduce emissions. Provided that emissions are controlled ECGD believes that the economic and social benefits resulting from the availability of electrical power are usually sufficient to outweigh the potential environmental impact of the associated greenhouse gas emissions, but ECGD considers each case on its own merits.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/9">ECGD is keen to support electricity generation from renewable resources. As the Prime Minister announced in September, the ECGD will help developing countries limit their greenhouse gas emissions by making available at least &pound;50 million of cover each year, from next April, for creditworthy exports in the renewable energy sector. This is not a cap and should it receive viable applications for a greater level of business ECGD will consider raising the level of support available. This initiative will assist countries to meet their power generation requirements in a sustainable way and their obligations under Kyoto.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.1/2" qnum="HL6279">What their policy is towards the marketing technique, closely allied to the practice of spamming and recently reported in the media in respect of e-greeting cards, whereby computer users are invited to install an application on their computer, the licence of which grants permission for e-mails to be sent to all contacts in a user's e-mail address book.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">The recent media reports concern an e-mail that invites the recipient to collect an e-greetings card from one of two websites. On visiting one of these websites, the recipient is invited to install an application onto their computer in order to view the e-greetings card. The installation process includes the display of two end user licence agreements, the second of which states that by installing the application the user is allowing a similar greetings card to be sent to all the e-mail addresses in the user's e-mail address book, and that if they object to this they should not download, install, access or use the websites concerned. It is only by agreeing to these licence agreements that recipients will allow their own contacts to be e-mailed in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/2">Although all but the initial e-mail addresses are supplied by the recipients, the originators of this e-mail are sending direct marketing communications by means of unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE). The Government encourage all direct marketers to adopt responsible techniques, to take account of consumer preferences where available and to target their marketing as far as possible. The regulatory framework for UCE, including industry codes of conduct and legislation, is still developing. The Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 require UCE to be easily identifiable as such as soon as it is received, enabling automatic filtering or deletion. The new Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications to be implemented by October 2003 will require an opt-in approach to UCE sent to individuals except where there is an existing relationship between the parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.0/1">Under the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999, the sending of direct marketing faxes to individual subscribers is banned unless the subscribers have given their prior consent. The regulations also set up a central opt-out list, called the Fax Preference Service (FPS), primarily for corporate subscribers but individuals may also register as an additional protection. Direct marketers are obliged to ensure that they do not send direct marketing faxes to numbers appearing on the FPS list unless they have prior consent to do so.</p>

The code will therefore be followed when appointments to these bodies are made. The code of practice is designed to ensure that the appointment process is fair, transparent and open and commands public confidence. The code is underpinned by the seven principles arising from the recommendations of the First Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Appointment on merit is the overriding consideration in the appointments process and care must be taken at every stage not to discriminate on the grounds of gender, race, age, disability, religion, marital status, sexual orientation or community background. Independent scrutiny is a mandatory element in every competition and this underwrites the integrity of the competition process. Independent assessors should always be used at the selection stage, which deals with the identification and selection of candidates and may be involved in earlier stages of the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.3/1">Section 4 of the Abortion Act 1967, which was agreed on a free vote by both Houses, allows doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion not to participate in treatment. The scope of the clause was clarified by the House of Lords' decision in the case of Janaway v. Salford Health Authority in 1988, which stated that in order to claim conscientious exemption under Section 4 of the Act, the objector had to be required to take part in administering treatment in a hospital or approved centre. Practitioners cannot claim exemption from giving advice or performing the preparatory steps to arrange an abortion where the request meets legal requirements. If a general practitioner has a conscientious objection to abortion, the patient should be advised and referred to another doctor if that is the patient's wish. Refusal to participate in the paperwork or administration connected with abortion procedures also lies outside the terms of the conscience clause.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/2">The General Medical Council (GMC) booklet Good Medical Practice states that general practitioners' views about a patient's lifestyle or beliefs must not prejudice the treatment they provide or arrange. If they feel their beliefs might affect the treatment, this must be explained to the patient, who should be told of their right to see another doctor. Breach of this guidance may expose a doctor to a charge of serious professional misconduct and disciplinary action by the GMC. The British Medical Association has also issued guidance to its colleagues on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.5/1">An extra &pound;70 million is to be made available for adoption support services and special guardianship support services over the next three years. This comprises &pound;12 million in 2003&ndash;04, &pound;23 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;35 million in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/2">The funding will help councils to deliver the duties set out in the Adoption and Children Bill that will require them to make and participate in arrangements for the provision of adoption support services and in the future special guardianship support services. Adoption support services cover a very wide range of different types of assistance to those affected by adoption. Such assistance might range from the provision of basic information about services through oral advice or the provision of a leaflet, to financial support, to assistance with accessing multi-agency packages of care, and, in some cases, to intensive therapeutic intervention and support in order to prevent the avoidable breakdown of an adoptive placement.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/3">We expect this funding to be of significant benefit to children affected by adoption, their adoptive families and their birth families regardless of when the adoption took place. In the future this funding will also assist those affected by special guardianship. Precise figures of the numbers that will receive services are difficult to predict, but, given the broad scope of adoption support described above, many thousands of families affected by adoption will undoubtedly benefit to differing degrees.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/4">In terms of hard figures, the Government have set a public service agreement target to increase by 40 per cent and, if possible, by 50 per cent the number of looked after children adopted by 2004&ndash;05, from a baseline of 2,700 in 1999&ndash;2000. There is clear evidence to show that the numbers of children being adopted and the numbers of children being placed for adoption are increasing. During 2000&ndash;01, 3,100 looked after children were adopted in England and, in addition, at <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> some 3,400 children were placed for adoption. If this trend continues, in each year of the grant we can expect there to be in the region of 7,000 looked after children who are newly adopted or are placed for adoption. Once the provisions of the Bill are in force and the grant is in payment, these children and their families will be eligible to seek support as will anyone else affected by adoption.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/5">This is not the first time this Government have specifically funded adoption services. We have already pledged &pound;66.5 million of the Department of Health's spending review settlement over the 2001&ndash;02&mdash;2003&ndash;04 for adoption services.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.1/2" qnum="HL6297">Further to the Written Answer by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath on 9 October (WA 26), whether the National Health Service policy in England for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C is different from that in Scotland since 2000 in respect of positive appraisal guidance, access to recombinant blood products and addressing the compensation of patients infected with contaminated National Health Service blood products; and, if so, why.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.2/1">Policy on health matters in Scotland is the responsibility of the devolved administration there. The development of different policies in different parts of the United Kingdom is an intended consequence of devolution and this can lead to different outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/2">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance on ribavirin and interferon combination therapy for hepatitis C in October 2000. It expects to issue guidance on pegylated interferons for the treatment of hepatitis C in November 2003. In the meantime, National Health Service bodies should continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where there is no guidance from NICE at the time the technology first becomes available, including assessing available evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/3">The Government are still considering whether to make recombinant clotting factors available to all haemophiliacs in England taking full account of representations made by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Haemophilia, the Haemophilia Society, the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organisation and others. We hope to announce our decision before the end of 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/4">We deeply regret that so many people were infected with hepatitis C through blood products. However, this Government and their predecessor have held that compensation is paid to patients only when the National Health Service has been at fault and that an exception to this rule is not justified in the case of people infected with hepatitis C.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.5/1">I have today placed copies of the chief inspector's annual report in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/2">For the first time the annual report includes the inspectorate's new responsibility for the inspection of the Children and Family Court and Advisory Support Service (CAFCASS). In March 2002 the inspectorate published a progress report on its work with CAFCASS (Setting Up) which highlighted some of the difficulties the new body had faced during its first year in existence. In his latest report, the chief inspector points to encouraging signs of progress, such as the publication of CAFCASS's first corporate plan and its work on developing draft national standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/3">Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) are seen to have contributed significantly to achieving the Government's target to reduce delay in the processing of persistent young offenders. The chief inspector reports that MCCs have also handled well the transfer of warrant execution from the police to the courts. This was a major piece of work and for understandable reasons there was some slippage in performance. Some criticisms remain of MCCs ability to ensure systems are in place to manage performance at a strategic level.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.5/1">It is not our intention to amend the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 in the way outlined in the question. A similar proposal to add accommodation centres to the short list of institutions specifically referred to in Section 36(2) of the Act was extensively discussed at Committee and Report stage of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill and defeated in a vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/2">The Government share the concern to protect children, but, as we made clear in the debate, we do not believe such a measure would increase the protection already offered by the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/3">Section 35(1) of the CJCSA 2000 states that, &quot;An individual who is disqualified from working with children is guilty of an offence if he knowingly applies for, or offers to do, accepts or does any work in a regulated position&quot;. It goes on to say that an individual who knowingly offers work in a regulated position to a person disqualified from working with children is also guilty of an offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/4">It is important to note that those who work (paid or unpaid) in any of the establishments established under, or provided for in, Immigration Acts, whose normal duties include caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children are already covered by the CJCSA provisions as they currently stand.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/5">We fully intend to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to protect children housed with their families in institutions provided for under Immigration Acts.</p>

The fact that an asylum seeker may have professional qualifications does not mean that his application will be expedited or receive more favourable treatment.

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">In accordance with the commitment in the Belfast Agreement to implement enhanced employment equality legislation, the Employment Equality Act 1998 was implemented in the Republic of Ireland with effect from <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-18">18 October 1999</phrase>. The Employment Equality Act 1988, which replaced the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act 1974 and the Employment Equality Act 1977, extends the grounds on which discrimination in relation to employment is prohibited to family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community as well as gender and marital status which were covered by the earlier legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2">The Employment Equality Act 1998 allows for the application of provisions in relation to proficiency in the Irish language in respect of certain public service employments; namely, holding of office under, or in the service of, the state (including the Garda Siochana and Defence Forces) or otherwise as a civil servant, officers or servants of a local authority, a harbour authority, a health board or a vocational education committee and teachers in primary and post-primary schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.5/1">The Irish Government's commitment to demonstrate their respect for the different traditions in the island of Ireland is an important aspect of the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish Government continue to work actively to fulfil it.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.5/2">In support of their efforts in this area, in April 1999 the Irish Government increased the funding available to groups working to achieve peace and mutual understanding between the different traditions on the island of Ireland to IR&pound;2 million per annum ( an eight-fold increase). The moneys are disbursed through the Reconciliation Fund, operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs. This increase enabled the Irish Government to provide grants worth IR&pound;4 million to 137 organisations involved in a wide range of cross-community, educational, research and outreach activities in 1999 and 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.5/4">With regard to the Ulster Scots language, an Ulster-Scots Agency is one of the two constituent agencies which comprise the North/South Language Body, the other being the Irish Language Agency, Foras na Gaeilge. As part of the language body, the Ulster-Scots Agency reports to the North/South Ministerial Council, which meets in the Language Sector to take decisions on policies and actions to be taken by the body.The agency's budget for 2002 is 2.4 million euro, of which the Irish Government contribute 600,000 euro, just less than 25 per cent.maria</p>

	<p pid="a.180.2/1">Records of the Prime Minister's official visits are not categorised in this way. The Prime Minister's office records show that since 1997 the Prime Minister has undertaken the visits in the list which I am placing in the Library. The Prime Minister's visits cover a range of matters, including health, education and tourism. He also travels regularly to his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.2/2">The Prime Minister travels making the most efficient and cost-effective arrangements. His travel arrangements are in accordance with the arrangements for official travel set out in Chapter 7 of the Ministerial Code and the accompanying guidance document, Travel by Ministers.</p>
