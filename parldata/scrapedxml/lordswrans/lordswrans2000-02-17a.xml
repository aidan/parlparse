	<p pid="a.159.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/2" qnum="HL1133">Whether they have received the report of the Security Commission on the case of Steven John Hayden.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-02-17a.159.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100331" speakername="Baroness Jay of Paddington" colon=":" colnum="159"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000217/text/00217w01.htm#00217w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.159.2/1">The Prime Minister announced on <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-30">30 April 1999</phrase> that, after consultation with the Chairman of the Security Commission and the right honourable Gentleman, he had asked the Security Commission to investigate the circumstances in which breaches of security had or might have occurred arising out of the case of Chief Petty Officer Steven Hayden, who was convicted on <phrase class="date" code="1998-10-23">23 October 1998</phrase> of offences under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989; and to advise in the light of that investigation whether any change in security arrangements was necessary or desirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">The Commission has now submitted its report, which is being published this afternoon as a Command paper, with the exception of some details which it would not be in the public interest to publish on national security grounds. The Prime Minister is grateful to the Chairman, Lord Lloyd, and to Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, Sir John Foley and Sir Clive Whitmore.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/3">It became apparent to the Commission at the start of the inquiry that the main issues at stake were in the area of personnel security. The Commission has fully examined the history of the Ministry of Defence's security assessment of Hayden. The Commission was critical of the decisions to continue to allow Hayden a security clearance and surprised at the lack of communication between the vetting authorities, the personnel authorities and line management about the management of the risk presented by him. In particular, they considered whether the correct balance was being struck between maintaining vetting confidentiality on the one hand and the effective involvement of line and personnel management in the active aftercare of vetting risk cases on the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/4">It was also concerned that recommendations made in earlier Security Commission inquiries had sought to address similar situations to those in the Hayden case which suggested that they had not been fully implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/5">However, the Commission acknowledges the Ministry of Defence's acceptance that Hayden's case represents a clear failure in personnel security and welcomes the changes to vetting processes and procedures that the Ministry of Defence has already implemented based on the lessons learned. The Commission has made a number of recommendations. These, in summary, are that:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/6" class="indent">(i) It should be standard practice for vetting authorities to consider whether to consult an individual's personnel or line managers, in order to ensure that the latter are aware of any particular vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/7" class="indent">(ii) In cases where doubts emerge, it should be normal practice for regular consultations to take place between all those involved in assessing a clearance. Where the recommendations of Investigating Officers seem likely to be overridden for wider policy considerations of a non-security kind, there should invariably be a discussion between them and those responsible for making the assessment, so that options can be explored before final decisions are reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/8" class="indent">(iii) In risk cases where confidential medical reports exist on an individual, someone at an appropriately senior level should have the authority to see all the papers including a medical report on the individual's suitability to hold a DV clearance and thus be in a position to reach a proper assessment based on all relevant information.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/9" class="indent">(iv) More emphasis should be given to threats outside the traditional risk of an individual being vulnerable to approaches from a hostile foreign intelligence service. Threats from cheque-book journalism and industrial espionage should be given more emphasis in the current Field Investigation Officers Guide issued by the Cabinet Office, and in departmental guidance based upon it.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/10" class="indent">(v) The question of follow-up to Security Commission recommendations should be revisited to ensure that effective implementation of agreed recommendations take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/11">The recommendations of the Security Commission have been accepted in principle by the Government, subject to further consideration of some detailed points and, in the case of (iii), subject to discussion with the appropriate medical authorities. Work is now in hand to ensure that they are effectively implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.2/3">The decrease in the department's running costs limit is the net effect of the following transfers: &pound;60,000 to the Department of Health towards the costs of the Teenage Pregnancy Implementation Unit; &pound;200,000 from the Lord Chancellor's Department and &pound;93,000 from the Crown Prosecution Service in relation to contributions towards the costs of the Integrated Business and Information Systems Unit; &pound;25,000 from the Cabinet Office in relation to the transfer of posts from the security facilities division; &pound;8,500,000 from the DEL Reserve in respect of asylum support costs; &pound;233,000 to the Northern Ireland Office in respect of legal services provided to the Northern Ireland Office; &pound;56,000 from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to cover the short-term attachment of the former Director of Operations (North) to the South African Department of Correctional Services; &pound;6,000,000 from the Prison Service's running costs to fund the issue of long-term loans to the Forensic Science Service; &pound;3,722,000 from the Department Unallocated Provision (running costs element) to other current expenditure to fund the purchase of DNA services from the Forensic Science Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.5/2">The cost of prescription prepayment certificates will rise to &pound;31.40 for a 4-month certificate and &pound;86.20 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for those needing more than five items in four months or 14 in one year.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.0/1">Applicable guidelines on Decisions Relating to Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation were first published in 1993 in a joint statement issued by the British Medical Association, the Resuscitation Council (UK), and the Royal College of Nursing. A revised version was published in June 1999. The joint statement gives only general guidelines on the basic principles within which decisions regarding local policies on cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be formulated. It makes clear that all acute hospital trusts should establish local resuscitation policies. The wider ethical context on end of life decisions (of which cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an example) is contained in the BMA guidelines on Withholding and Withdrawing Life-prolonging Medical Treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/2">One of the basic principles of healthcare is that a competent patient has the right under common law to give or withhold consent to examination or treatment. The guidelines suggest that where competent patients are at risk of cardiac or respiratory failure, or have a terminal illness, there should be sensitive exploration of their wishes regarding resuscitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/3">In the case of patients who are not capable of consenting to treatment, and in the absence of a valid advance refusal of treatment, it is a doctor's duty to act in the best interests of the patient concerned. The overall responsibility for &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; decisions rests with the doctor in charge of the patient's care. Before making a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; decision, an assessment is made of the patient's best interests and the guidelines specify that this assessment should include consultation with other members of the health care team and, where appropriate, relatives or those close to the patient. However, the latter cannot determine a patient's best interest nor give consent to or refuse treatment on a patient's behalf. Although the guidelines suggest that resuscitation decisions should be subject to audit, the involvement of an independent party in individual decisions is not specifically required.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/4">The guidelines recognise that the decision arrived at in the care of one patient may be inappropriate in a superficially similar case. &quot;Do not resuscitate&quot; decisions should therefore be reached on a case by case basis. Thus a blanket &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; policy based on a specific patient group (for example, elderly patients) would neither be appropriate nor acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/5">Consultation on the guidelines is a matter for the British Medical Association, the Resuscitation Council (UK), and the Royal College of Nursing, which were responsible for its development.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.2/1">Arthur D Little's report on regional Eurostar services is published today. We have placed copies in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/2">The report considers whether Eurostar services directly serving the English regions and Scotland would be financially viable, and what wider transport and social benefits they would bring. The consultants consulted widely with local and regional authorities and groups. The report provides an independent assessment of the costs and impacts of a range of options.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/3">Under Section 40 of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987, the British Railways Board, now part of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority, has a duty to prepare a plan for regional international rail services. The board is now reviewing its 1989 plan. It will no doubt wish to consider the Arthur D Little report in that review, which it expects to conclude in early summer. In the longer term, the Strategic Rail Authority will have a duty to produce a strategy for services in various parts of Great Britain for facilitating the carriage of passengers by way of the Channel Tunnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/4">We are today giving the go-ahead for Eurostar UK Limited to lease some of the regional trains to GNER for a limited period for additional services on the East Coast Main Line. This will allow regional passengers to enjoy an immediate benefit from the investment made in these trains while leaving open future options for the use of the trains for regional Eurostar services. This arrangement accords with the recommendation of the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs that leasing to a domestic rail operator should be considered while decisions on regional Eurostar services were under review.</p>

He and I had in fact discussed this very point, and I had emphasised that no government could possibly commit to cutting taxes every year.
