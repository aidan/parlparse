	<p pid="a.81.2/1">We are not aware of any proposals for a new airport on the Dungeness peninsular. However, we are aware of two planning applications in regard to Lydd airport. It would be prejudicial for Ministers, who have a quasi-judicial role in the planning process, to comment on matters in regard to Lydd airport that are subject to a planning application and may come before a planning inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/2">The Government's policy on airport expansion remains as set out in the 2003 White Paper <I>The Future of Air Transport</I> and as confirmed in the 2006 Progress Report. In the run-up to the 2003 White Paper the Government considered at length a large number of options for additional airport capacity across the UK, several of which were then subject to public consultation. In the south-east, support is given to a new runway at Stansted Airport, followed by one at Heathrow Airport subject to meeting strict local environmental conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.2/21">Trying to model changes to the rate of child benefit on the level of children in poverty involves considerable uncertainty and is sensitive to factors such as sampling errors, the precise definition of household income, income equivalisation scales and other modelling choices. It is estimated that the same increases in child benefit in relation to its 1997 level, (a) by 25 per cent, (b) by 33 per cent and (c) by 50 per cent more than the rise in earnings may reduce the number of children living in households with income below 60 per cent of median income by (a) 100-150,000, (b) 150-200,000 and (c) 250-300,000.</p>

Estimates were derived using 2005-06 Family Resources Survey data and are on a before housing costs basis, using OECD equivalisation factors.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.1/2" qnum="HL3296">Whether the United Kingdom is facing particular problems from the rise in world sea level, especially in low-lying and heavily populated areas, as outlined in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessment report.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-05-08a.86.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="86"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80508w0001.htm#80508w0001.htm_spmin6">
	<p pid="a.86.2/1">Rising sea levels is an issue that affects many coastal areas both in the UK and around the world. The fourth assessment report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that world sea levels could rise by 0.18m to 0.59m (relative to 1980 to 1999) by the end of the 21st century, as a result of global warming. These estimates do not include future changes in ice dynamics, which could increase the contribution of ice sheets to sea level rise over the 21st century. The AR4 identified low-lying islands in the Pacific and flood plain deltas like Bangladesh as particularly vulnerable regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/2">For the United Kingdom, the impact of sea level rise on flooding and coastal erosion is certainly a challenge and risk for Defra and operating authorities (Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards). The potential increase in intensity, severity and frequency of coastal storms, as another consequence of climate change, also needs to be considered in this context. The risks may include an increased frequency of coastal flooding, with greater potential for coastal erosion.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.5/1">Aerial photography is a technique that UK scientists have been using to a limited extent, primarily as an indirect means of estimating sea level rise caused by ice loss from glaciers.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/2">The British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), has a unique archive of aerial photography for Antarctica, going back to the 1940s. Scientists at BAS have made extensive use of this time-series photography to identify ice volume loss in Antarctic peninsula glaciers, which is contributing to sea level rise. Using data from both this archive and other sources of information, a collaborative study between BAS and the US Geological Survey, published in the journal <I>Science</I> in 2005, found that 87 per cent of the 244 glaciers studied had retreated over the last half-century. Loss of ice volume in Antarctic peninsula glaciers contributes to sea level rise.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.5/3">More generally, direct measurements of sea level rise are made using satellite altimetry. Monthly and yearly mean values of sea level at all UK sites are retained by the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL), which is based at the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory. Also, Defra is working with the Environment Agency and the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory to measure and understand the effects of vertical land movement (sinking in south-east England and rising in the north of the country), caused by melting of ice at the end of the last ice age.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.8/1">Although youth offending teams do not have any specific targets or key performance indicators in 2008-09 for restorative justice, their performance management framework and inspection focuses on the outcomes for young offenders. Youth offending teams are best placed to decide on the right approach in individual cases, including the use of restorative justice, to meet these overall objectives. It allows options to be tailored to the needs of individuals and areas. This allows for local discretion on how to best use restorative justice approaches. In addition the Youth Justice Board works with youth offending teams to disseminate best practice. We believe that this approach is likely to be more effective than a simple target to use restorative justice processes in a specific number of instances as it will allow its use to be targeted more appropriately where it can be most effective for offender and victim.</p>

The research will be governed by a standard departmental research and development contract an example of which is available on the NIHR website at <a href="http://www.nihr-cf.org.uk/site/docdatabase/rfpb/rfpb_docs/RfPB%20-%20NHS%20Trust%20Contract.pdf">www.nihr-cf.org.uk/site/docdatabase/rfpb/rfpb_docs/RfPB%20-%20NHS%20Trust%20Contract.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.3/1">The Government's main programme for eradicating fuel poverty in England is the Warm Front Scheme, which provides a variety of heating, insulation and energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households. The scheme engages with those in greatest social need, including rural, private landlord and black and minority ethnic households, through targeted activities run in conjunction with landlords' forums, private sector housing and regeneration teams at a number of local authorities. In addition, working closely with local authority benefit managers remains a key priority by providing opportunity to successfully target the most vulnerable households readily eligible for assistance. Warm Front also has a network of organisations operating in the charitable sector that proactively promote and refer back to Warm Front. Marketing of the Warm Front Scheme is continually developing to ensure the right information reaches those in most need of assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/2">The carbon emission reduction target (CERT), which started in April 2008, is an obligation on energy suppliers to achieve targets for promoting reductions in carbon emissions in the household sector. Under CERT, energy suppliers are required to direct 40 per cent of their carbon savings to a priority group of low income and elderly consumers. Suppliers may use a variety of methods to identify priority group consumers. These include setting out the priority group criteria in promotional material; partnership arrangements with bodies like social housing providers or charities that work with priority group consumers; and showing consumers the priority group criteria when giving out measures person-to-person.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.5/1">Highways Agency traffic officers attend a wide variety of incidents on the strategic road network and the data collected at each vary depending on the nature of the incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/2">The data collected by traffic officers include the time, date and location of the incident, its nature, the number and types of vehicles involved, the number of casualties, as well as information about any interventions used to restore the network to normality. For a number of pre-identified incident types the names and addresses of the drivers and the registration marks of the vehicles are also collected. The agency's policy is that all incident data are stored in a secure command and control environment and access to data is on a controlled and audited basis at all times.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/3">The agency uses traffic officer data in a number of ways, of which the first is proactive incident management. Incident data are initially used to determine whether the incident is one which the agency will lead or hand over control to the police. The incident data are used to set network signs, distribute media travel reports, and when appropriate, to activate formalised network diversion routes. Incident data are also used to mobilise the correct incident responders and provide them with necessary non-personalised information to ensure they use appropriate resources to resolve the incident as effectively as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/4">Responding organisations include the emergency services, motoring organisations, recovery operators who assist stranded drivers or remove accident-damaged and broken down vehicles from the road, and other government agencies such as the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/5">Current Highways Agency policy is that personal information is passed to these organisations only if specifically required to manage the incident, with the knowledge of the persons involved where it is reasonable to do so, the only normal exceptions being those incidents involving injury or suspected criminality.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/6">Another area where the agency uses traffic officer-generated incident data is post-incident analysis by which the agency improves its understanding of the causes and impact of incidents, and analyses the effectiveness of the interventions deployed to reduce their incidence, duration and impact. It is agency policy that all incident data used for analysis have personal data removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.5/7">There are two further areas in which the agency commonly uses data gathered by the traffic officer service at the scene of incidents. The first is in supporting recovery of the cost of damage to the road from those responsible for an incident, as well as dealing with third party claims against the agency. The second area is the passing of information on suspected criminal offences to the police and other agencies of the Department for Transport responsible for road traffic law enforcement, and the provision of a statement or evidence when requested by the police or coroner's court. Invariably, these areas do require personalised data sets to be used. However, agency policy is in place to ensure that robust processes and procedures control the use, access and storage of this information used for these purposes.</p>

This method provides faster payment to customers and is not disrupted by postal problems.
