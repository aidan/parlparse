	<p pid="a.40.9/1">The Irish Language Broadcast Fund, which is expected to come on stream early this year, stems from a commitment in the Joint Declaration made by the UK and Irish Governments in April 2003. There was also a commitment to encourage support to be made available for an Ulster-Scots academy. I can confirm that the Government have given equal attention to both commitments and have earmarked a similar level of resources for both. My honourable friend the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure is currently considering a business case for an Ulster-Scots academy.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-02a.41.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="41"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050202/text/50202w02.htm#50202w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.41.2/1">Effort to prevent and resolve conflict, and build peace, is fundamental to HMG's multilateral and bilateral security activity. We are actively engaged around the world in conflict resolution and peacebuilding, for example, in Afghanistan, west Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">The conflicts the Government are working to resolve are varied and complex: many are within states, rather than between them, and involve a disparate range of actors (both state and non-state). There is no single &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to their resolution. But a number of principles apply in most cases, the most important being:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/3" class="indent">that all parties to the conflict need to be engaged in the process of conflict resolution;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/4" class="indent">that any peace agreement reached is owned by the parties and that both they and the international community are politically committed to it;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/5" class="indent">that it is important to identify countries or other interest groups who have strong links to the country in conflict, and to engage them in support of the conflict resolution effort;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/6" class="indent">that a measured approach, combining both pressure and incentives, and using a full range of political, diplomatic and other instruments is usually required; and</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/7" class="indent">that &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; and the use of mediators (for example, United Nations (UN) or European Union appointed) can be effective tools.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/8">We recognise that reaching a peace agreement is only one part of conflict resolution. Once peace is achieved it must be sustained. Each situation is different, but again some important principles apply:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/9" class="indent">a long-term approach is required;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/10" class="indent">integrated mission planning for peace support operations is needed to ensure that immediate stabilisation links with transition to sustainable peace; and</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/11" class="indent">parallel action, engaging donors and international bodies, is often crucial in building a self-sustaining peace: for example, capacity building in the areas of governance, economy and rule of law. Programmes for security sector reform, transitional justice and disarmament, demobilisation and resettlement of combatants can play a key role.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/12">Against this background the Government are working hard to improve multilateral institutions' willingness and ability to act effectively in preventing and resolving conflicts and building peace, including in the UN, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and through the development of NATO and European Union security and defence capabilities. HMG will use their G8 Presidency in 2005 to reinforce efforts to improve security and stability in Africa. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has welcomed the report of the UN Secretary-General's high-level panel published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> which makes a wide range of recommendations aimed at improving the international response to threats to global peace and security. HMG will be giving the UN Secretary-General firm support in taking this agenda forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/1">The European Council decided at Helsinki in 1999 that a Cyprus settlement was not a precondition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union (EU). On this basis, Cyprus signed the Treaty of Accession to the EU on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-16">16 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/2">The Republic of Cyprus, including the northern part of the island, is an EU member state, but the acquis remains suspended in the north. Therefore in practice, Turkish Cypriots living north of the green line are unable to enjoy most of the benefits of EU membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/3">With regard to travel, under UK Immigration Rules, Turkish Cypriots travelling on passports issued by the Republic of Cyprus have the same right of freedom and freedom to work in the UK as any other EU national. However, as the UK does not recognise the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;, those travelling on documents issued by the authorities in the north are subject to immigration control. In the field of education, only Turkish Cypriots with Republic of Cyprus passports are eligible for EU fees at UK universities.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/4">The Government are committed to ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. Although Turkish Cypriots are currently unable to trade directly with the EU, a Commission proposal to that end is under discussion, as is a proposal to disburse 259 million euros of aid in the north. We fully support both proposals. The Green Line Regulation (GLR), agreed in August 2004, allows for limited trade across the green line. We support the Commission's proposals to amend the GLR to increase intra-island trade.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.2/1">The <i>entente cordiale</i> centenary provided an opportunity to further UK-French relations and strengthen shared interests and values. There were more than 340 different celebrations and 280 town-twinning exchanges. Many events were designed to leave a lasting legacy, and looked to the future by involving children and students. There was co-operation in education, youth, sport, science and the arts, as well as in trade and investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/2">The two Education Ministers signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on educational co-operation, boosting several initiatives. The MoU will be delivered over three years through various agencies, including the British Council, the Teacher Training Agency and the Specialist Schools Trust. It is likely to be renewed in 2006. Partnerships between language and specialist schools were given a further boost, with 84 partnerships now in place. Regional links between UK and French schools have produced joint study projects and visits for students and teachers. The University of the Transmarche was established, with cross-Channel courses being developed between the University of Kent and French universities in Lille and Dunkirk. Over 400 exchanges took place each way through the Teacher Training Agency, providing initial teacher training in modern foreign languages. Various badged events raised more than &pound;200,000 for cancer charities, and the <i>entente cordiale </i>cancer initiative&mdash;a programme of co-operation between Britain and France in cancer research&mdash;established a number of practical outcomes: joint work between the UK's National Cancer Research Institute and France's new National Cancer Institute; a fellowship exchange scheme between clinical research centres; travel and subsistence bursaries for collaboration between researchers at grass roots level; and a prestigious <i>entente cordiale</i> cancer prize to allow the brightest young cancer scientists from the UK and France to work with scientists of the other country.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/3">Her Majesty the Queen was warmly received by the French people in April 2004 during a state visit for the official launch of the centenary celebrations. President Chirac visited the UK in November as a special guest of Her Majesty, formally to round off the year. Against this successful backdrop of high-level exchanges and grass roots initiatives, the UK/French summit in November 2004 highlighted how Britain and France can achieve much when working together, and that there is more that unites us than divides us.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.5/1">Six exemption orders made under Section 47 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 apply to heritage railways and tramways. These grant exemptions to vehicles regulated by the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (RVAR) and are operated by the Bristol Harbour Railway, Ffestiniog Railway Company, Furness Railway Trust, Isle of Wight Railway, Middleton Railway Trust and the Summerlee Heritage Park. A further three exemption orders apply to tourist railways. These are the Cairngorm Funicular Railway, East Hayling Light Railway, and Seaton Tramway.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/2">The RVAR are aimed primarily at rail vehicles that are used in a public transport role. However, some vehicles operated by heritage and tourist railways and tramways have been subject to the RVAR when old vehicles have been converted to such an extent that they have been categorised as &quot;new&quot; vehicles for the purposes of the regulations or, as with Ffestiniog Railway and Seaton Tramway, entirely new vehicles have been constructed.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/3">By their very nature, vehicles on heritage and tourist railways cannot meet many of the measures within the RVAR. However, officials from the Department for Transport work closely with the operators to ensure that accessibility is designed in wherever possible. Indeed, all these vehicles have some access features, even if they do not achieve full compliance with the RVAR&mdash;hence the need for these exemption orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/4">Exemption orders for vehicles operated on heritage and tourist railways are usually granted for the lifetime of that vehicle. This policy is supported by the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, the department's statutory advisers on disability issues, which must be consulted on every exemption application.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/5">The Government are taking powers in the Disability Discrimination Bill to enable them to exempt heritage and tourist railway systems from the RVAR. We intend to consult on detailed proposals, including a list of railways and tramways to be exempted, during the passage of the Bill. Even where heritage and tourist railways are granted an exemption, we expect that these will be made subject to conditions to assist disabled people.</p>
