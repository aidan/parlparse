	<p pid="a.57.6/1">The UK worked hard in the final session of the working group under its current mandate to promote solutions that would allow a strong declaration to be agreed. However, a number of issues remained on the table at the end of the session. We understand that the chair of the working group will make a recommendation to the Commision on Human Rights to allow a short extension of the working group's mandate so it can complete its work. The UK will look constructively at any such proposal.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.0/1">The UK Government welcome the fact that many states with indigenous populations have granted them various collective rights in their national constitutions, laws and agreements. The UK has made clear in its statements to the UN working group that it has no objection to such rights being reflected in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. However, the UK believes that it is important that these rights, bestowed nationally, remain distinct from individual human rights in international law, since human rights are universal and equal to all human beings. We believe that this distinction can be accommodated in a strong and meaningful declaration, such that indigenous people are assured their human rights on an equal footing with all individuals; and&mdash;separately and in addition&mdash;can hold recognised collective rights, specific to indigenous peoples.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.5/2">The average time taken by multi-centre research ethics committees (MREC) to deal with applications submitted in May 2004 was 50 days. Preliminary data for subsequent months show an improvement in this aspect of MREC performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/3">Research ethics committees (RECs) meet in private. They need to be able to discuss freely the proposals that come before them which are confidential and frequently contain material which is commercially sensitive, or involves unpublished intellectual property. However, the outcome of the Committee's discussion is in the public domain. Applicants may be invited to attend MREC meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/4">For the purpose of review of clinical trials of medicinal products, the MRECs are recognised by the United Kingdom Ethics Committee Authority, which has approved their standard operating procedures. For other research, the English MRECs operate under the policy published as governance arrangements for NHS research ethics committees (GAfREC) on the Department of Health's website (<a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a>). The Central Office of Research Ethics Committees provides operational oversight and management support on behalf of the department. MRECs are independent with regard to their opinion on the ethical standards of the applications they review.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/5">MRECs have a maximum of 18 members, of whom at least one-third must be lay members. The remainder are health professionals (drawn from a variety of disciplines) and other experts. Appointments are made by an open process, compatible with the Nolan standards, as required by department policy laid down in the GAfREC. This includes public advertisement or advertisement through professional networks, as appropriate. Membership of each committee is listed in each MREC's annual report, and applicants are provided with a list of those present at the meeting at which their application was considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/6">There are 13 MRECs, of which 11 are in England, two in Scotland and one in Wales. The opinion of any one MREC covers the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/7">The remit and role of RECs (including MRECs) is published in full in the GAfREC. In brief, their role is to provide independent advice to participants, researchers, funders, sponsors, employers, care organisations and professionals on the extent to which proposals for research studies comply with recognised ethical standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/8">The work of all RECs is currently under review. The review group, chaired by Mr Michael O'Higgin, has been asked to recommend steps to improve the efficient operation of the REC system, building on changes already under way.</p>

Specifically, Highways Agency traffic officers are being introduced across the motorway network and it is anticipated that they will be patrolling the M4 in 2005.

	<p pid="a.65.5/1">The replacement of the level crossing at Silk Mills Lane, Taunton, with an overbridge was assessed as part of the north-west Taunton package (NWTP), which the Government announced had been given full approval to proceed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December</phrase>. This scheme comprises a number of elements:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/2" class="indent">A new park and ride site on the outskirts of Taunton;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/3" class="indent">Replacement of the rail level crossing with a bridge;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/4" class="indent">Various junction improvements and bus priority measures within Taunton.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/5">The major scheme proposal was appraised using the department's new approach to appraisal (NATA) criteria. Since the NWTP was assessed as a whole rather than in its constituent parts, exact figures for the safety and time-saving benefits attributable to the proposed new bridge cannot necessarily be separated out.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/6">Safety benefits were claimed and accepted by the Department for Transport for the scheme as a whole. The main reason given in justification of these claimed benefits is that, compared with the situation predicted without the scheme, the reduction in the number of vehicles on the local road network arising from the package of measures would reduce the road-based accident rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/7">Time saving benefits associated with the scheme arise in part from the highway improvements, which include the new bridge. A considerable proportion of the total highway benefit claimed is due to the introduction of the bridge, as the bridge removes the delay caused by traffic having to wait at the level crossing.</p>
