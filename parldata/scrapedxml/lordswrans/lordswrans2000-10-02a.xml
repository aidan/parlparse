	<p pid="a.203.5/1">The Defence Driving Instructor (DDI) Course runs for 15 training days (commonly three weeks). Students are required to pass a written theory test, a driving assessment, an instructional assessment, a cross-country instructional assessment and a recovery instructional assessment. Students are subject to continual assessment throughout the course. There are no training requirements for civilian instructors that are additional to these requirements; the civilian course requires a touch screen theory test rather than a written test, and does not require success in cross-country or recovery instructional assessments. Additionally, DDIs are given the result of their test at the end of the course, whereas civilian Approved Driving Instructors are given the results of each of the qualifying tests shortly after taking them.</p>

One of the key recommendations identified by the Expert Group is the need to build up research capacity in prostate cancer by establishing one or more centres of excellence and improving research networks. The Medical Research Council on behalf of Cancer Research Funders Forum members has approached existing prostate research groups about taking this forward. Part of the additional funds announced by the department will be made available for this purpose.</p>

The department will make available an additional &pound;5 million per annum from 2001-02 to set up and run the network, which will be fully implemented by 2004. Trials related to prostate cancer will be one of the high priorities for this new NHS Cancer Research Network.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.5/1">Guidance given on page 82 of the Companion to Standing Orders states that &quot;it is considered undesirable to incorporate statements of opinion or the demonstration of a point of view&quot; into the text of Questions on the Order Paper. The purpose of the Questions on the Order Paper should be to elicit information, and not to make an argument.</p>
