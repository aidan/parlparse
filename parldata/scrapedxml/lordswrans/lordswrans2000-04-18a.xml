	<p pid="a.81.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/2" qnum="HL2131">What steps they are taking to ensure that the effectiveness of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency will be maintained if the proposals for its part-privatisation are implemented.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-04-18a.81.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="81"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000418/text/00418w01.htm#00418w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.81.2/1">The Government concluded in the Strategic Defence Review that, in order to guarantee the ability of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) to continue to conduct world-class research, we would harness the opportunities offered by a Public Private Partnership. Last year's consultation exercise on a potential PPP proposal produced a wide range of useful comments from stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/2">As a result of this process, we announced in October that we would be widening the scope of our discussion to take these comments into account. That work is now complete and has led to the development of two revised models for potential PPP structures, known as &quot;Core Competence&quot; and the &quot;Public Sector Option&quot;. A detailed evaluation of these options indicates that Core Competence best meets the PPP objectives while also responding to the views of stakeholders. Both models are described in a consultation document which has been placed in the Library of the House and which is also available on the internet at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/commercial/ppp/dera/">www.mod.uk/commercial/ppp/dera/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/3">The essence of Core Competence is a clear separation of those functions which are best developed within a PPP, and those which are best performed wholly within government. Around three-quarters of DERA would be turned into a company, which we would hope to float on the stock market as soon as its potential is judged to be suitably developed. A core of staff would be retained wholly within the MoD to provide a high level overview of defence science and technology. This ensures that MoD would retain access to in-house impartial advice and allows management of the defence research programme and international research collaboration. Specific very sensitive areas and programmes would also be retained.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/4">We believe that this approach would create two vibrant, sustainable organisations. The new company would have the freedom to flourish, to grow its business and to diversify the wealth of knowledge it has built up over the years to the benefit of the wider UK economy, while still providing the MoD with the essential services we shall continue to need long into the future. The retained organisation will be a small but also world-class organisation offering rewarding careers within MoD and the wider Civil Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/5">This approach is good for DERA, good for MoD and good for the wider UK economy. It will provide the UK technology sector with added impetus and ensure we are well placed to take on the challenges and opportunities offered by the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/6">All stakeholders are now being invited to submit their views on the revised proposals. As the previous exercise has proved, we are willing to listen and to respond to comments before taking a final decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.5/1">The Government have no such plans. Our policy on free television licences for people aged 75 or over is intended specifically to benefit individuals and their households. A single licence taken out by the managers of sheltered housing, whatever the age of the residents, already covers any number of television sets installed in the communal areas at the specified address. Introducing free licences to cover such sets only in cases where all the residents were 75 or over would inevitably create anomalies, since a single resident aged below 75 would disqualify the accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.8/1">The Government do not provide direct marketing support for Belfast International Airport, which is a profitable private sector enterprise. But they are always happy to draw attention during international air services agreement negotiations to the potential advantages of serving Belfast. There are no legal constraints on air carriers wishing to start up services between Belfast and another EEA destination. The Government have also offered access to all regional airports, including those serving Belfast, to their bilateral partners, provided reciprocal treatment is permitted to UK carriers. I understand that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board markets the Belfast airports as gateways to the Province.</p>

In November 1999, my department issued a comprehensive information pack on the transformation process to all schools in Northern Ireland to ensure that there is a proper understanding of the process. In addition, my department provides significant funds to the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education to support its promotional and development work in the integrated sector, and has been the main contributor to the Integrated Education Fund, which assists the initial development costs of new schools. The growth of the integrated sector from 10 grant-aided schools with 2,000 pupils in 1989 to 43 schools with over 11,000 pupils in 1999 fully demonstrates my department's commitment to responding to parental demand for integrated education.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.1/2" qnum="HL1937">How many lone parents under the age of 25 are benefiting from the Sure Start programme during the first year of their child's life at present; and how many are anticipated to be doing so in (a) six months, (b) one year and (c) two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.2/1">Sure Start is a government programme for children under four and their parents. Its aim is to work with parents and children to promote the physical, intellectual and social development of pre-school children--particularly those who are disadvantaged--to enhance their chances of success. The programme is targeted on areas of disadvantage, typically with between 500 and 1,000 children under four, and will aim to provide services for all families in that area with children under four. A key target group of the population in these areas will be lone parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/2">The Sure Start programme in England is being rolled out in stages, with the target to have 250 programmes operational by 2001-2002. The first 60 &quot;trailblazer&quot; areas were announced in January 1999 and most have now started to deliver services. A further 69 areas were announced in November 1999 and it is anticipated these will be up and running by the summer. It is hoped to announce a further round in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/3">Information on how many lone parents are using Sure Start services is collected centrally, on a monthly basis, but this is not broken down by their age, nor that of their children. As the 60 trailblazer programmes are only just starting to deliver services, the information received so far does not give an accurate or reliable indication of the number of lone parents who are benefiting from Sure Start. As more Sure Start programmes start to deliver services, the overall number of lone parents benefiting from Sure Start will increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.5/1">The issue will be affected by decisions reached following the outcome of the work of the Task Force that is examining options for the future of railways in Northern Ireland. In principle, Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) would be permitted to lease trains if that is shown to be the most cost-effective option for replacing its rolling stock. However, unlike the other railway companies in the United Kingdom, NIR is publicly owned and consequently would normally have lower borrowing costs. This means that leasing is less likely to be cost effective for NIR than for other railway companies in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">The Regulatory Reform Bill has today been published in draft, in order to allow the two Parliamentary Deregulation Committees to report on it prior to its formal introduction to Parliament. The Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee and its counterpart in the House of Commons have great expertise on the existing deregulation order-making power under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. Their views on the proposed extension of this power will clearly be of great interest to the House when it comes to consider the Bill. Publication of the draft Regulatory Reform Bill (Cm 4713) contains the draft Bill, Explanatory Notes and other supporting material, and I have placed copies in the Libraries of the House, the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">In addition to the changes to the deregulation order-making power, the draft Bill includes provisions to replace Section 5 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, which deals with enforcement of regulations. This policy was the subject of a public consultation exercise in autumn 1999. The majority of those responding to the consultation document were supportive of the Government's proposals. Copies of the Government's response to that consultation exercise have today been placed in the Libraries of the House, the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. Copies of the Government's response to the earlier consultation exercise on the proposed changes to the deregulation order-making power, published in September 1999, are already in the Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.2/1">The Prime Minister's weekly audio broadcasts on the Internet appear on the site in three forms--&quot;Real&quot; stream, &quot;mp3&quot; file (the broadcast-quality file) and the transcript. The Real streams are hosted on a separate server and it is therefore possible to say that they have been accessed by on average 3,473 people each week.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/2">However, many thousands more will have accessed the transcripts of the broadcasts and the mp3 version. These are hosted on the Number 10 site and the site's statistics software is not configured to give figures for the number of people accessing specific parts of the site such as these. As a consequence, we are unable to give an exact figure for the total number of people accessing the Prime Minister's weekly broadcasts. The average number of hits per week on pages in the site has been 3.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/3">For the same reason, we do not know how many people have accessed the briefings by the Prime Minister's Official Spokesman.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/4">It would be possible to configure our statistics software to record figures for hits to each page on the site. However, this would place a heavy burden on our server, which would slow down access to the site for the public and lead to a poorer service. For this reason, we do not propose to record these specific figures.</p>
