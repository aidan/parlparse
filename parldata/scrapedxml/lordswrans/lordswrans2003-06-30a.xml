	<p pid="a.54.2/1">It is for the courts to decide in individual cases whether a prison sentence is appropriate. Where imprisonment is the most appropriate punishment, it should be applied and we should, and are, developing our capacity to meet demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">The Criminal Justice Bill will provide sentencers with a more flexible range of sentences to deal with offenders as effectively as possible. The introduction of two intermediate sanctions&mdash;&quot;custody minus&quot; and &quot;intermittent custody&quot;, allowing offenders to retain employment and family contact during the week while being held in custody at weekends&mdash;will provide options short of full-time custody. The introduction of a generic community sentence to replace the current series of standardised orders will also provide sentencers with the flexibility to impose a package of requirements at any level of seriousness.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">We are also introducing tough new community sentences such as the intensive control and change programme (ICCP) which is designed to cut offending by 18 to 20 year-olds. ICCP, which was launched as a pilot in April, will keep offenders off the streets, tackle their offending behaviour, aid rehabilitation and provide an effective alternative to prison for non-violent and non-sexual offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">We are also extending home detention curfew (HDC) to four and a half months. The HDC scheme is proving successful. There are currently more than 3,000 prisoners on HDC each week and 90 per cent of the 70,000-plus prisoners released on HDC since the scheme began in January 1999 have completed their curfew period without any problems at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.3/2">Rape and sexual assault can, and does, happen to people from all walks of life&mdash;women, men, young and old. It is a very traumatic experience in any circumstance. That trauma can often be made even more difficult to deal with when the rape happens abroad.</p>

Equally, we want to give advice to travellers before they go to help ensure their personal safety.

	<p pid="a.60.8/1">DfID already has assisted Montserrat with the handling of government loans, and continues to do so. Since the onset of the volcanic crisis, the island government have encountered difficulty in servicing outstanding debt. We assisted initially in support of their case, which secured Caribbean Development Bank agreement to a moratorium on repayments. Since December 2001, when the moratorium ended, we have contributed to the partial write-off of a loan for port expansion and helped with full repayment of some other debts. The Caribbean Development Bank has since confirmed Montserrat's renewed eligibility for some concessional finance and has restructured some 7.2 million United States dollars of remaining debt. This includes lines of credit, managed by the Bank of Montserrat on behalf of the Government of Montserrat, some of which has been on-lent for mortgage purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.2/1">The only method of payment available for the issue of retirement pension (RP) to people living in Montserrat is by order payable through the postal system. Direct payment into a bank account is only available if the person has a bank account in the UK or in a country which has the infrastructure to accept payments direct to a bank account, Montserrat does not at present have that infrastructure. To date, we have had confirmation that our new courier service is meeting the delivery target of eight working days to destinations outside of Europe. The post to Montserrat is flown direct from the courier to the postal service in Montserrat. This ensures that any postal delays in other countries are not contributing factors to any delays in Montserrat. There are currently no reported delays in Montserrat.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/2">Although no problems are anticipated, should people in Montserrat suffer any delays in receiving their RP in the future, arrangements can be made to track the payment from when it was issued up to when it is eventually received.

This is a significant milestone that triggers the process of accepting individual aircraft into service with the Royal Air Force and the air forces of our collaborative partners: Germany, Italy and Spain.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.8/2">Delivery to the Royal Air Force, which also represents the achievement of the in-service date for this important programme, will signal the beginning of the introduction to service process. Following a very short period in which the safety limitations of initial flying will be confirmed, flying activities will begin with work-up training for BAE Systems instructors. Final confirmatory assessment by Royal Air Force test pilots will follow, after which operational test and evaluation and pilot conversion training will commence.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.8/3">The Royal Air Force aircraft will be operated from BAE Systems' facility at Warton for an initial period of some 18 months. This will enable the operators to make best use of the facilities and technical expertise available there before the aircraft transfer to RAF Coningsby, which will be the first operating base to be home to the Typhoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.8/4">Type acceptance is an important landmark in this complex programme that will lead to a capability to deploy on operations in the second half of this decade. The many people involved in industry and the services, both here and overseas, can be justly proud of what they have so far achieved. The House can be assured of our continued commitment to ensuring that the Royal Air Force is equipped with a world-class weapon system that will enable it to achieve air superiority well into the future.

	<p pid="a.65.2/1">Most recently, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Public Health) at the Department of Health (Ms Hazel Blears) met representatives of the Health Food Manufacturers' Association to discuss the Food Supplements Directive on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-09">9 June 2003</phrase>. Issues covered in discussion fell under four main headings: nutrients and nutrient sources missing from Annex I and II in the Food Supplements Directive and requirements for safety dossiers; the recently-published report of the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals and advice on safe upper levels therein; future setting of maximum permitted levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements at European Union level; and plans for future action on chromium picolinate.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/2">The Government are firmly committed to the view that, in the interests of consumer choice, the law should allow food supplements that are safe and properly labelled to be freely marketed.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/3">The Government, represented by the Food Standards Agency, are pressing the European Food Safety Authority for an urgent, substantive meeting with relevant parties to discuss dossier requirements; the objectives of such a meeting would include outlining the problems faced by the United Kingdom food supplements industry resulting from the omission of nutrients and nutrient sources from the annexes in the Food Supplements Directive, finding out whether dossier requirements could be simplified and discussing to what extent there is crossover with dossiers required for other directives.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/4">Further, to ensure that the Government's policy objectives for regulation of food supplements in the European Union are met, the Government continue to press their view that the setting of maximum limits for nutrients in food supplements should be based on thorough risk assessment and set at levels which protect public health, but which neither unnecessarily limit consumer choice nor unduly restrict trade. The Government continue to press this view strongly in Brussels at every opportunity.</p>

The commission may also undertake investigations into the management, provision and quality of healthcare NHS bodies provide.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.2/5">Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, the Commission for Health Improvement will be replaced by a new Commission for Healthcare, Audit and Inspection (CHAI). CHAI will encompass the current and proposed work of CHI with the independent healthcare work of the NCSC and the national NHS value for money work of the Audit Commission.

The CSCI will also have functions in relation to the consideration and investigation of complaints about the social services provided by local social services authorities in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.2/1">We are pleased to announce the publication today of a report for consultation by the Government's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, outlining proposals for reform of the National Health Service clinical negligence system.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/2">The report, entitled Making Amends: a consultation paper setting out proposals for reforming the approach to clinical negligence in the NHS, has been prepared against a background of the rising cost of claims for clinical negligence, which have drawn much media attention. In line with our wider drive to put patients at the heart of the NHS and patient safety at the top of its agenda, Sir Liam proposes that a less adversarial system should be available. Injured patients would no longer have to resort to lengthy and costly court action under the tort law. It would allow the NHS to be pro-active in responding to sub-standard care. There would be clear links to NHS quality initiatives to improve the patient's experience of the NHS as well as an incentive to drive up standards and so reduce injuries in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/3">The Chief Medical Officer proposes a NHS redress scheme which would offer redress for injuries, in all senses of that word. The scheme would provide people who were injured with an explanation of what went wrong, the necessary apologies, treatment for that injury and support for patients and their families, as well as some financial compensation in appropriate cases. It is proposed that families of neurologically impaired babies would also be eligible for the NHS redress scheme if the impairment was birth related and fulfilled other eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/4">Although a person's right to pursue a formal claim in the court would remain, patients would no longer have to resort to the law as the only way of resolving a dispute with the NHS. Proposed improvements to the legal aid system would mean that use of the NHS scheme would be taken into account if a claimant applied for legal aid after rejecting a fair package of redress under the NHS scheme. At present, over 70 per cent of clinical negligence cases are legally aided, meaning the taxpayer often foots the bill through the legal aid budget if the NHS wins a case or the NHS budget if it loses.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/5">For too long, we have had a disjointed approach to clinical negligence in the NHS. There are often no clear links between complaints procedures and the systems to deal with clinical negligence claims at a local level. There is little consideration of the wider issues raised by complaints and clinical negligence claims&mdash;and settlements&mdash;locally and nationally. Finally, there are no reliable systems of ensuring that mistakes made in one organisation are not repeated in another.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/6">The proposed NHS redress scheme would link to the NHS complaints procedure and the new independent inspection structures being taken forward through the Health and Social Care Reform Bill presently before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/7">The report emphasises the importance of building an NHS that is better at addressing injuries resulting from poor quality treatment. As well as the NHS redress scheme, it recommends that the NHS should improve rehabilitation services and that in cases of clinical negligence the costs of future care should be considered on an NHS-provided rather than a privately-provided basis. This is a long-term measure and it will take time to establish the necessary specialist NHS capacity. However, the Department of Health will be exploring taking this forward through the long-term care national service framework, as it makes sense that those injured by the NHS should be able to get the care that they need from the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/8">Sir Liam's review has been wide ranging and he proposes radical reform of the present lengthy, complicated and over adversarial court-based system. The existing system is slow and often does not provide injured patients with the response to their injuries that they seek. The new system will be more responsive to the needs of patients for redress, and of the NHS for mechanisms that help it learn from mistakes. We believe it is possible to have a system that responds to patients' needs, that supports clinicians to deliver the very best quality care, and that is a driver for the NHS to learn from mistakes to continue to improve the quality of care it delivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/9">There will now be a consultation period until <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>. Following considerations of the issues raised and of the views of respondents on the specific questions asked, the department expects to set out the next steps to reform the clinical negligence system in the autumn.</p>
