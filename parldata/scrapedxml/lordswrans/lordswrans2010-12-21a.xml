	<p pid="a.272.3/1">Passenger name record (PNR) data are only collected by the UK's e-Borders system to the extent that it is known to the carrier. The Immigration and Police (Passenger, Crew and Service Information) Order 2008 specifies that only passenger information that is routinely held by the carrier on their reservation system or departure control system, or information that is obtained during the ordinary course of the carrier's business, may be required. PNR collection on flights between member states and Australia, Canada and the United States of America under EU agreements with those countries follows the same principle, as will PNR collection on flights between member states and third countries, and potentially between member states, when an EU PNR Directive is introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.3/2">Therefore, there are no implications for ordinary air travellers, as they are not required to provide any more data than they would normally provide in the course of booking their flight.

	<p pid="a.278.2/1">Approximately 48 per cent of UK cluster munitions have now been destroyed. The remainder are stored safely either in the UK or in Germany, pending disposal. The majority of the remaining stocks are stored by Joint Support Chain Services (JSCS) (formerly the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency) at their explosives storage facilities at Kineton (Warwickshire), Longtown (Cumbria), Eastriggs (Dumfries and Galloway) and Wulfen (Germany). Some stocks of UK M26 rockets are also stored at the US ammunition base at Miseau (Germany), due to JSCS's temporary storage capacity limitations and by one of our disposal contractors, NAMMO Buck, in Germany. All stocks are maintained for the purpose of ensuring their safe storage and, where appropriate, transportation. It is our intention to have completed the destruction of all UK cluster munitions by the end of 2013.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.0/1">The Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004 allows victims of certain serious violent and sexual offences, where the offender receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or more, to receive information about key developments in the offender's sentence. Such key developments will include where offenders are being considered for or granted a move to open conditions, a work placement in the community and release from prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/2">Where the offender's release is determined by the Parole Board, victims can also choose to submit a victim personal statement to the board which sets out how the offence has affected them.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/3">Eligible victims are also able to make representations about conditions which may be attached to the offender's licence on release. They can, for example, request that the offender is excluded from a particular area, such as where they (the victims) live. In all cases, licence conditions must be proportionate, reasonable and necessary and, in the case of indeterminate sentenced prisoners, must be approved by the independent Parole Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/4">The interests of the victim to be provided with the personal information of the offender, such as their release location, must be balanced against the offender's interests and privacy and the need to rehabilitate the offender. There are sound public protection reasons for doing this, as it is necessary to ensure the successful supervision and re-integration of offenders into the community and prevent reoffending. Releasing the whereabouts of a particular offender's location could undermine this process and reduce the likelihood of a successful, law abiding resettlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/5">Furthermore, all information disclosed to victims must be compliant with the Data Protection Act 1998, which regulates the processing of any personal data about individuals including offenders, and with human rights legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/6">Disclosing very specific information such as an offender's location could be potentially unlawful. There may, however, be circumstances in which it may be proportionate, lawful and in the public interest to provide victims with more specific information about an offender's location. One example might be where the victim is at risk of serious harm from the offender.</p>

An estimated one in every four children under the age of five are underweight. A survey in 2008 established that 15 million people are severely and moderately food insecure and recent surveys suggest the situation is not improving. Through our humanitarian programme, The Department for International Development (DfID) is helping many thousands of children every year receive therapeutic food and treatment. Last year, we helped more than 55,000 children and expect to double our assistance to malnourished children in the year ahead. The UK is also tackling food insecurity by building roads, stimulating food production by making it easier for farmers to get goods to market.</p>

We are deeply concerned by reports of widespread fraud, media restrictions and of denials of access to polling stations for independent national observers and candidate representatives. We are also concerned by reports of harassment and arrest of opposition candidates and their supporters in the run up to, and on the days of the elections, and cases of irregularities, which in some cases amount to serious allegations of interference in and disruption of the electoral process and call into question its credibility.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.3/1">The EU's pre-accession assistance for all enlargement countries is provided through the instrument for pre-accession (IPA). The candidate countries of Turkey, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia work under a decentralised management system. For these countries, the national authorising officer (NAO) is responsible for the expenditure of IPA funds. The NAO is typically a high-level public servant of the Treasury or Ministry of Finance in the country concerned. For all other enlargement countries, the Commission remains responsible for the expenditure of funds. Member states have full oversight of all proposals for the use of IPA funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/2">Pre-accession assistance for Turkey is not directly conditional on Turkey making progress with constitutional reforms, but rather aims to support these reforms.

	<p pid="a.292.0/1">Ellaone contains ulipristal acetate, a selective progesterone receptor modulator. Ellaone was licensed for use as a single 30 mg dose for emergency contraception by the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use (CHMP) in May 2009. It is used to prevent pregnancy for up to five days after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure, mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation. Ellaone is contraindicated for use during an existing or suspected pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/2">In the United Kingdom, Ellaone is licensed as a prescription-only medicine. Under medicines legislation, prescription-only medicines may generally only be sold or supplied by, or under the supervision of, a pharmacist on registered pharmacy premises against a prescription written by an independent prescriber. These legal restrictions apply equally to sale, supply and advertising of medicines via the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/3">Full information relating to the safe and appropriate use of a medicine is provided to healthcare professionals in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and to women in the patient information leaflet (PIL). The SmPC and PIL for Ellaone clearly inform women and healthcare professionals that it should not be taken by a woman who knows she is pregnant and that a pregnancy test should be undertaken if she suspects she is pregnant. The SmPC and PIL also provide information on the known side-effects for Ellaone, most common of which are headache, nausea, menstrual disorders, and abdominal pain.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/4">There is no published experience of pregnancy termination with Ellaone and in clinical studies a 30 mg dose of ulipristal acetate did not interrupt existing pregnancies. Nevertheless, CHMP considered that such an effect could not be excluded and that Ellaone could potentially be used off-label in an attempt to terminate pregnancy. On this basis, no information on the potential use of ulipristal as an abortifacient has been included in the information provided for doctors and women. However, the publicly available risk management plan for Ellaone includes a number of measures taken to minimise the potential risk of off-label use, including a post marketing study to monitor how Ellaone is being used in real life.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/5">When used in accordance with the product information, Ellaone is a safe and effective option for emergency contraception. As with all marketed medicines used in the UK, the safety of Ellaone is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with independent expert advice from the Commission on Human Medicines. In the event of any important new safety information emerging, the MHRA will take action to ensure that this is accurately reflected in the product information and communicated to health professionals and women.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.3/1">We are currently in the process of reforming the way student support is delivered in England. The Student Loans Company (SLC) is in the last phase of a three-year service transformation programme, which began in 2009 to deliver a centralised, predominantly online student finance service for students known as Student Finance England (SFE). SFE has been taking on board one new academic cohort at a time from local authorities and progressively implementing improvements to the way students apply for support and graduates throughout the UK repay their loans.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/2">The weak performance of the Student Loans Company in 2009 under the previous Administration was completely unacceptable. The new Government acted quickly, replacing the company's senior team and making clear our expectation for substantial improvements for students taking out a loan last summer. The Student Loans Company has significantly improved its service this year, though there is no room for complacency. There is still more to do to ensure that the service continues to improve and that students and their families receive the level of service that they have a right to expect. My department continues to work with the SLC to that end.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/3">To date, the SLC has already made some major technological improvements, including data links with UCAS and with the Immigration and Passport Service. My department is currently working in partnership with the SLC and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to make further improvements to the way household income is validated.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.5/17">The rough sleeping street counts in the City of London and Westminster have not shown a consistent upward or downward trend throughout this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.5/18">Since 1998, only councils in areas with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count, which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that, under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, the coalition Government wanted a more accurate measure of rough sleeping and when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers, taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.5/19">Under new guidance, all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so that more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.3/1">Individuals who have been recognised as refugees would not normally be detained. Immigration Act powers of detention are not time-limited, nor do they require judicial involvement. This is a long-standing position that has been accepted by the courts and is fully in accord with Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Individuals who are detained under Immigration Act powers are able to apply to an immigration judge for release on bail and can challenge the lawfulness of their detention by way of judicial review. The question of possible constitutional implications does not, therefore, arise.</p>

However, there are significant economic and social challenges in ensuring that Dalit and other disadvantaged children remain in school. The Indian Government, state governments and the Department for International Development (DfID) are working together to support disadvantaged children to complete their education, including by improving classroom practices and involving the community.

	<p pid="a.313.2/1">We do not intervene in other countries' judicial proceedings so would not demand the release of suspects. The 2010 EU Progress Report, published on November 9, highlighted the high proportion of prisoners in pre-trial detention as an area of continuing concern. We understand that the 2005 amendments to Article 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedures, reducing the maximum period of time suspects can be held in pre-trial detention, will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase>. Our embassy in Ankara is monitoring the case closely and we expect the highest international standards to be observed when the trial resumes.</p>

	<p pid="a.313.5/1">The UK Government strongly support the establishment of the new United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, known as UN Women.

	<p pid="a.314.3/1">The number of visas issued to intra-company transferees in 2009 with a validity of 12 months or less was 5,054. Details of the salaries and job descriptions of these applicants is not held centrally and the information requested could only be produced by checking individual records at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.3/2">Intra-company transferees account for a significant proportion of tier 2 numbers and there are concerns that they have been used by some companies to fill jobs that could be done by resident workers. Our new salary threshold of &#163;40,000 for any transfers of longer than 12 months will ensure that those coming are the senior managers and key specialists that the route was intended for.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.6/1">For the period April 2009 to March 2010, 128 individuals, identified on our systems as students, were arrested during enforcement visits for working in breach of their conditions of leave, of which 88 have subsequently been removed and two have been prosecuted. The figures provided are sourced from management information tools; they are not quality assured under National Statistics protocols and are subject to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.6/2">Where a foreign student is found to be working full-time in breach of his or her conditions of leave to enter or remain, there are a range of sanctions that the UK Border Agency can use including prosecution, curtailment of leave, refusal of future applications for leave and removal. Employers who fail to check that employees have the right to work in the UK can be fined up to &#163;10,000 per illegal worker encountered. Employers who knowingly employ an illegal worker may be liable to an unlimited fine and/or imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.6/3">The UK Border Agency does not keep central records of the number of individuals whose leave was curtailed or application refused for working in breach of their conditions, or of fines issued to employers for employing students in breach of their conditions. This information could only be obtained by the detailed examination of individual case records at disproportionate cost.</p>
