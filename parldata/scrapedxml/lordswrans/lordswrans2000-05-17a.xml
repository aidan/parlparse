	<p pid="a.19.2/1">The Government's policy on export licence applications for Zimbabwe was set out in a statement made by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-03">3 May 2000</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 149-62).</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">As my right honourable friend informed the House, the Government decided last week, in the light of the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe, to refuse from <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-03">3 May</phrase> all applications for new licences for Zimbabwe for goods and technology listed in Part III, Schedule 1, of the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, as amended (commonly known as the Military List). This included all new licence applications for spare parts in connection with previous contracts. We also began a review of all extant export licences for Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">In line with the statement of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister of <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-09">9 February 2000</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 184-5W) government will not grant export licences for dual-use equipment where there is a clear risk that the equipment would be used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Other applications for standard individual export licences to export dual-use equipment to Zimbabwe will be considered on a case-by-case basis against the national criteria and those in the EU Code of Conduct.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/4">We have now completed the review of extant licences foreshadowed in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-03">3 May</phrase>. The Government place considerable importance on UK companies being able to honour their contractual obligations. They do not, therefore, revoke existing licences except in exceptional circumstances. Zimbabwe has now regrettably placed itself in that category. We have, therefore, decided to revoke all extant standard individual export licences for goods and technology on the Military List (with the possible exception of one extant licence for de-mining equipment already in Zimbabwe) and to remove Zimbabwe as a permitted destination from all open individual export licences for goods and technology on the Military List.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/5">In addition, Zimbabwe is a permitted destination on four open general export licences (OGELs) and two open general transhipment licences (OGTLs) which allow the export of goods and technology on the Military List. Zimbabwe will now be removed from the coverage of these licences. Amended copies of these licences will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/6">We will remove Zimbabwe as a permitted destination from the coverage of extant open individual export licences for dual-use equipment. Exporters affected by this measure may, however, submit applications for standard individual export licences for this equipment. Such applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis against the criteria as described above.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/7">We will also be prohibiting transhipment of goods on the Military List to Zimbabwe via the United Kingdom without a licence by means of an amendment to Schedule 3 of the EG(C)O.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/8">The effect of this is that we now have a national arms embargo on Zimbabwe. We will be requesting the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories to take the necessary measures to implement the same embargo.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/9">The Government will continue to monitor events in Zimbabwe closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.3/1">As I explained in my reply to Baroness Whitaker on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-12">12 April</phrase> (WA 49-50), the issues surrounding the definition of &quot;racial hatred&quot; and its application to particular groups are difficult and complex. But this difficulty and complexity are a reflection of the ethnic and religious diversity of Britain generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/2">It is the Government's view that the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland, with its terrible history of sectarian hostility and violence, require particular measures which it may not be suitable to apply to the United Kingdom. That is why there is legislation dealing with the issue which is specific to Northern Ireland, namely the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. Under this it is an offence to incite hatred against a group of persons defined by &quot;religious belief&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/3">I should emphasise, however, that we are continuing to keep the issue of incitement to religious hatred under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-09">9 February</phrase> my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced in another place (House of Commons, Official Report, cols. 172-174W) that all 43 forces in England and Wales had successfully bid for a share of the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) to recruit 5,000 police officers over and above the number they had otherwise planned to recruit over the next three years commencing April 2000. These were to be phased on the basis of 1,000 recruits this year (2000-01), 2,000 in 2001-02 and 2,000 in 2002-03. He also gave details of the number of police officers each force had been allocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/2">Since then, and as a result of the funding decisions outlined by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary was able to announce in another place (House of Commons, Official Report, cols. 1-3W) that part of the &pound;91 million provided in the Budget for modernising the police service in England and Wales would be used to accelerate the CFF with a view to delivering the 5,000 recruits within the first two years of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/3">My right honourable friend has consulted the police service and police authority representatives and he is now pleased to announce that forces will be able to recruit up to a maximum of 3,000 new recruits in year 1 of the scheme (2000-01), rather than 1,000 as announced in February, and the remaining 2,000 in year 2 (2001-02). Tripling the number which can be recruited during the current financial year will cost about &pound;24 millon above and beyond the &pound;35 million which has already been provided for the current allocation. Further decisions on funding for the police service for 2001-04 will be announced as part of the Spending Review 2000 in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/4">The table shows the revised distribution of officers allocated to each force under the accelerated scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/5">Home Office officials have today written to each chief constable and each police authority to explain the funding arrangements under the scheme. I have placed a copy of the letter in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/6">The funding for each force will be determined once each force has provided a profile of their planned recruitment during the first year. This will help ensure that funding can be maintained for forces to recruit up to the maximum in year 1. Forces are also being given the opportunity, by prior agreement, to revise their CFF allocations if they are experiencing difficulty in recruitment by deferring part of their allocation to year 2 and, for those who are able to, to accelerate some of their year 2 allocation into year 1. No force will be able to exceed its overall total CFF allocation and any increase may be limited by the total CFF budget for year 1.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.2/1">Many of the claims from veterans alleged to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder are similar and a group action was therefore set up by the Supreme Court last year. The group action consists of two groups. Group 1 is where the earliest alleged failure by the Ministry of Defence to diagnose or properly treat their condition occurred before the repeal of Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 on <phrase class="date" code="1987-05-15">15 May 1987</phrase> which prevented service personnel from pursuing claims for compensation from the Ministry of Defence. Group 2 is where the earliest alleged failure took place after <phrase class="date" code="1987-05-15">15 May 1987</phrase>, since when service personnel have had the right to make common law claims for compensation. Approximately 15 lead cases from each group, to be agreed by both sides, will shortly be selected as representative of all the cases in the group action. These lead cases will proceed to trial towards the end of 2001, when a judge will rule on the issue of liability. The ruling in each of these lead cases will be binding on similar non-lead cases. In the meantime, both sides are concentrating on obtaining evidence in preparation for the trial.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.3/1">Leucodepletion was introduced, on the advice of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), as a precautionary measure against the theoretical risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) through blood transfusion. A detailed risk assessment of variant CJD infectivity in blood commissioned by the Department of Health from Det Norske Veritas (February 1999) concluded that &quot;leucodepletion appears to have significant benefit in reducing the risk of variant CJD infection through blood transfusion&quot;. This assessment was considered and accepted by SEAC.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/2">We are continually reviewing the available evidence on the effectiveness of leucodepletion but, to date, there has been no new evidence to justify a change of policy. The article by Dr Paul Brown describes experimental studies with scrapie and sporadic CJD and concludes, on the basis of preliminary data, that the negligible plasma infectivity detected in experiments in mice is not significantly reduced by leucodepletion. It does not consider variant CJD, except to say that the risks of blood-borne transmission are unknown, or provide conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of leucodepletion in reducing the risk of variant CJD.</p>
