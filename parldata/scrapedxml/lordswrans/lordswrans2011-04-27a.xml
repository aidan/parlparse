	<p pid="a.117.8/1">Neither the UK nor its coalition partners have plans to trial legal opiate poppy production in Afghanistan. This is because the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) report of 2010 stated that the planned production of licit opiates in licensed countries for 2011 will be sufficient to cover medical demands during the year and increase stocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.8/2">Additionally, the Afghan Government accept that they do not have the capacity to administer a licit cultivation scheme. There is a high chance that any licit cultivation of poppy would be diverted for illicit purposes. Furthermore, Afghan opium would not be economically competitive in the global market place.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.8/1">It is the longstanding policy of the UK to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle. We regularly make representations to governments to abolish the death penalty. Countries we have lobbied include our top five priority countries and regions: China, Iran, the US, Belarus and the English-speaking Caribbean region. We have also raised the death penalty in a number of our other priority countries, as outlined in our <I>HMG </I><I>Strategy for Abolition of the Death Penalty</I> published in October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.8/2">The specific information requested about representations on reducing the numbers awaiting the death penalty is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. However, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) project work has contributed to a reduction in the numbers awaiting the death penalty. For example, in Uganda 167 death row inmates had their sentences reduced to life imprisonment as a result of project work funded by the FCO in 2010.</p>

It was an important part of the transition to a civilian-led democratic Government which the Egyptian authorities have committed to undertake. It has fostered debate on an important issue.

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">Clause 18 of the EU Bill is not intended to express any view on the origin of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty but is concerned with reaffirming the basis upon which directly effective and applicable EU law is given effect within the UK domestic legal order. The Government amended the Explanatory Notes to Clause 18 of the EU Bill ahead of the Bill's First Reading in the House of Lords to remove the references to common law principle. This was in response to concerns raised in the other place, both during the course of the consideration of the EU Bill and most notably by the European Scrutiny Committee in its inquiry report on Clause 18, that such references might be considered to be determinative of the origin of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. The evidence submitted to the European Scrutiny Committee from a variety of distinguished constitutional academics demonstrated that the origin of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty is subject to debate, and is an issue on which opinion remains divided.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.5/1">We were obviously saddened to hear of this fire in one of Nairobi's informal settlements a few weeks ago. We would not have been able to provide any direct assistance, even if we had been asked, as our bilateral focus in Kenya is on other issues, such as education, malaria, maternal mortality and hunger. We would have directed any request instead to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs emergency response fund, to which the Department for International Development is a leading contributor.</p>

A UK-instigated UN Security Council Resolution (1970) asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor to investigate whether crimes against humanity had been committed in Libya. These investigations began on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-03">3 March 2011</phrase>. The UK also led a call for a special session of the Human Rights Council, which convened on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-25">25 February 2011</phrase>, and a resulting resolution which set up an independent commission of inquiry to establish the facts about violations of human rights and to make recommendations, including on holding those responsible to account. We continue to press for full and immediate access to Libya for International Criminal Court investigators and the Human Rights Council's Commission of Inquiry. We call on the Libyan authorities to comply with international human rights and humanitarian law and for those being detained illegally to be released immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/2">We are aware of the reports about the rape of Iman al-Obeidi and that according to media reports Miss al-Obeidi is no longer detained. If true this crime is another abhorrent example of the crimes committed by Gaddafi's regime and those responsible should be held to account. Her serious claims of mistreatment must be investigated thoroughly and she must also be given access to legal representation.</p>

The indiscriminate targeting of Israeli citizens, as they celebrated the Jewish festival of Purim, is unacceptable. The firing of over 50 mortars in the space of a few hours, as well as a Grad rocket on Ashkelon that caused injury and damage, signals a further, worrying escalation in the situation at a time when international efforts are focused on getting Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Hamas must halt these strikes immediately, and rein in other militant factions in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/4">These attacks come against the backdrop of last week's footage of Hamas security forces assaulting students and other peaceful demonstrators in Gaza. Over the weekend Hamas also targeted local and foreign media organisations. The people of Gaza, like the people across the region, have an absolute right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Hamas should not think that while the attention of the world is elsewhere we will turn a blind eye to their actions&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.3/1">The Government have not made such an assessment. The Government and the EU Commission regularly discuss with Turkey the political reforms required for the EU accession process. However, the Government believes that it is for the Government of Turkey to decide upon amendments to their own constitution.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.2/1">The UK Government and its officials in San'a have been in constant contact with senior Government of Yemen figures, including with the President, during the course of the current crisis. We continue to watch developments closely. Large numbers of Yemenis have given a clear indication to the Government of Yemen that they want change: political reform, greater employment opportunities and an end to corruption. The President has accepted that it is time for him to go, but has publicly stated his intention to remain in power until the end of 2011. The position of the protestors and the official opposition is that President Saleh should immediately relinquish his authority to others and stand down. We have strongly urged all parties to act with restraint, avoid resorting to violence and to urgently engage in constructive dialogue to reach a peaceful transition. It is for the Yemeni people to reach agreement on their political future. But we strongly believe that the process of political transition should start now.</p>
