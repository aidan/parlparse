	<p pid="a.98.2/14">Our aim is to maintain morale and promote stable levels of retention through policies that genuinely reflect the priorities of our people and their families while optimising their operational effectiveness. Therefore, for example, we have improved pay and introduced new equipment. We have improved accommodation and continue to do so pledging &pound;8 billion over a 10-year period. We have also made improvements to travel allowances to permit personnel to get home more easily and we continue to refine the operational welfare package while also promoting measures such as work/life balance and career breaks to improve the day-to-day lives of service personnel and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/15">However, it is true that there are significant challenges in keeping some groups up to strength. Consequently some areas, for example the infantry and medical specialist, are busier than intended. Retention measures such as commitment bonuses, re-engagement packages, and financial retention initiatives (FRI) continue to be used to encourage longer service, improve morale and reduce voluntary outflow. There is a FRI in place for infantry soldiers at the four-year point, and more than 2,000 soldiers have signed up for this package.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.5/1">DfID's objectives for CDC are that it should: invest in the creation and growth of viable private businesses in poorer countries to contribute to economic growth for the benefit of the poor, and secondly, that it mobilise private investment in these markets both directly and by demonstrating profitable investments.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.5/2">In 2004, we agreed an investment policy with CDC which obliges it to make (a) 70 per cent of new investments in developing countries with less than $1,750 GNI/per capita and the remaining 30 per cent in countries below $9,095 and (b) 50 per cent of new investments in sub-Saharan Africa or south Asia. Both targets are measured on a five-year rolling basis. CDC has adopted a set of responsible business principles which covers areas such as the environment, health and safety and social and governance issues. It is prohibited from making investments in the following areas: manufacture of military equipment, illegal drugs, gambling, pornography or tobacco.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.5/3">Any possible sale of CDC is governed by Section 18 of the CDC Act 1999, which requires the Secretary of State to ensure that the Crown (or a wholly owned subsidiary of the Crown) retains at least 25 per cent of CDC's ordinary share capital and continues to hold its special share in CDC. Section 18 may be amended or repealed by statutory instrument, but such order must first be approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.8/1">Gender is an essential part of DfID's work to eliminate poverty overseas. The third millennium development goal (MDG) specifically promotes gender equality and the empowerment of women, and evidence also shows that gender equality is key to the achievement of the other MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.8/2">In line with the commitment in the UK Government's White Paper (2006) to give greater priority to gender equality, DfID carried out an evaluation of how effective the department has been at achieving gender equality and women's empowerment. This led to a three-year gender equality action plan (GEAP).</p>
	<p pid="a.99.8/3">A network of gender champions has been established across the department consisting of deputy directors, who are responsible for promoting gender equality. They report on progress against the GEAP in their divisions on a quarterly basis to the senior gender champion who is the director general for Policy and International Division and a member of DfID's top management team. Gender equality issues are reflected as a target within our first departmental strategic objective in DfID's corporate performance framework, linked to our new PSA Delivery Agreement for 2008-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.8/4">DfID will regularly review the gender equality action plan and revise it in the light of progress made and new challenges. A report on the first year's implementation of the plan will be published in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.8/5">DfID has a gender equality (duty) scheme and associated action plan covering the period 2007 to 2010. The central diversity team has a systematic process in place to monitor the agreed actions. The action plan is a living document and while the aims will stay the same, the diversity team is in the process of updating the plans to reflect any changes and to show progress. This will feed into DfID's 2007-08 Annual Diversity Report.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.8/6">Gender equality is a priority for DfID. There are no plans that overall staffing forecasts will change this direction.</p>
