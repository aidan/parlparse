	<p pid="a.98.3/85">The elections for the Greater London Assembly and London Mayor in 2000 also used e-counting of ballot papers, but this was permitted under the terms of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and was not an electoral pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.3/86">There has been no manual checking of the e-counting results. However, there was a manual recount of the ballot papers at the Chester-le-Street, Derwentside and Wear Valley joint pilot in May 2003. This recount was requested after three recounts by the e-counting technology produced different results. It was subsequently identified that these discrepancies arose because the ballot papers that the e-counting systems had rejected as requiring adjudication had been adjudicated in a different manner each time they were checked.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.2/1">The criminal statistics, published annually, do not categorise offences against children who have been sexually or physically abused in this way. The Home Office Court Proceedings database, can identify sexual or physical offences against children only where the age of the victim is identified by the offence. It does not hold information on the individual circumstances of the offence, thus the status of the defendant and relationship between victim and offender is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">A research paper by the Home Office published in 1998, entitled <i>Sex Offending against children: Understanding the risk </i>indicates that while individuals who sexually abuse children are an extremely varied group, around three-quarters of perpetrators who sexually assault children are known to them with about 80 per cent of offences taking place in the home of either the offender or victim.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.2/1">For all federal and regional elections in Belgium (including for the Chamber and Senate), candidates must be Belgian by birth or be naturalised Belgian; be in full possession of their civil and political rights (the right to vote can be withdrawn if convicted of serious criminal offences); be at least 21 years-old; and be resident in Belgium. There is no stipulation on the number of years resident in Belgium or the number of years since naturalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/2">To stand for election to the French S&eacute;nat, one must be a French national and resident in France. There are no limitations for naturalised French citizens on how long they need to have had French nationality before they can stand.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/3">In Luxembourg the closest body to an upper chamber is the Conseil d'Etat (Council of State). It consists of 21 Members, of which a minimum of 11 have to hold lawyers' degrees. They are nominated by the Grand Duke. Candidates must be a Luxembourger (there is a five-year minimum residency to obtain citizenship); a resident of the country (no minimum time for EU 14 citizens); and be at least 30 years of age, with the exception of the Crown Prince. Membership ends after 15 years, or when a member turns 72.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/4">In Austria the Bundesrat functions as the &quot;second chamber&quot;, representing the interests of the federal provinces in the legislative process. The 62 Members of the Bundesrat are not directly elected but are chosen by the regional parliaments (Landtag) in each of the nine federal provinces (Bundesland), in proportion to the representation of the politcal parties within the respective regional parliament. The candidates do not have to be Members of the regional parliament, but must fulfil the criteria to be elected to the Landtag. These are: Austrian nationality; having the main residence (Hauptwohnsitz) in the relevant Bundesland; no criminal record.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/5">Members of the Upper House (the Bundesrat) in Germany are appointed by the governments of the federal states (the Lander). As specified in the Federal Basic Law (Grundgesetz), Article 51(1), they must be Members of the respective Land government. In most Lander, the Minister President (Head of the Land Government) can freely pick their Ministers. They usually do not have to be Members of the Land parlaiment, or even necessarily resident in the Land. In theory, Lander could impose their own residence criteria for membership of their governments, but in practice none does so and any such criteria would need to be compatible with German federal law.</p>
