	<p pid="a.365.2/1">All-party groups (APGs) are informal cross-party groups that have no official status within Parliament. The register of all-party groups was set up by a resolution of the House of Commons in 1985 and the rules governing APGs are set by the Commons, on advice from the Committee on Standards and Privileges and the Administration Committee, which both have an interest in APGs. The Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, again based in the Commons, is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the rules on APGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-17">17 February</phrase>, the Commons approved changes to the rules governing APGs, following recommendations originally made by the previous commissioner in 2006 as part of his investigation of a complaint into lobbying and APGs. Those recommendations were published in the ninth report of the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges in May 2006 and some (though not the one in question) were later modified and again published (in the committee's eighth report of 2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="a.365.2/3">No committee of the Lords, or any officials from the Lords, was consulted at any stage about the recommendations. However, the Committee on Standards and Privileges wrote to all registered groups in June 2006 to ask them for their views on the recommendations. I understand that very few responses were received and none opposed the recommendation in question.</p>

	<p pid="a.368.2/4">Data for the January 2011 CPI were collected between 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January</phrase>, which are the earliest data that have ever been collected for a January index. The timing of this collection is consistent, though, with the standard approach for the CPI where collection takes place around the second or third Tuesday of the month.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.2/5">The data collection for the CPI is designed to capture the prices paid by consumers for the goods and services that they purchase, including when they are on sale. This means that no adjustments are required in order to capture new year sales prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.2/6">The additional measures that were put in place (for example, asking each of the 20,000 retailers visited how they implemented the increase to value added tax) to complement the already existing robust approach to data collection mean that the January 2011 CPI does reflect the increase in the rate of value added tax to 20 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.370.0/1">It is essential that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is able to pay out compensation to all eligible policyholders. Without certainty of payout, consumer protection is substantially weakened. It is therefore vital that the FSCS is able to raise resources in a range of circumstances to compensate consumers effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/2">The FSCS is funded by levies on firms authorised by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The rules governing the FSCS are set by the FSA. FSA-authorised firms are grouped into classes and each class has an annual limit on contributions to compensation costs. Following public consultation in 2007, the FSA set these thresholds at what was considered to be an affordable level for each class and sub-class.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/3">For firms that may be unable to pay any levy costs in one lump sum, the FSA has also facilitated an instalment arrangement with Premium Credit Ltd (PCL). PCL takes monthly instalments from firms at a competitive rate of interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.372.6/1">National citizen service (NCS) will help to build a more cohesive, responsible and engaged society by bringing together young people from different backgrounds, working in teams to challenge themselves and achieve socially beneficial outcomes in their areas. Young people will benefit from the opportunity to work, and build lasting friendships, with other young people whom they may not otherwise have met; to stretch themselves by undertaking challenging and rewarding activities; and to take responsibility for planning and delivering a social action project in their community. Society as a whole will benefit from the projects delivered by NCS participants and from the enhanced confidence and responsibility that NCS will engender in those who complete it. We hope that NCS will encourage young people to remain actively engaged in their local communities after the completion of the NCS summer programme and we are looking at ways in which we can actively support this by signposting alumni to opportunities. The Government intend to pilot NCS for two years, with over 11,000 places available to 16 year-olds in England in summer 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.6/2">NCS does not seek to replace or replicate the work of youth services; it is intended to be a new, common experience for all 16 year-olds at a key juncture in their lives. The Government are working with the sector to develop a new vision for young people and young people's services and expect to publish a new policy statement later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.374.5/1">For the purposes of the 2010 performance tables, the humanities element of the English baccalaureate measure was either history or geography. We have not included religious education (RE) as fulfilling the humanity requirement of the English baccalaureate because it is, and remains, compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. One of the intentions of the English baccalaureate is to encourage wider take-up of geography and history in addition to, rather than instead of, compulsory RE.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.5/2">We will continue to monitor the teaching of RE as we do at present through the school workforce census, which will collect information annually on the subjects being taught by all teachers in maintained secondary schools; through trends in GCSE entry; and through Ofsted's triennial subject survey report of RE, which will look at the quality of teaching. We will also consider any representations about the English baccalaureate measure and review the precise definition of the English baccalaureate for the 2011 performance tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.375.2/1">Integration is an integral part of the big society. As the Prime Minister set out in his recent speech in Munich, integration is fostered by meaningful and active participation in society, which is achieved by shifting the balance of power away from the state and towards the people, and by initiatives such as the national citizen service. DCLG is considering what additional, specific activities are needed to improve integration and to overcome divisions in communities. We are working to develop a cross-government approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.375.5/2">Black and minority ethnic communities and community groups already have a strong history of developing innovative solutions to their problems. The work to decentralise power to communities through the new rights in the Localism Bill and open public sector service provision to voluntary sector providers will enable all communities to take control of services and make them more effective and focused on their needs. Support will be put in place to enable communities and community groups to engage with and benefit from these new rights and opportunities.</p>
