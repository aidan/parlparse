	<p pid="a.39.3/2">An estimate of the potential cost of a new building for the Appellate Committee would require a detailed investigation of the requirements, but it is clear that a new building, of high architectural merit, in the heart of London, would be very costly.

	<p pid="a.40.2/4">The UK policy on population was presented to the UN Conference on Population in Mexico in 1984 and Population and Development in Cairo in 1994. The following statement was presented and remains the official UK policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/5">'The United Kingdom government does not pursue a population policy in the sense of actively trying to influence the overall size of the population, its age-structure, or the components of change except in the field of immigration. Nor has it expressed a view about the size of population, or the age-structure, that would be desirable for the United Kingdom. Its primary concern is for the well-being of the population, although it continually monitors demographic trends and developments. The current level of births has not been the cause of general anxiety. The prevailing view is that decisions about fertility and childbearing are for people themselves to make, but that it is proper for government to provide individuals with the information and the means necessary to make their decisions effective. To this end, the government provides assistance with family planning as part of the National Health Service. The 'ageing' of the population does raise social and economic issues. However, it is believed that these will prove manageable; and also, to a degree, that society will adapt'.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/6">Population matters are taken into account in formulating economic and social policy. Many aspects of economic and social policy will, of course, influence population change'.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.6/1">We have agreed a procedure with Spain and the Commission allowing aviation measures to be unblocked without prejudicing any party's position on sovereignty or affecting day-to-day operations at Gibralter airport. When such a measure is brought forward, the Commission will judge whether or not it places obligations on airports. If so, the Council and Commission will agree to the insertion of the clauses suspending application until the implementation of the 1987 Joint Declaration of the UK and Spain on Gibralter airport, which have featured in previous measures.

It would be intolerable if all air travellers were denied the benefit of such measures because of delay caused by disagreement between the UK and Spain over Gibralter, and the refusal of the Government of Gibralter to join discussions to resolve such problems under the Brussels process.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.2/1">Schools and local education authorities have duties to identify and make provision for the learning difficulties of children with special educational needs, including those with autistic spectrum disorders, and to give them access to a broad curriculum suitable to their needs. The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice gives statutory guidance on how to achieve this. The Department for Education and Skills' Autism Working Group will shortly be publishing guidance setting out the key principles underpinning proper provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders and pointers to good practice. This guidance takes into account the work of the West Midlands SEN Regional Partnership, which has been focusing on autism provision, and the National Autistic Society's Accreditation Programme. The working group intends to monitor the response to its guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">Ofsted has a regular cycle of inspection of maintained schools, non-maintained special schools and independent schools which cater wholly or mainly for children with SEN, including schools which make provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders. In determining their judgments, Ofsted inspectors have to consider the extent to which pupils with SEN are making progress and how well the teaching meets pupils' diverse needs. Ofsted will also be monitoring the implementation of the revised SEN Code of Practice and the new Inclusion framework. Special schools, including autism-specific special schools, have a vital role to play in the new arrangements through using their expertise to help mainstream schools include children with SEN. I have established a working group on the role special schools which will look at how to develop this aspect of special schools' work.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.9/2">In November 2000, following public consultation, Adam Ingram, the then Northern Ireland Minister of State, made a commitment to Parliament to deliver a purpose designed Juvenile Justice Centre for Northern Ireland at Rathgael in Bangor. His statement went to say that while the new centre was being built, young people already in the system would be transferred to the Rathgael campus.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.9/3">Since then a phased development programme has commenced. The first phase involves upgrading security and refurbishing the existing accommodation on the Rathgael site to facilitate the transfer of young people from Lisnevin. Phase 1 of the programme is scheduled for completion by late 2002. On completion, Lisnevin will close and Rathgael will function as the single Juvenile Justice Centre for Northern Ireland and will operate until the new purpose-designed centre is constructed and commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.9/4">The second phase relates to provision of the new, purpose-designed centre, to be located on available land at Rathgael. When fully commissioned, the new centre will replace the phase 1 facility. Planning the Phase 2 project is at an early stage. Phase 2 is estimated to take about four years to complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.8/8">The Government have not had detailed discussions with the relevant local authorities about this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.8/9">The Highways Agency manages the trunk roads and motorways in England. The GLRN was defined by powers contained in section 14A of the Highways Act 1980 (inserted by section 260 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999). Roads designated as part of the GLRN under this power thereby ceased to be trunk roads. The Government have no plans to resume responsibility for these roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/1">There is no official estimate of the additional congestion cost caused by deregulation of Royal Mail. However, a study of the costs of road and rail transport, published in August 2001, was carried out by the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds on behalf of the department. This showed that the congestion costs of an additional vehicle varied according to location and vehicle type.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/2">For Light Goods Vehicles, those most likely to be used by Royal Mail, the typical figures in 2001 prices were:</p>

	<p pid="a.50.9/1">The duty incentives set for road fuel gases are aimed predominantly at improvements in local air quality where cleaner fuels have a key role to play. The reduced rate of duty for biodiesel, which will take effect from Royal Assent of this year's Finance Bill, contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A direct comparison between the fuels is therefore not appropriate.</p>
