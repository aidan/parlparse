	<p pid="a.153.5/1">Eligibility to take part in the Erasmus student exchange programme, as a strand of the European Community's Socrates education and training programme, is confined to students from the member states, the other European Economic Area countries and the accession countries. However, students and higher education institutions from Israel and the Palestinian Authority are eligible to participate in the wider higher education co-operation arrangements under the European Community's Tempus programme and through student and researcher scholarships and partnerships between higher education institutions in the new Erasmus Mundus programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.0/1">The proposal to unify the appeal system for asylum and immigration appeals is, of course, subject to parliamentary approval. However, in announcing their proposals, the Government decided to advise lay members of its intention that the new, unified tribunal should comprise legally qualified members only. This was not done to pre-empt the will of Parliament but to provide lay members with adequate notice that the Government did not envisage a role for them in the new tribunal.</p>
