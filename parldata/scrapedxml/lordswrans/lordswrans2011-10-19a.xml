	<p pid="a.67.2/2">In summer 2011, we launched the higher apprenticeship fund, with &#163;25 million to support the creation of up to 10,000 advanced and higher apprenticeships over the next four years, giving firms in sectors such as advanced manufacturing, information technology and engineering the hi-tech skills they need to grow. Professional bodies were amongst those encouraged to respond. The deadline for proposals closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-16">16 September</phrase> and these are now being evaluated. The outcome will be announced in November.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/3">In addition, we have asked the Technician Council to look at the issue of professional registration for people graduating from apprenticeships, and anticipate its advice in the new year. This will include examining the extent to which apprenticeship frameworks currently lead towards registration, and if there are further steps that professional bodies or others might take to offer more help to people to attain this goal.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/4">It is important that professional bodies are involved from the outset in the development of apprenticeship frameworks, in particular at the higher level, to ensure that these lead towards eligibility for membership and professional status. Apprenticeship framework developers have considerable experience of working with professional bodies within their sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.0/1">The UK is one of the major donors to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) election process. We have already provided &#163;26.1 million with a further &#163;5 million committed by end of 2012 for the 2007-13 electoral cycle. While we are not funding election observation directly, we pushed strongly for the EU election observation mission. This is deployed for a period of three and a half months, from the end of September 2011 until mid-January 2012. The first long-term observers are now in the country. We also remain in close contact with partners, including the Carter Center, African Union, and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Catholic Church, and the Electoral Institute for the Sustainability of Democracy in Africa (EISA) about their observation missions.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/2">We are funding disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, resettlement, and reintegration (DDRRR) programmes to encourage the surrender of members of the armed groups in eastern DRC. These programmes combined with the continued military pressure from the Congolese army (FARDC) are helping to reduce the threat of armed groups, substantially reducing their number over the past two years. We welcome the improved relationships between DRC, Rwanda and Uganda and the strengthened co-operation this signifies. We will continue to engage with these countries to encourage greater co-ordination on regional security issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/3">We, alongside international partners, are working to ensure that the DRC's mineral wealth is brought under legitimate control, as a source of revenue for the state and the local population, and to restrict financial support to armed groups. Further information about our work on conflict minerals is available online at ww.fco.gov.uk/conflictminerals.</p>

We do, however, provide funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) including for the reconstruction of homes and public buildings. We are therefore concerned that only 28 per cent of UNRWA's programme of work for Gaza has been approved by Israel and that difficulties in securing materials for reconstruction projects continues to delay progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.5/1">The design and timing of the auction is a matter for Ofcom, following a direction from the Government in December 2010. In the light of the detailed responses to an earlier consultation dealing with the design of the combined auction and competition issues in the mobile sector, Ofcom is planning to consult again based on a revised analysis with, as before, a range of options dealing with auction design and competition. The consultation will be issued towards the end of this year with the auction expected to take place in the last quarter of 2012. It is important to note that the bands would not be available for new use until 2013 in any case as they are still being cleared of existing users so this delay is unlikely to have an impact on the availability of new services to the consumer.</p>

We are deeply concerned at the continuing violent repression of civilians by the Syrian regime. The United Nation's latest estimate is that more than 2,900 people have been killed in Syria since March 2011. The UK is at the forefront of international action to put pressure on President Assad and his regime to immediately end the violence, release all prisoners of conscience and allow free, unhindered and immediate access to the UN for an independent assessment of the situation on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.3/1">The UK has been very active in increasing international pressure on President Assad and his regime to stop its violent repression of civilians. This has included EU sanctions including an oil embargo. We continue to work with EU partners to consider what further sanctions are appropriate. We seek to avoid as far as possible any negative impact on the civilian population. We will continue to use these principles to guide our assessment on further EU sanctions.</p>
