	<p pid="b.13.2/1">The northbound carriageway of the newly constructed A1(M) between Wetherby to Walshford was dug up and re-laid because of damage to the lower layers of the pavement during construction, resulting in the premature failure of the road surface. The cost of this work is a matter for and borne by the Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) Company, Road Management Services Ltd, and its contractors. No additional costs will fall to the Highways Agency as a result of this failure. Further investigations on the southbound carriageway are being carried out to see whether similar repairs will be needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.2/1">Under the guaranteed standard of performance for supply restoration following severe weather the time at which customers are entitled to compensation depends on the scale of the event. For medium-size events, customers are entitled to compensation once they have been off supply for 24 hours. For large weather events, customers are entitled to compensation once they have been off supply for 48 hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/2">For very large events consultation with the industry suggested that the restoration times that could reasonably be expected increased more than proportionally with the size of the event. Some companies suggested that a square factor was more representative. Therefore the period is calculated using the following formula:</p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/3">48 hours x ( <i>Number of customers affected </i>35% <i>of customers</i> ) <sup>2</sup></p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/4">For any given distribution company the number of exposed customers is the number of customers supplied from mixed or overhead high-voltage circuits that may be affected by severe weather. For example, there are 270,000 exposed customers for WPD South-West.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/5">Suppose severe gales lead to 300,000 customers being interrupted in the WPD South-West area. The period when compensation is due will be:</p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/6">48 hours x ( 300,000 270,000)= 59 hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/7">The formula reflects the impact of the scale of such events on reasonable restoration times.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/8">Events are excluded from the arrangements where more than 60 per cent of exposed customers are affected in any distributor's area. Sixty per cent of exposed customers for an average distributor is 500,000 customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.2/9">If there were no limit on the severity of weather covered by these arrangements, it is feasible that, for a very extreme event (such as the October 1987 storms), total compensation could run to many millions of pounds. The price control proposals cap each distributor's cost exposure to 2 per cent of revenue, so any compensation costs in excess of this would be passed through to customers. Without a limit on the size of event covered, an extremely severe storm could result in a significant rise in distribution charges in a subsequent year and substantial cross-subsidy between urban and rural customers.</p>

	<p pid="b.17.8/1">There are two phases of traffic management during the works at the junction of the M2 and the A299. The first phase, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">1 June 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-23">23 July 2005</phrase>, closes the hard shoulder in both directions to allow work to be carried out safely on the road verge.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.8/2">The second phase, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-24">24 July 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-19">19 August 2005</phrase>, will open the hard shoulder to traffic while closing lane two on both carriageways. Again, this is to allow safe working in the central reserve.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.8/3">The traffic flows at the junction show that only one running lane is essential. Since one running lane will be provided in both directions at all times, delays as a result of the traffic management are unlikely.

This guidance is in line with the requirements of the Public Disclosure Act 1998, which gives significant statutory protection to employees who disclose information in the public interest and are victimised for doing so. The Act covers all employees, including trainees, agency staff, home workers and all self-employed NHS professionals that is doctors, dentists, optometrists and pharmacists.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.2/1">HMRC's code of practice 26, <i>What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?</i> explains that where claimants have been paid too much they will normally be expected to pay back the overpayment. However, it also describes a number of measures to protect against hardship being caused by the recovery of an overpayment.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.2/2">First, when a person's circumstances change, the revenue will adjust the payments for the remainder of the year with the aim of paying them the right amount over the year as a whole. This can sometimes lead to a considerable reduction in payments for the rest of that year. HMRC can make additional tax credit payments to prevent this reduction causing hardship. In 2003&ndash;04, the Revenue made additional tax credits payments to around 32,500 claimants. In the period 2004&ndash;05, HMRC made additional tax credits payments to around 10,000 claimants. Secondly, where someone has an overpayment for a previous tax year, HMRC will, where possible, recover it by deduction from the tax credit payments for the current year. There are automatic limits on the amounts that will be deducted from payments, and these are designed to prevent hardship.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.2/3">Where there is no award in the current year, the claimant will receive a &quot;notice to pay&quot; which explains that they can pay back the overpayment in 12 monthly instalments if they wish. In around 153,000 direct recovery cases, HMRC has agreed that customers can pay back their overpayment in 12 monthly instalments. It has also agreed that around 20,000 customers can pay in instalments over a longer period.</p>
