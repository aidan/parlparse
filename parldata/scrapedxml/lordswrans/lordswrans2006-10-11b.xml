ISAF forces are also authorised to provide training and operational support to Afghan counter-narcotics forces. But ISAF has not been deployed to take direct action against the drugs trade or to eradicate the opium poppy in the fields. That is a job for the Afghan Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.38/1">Using a definition of a missile as a surface-to-surface rocket, we can make the following estimate. Before the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel that began on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July</phrase>, Hezbollah claimed, and Israel agreed, that Hezbollah had approximately 12,000 rockets. We have no way of independently verifying this figure, but have no reason to think it was false. During the conflict Hezbollah fired approximately 4,000 of its rockets, reducing its stockpile by about one third. We therefore broadly assess that there are about 8,000 rockets remaining in Hezbollah's arsenal. There are no estimates available on the division between short and long range rockets. However, around 90 per cent of rockets fired were short range and this ratio is possibly reflected in the remaining stockpile.</p>
