	<p pid="a.61.2/1">In England and Wales hearings in the High Court may only take place in private in the limited circumstances set out in Part 39 of the Civil Procedure Rules. A practice direction, supporting the relevant rule of court, specifically requires the judge to have regard to Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights in exercising this discretion. The High Court has held that Part 39 of the rules is compatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In Scotland, the Court of Session's practice is to hold all interim hearings in open court and announce the calling over the public address system. Only in exceptional circumstances would an interim hearing be held in chambers.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.0/1">The Prison Service has no such plans but keeps under review the efficacy of arrangements for the management of sex offenders. Sex offenders may be serving sentences from a few months to life and it is unlikely that it would be practicable or beneficial to manage such a diverse population through a central unit. However, the Prison Service's sex offender treatment programme is supported from the centre, thus providing a co-ordinating mechanism for the development, training, delivery and evaluation of relevant treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the Chief Statistician, Mr Len Cook, dated January 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question regarding what Her Majesty's Government intend to achieve by the &quot;National Survey of Time Use&quot; and the &quot;People, Families and Communities Survey 2001&quot;. [HL2507]</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/4">Time is a valuable resource. Understanding how people use time is increasingly important in developing government policy and delivering public services, There are, however, no official statistics on this. The first UK Time Use Survey was therefore conducted in 2000&ndash;01. It was carried out on behalf of the Office for National Statistics, The Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Education and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions and the Economic and Social Research Council. The Survey was commissioned following an analysis of need, and is intended to support a wide range of policy issues. It will provide detailed statistical information on the breakdown of time use by the UK population on the UK policy issues. First results from the survey are due to be published in March.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/5">Some examples of specific areas of use are: time taken to travel to work; time spent on voluntary tasks; activities of the unemployed; and the balance between work and leisure. The survey will provide a resource to call on over a number of years. The indications are that the use of time does change, but perhaps in a rather slow and evolutionary way.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/6">The 2001 Home Office Citizenship Survey is the first Home Office funded survey into citizenship in England and Wales. It is another major policy tool, informing the development and implementation of policies on civil renewal, families, active communities and race relations. It is the only source of performance monitoring information for these policy areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/7">The survey collects information on: race equality, including attitudes towards and experiences of various public services; voluntary and community activities, including reasons why people do not participate; and family networks and sources of parenting support.</p>

This Act introduced a new offence of intentional or reckless disturbance to any species of cetacean or basking shark. It was already an offence to intentionally kill, injure or take any protected marine species under the Wildlife and Countyside Act 1981.

	<p pid="a.71.0/1">The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) is currently co-ordinating the fourth Quinquennial Review (QQR) of the schedules to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Based on representations made to it, the JNCC will make recommendations to government on possible amendments to the schedules. Criteria for the selection of species for the current round have already been established, but all representations will be considered in determining the criteria for the next QQR.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">The criteria for the selection of UK Biodiversity Action Plan species were first determined by the UK Biodiversity Steering Group in its report published in December 1995. The criteria for selecting marine species were subsequently reviewed by the marine sub-group. The sub-group took particular account of the limited knowledge surrounding distribution and population dynamics of species other than those that had been subject to recent and long-term survey analysis. It supplemented the original criteria with the following guidelines to produce a revised list of marine species: wide-ranging species which cannot be protected within a designated habitat; vulnerability to damage by pollution or physical disturbance such as trawling; low fecundity; high age of first maturity; inability to recolonise an area after loss or removal due to particular developmental biology (sessile species with benthic larvae or brooding young).</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/3">The revised list of priority species and action plans for a further 10 individual marine species and six groups of marine species were published in October 1999. Implementation of the marine species action plans is being co-ordinated by the UK Marine Biodiversity Action Plan Co-ordinating Group.</p>

The herds affected are those in annual test frequency parishes that have missed the six and 12-month tests carried out after the lifting of movement restrictions put in place after an earlier TB incident. A veterinary risk assessment has shown that these have been historically more at risk of being infected with TB than herds with other types of TB test. The measure is expected to affect up to 1,250 herds mainly in the south and west of England. In addition, we are introducing additional checks on herds that have been reformed after FMD. These herds will be TB tested at 12 and 24 months after the normal TB check test at three months after restocking.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.3/1">I am pleased to announce that, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March</phrase>, all affirmative statutory instruments laid before the House will be accompanied by an explanatory memorandum which will be a fuller document than the existing explanatory note. This is intended to assist Parliament in considering the instrument. The new memoranda will be in addition to the explanatory notes, which will continue to be printed with statutory instruments.</p>
