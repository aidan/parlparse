	<p pid="b.5.0/1">In January 2003, the Medical Research Council (MRC), through the Military Health Research Advisory Group (MHRAG), undertook a comprehensive review of relevant Gulf research. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-27">27 January</phrase>, MHRAG held a private meeting with a number of scientists from the UK and overseas and then met separately on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-28">28 January</phrase> to appraise the MRC of scientific progress, of the potential for gaining further knowledge and of research needs, and of what the likely medical issues might be. The report, <I>MRC Review of Research into UK Gulf Veterans' Illnesses</I>, was published in May 2003 and is currently available on the MRC website<sup>1</sup>. The membership of the MHRAG was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/2">Professor Catherine Peckham (chair): Institute of Child Health, London Professor Bryn Bridges: Genome Damage &amp; Stability Centre, Sussex Professor David Coggon: MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit, SouthamptonProfessor Dudley Goodhead: MRC Radiation &amp; Genome Stability Unit, HarwellProfessor George Griffin: St George's Hospital Medical School, London Professor Pierluigi Nicotera: MRC Toxicology Unit, Leicester Professor George Davey-Smith: University of Bristol, Bristol Professor Nick Tarrier: Manchester University (Withington Hospital), ManchesterProfessor Andrew McMichael: MRC Human Immunology Unit, OxfordDr Frances Murphy (observer): Department of Veterans' Affairs Washington, USA</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/3">Mr Nick Blatchley (observer): MoD Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit, London</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/4">The review was conducted in London and, in addition to the expenses incurred by members of the MHRAG, the travel expenses of individuals invited to the private meeting were also supported. These included: eleven participants from the UK (Aberdeen (1), Bristol (1), Cambridge (1), Cardiff (1), Glasgow (1), Leicester (2), Liverpool (1), London (14), Manchester (1), Oxford (1) and Porton Down (1)); two from France (Bordeaux (1) and Strasbourg (1)); three from Canada (Alberta (1) and Ottawa (2)); and five from the United States (Iowa City (1) and Washington DC (4)).</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/5">The MRC did not consult directly with the Gulf War Veterans and Families Association before undertaking the review. A representative from the Royal British Legion attended the private meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January 2003</phrase> and all relevant information on the review has been made available on the MRC website. Following the review, the Ministry of Defence (MoD), which is the lead government department on Gulf veterans' illnesses issues, wrote to veterans organisations to report on the outcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/6">The 2003 review did not include an assessment of published or emerging research at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/7">One of the recommendations of the 2003 review was that MoD should replicate US neuroimaging studies in the United Kingdom. A further review of this recommendation was conducted in January 2005 and it was concluded that this area of work should not be taken forward at this time. At present, the MRC has not conducted subsequent strategic reviews of more recent research findings.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.0/1">The new rural development regulation, agreed in September 2005, provides member states with a framework to target funding from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development during the next programming period: 2007-2013. To unlock this funding the regulation requires us to submit to the EU Commission a national strategy plan plus an accompanying, and more detailed, programme document.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/2">The national strategy plan is the term the EU Commission uses for a strategy that sets out at a high level; our priorities for action; a summary of the evidence base for our approach across the rural development programme's objectives; and, information about how we will co-ordinate rural development funding with other EU derived funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/3">The regulation requires the strategy to be developed at member state level. As rural development is an area of devolved responsibility, there will be an overarching UK national strategy plan, highlighting the common themes between our four countries, with annexes covering the strategies for rural development in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/4">We expect the EU Commission to respond to the strategy this autumn. However, the Commission does not formally approve the strategy and submission of the strategy is not dependent on having agreement on overall budgets. Therefore it is unlikely that there will be any delay in applying the strategy as a result of the Commission's response to it.</p>

The possible costs of delay have not been calculated in any detail and it would require significant effort to do so. However, in the event of a delay in the introduction of charges until April 2008, it is estimated that some &pound;80 million to &pound;90 million of income from customers would be forgone. Additionally access to the borrowing power of up to &pound;200 million annually under the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative is conditional upon the introduction of water charging. In the absence of detailed costing, the range of &pound;130 million to &pound;180 million represents an indicative estimate of the impact of delay.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.8/1">The red squirrel is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. In addition, it benefits from an individual species action plan that is led by the UK Red Squirrel Group, a consortium including all the UK conservation agencies and the Forestry Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.8/2">The majority of red squirrel habitats remaining in England are conifer plantations and do not receive statutory protection as SSSIs, as Natural England believes this would do little to improve their conservation and management. However, the Forestry Commission plays an important role in agreeing and delivering management plans for many of these sites, and also provides woodland grants to assist in the delivery of biodiversity targets. This strategy provides the best chances of maintaining a red squirrel population on mainland England.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.8/3">In southern England, the red squirrel population does occupy some areas that are statutorily protected as SSSIs. These include parts of the two largest areas of woodland on the island, Parkhurst Forest and Briddlesford Woods. The other remaining English stronghold for the red squirrel is in the north of England. A major partnership project, Red Alert North England, is underway to manage 16 forests as red squirrel reserves, with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Partners include the Forestry Commission, which is responsible for the management of more than half the reserve area, Natural England and the Wildlife Trusts for Northumberland, Cumbria and Lancashire.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.2/1">Natterjack toads are strictly protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994. Therefore, the places they use for breeding, resting, sheltering and protection are protected wherever the species occurs, regardless of whether the land has some statutory designation. The areas they are recorded to occupy can be found in the National Biodiversity Gateway (<a href="http://www.searchnbn.net">www.searchnbn.net</a>).</p>
