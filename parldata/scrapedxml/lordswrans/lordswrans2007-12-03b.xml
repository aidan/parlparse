	<p pid="b.154.2/1">The department is fully committed to implementing the ContactPoint system. Before it is put into service, ContactPoint will go through extensive user acceptance testing by practitioners to ensure that the system meets their needs and is fit for purpose. It will also be subject to rigorous penetration testing by people who are experts in the IT security field and approved by the Communications and Electronics Security Group.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/2">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families (Kevin Brennan) and I have today made the following Written Ministerial Statement about funding and implementation of ContactPoint:</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/3">I am announcing today levels of funding to local authorities to support the implementation of ContactPoint and providing an update on the implementation timetable.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/4">To support local implementation until March 2009, &pound;40 million will be made available, made up of the following elements:</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/5">&pound;27 million to local authorities in England, from April 2008 to March 2009, to support implementation;&pound;1 million from April 2008 to March 2009 to support national partners' ContactPoint implementation projects;a further &pound;12 million from January 2008, made available to lead organisations to support modifications to case management systems. This will enable the main existing systems to provide data to ContactPoint and/or for authorised users to be able to have one-way access to ContactPoint via those systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/6">We have also provided indicative funding allocations to local authorities for future years: &pound;27 million in 2009-10 and &pound;15 million in 2010-11. My officials will write to local authorities and national partners today to inform local authorities and other partners about this funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/7">ContactPoint is a key element of the <I>Every Child Matters</I> programme to transform children's services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. ContactPoint will provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/8">ContactPoint will be a simple basic online tool containing:</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/9">minimal identifying information for each child, and name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details for parents or carers; each child will also have a unique identifying number;contact details for the child's educational setting and GP practice and for other practitioners or services working with them; and an indication as to whether a service or practitioner holds an assessment under the common assessment framework or whether they are a lead professional for that child.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/10">No case information will be held on ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/11">ContactPoint is being developed with extensive input from a wide range of stakeholders. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/12">delivery partners&mdash;local authorities and national partners (for example, voluntary and community sector organisations);practitioners and managers from across children's services, and bodies that represent them; andchildren, young people and parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/13">Over the last few months, we have been considering the substantial stakeholder feedback that we have received and we have looked at the implications that the resulting proposed changes could have on the system. It is clear from the considerable work that we have done so far that we will need more time than we originally planned to address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users suggested.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/14">The change to the timetable will mean that deployment of ContactPoint to the &quot;early adopters&quot; local authorities and national partners will be in September or October 2008. It will be deployed to all other local authorities and national partners in 2009, between January and May, depending on final deployment slots. The additional time available presents a number of opportunities to do more work in the period prior to ContactPoint deployment, which will help to realise some benefits earlier. The fundamental design of ContactPoint will not change; the alterations will make sure that the system works even more effectively for users and improves the ability of local authority ContactPoint teams to manage user access.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/15">The news on <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 20 November</phrase> of the loss of large volumes of child benefit data from HMRC has raised questions about the safety of large-scale personal data in other government systems, including ContactPoint. ContactPoint will not contain any financial information (such as bank details) or case information (such as case notes, assessments, medical records, exam results or subjective observations).</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/16">On <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>, the department conducted an assessment of how personal data are stored and protected in the department. As a result of that assessment, I am confident that we have very robust procedures in place. On <phrase class="date" code="">Wednesday 21 November</phrase>, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. In light of the security breach at HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure that standards are as high as they can be. To this end, on <phrase class="date" code="">20 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided to commission an independent assessment of its security procedures. This will be undertaken by Deloitte. Delaying the implementation of ContactPoint will enable the independent assessment of security procedures to take place as well as address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users have told us that they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.2/17">Delivery partners will receive further information early in the new year. In the mean time, progress will be reported to local project managers regularly through their ContactPoint implementation co-ordinators. They will work with individual authorities and national partners to agree new deployment slots as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.156.2/1">The most significant factor contributing to increases in UK carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2005 and 2006 was greater electricity generation from coal burning. The price of gas has been at a level that has meant that it is more profitable to generate electricity through the increased use of coal.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.2/2">The introduction of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) set a price on CO2 emissions. Power stations are covered by the scheme and must account for their emissions by surrendering allowances.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.2/3">In phase 1 of the EU ETS, the price of allowances fell significantly due to oversupply in the market. It is still more profitable for electricity generation to come from increased use of coal even when factoring in additional carbon costs of burning coal compared to gas.</p>
	<p pid="b.156.2/4">In phase 2 of the EU ETS, the European Commission's decision to request significant reductions on several member states' caps will help to ensure greater scarcity of allowances in the market. This should deliver a carbon price that incentivises cost-effective emission reductions and investment in clean technology.</p>

They include heavy emitters such as large electricity producers, energy-intensive activities such as iron and steel production and smaller combustion installations with a thermal input capacity above 20 megawatts (MW). The exact allocation to each UK installation is laid out in the final allocation decision for phase I. This is available on the Defra website.</p>

The electricity supply industry was expected to deliver the emission reductions that the UK's share of the phase I cap required, as it faced limited international competition and had relatively low-cost abatement opportunities.</p>

In the transmission price control, which covers the five-year period from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, a further &pound;3.8 billion of investment in the transmission network was agreed.

	<p pid="b.164.5/25">The increase in the number of new HIV diagnoses has occurred for several reasons including:</p>
	<p pid="b.164.5/26">increased testing for HIV of groups at risk of infection;the introduction of HIV antenatal screening;diagnosis of infections in the United Kingdom that were acquired abroad in countries of HIV prevalence;continuing transmission of HIV in the United Kingdom, mainly transmitted sexually between men; and the introduction of effective antiretroviral drug therapies in the mid-1990s, which may have led to an increase in HIV testing.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.5/27">HIV incidence (newly acquired infections) is currently monitored through unlinked anonymous testing of men who have sex with men across a network of 15 sentinel genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data are analysed for London and outside London. There have been no statistically significant trends since 1996 in the incidence of HIV among men who have sex with men as measured through this sentinel surveillance system. In 2006, incidence of HIV among men who have sex with men was estimated at 2.1 per cent. For London the estimated incidence was 2.6 per cent and outside London it was 1.3 per cent. Men who have sex with men who attend GUM clinics are considered to be a higher risk of HIV than the general population of men who have sex with men and therefore are likely to have a higher incidence of HIV.</p>

Those who have taken the foundation course in the UK and need to continue with their postgraduate training can apply for jobs in UK hospitals. The NHS trust will need to apply for a work permit and undertake a recruitment search to ensure that the post could not be filled by a resident worker. This complies with the normal requirements of the work permit arrangements. IMGs may apply to enter the UK under the highly skilled migrant programme (HSMP), as long as they meet the points threshold. Successful HSMP applicants have free access to the UK labour market. The medical training initiative (MTI), which is part of the training and work experience scheme (TWES), offers an additional work permit route for IMGs who may need specific training in a particular area of medical procedures. As this is specific training for the individual doctor, advertising is not appropriate. The period of approval for the MTI is limited to 24 months and requires endorsement by the deanery.</p>

	<p pid="b.168.3/1">The UK Government have consistently voiced their opposition to Japanese &quot;scientific&quot; whaling. The UK's position is that we remain strongly opposed to all lethal whaling, except for some limited subsistence whaling. We do not believe that this lethal research is necessary and consider that a great deal of this information can be obtained by non-lethal means. It is difficult not to conclude that this research is driven primarily by commercial gain rather than science and we have serious reservations as to the scientific value of this research.</p>

	<p pid="b.169.2/1">Full details of the Bank of England loan to Northern Rock are set out in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's letter to the Treasury Select Committee and Public Accounts Committee of <phrase class="date" code="">11 October</phrase>, copies of which are available in the Library, and his Statements of <phrase class="date" code="">11 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase>. The loan is secured against high-quality assets, and the Treasury's indemnity to the Bank of England will be triggered only in the event that the Bank is unable to recover its full loan. There is therefore no direct impact on the public finances at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.170.0/1">The Government welcome the work that has been carried out by the group of specialists on access to official documents in drawing up a draft convention. The Government are keen that there should be a robust convention along the lines of the Freedom of Information Act, yet moderate enough to gain wide acceptance. Any exemptions from the right of access should be proportionate to the aim of protecting other legitimate rights and interests. The Government are working closely with civil society groups on proposals for an Explanatory Memorandum that will emphasise the principles contained in a convention. These proposals concern: the definition of a public authority; possible limitations to the right of access; the establishment of time limits, including the opportunity to challenge administrative silence; the denial, review and appeal of requests; and proactive disclosure of information. The Government will continue to work closely with these groups to determine how these proposals can be reflected in the Explanatory Memorandum.</p>
