	<p pid="a.18.8/1">I am pleased to announce that we are putting in place a single, flexible crime fighting fund to help local agencies better tackle crime and drug-related crime. The new Building Safer Communities fund brings together into a single funding stream funding that was previously provided through three separate crime reduction programmes: the Communities against Drugs Programme (CAD), the Safer Communities Initiative (SCI) and the Partnership Development Fund (PDF).</p>
	<p pid="a.18.8/2">Funding for these three programmes in 2003&ndash;04, and hence for the new single fund, formed part of the package of funding to tackle crime and drug-related crime, amounting to &pound;190.2 million in total, announced by David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-21">21 January 2003</phrase>. &pound;94 million of this funding was for use by the 376 crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs) and drug action teams (DATs) across the country to help them tackle crime and drugs in their communities. &pound;82.3 million of this is now being made available to CDRPs under the Building Safer Communities Fund and the remainder, separately, to DATs.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.8/3">In announcing the new funding for CAD, the SCI and the PDF in January, the Home Secretary indicated that he wished to consult with local groups&mdash;those at the sharp end, including CDRPs, DATs, voluntary groups and national bodies concerned with crime reduction&mdash;about whether they wished to see a merger of these programmes in order to reduce the bureaucratic burden on them, thereby allowing them to concentrate on delivery rather than paperwork. There was clear support for the idea of a merger and a single pot of funding but a strong wish to ensure that the level of drugs spend was maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.8/4">Practitioners have been aware for some time that plans were being drawn up for this new fund, and activities are already well under way to spend the money, with many already drawing down grant and progressing their work. My department will today be issuing administrative guidance on how the new fund will operate and formal conditions of grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.8/5">This is a three year funding programme and CDRPs can expect to receive the same levels of funding in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. My officials are devising monitoring procedures to ensure that accountability at CDRP level for their spend, including that on drugs crime, is fully preserved, and that the balance of spend between the different aims of the CAD programme is maintained.</p>

Those that wish to charge penalty fares must submit a scheme for approval to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). The scheme has to comply with the Penalty Fares Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Transport and the Penalty Fares Rules made by the SRA. The approval process includes consultation with the relevant rail passengers committee and passenger transport executive. The London Transport Users Committee was consulted on all the London area penalty fares schemes, including Thameslink and South Central.

	<p pid="a.25.5/1">In research commissioned by Defra, an interdisciplinary panel of experts were asked to summarise the state of scientific knowledge and uncertainty and estimate the risk of a sea level rise of over four metres due to the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). The study revealed a wide range of opinions on the stability of the WAIS and concluded that it would most likely not collapse in the next few centuries, although they estimate a 50 per cent probability of WAIS causing sea level rise of at least 10mm per year within 200 years. There is still much uncertainty about the behaviour of the WAIS: whether it is still adjusting to changes after the last ice age and how it will respond to climate warming and contribute to sea level rise. Both the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Hadley Centre continue to assess the impacts of climate change on ice sheets both in the Arctic and the Antarctic through observational and modelling studies. The collapse of the WAIS over a period of centuries would raise sea levels by some six metres with a major impact on low-lying countries and coastlines.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/2">International action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the Kyoto Protocol is the first step in a long process to reduce emissions enough to stabilise greenhouse gases at a level which avoids dangerous anthropogenic climate change. There is however no international consensus as to what that level should be. The EU has proposed that carbon dioxide concentrations below 550 parts per million should guide emission reduction efforts, but what level would be required that to avoid loss of the WAIS is a matter for further research.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.3/1">The most rigorous method for measuring the cost of management would be to start with the definition of the activities that constitute management. The amount of time each member of staff spent on those activities would then be calculated and costed but even if a list of activities could be agreed upon, such a method would be prone to subjectivity and inconsistent application. It would also be extremely time-consuming and bureaucratic to undertake. The method adopted is based on management posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/2">Not all the running costs of primary care trusts and National Health Service trusts cover activities that are classed as management, unlike strategic health authorities and former health authorities, whose management cost definition includes elements for both staff and non-staff costs as their running costs do cover activities that are classed as management.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-10a.27.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="27"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030610/text/30610w03.htm#30610w03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.27.6/1">Following interest in both Houses about the issues surrounding the safety of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Seroxat, we are informing the House of new advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) against the use of Seroxat in children under the age of 18 for the treatment of depressive illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/2">New data from clinical trials in children and adolescents were received by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) at the end of May 2003. These new data have been reviewed by an expert working group on SSRIs and the CSM. These data do not demonstrate efficacy in depressive illness in this age group and show an increase in the risk of events including episodes of self-harm and potentially suicidal behaviour in the Seroxat group compared to placebo. Various analyses suggest that the risk of these events is between 1.5 and 3.2 times greater with Seroxat compared to placebo. On the basis of these data, CSM has advised that the balance of risks and benefits of Seroxat is unfavourable when used to treat depressive illness in this age group. CSM has advised that Seroxat should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years to treat depressive illness. Ministers have accepted the committee's advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/3">Seroxat is not and never has been licensed for use in those under 18 but it is used in this age group outside its licensed indications where prescribers make a judgement on their own responsibility that it is the right treatment for a particular patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/4">SSRIs, including Seroxat, have been under close continuous review by the MHRA and the CSM for a number of years with the CSM issuing advice in 2000 and 2001. The product information for SSRI antidepressants already contains advice that suicidal thoughts and behaviour are likely to increase in the early stages of treatment of depression (as with all antidepressants) and patient information leaflets already contain advice to seek medical advice urgently in the event of such symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/5">The recent concerns expressed by patient groups and in the media over the safety of Seroxat have been taken very seriously. In response to concerns of an association of Seroxat with withdrawal reactions and suicidal behaviour, a new expert working group of the CSM has been convened to further review the safety of SSRIs and to ensure the advice in the product information for both patients and prescribers is optimal for the safe use of these products. This group will be incorporating the experiences of patients in its safety evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/6">Communications to patients and prescribers are taking place today. The expert working group of the CSM, convened to look at the wider issues relating to the safety of SSRIs, will examine urgently what implications, if any, these new findings have for the use of Seroxat in adults and for other SSRIs. The benefits of taking Seroxat are well established and patients over 18 and patients who are benefiting from Seroxat should not be frightened into stopping their medication. Patients who are experiencing any side effects or are concerned about their treatment should discuss these with their doctor.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.6/7">The Government are committed to ensuring that the wider aspects of suicide prevention remain at the top of the agenda and the National Institute for Mental Health in England has made suicide prevention one of its core policy programmes.</p>
