	<p pid="a.35.6/1">The coalition Government will not hold a Care Matters Ministerial Stocktake in 2010-11. The Government are enforcing a marketing and advertising freeze as part of their drive to control expenditure and to cut the structural deficit by &#163;6.2 billion this year. Non-essential conferences are included in this freeze.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.6/2">The Government remain committed to improving outcomes for looked-after children and listening to the views and experiences of children and young people to help inform policy and improve the services they receive. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families will regularly meet groups of looked-after children and care leavers to hear their views from October 2010. The Government will also continue to use the reports produced by the Children's Rights Director, Dr Roger Morgan, which present the views of children and young people in care or leaving care on a range of issues.</p>

Spending on human resources is not routinely disaggregated from broader health system expenditure. However, in 2009 a retrospective review of health spending at country level, it was estimated that approximately 25 per cent of DfID's health spending supported human resources for health.

	<p pid="a.49.2/7">Recalling the council conclusions of June 2010 on Gaza, the European Union also stresses that for peace to be sustainable, a durable solution needs to be found for Gaza. It welcomes the recent measures announced by the Israeli Government as an important step forward. It calls for full implementation and complementary measures in order to achieve a fundamental change of policy that allows for the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza. The EU has offered its assistance for achieving this objective. The European Union calls for a solution addressing Israel's legitimate security concerns&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.2/1">Violence against women by a partner is a global public health problem and a human rights violation directly linked to women's lack of status and power. Intimate partner violence in many settings increases during pregnancy, and can have damaging, even fatal, consequences for the health of the woman and her baby. Women who are physically abused in pregnancy are more likely to suffer miscarriage or seek induced abortion and the violent partner is more likely to have multiple sexual relationships, so increasing the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/2">Female genital mutilation or cutting is a human rights and a health issue for both mothers and babies.
