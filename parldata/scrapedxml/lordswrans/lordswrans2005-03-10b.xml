	<p pid="b.85.2/1">A UN-funded integrated vulnerability assessment, published in February 2003, reported on all forms of risk to Montserrat, including tsunamis. The report recommended that, for planning purposes, buildings should be four metres above mean sea level. Because of Montserrat's mountainous terrain, nearly all construction takes place on high ground. The island's government are taking this recommendation into account in their detailed planning for the proposed development of the Little Bay area, some of which is low-lying.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.2/2">Seismic activity in the Caribbean is monitored by the University of the West Indies, which has direct access to the Montserrat Government's Emergency Department and similar regional bodies. Montserrat has a system in place, established with DfID funding, in order to warn the public in the event of a tsunami or any other natural disaster.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.2/3">More generally, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) has been mandated by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to advise it on all issues related to tsunami threats, and to develop proposals for establishing a regional tsunami warning system. DfID is monitoring progress on this initiative through its regional office in Barbados and through its disaster management adviser for the Caribbean Overseas Territories who is presently based in the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.4/2" qnum="HL1436">In view of the recent allegations by the United Kingdom's High Commissioner in Kenya of corruption in named contracts concerning the Kenyan Government, and the United States Ambassador's threatened suspension of aid to Kenya, what steps they intend to take to suspend or cancel aid from the United Kingdom to Kenya.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-10b.85.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="85"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050310/text/50310w01.htm#50310w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.85.5/1">DfID has no immediate plans to suspend or cancel the UK's development assistance to Kenya. DfID has produced clear guidance on the relationship between development assistance and tackling political governance issues of the type being faced in Kenya, and a co-ordinated and common response across the donor community will have more impact than working independently.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.5/2">DfID has made it clear to the government of Kenya (GoK), together with other donors, that action is required on behalf of the GoK to restore the confidence of the people of Kenya and rebuild the Government's credibility, including in the fight against corruption. DfID will not consider any support through the government budget and will argue against multilateral budget support unless and until this action is taken and confidence is restored.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.5/3">Kenya is making some progress. Implementation of the free primary education policy is applauded internationally and has brought an additional 1.3 million children into school. The fight against HIV/AIDS is moving in the right direction, and there are things DfID can and should do to make a difference to people's lives in Kenya. That is why around 50 per cent of the programme is currently spent on improving the health of women and children and combating HIV/AIDS. There are compelling human and economic reasons for accelerating this work. For example, DfID expects to have distributed more than 11 million insecticide-treated bednets by the end of 2006, saving 170,000 lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.5/4">The development assistance provided by DfID does not go through the government budget. Over 70 per cent of the programme is and will continue to be targeted on education and health. All these funds are managed separately by financial management agents or through special, earmarked accounts or provided directly to civil society. In this way fiduciary risks are minimised while delivering key benefits to poor Kenyans and making a real contribution towards the millennium development goals.</p>

To establish the full scale of the problem this Government introduced the mandatory surveillance of MRSA blood stream infections with effect from 2001. It is by employing these data that we have been able to set a target to halve the rates of MRSA by 2008 and to see that between April and September 2004 MRSA infections dropped by 6.3 per cent compared with the same period in 2003 thanks to hard work by National Health Service staff.</p>
