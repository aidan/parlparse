	<p pid="a.169.2/1">The Government agree that significant human rights abuses were committed during Operation Kimia II, although precise numbers are very difficult to verify in an area such as Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We regularly raise the issue of civilian protection with the Government of DRC, and were instrumental in the renewal of the United Nations peacekeeping force in the DRC (MONUC) mandate, with its sharper focus on protection of civilians. We fully support the decision by MONUC to withdraw support from the Congolese military (FARDC) units which commit serious human rights abuses, and continue to press the Government of DRC to take action against any members of the DRC armed forces who commit such abuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">We continue to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict, for example by supporting the voluntary disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration of Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda combatants, which has been successful in encouraging some of these combatants to lay down their arms.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3">We agree that long-term peace in DRC depends on good relations between the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. There are signs of improvements in these relations and DRC made a welcome exchange of ambassadors with Rwanda in 2008 and Uganda in early 2009. Through our ambassador in Kinshasa, and High Commissioners in Kigali and Kampala we continue to support co-operation between the states.</p>

The English uplands are some of our most iconic areas, providing vital environmental benefits in the form of biodiversity, natural resource protection and valued historic landscapes. The Government remain committed to supporting upland farmers in England for their crucial role in maintaining the upland landscape and environment. This is why we will shortly be launching our new upland entry level stewardship scheme to reward farmers for environmentally beneficial land management practices, with the first agreements starting from July 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.2/1">An element of the DCMS overall pay award is allocated to non-consolidated variable pay related to performance. These payments are used to drive high performance and form part of the pay award for members of staff who demonstrate exceptional performance, for example by exceeding targets set or meeting challenging objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">Non-consolidated variable pay awards are funded from within existing pay bill controls, and have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined targets and, as such, do not add to future pay bill costs. The percentage of the pay bill set aside for performance-related awards for the SCS is based on recommendations from the independent Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/3">The table below details how many people were eligible for and received a non-consolidated variable pay awards and the average and the maximum payment for a non-consolidated variable pay award, by civil service band, awarded under the DCMS standard pay and performance management process for the three most recent performance years for which the relevant payments have been published in the department's accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/4">The department, and its executive agency, make non-consolidated performance payments to its employees for two purposes: (a) in-year non-consolidated performance payments to reward outstanding contributions in particularly demanding tasks or situations; and (b) year-end non-consolidated performance payments to reward highly successful performance over a whole year. In both cases they support help drive high performance in the both the department and its executive agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/5">These figures cover all civil servants on standard terms. They are exclusive of two key senior staff in the Government Olympic Executive, who were appointed on non-standard terms with fixed-term contracts ending in 2012 and whose remuneration reflects extensive relevant experience and the unique challenge of delivering the Olympics to a fixed deadline. Details of their remuneration were published in the departmental annual reports and accounts 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.5/1">Defra and the Forestry Commission have funded research into the diseases caused by Phytophthora ramorum and Phytophthora kernoviae since 2002 and 2003 respectively. This has included research into managing the pathogens in woodlands, heritage gardens, heathlands and plant nurseries. A policy review and public consultation was held in 2008 on these two pathogens; this was supported by an impact assessment of the policy and management options, and by pest risk analyses. It concluded that increased effort was required to protect woodlands, heathlands, heritage gardens, and nurseries, thereby reducing impacts on the environment and rural economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.5/2">As a result, a new five-year disease management programme was established on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, led by the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera). The programme includes three elements: disease control; awareness and behavioural change; and research. The research (&#163;1,500,000 over five years) will directly support the other elements of the programme, especially disease control. A mid-term review of progress on all elements of the programme will be carried out in 2012 and again in 2014.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.0/1">The Government's position on British Waterways' (BW) non-operational property assets is set out in the Government's asset portfolio. This was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-07">7 December 2009</phrase> alongside the Smarter Government White Paper. The Government currently have no plans to dispose of BWs' non-operational assets. However, the Government recognise that there may be benefits in considering alternative structures for BW's business as a whole, including its property portfolio, such as mutual or third sector structures. Under any scenario, ensuring the continued maintenance and protection of the waterways will continue to be an important objective for the Government.</p>
