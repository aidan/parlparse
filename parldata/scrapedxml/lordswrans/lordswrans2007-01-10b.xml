This equates to around &pound;1 million per annum in subscription fees.

	<p pid="b.88.5/1">There is no provision under the European Union animal by-products regulation (which bans on-farm burial of fallen stock) for seeking a derogation to permit the burial of sheep. The only derogations which permit burial are in the event of an outbreak of a notifiable disease and for certain designated remote areas. In the case of a disease outbreak, the derogation would apply if there were a lack of capacity at rendering plants and incinerators, or if transport of the carcases would spread disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.5/2">Pollution control is not the main aim of this regulation. The regulation is there to protect public and animal health from any potential risks associated with the burial of fallen stock. Rendering and incineration provide safe, controlled routes of disposal.</p>

The action plan clearly sets out Defra's commitment for research to be undertaken to monitor the voluntary uptake of the code, its practical application and impact. A research project will be procured in the near future. Defra will aim to review the code of good practice by the end of 2008 in the light of research findings and of its impact on snaring practices and results. Following the review of the code, Defra will consider giving it a higher legal status if appropriate. Nothing within the League Against Cruel Sports report changes that position.</p>

	<p pid="b.95.2/1">The UK is fully compliant with its obligations under the Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption. Article 20 of that convention requires each party to the convention to ensure that specialised authorities in the fight against corruption have the necessary independence to carry out their functions effectively and free from any undue pressure. The objectives of this provision are also replicated in the Guiding Principles on the Fight against Corruption agreed by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. No specific new measures were required for the UK to comply with these provisions. Police and prosecution authorities already possess the necessary independence to carry out their functions effectively and free from undue pressure. While under our existing law a prosecution under either the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889 or Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 requires the consent of the Attorney-General, the Attorney-General does not exercise his prosecution functions as a member of the Government but as an impartial guardian of the public interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.102.5/1">The cross-regional information sharing project (IMPACT CRISP) is an important step in the modular and incremental approach we are taking to the delivery of new information sharing services to the police and partner agencies. It will provide the police service with a new capability to access information held in other forces' local systems much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible. It will also assist in the delivery of the police national database (PND) by introducing a new common data schema, enabling forces to contribute their data for sharing and helping forces identify the business process changes they need to introduce in order to make the best use of the new information- sharing capabilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.2/1">Work undertaken by the Building Research Establishment for Defra indicates that putting clocks in the UK forward an additional one hour in winter and summer (ie summer time in winter and double summer time in summer to match Central European Time) would lead to a net increase in carbon dioxide emissions corresponding to around 1 per cent of total UK emissions of carbon dioxide, as a result of increased energy consumption in UK buildings for lighting, space heating and cooling. The study also shows that a switch to British Summer Time all the year round would increase emissions by just under 0.5 per cent.
