	<p pid="a.269.4/2" qnum="HL2692">How many members of the regular Armed Forces and the Reserves, having served in Iraq since January 2003, have been treated for mental illnesses; what consultation Ministers have had with Combat Stress in the past year about the after-care of those discharged because of their illnesses; and what further action is being considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.5/1">During the operational period from January 2003 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>, 2,123 mobilised British Military Personnel (Regular and Reservists) who deployed to Operation TELIC were assessed by, and received treatment from, the Defence Medical Services for mental health conditions thought to be related to their deployment. This represents around 2 per cent of personnel deployed to Operation TELIC over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.5/2">Of this number, 328 service personnel fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), representing around 0.3 per cent of personnel deployed to Operation TELIC over the same period. Some 904 personnel were diagnosed with an adjustment disorder; this figure will include a number who have post-traumatic symptoms not amounting to full PTSD. The other 891 personnel were treated for a range of other miscellaneous disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.5/3">In 2003, the MoD commissioned research by the King's Centre for Military Health Research into the health of military personnel who were deployed to Operation TELIC. This report showed that in the 2003 deployment there was no significant increase in ill health of regular forces compared to those that did not deploy. However, the report did show that a higher proportion of Reservists who did deploy displayed symptoms of common mental health problems and PTSD compared to either regulars or to Reservists who did not deploy. As a result of this study, the MoD introduced the Reserves Mental Health Programme to improve the overall healthcare we offer to demobilised Reservists.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.5/4">It remains the case that medical discharge from the UK Armed Forces due to psychological illness is also low. Out of the total of some 180,000 regular service personnel, only about 150, or less than 0.1 per cent, are discharged annually for mental health reasons, whatever the cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.5/5">The Veterans Minister has had a number of meetings or discussions with officers of the Ex-Service Mental Welfare Society (Combat Stress) in the past year. Discussions have covered various aspects of the society's work with mentally ill veterans; his latest conversation with the chief executive was as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.5/6">The MoD meets individual costs relating to war pensioners who undergo &quot;remedial treatment&quot; at either of the two Combat Stress homes in England for conditions related to their individual war pensioned disablement. For 2006-07, the &quot;remedial treatment&quot; fees rate was increased by more than the rate of inflation. We are currently in discussions with Combat Stress regarding fee rates for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.5/7">The MoD also recently awarded a grant of &pound;100,000 to Combat Stress towards the modernisation of its care home in Scotland, Hollybush House.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.5/8">The Government are committed to good mental health and well-being for Armed Forces personnel, both in service and after they leave. For veterans, healthcare is primarily the responsibility of the NHS. A number of new initiatives are being considered to improve the treatment of veterans suffering with mental health problems. Following recommendations on mental health services for veterans in 2005 by the independent Health and Social Care Advisory Service, officials from the Ministry of Defence, the UK health departments and Combat Stress have been working together to develop and implement a new community-based model for mental health services for veterans; this would include integration of Combat Stress into NHS commissioning arrangements. It is hoped that, beginning in the spring of 2007, the model will be piloted at sites across the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.0/1">The answers to the points raised are:</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/2">(a) The Regulations regarding the registration of Births, Deaths and Missing Persons are laid down in the Civil Aviation (Births, Deaths and Missing Persons) Regulations 1948, as amended, made pursuant to Section 83 of the Civil Aviation Act, 1982. In general terms, if a death occurs on board an aircraft (which is not a consequence of an aircraft accident) anywhere in the world, the owner of the aircraft needs to notify the CAA of the death by completing the notification of deaths form and returning it to the Aircraft Registration Section. The regulation only covers aircraft that are registered in the UK and does not apply if the death occurs on an aircraft registered in another state, even if operated by a UK airline.(b) No limits are laid down concerning the length of time a deceased person may remain strapped in an aircraft seat.(c) There are no requirements for airlines to divert in the case of a death on board. Any guidance to the aircraft commander on actions to be taken following a death on board will be provided by the aircraft operator and set out in the operator's operations manual.(d) There are no requirements for an airline to provide specific facilities on board an aircraft to cater for a death in flight.(e) There are no regulations requiring an airline to pay compensation for any inconvenience caused to passengers as a result of a death on board.</p>

	<p pid="a.272.8/1">Recognising the problem of potential global climate change, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. It is open to all members of the UN and WMO.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.8/2">The role of the IPCC is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.8/3">The IPCC is the most authoritative voice on climate change. Its assessments represent the consensus of thousands of scientists worldwide, based on peer-reviewed, research. Objectivity is ensured by the broad and open review process and shared responsibility for its reports. No one Government, organisation or individual has sole responsibility for any part of the IPCC's reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.8/4">The IPCC's latest major assessment, the fourth assessment report on climate change, concludes that most of the observed warming since the mid-20th century is very likely&mdash;that is, a more than 90 per cent chance&mdash;to be the result of human emissions of greenhouse gases. Both the spatial patterns and trend of warming can only be explained by the inclusion of human emissions. It is therefore very unlikely that the rapid increase in global temperatures seen over the past half century could have been caused by natural factors alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.5/1">ECAs were first introduced for a range of energy-saving technologies in 2001. The qualifying technologies are specified in the Energy Technology List (ETL) published by Defra. The ETL includes a product list that lists the products that meet the energy-saving criteria. This gives businesses certainty that if they buy a piece of machinery when it is on the list, they can claim the allowances.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.5/2">Providing ECAs for tailor-made installations, such as biofuel plants, rather than an individual piece of equipment requires a different approach. For example, in the case of combined heat and power (CHP) plants, to qualify spending must be certified as being incurred on &quot;good quality&quot; CHP. Accreditation is carried out by the CHP quality assurance programme (CHPQA) on behalf of Defra. The ETL includes a criteria list that lists the equipment making up a CHP installation that can qualify for ECAs.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.2/1">The Government have funded a number of studies to consider environmental impacts and benefits of biofuels, including emissions of nitrous oxides.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.2/2">Emissions of nitrous oxide associated with feedstock cultivation are mainly related to fertiliser production and application. The fertiliser nitrogen requirement of arable crops grown for fuel are little different from that required to grow the same crops for food.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.2/3">Both oxides of nitrogen (NOx&mdash;local pollutants) and nitrous oxide (N20&mdash;a powerful greenhouse gas) are produced during the combustion of biofuels. A DfT funded study found that at low level blends, emissions performance of vehicles are broadly the same as for fossil fuels (~0.007 N20 grams per kilometre (g/km)). Pure biofuels had a slightly higher rate of N20 emissions (~0.01 N20 g/km), but NOx emissions were 8 per cent lower than fossil fuels.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.2/4">Under the forthcoming Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, obligated companies will be required to report on the environmental impacts and lifecycle greenhouse gas benefits of the fuels that they supply. The Government are currently developing technical guidance to ensure reporting is consistent and robust.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.4/2" qnum="HL2648">What is their assessment of the level of input of fertiliser into the cultivation of feedstock for production of bioethanol and biodiesel which will render the use of the biofuel to be responsible for net emissions of greenhouse gas rather than savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.5/1">The Government have funded a number of studies to evaluate the net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions performance of biofuels. Such research routinely takes into account inputs such as levels of fertiliser application.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.5/2">Emissions associated with the production and use of fertiliser reduce the overall greenhouse gas benefits that biofuels offer. Nevertheless, most biofuels do offer worthwhile emissions savings. For example, UK biodiesel using rapeseed typically offers net lifecycle greenhouse savings of around 50 per cent compared with fossil diesel. Similar levels can be achieved through UK bioethanol derived from wheat. Actual levels of performance can vary widely according to the type of feedstocks used, the level of inputs, and the processing methods employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.5/3">Under the forthcoming Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), obligated companies will be required to report on the lifecycle greenhouse gas benefits of the fuels that they supply. The Government are currently developing the technical guidance that transport fuel suppliers will have to use when calculating their greenhouse gas savings. This will ensure that reporting under the obligation is consistent. In the future, when the reporting system has demonstrated that it is sufficiently robust, the Government are keen to move to a system under which biofuels are rewarded under the RTFO according to their carbon-saving performance. The Government are seeking views in their public consultation on the RTFO, available via the DfT website, on whether, how and when, the RTFO might directly incentivise use of biofuels according to their carbon performance.</p>

In contrast, the three commercial note issuing banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland collectively issue 39 banknotes designs. Consequently, some Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes may not be as readily recognised and accepted overseas as Bank of England banknotes.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.6/1">Over the past 10 years, the commercial approach to pricing taken by train operators has helped to generate the 40 per cent increase in passenger volumes which has given Britain the fastest-growing railway in Europe. Commercial pricing means charging higher fares at peak times when trains are full, but lower fares in the off-peak to attract additional passengers. This helps to achieve value for money in terms of both passengers carried and subsidy required.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.6/2">Where operators have a degree of market power&mdash;for example, commuter transport into London and other big cities&mdash;the Department for Transport places a limit on fares increases. As a result, these regulated fares are currently on average 2 per cent less in real terms than they were in 1996.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.5/2">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, and the UK Permanent. Representative to the HRC, called on the Council to take effective action on Darfur and not become mired in procedural debates. We do not accept the argument that the mission report lacks validity because the mission failed to go to Sudan. The Government of Sudan reneged on their commitment to co-operate with the mission and refused to grant visas to all members of the mission, so, rightly, none of the members went. The report is based on the assessments of UN humanitarian agencies, the African Union in Addis Ababa and UN High Commissioner for Refugees in eastern Chad. All of these organisations, which have large numbers of staff operating in Darfur and Eastern Chad, continue to report an appalling human rights and humanitarian situation there. We are lobbying partners, including China and Russia, to ensure that the report's recommendations are taken forward.</p>

While we are considering further, targeted sanctions, it remains true that they are more effective if implemented by the international community. None the less, if such support were not forthcoming, we have not excluded the possibility of taking further measures with our EU partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.5/1">The Welsh Office commissioned a survey of contaminated land in Wales which was undertaken by Liverpool University who produced a report in August 1988, which included information about the Brofiscin site. The report suggested that the disposal of such wastes on permeable limestone could present a hazard to users of local groundwaters, although it did not identify any specific hazards. Previous investigations had also concluded that there were no proven or immediate risks to human health. There was some evidence of pollutants affecting grazing livestock, and measures had been taken to prevent or discourage the grazing of animals in areas polluted by surface water runoff. No groundwater supplies in the immediate vicinity of the site were or are currently used for human consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.5/2">In 1988, land not due for redevelopment had historically been dealt with via the statutory nuisance powers of local authorities. However, new legislation, implemented in Wales in 2001, has provided an improved system for the identification and remediation of land where contamination is causing unacceptable risks to human health or the wider environment. This aims to ensure that land is returned to a condition suitable for its current use.</p>
