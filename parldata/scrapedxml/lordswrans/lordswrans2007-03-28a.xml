	<p pid="a.271.0/1">The answers to the points raised are:</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/2">(a) The Regulations regarding the registration of Births, Deaths and Missing Persons are laid down in the Civil Aviation (Births, Deaths and Missing Persons) Regulations 1948, as amended, made pursuant to Section 83 of the Civil Aviation Act, 1982. In general terms, if a death occurs on board an aircraft (which is not a consequence of an aircraft accident) anywhere in the world, the owner of the aircraft needs to notify the CAA of the death by completing the notification of deaths form and returning it to the Aircraft Registration Section. The regulation only covers aircraft that are registered in the UK and does not apply if the death occurs on an aircraft registered in another state, even if operated by a UK airline.(b) No limits are laid down concerning the length of time a deceased person may remain strapped in an aircraft seat.(c) There are no requirements for airlines to divert in the case of a death on board. Any guidance to the aircraft commander on actions to be taken following a death on board will be provided by the aircraft operator and set out in the operator's operations manual.(d) There are no requirements for an airline to provide specific facilities on board an aircraft to cater for a death in flight.(e) There are no regulations requiring an airline to pay compensation for any inconvenience caused to passengers as a result of a death on board.</p>

A DfT funded study found that at low level blends, emissions performance of vehicles are broadly the same as for fossil fuels (~0.007 N20 grams per kilometre (g/km)). Pure biofuels had a slightly higher rate of N20 emissions (~0.01 N20 g/km), but NOx emissions were 8 per cent lower than fossil fuels.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.5/1">The Government have funded a number of studies to evaluate the net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions performance of biofuels. Such research routinely takes into account inputs such as levels of fertiliser application.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.5/2">Emissions associated with the production and use of fertiliser reduce the overall greenhouse gas benefits that biofuels offer. Nevertheless, most biofuels do offer worthwhile emissions savings. For example, UK biodiesel using rapeseed typically offers net lifecycle greenhouse savings of around 50 per cent compared with fossil diesel. Similar levels can be achieved through UK bioethanol derived from wheat. Actual levels of performance can vary widely according to the type of feedstocks used, the level of inputs, and the processing methods employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.5/3">Under the forthcoming Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), obligated companies will be required to report on the lifecycle greenhouse gas benefits of the fuels that they supply. The Government are currently developing the technical guidance that transport fuel suppliers will have to use when calculating their greenhouse gas savings. This will ensure that reporting under the obligation is consistent. In the future, when the reporting system has demonstrated that it is sufficiently robust, the Government are keen to move to a system under which biofuels are rewarded under the RTFO according to their carbon-saving performance. The Government are seeking views in their public consultation on the RTFO, available via the DfT website, on whether, how and when, the RTFO might directly incentivise use of biofuels according to their carbon performance.</p>

In contrast, the three commercial note issuing banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland collectively issue 39 banknotes designs. Consequently, some Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes may not be as readily recognised and accepted overseas as Bank of England banknotes.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.6/5">The exchange rate offered for Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes overseas will be influenced by the acceptor's perception of his ability to obtain value for the banknote.

Representative to the HRC, called on the Council to take effective action on Darfur and not become mired in procedural debates. We do not accept the argument that the mission report lacks validity because the mission failed to go to Sudan. The Government of Sudan reneged on their commitment to co-operate with the mission and refused to grant visas to all members of the mission, so, rightly, none of the members went. The report is based on the assessments of UN humanitarian agencies, the African Union in Addis Ababa and UN High Commissioner for Refugees in eastern Chad. All of these organisations, which have large numbers of staff operating in Darfur and Eastern Chad, continue to report an appalling human rights and humanitarian situation there. We are lobbying partners, including China and Russia, to ensure that the report's recommendations are taken forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.4/2" qnum="HL2770">Whether the Welsh Office were aware by 1988 that the discharge at Brofiscin quarry contained carcinogens and was hazardous to users of the groundwater; and, if so, what measures were taken to protect humans, farm livestock, wildlife, vegetation and the soil close to the quarry and along water courses that carried the discharge.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.5/1">The Welsh Office commissioned a survey of contaminated land in Wales which was undertaken by Liverpool University who produced a report in August 1988, which included information about the Brofiscin site. The report suggested that the disposal of such wastes on permeable limestone could present a hazard to users of local groundwaters, although it did not identify any specific hazards. Previous investigations had also concluded that there were no proven or immediate risks to human health. There was some evidence of pollutants affecting grazing livestock, and measures had been taken to prevent or discourage the grazing of animals in areas polluted by surface water runoff. No groundwater supplies in the immediate vicinity of the site were or are currently used for human consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.5/2">In 1988, land not due for redevelopment had historically been dealt with via the statutory nuisance powers of local authorities. However, new legislation, implemented in Wales in 2001, has provided an improved system for the identification and remediation of land where contamination is causing unacceptable risks to human health or the wider environment. This aims to ensure that land is returned to a condition suitable for its current use.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.5/3">Current site investigation work will be completed in April. This will enable the Environment Agency to make an informed decision on the most appropriate remedial solutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.288.2/1">Monsanto discontinued PCB manufacture at its Newport site in the 1970s. Detailed discharge records are no longer available. The current owner of the site is Solutia UK Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.2/2">A Pollution Prevention Control Permit was issued to Solutia by the Environment Agency in 2004. It required the company to undertake an environmental risk assessment of Polychlorobiphenyl (PCBs) releases into the Severn estuary arising as a result of historic contamination that occurred during Monsanto's ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.2/3">This assessment was completed and submitted to the agency in 2005. The Food Standards Agency reviewed the assessment and concluded that the operation was unlikely to have any unacceptable affects on the human food chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.2/4">Current releases of historic PCB contamination from the Solutia Newport site into the Severn estuary are in the order of 4.4 pounds (2 kilogrammes) per year.</p>
