Also in 2001&ndash;02 we offered relief to Pakistan on &pound;20 million of debt originally owed to the CDC but subsequently transferred to DfID; this will show up as a provision in our 2001&ndash;02 accounts, though the relief is conditional on performance over the next two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.5/1">WTO disputes inevitably involve complex and detailed issues which take time to resolve. The dispute settlement understanding (DSU)&mdash;which sets out the procedures to be followed in resolving WTO disputes&mdash;has in-built a number of stages which allow for review of panel findings and appeal by the parties involved. Those stages are important in ensuring the decisions of the panel are fair and based on all the evidence available. However, not all disputes take so long to resolve. Many are resolved at an early stage without the need to resort to a dispute panel.</p>

The UK Government's aim for those negotiations is to ensure disputes are resolved in as efficient a manner as possible, while retaining the rigour of the current system. John B</p>

	<p pid="a.79.5/1">The Government's aim of building a broadband Britain means making services available to as many people as possible. A key part of that strategy involves making various bands within the radio spectrum available to enable the market to develop a portfolio of technical solutions. Licences were awarded in the 28GHz band that provide coverage of over 60 per cent of the country. Industry has asked for additional spectrum at 3.4GHz to be made available. They can then choose the most appropriate method of delivering broadband to the business and residential markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/2">Licences will be awarded through an auction process, as an auction process provides a fast, transparent, fair and economically efficient way of allocating the spectrum and allows the spectrum to be assigned to the operator who values it most.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.5/1">The Animal Health Act 1981 provides for the slaughter of animals which are affected with foot and mouth disease (FMD) or suspected of being so affected and of animals which have been in contact with affected animals or which appear to the Minister to have been in any way exposed to the infection of foot and mouth disease. This is the legal basis for the contiguous cull.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/2">The Act does not provide for the slaughter of animals outside these categories. The contiguous cull was inhibited to some extent by disputes over whether particular animals had been exposed to FMD infection or not and was therefore not as effective as it might have been in some cases. The Government's Animal Health Bill would have provided additional powers, namely to slaughter animals in order to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. This would enable preventive or firebreak culls to be carried out without the animals being affected by FMD or having been exposed to it, thereby speeding up eradication and reducing the overall number of animals that have to be culled.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/3">The Animal Health Bill also provides for powers of entry which could facilitate a more effective and rapid cull both in circumstances that are in principle already covered by the 1981 Act and in the circumstances covered in the proposed amendment to the Act in the Bill.
