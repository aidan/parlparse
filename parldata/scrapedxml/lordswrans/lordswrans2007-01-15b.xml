	<p pid="b.115.2/1">The National Scrapie Plan (NSP) was launched in 2001 against a background of concern about the risks from transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in sheep (that is, scrapie) and the theoretical risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Its complementary aims have been to protect both public health and animal health and welfare by increasing the TSE resistance of the national flock, principally through its voluntary ram genotyping scheme (RGS).</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/2">The Veterinary Laboratories Agency has tested samples where suitable material has been available from all sheep diagnosed as positive for scrapie, from 1998 to the present time, for the possible presence of BSE. Samples from nearly 3,000 animals have been tested and all have been negative for BSE. Recently, in the light of this testing, and the latest scientific knowledge and research, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee's sheep sub-group was asked to consider the latest science underpinning the RGS. It concluded that the prevalence of BSE in the UK sheep population is most likely to be zero, or very low if present at all, and that consequently the current RGS would have little impact on public health. They concluded that the RGS was still scientifically valid with respect to animal health to protect against classical scrapie. The subgroup's statement is available at <a href="http://www.seac.gov.uk/statements/sheepsubgrp-statement131006.pdf">http://www.seac.gov .uk/statements/sheepsubgrp-statement131006.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.2/3">The voluntary breeding programme elements of the NSP which include the RGS (but not the statutory, EU-required elements including compulsory controls on scrapie-affected farms) are currently under review.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.2/1">No reliable estimate is available of the distribution of the 15 known scrapie genotypes of sheep in the national ram flock prior to the commencement of the first National Scrapie Plan (NSP) genotype testing in 2001. Relatively few breeds had been commercially testing their rams prior to 2001. Modelling done prior to the NSP<sup>(1)</sup> estimated that approximately 28 per cent of rams were of the most resistant genotype that carries two copies of the ARR allele<sup></sup> (the allele that is most resistant to classical scrapie) and that thus had the &quot;ARR/ARR&quot; or NSP Type 1 genotype.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/2">There are 420,000 rams and ram lambs in the national flock. Since 2001, the NSP has tested over 2.6 million sheep (in all schemes) in Great Britain. Table 1 below shows the genotypes of all those sheep. Table 2 illustrates the change in the allele percentage of ram lambs born in flocks participating in the NSP from 2002 to 2005 (the ARR allele is the most resistant to classical scrapie and the VRQ is the most susceptible in the majority of breeds). The ram lamb data for 2002 are a good starting point as the majority of these animals will have been the progeny of previously untested rams as NSP testing only commenced on a small scale in October 2001.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.2/1">We understand that the joint report by Refugee Action and Amnesty International published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November 2006</phrase> is entitled <I>The Destitution Trap</I>. The Government are aware of the detailed recommendations made in the report, which are directed at a range of government departments and other agencies. It will take them into account when formulating policy on dealing with the legacy of older cases and in dealing with new cases under the New Asylum Model. Failed asylum seekers have had their asylum claims carefully considered by the Home Office and, where appropriate, by the independent appellate authorities. It has been decided that they do not require international protection and they are therefore required to leave the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.9/136">1. The information in the tables is taken from the Court Proceedings Database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform and gives the number of persons and companies proceeded against at magistrates courts, found guilty at all courts and sentence breakdowns, including average fine amounts, for selected offences related to fly-tipping and littering in England from 2001 to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.9/137">2. The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.9/138">3. These data are a further breakdown of that published in the Criminal Statistics, Supplementary Volumes for England and Wales for the years 2001-2005.</p>
