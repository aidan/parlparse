	<p pid="a.41.2/1">Detention is most usually appropriate to effect removal, initially to establish a person's identity or basis of claim, or where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with any conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release. It necessarily follows therefore that there will be asylum applicants detained at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre whose cases have not been finally decided.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">The most recent published statistics indicate that, as at <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-29">29 June 2002</phrase>, there were 385 persons detained at Harmondsworth who were recorded as having claimed asylum at some stage. Information about which of these cases had not been finally decided is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by an examination of individual case files.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/3">As at <phrase class="date" code="">21 November</phrase> there were 10 children under 18 detained as part of family groups at Harmondsworth.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/4">Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre is managed and operated on behalf of the Immigration Service by UK Detention Services Ltd. The contractor makes provision for education for school-aged children and employs suitably qualified staff as managers of education. The profile and numbers of children at the centre changes from day to day. Education provision needs therefore to be sufficiently flexible to cater for the needs of a variable number of children of variable ages and abilities. A programme of modular education concentrates on numeracy and literacy and the national curriculum, taking into account the diverse needs of the children who pass through the centre.</p>

Her Majesty's Government will be represented at the launch by the Member for North Warwickshire, Mike O'Brien, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/2">The ICOC is a politically binding agreement designed to tackle the proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. It does so by promoting transparency and confidence building among states. It consists of principles, commitments and confidence-building measures. It will establish international norms for the first time in the area of ballistic missiles. The code will complement the existing range of international instruments against WMD.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/3">The non-proliferation commitments in the code include a commitment not to contribute to, support or assist any ballistic missile programme in countries which might be developing or acquiring weapons of mass destruction in contravention of international obligations; also to exercise vigilance in assistance to space launch vehicle programmes, given that these can be used to conceal ballistic missile programmes. The code also calls for maximum possible restraint in the development, testing and deployment of ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/4">The confidence-building and transparency measures are designed to promote confidence through information sharing, in the form of both pre-launch notifications and annual declarations about ballistic missile and space launch programmes. The aim is to boost confidence for instance that space launch vehicle programmes are not being used as cover for ballistic missile programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/5">The code represents a significant step forward for the international community in the area of arms control&mdash;in this case, the control of one of the delivery systems of choice for weapons of mass destruction. The UK has played a leading role in the development of the ICOC since its inception. We are calling on all states to subscribe to the code.</p>
