	<p pid="a.55.5/1">Until the text of each Bill is available, it is not possible to state precisely what will be the application of proposed legislation in Scotland. With that proviso, it seems likely that around half the Bills announced in the Queen's Speech will include measures which would apply in Scotland. Some of these Bills will extend to Scotland in relation to matters which are reserved to the UK Government e.g. the Communications Bill and the European Union (Accessions) Bill. Others may extend to Scotland in relation to certain devolved matters, subject to the consent of the Scottish Parliament under the terms of the Sewel convention, e.g. the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill. Others still are a mixture of reserved and devolved matters.</p>

Entrepreneurship can also offer disadvantaged and socially excluded groups employment and prosperity. That is why enterprise is a key plank of the agenda on EU economic reform agreed in Lisbon in 2000. Her Majesty's Government have made a significant contribution to the work on an Entrepreneurship Green Paper. In October my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry sent Commissioner Liikanen a copy of UK Enterprise for All to assist his efforts. Produced by the Small Business Service, this is a paper that sets out the significance of small business across Europe and makes practical suggestions to encourage enterprise in the EU. Copies of the paper have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">We have made no representations to the Commission on this issue since its decision. After all, as the noble Lord is aware, it was the actions of the European Commission and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) that helped persuade the French Government finally to lift their unjustified and illegal ban on beef imports from the United Kingdom. We very much welcome the role that those EU institutions played in resolving the issue. As the noble Lord will also be aware, the National Farmers Union continues to pursue its own case in the French courts, in which it seeks a ruling that the beef ban was illegal. This follows a separate judgment by the ECJ.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.8/1">The Government support the WEEE directive, which is a priority waste stream for the UK. It is growing fast and electronic equipment often contains hazardous substances. It is therefore right that action is taken to limit potential environmental damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.8/2">DTI-commissioned research by PriceWaterhouseCooper shows that there will be significant environmental benefits from treatment, recycling and recovery of WEEE under the requirements of the directive, when compared to current practices, and especially with landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.8/3">The European Commission estimates that the costs of the directive will be equivalent to a 1 to 3 per cent rise in the price of electrical goods. However, the directive is flexible and member states will have some degree of freedom to decide how to implement it. The UK will look to implement in such a way that minimises costs to UK business and consumers while retaining environmental benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">In the past, the Government have supported the solar thermal industry through a number of measures, including field trials, testing of systems, dissemination of objective information and funding for training courses. The Government recognise the importance of solar thermal in contributing to reducing carbon emissions and as such extended the enhanced capital allowance scheme to cover solar thermal in the last budget. This is in addition to the reduced VAT rate of 5 per cent that applies to professionally installed systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">The Government are likely to further encourage the development of the solar thermal industry through the forthcoming Community and Household Capital Grants Scheme for Renewable Energy. The scheme will disburse grants to individual homeowners and community groups who wish to install renewable energy systems such as solar water heating. The scheme will run concurrent to an installer accreditation and training programme to expand the current installer base. The scheme is likely to be launched in the new year.

These licences contain conditions to ensure that the activities authorised do not cause pollution of the environment, harm to human health or become seriously detrimental to the amenities of the locality. Conditions will typically stipulate environmental monitoring requirements for surface and groundwaters, leachate, gases and odours. The licence will also contain conditions relating to the aftercare and post closure monitoring of the landfill site until such a time that the licence is surrendered.

	<p pid="a.59.3/1">The Government support horticultural research through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and through government departments. Research of immediate relevance to the horticulture industry is also funded by the Horticultural Development Council, a levy-funded statutory body.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/2">The goal of the BBSRC is to support science of international quality that is relevant to the council's mission and to the needs of its users and beneficiaries. Funding is allocated to universities and research institutes by a number of mechanisms, mainly through open competition. The agriculture industry, including the horticulture sector, is one of the main beneficiaries of the council's research.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/3">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) funds strategic research in support of its published aims and objectives. Individual horticultural research projects are commissioned by Defra from a number of research providers. A proportion of the available funding is allocated to open competitions in which research proposals are invited from universities, research institutes and other providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) Horticulture and Potatoes Programme consists of fixed-term projects with specified deliverables which are either commissioned individually from research contractors or chosen from among proposals put forward in response to open competitions. A number of such projects will terminate next year in the usual way. The programmes of work identified by Horticulture Research International (HRI) in its annual reports are not directly commissioned by Defra, but encompass work commissioned from a number of customers. The organisation of these programmes is a matter for the management of HRI.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/2">The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) currently funds HRI on a similar basis to its own sponsored institutes, mainly through a four-year core strategic grant (CSG) that started in April 2002, and will be reviewed in 2005 prior to its potential renewal. The particular programmes of research supported from the CSG and their start and end dates are determined largely by HRI's chief executive, subject to the general direction of BBSRC based on scientific advice obtained in its four-yearly institute assessment exercise. In addition, HRI is able to apply to the council, in competition with other institutions and up to a defined limit, for supplementary grants for specific fixed-term (usually year) projects. There is ongoing turnover of such projects, some of which will come to their scheduled end in 2003.</p>

That remains the position. A sub-group of SEAC is meeting in early December to consider the findings. We will then review the situation in the light of SEAC's advice. The research project used intracerebral inoculation, and this is not a natural route of transmission for TSEs. It remains the case that no sheep of the most resistant (ARR/ARR) genotype has been confirmed as having developed a TSE in natural, non-experimental, conditions or experimentally through the oral transmission route.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.2/1">The joint chief inspectors' report Safeguarding Children, published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-14">14 October 2002</phrase>, contains a recommendation that the Department of Health, Home Office, Department for Education and Skills, and the Lord Chancellor's Department should support and facilitate national and local agencies to recruit and retain sufficient levels of appropriately qualified staff, paying particular regard to the image, status, morale, remuneration and working conditions of specialist child protection staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/2">The Government have welcomed the publication of this report. They recognise that there is still more to be done to ensure that the highest standards of child protection are applied in every case. That is why they commissioned the joint chief inspectors' report. It is also why the Secretary of State for Health and the Home Secretary set up the statutory inquiry, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, into the circumstances leading up to, and surrounding, the death of Victoria Climbie. The recommendations of the joint chief inspectors' report and those of the Victoria Climbie inquiry will provide the Government with an authoritative basis for any reforms to child protection that may need to be made, and if reform is necessary the Government will implement it.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/3">The Government have introduced initiatives designed to improve recruitment and retention in these key areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/4">All our policies that affect teachers aim not only to encourage new graduates into the profession, but also to ensure that teachers already within it stay. The Chancellor announced in the recent spending review that more money than ever is going direct to schools to enable heads to manage and staff their schools more effectively. There is also funding for Recruitment Strategy Managers, who are currently working in over 100 LEAs across the country helping to provide a co-ordinated local approach to vacancy-filling, with three specialist advisers dedicated to helping schools in challenging circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/5">Similarly, the national social work recruitment campaign was launched in October 2001 by the Secretary of State for Health. This includes both national and local press and radio advertising and particular efforts are being made in London and the South East where retention and recruitment of social workers is a particular problem. The third phase of the recruitment campaign was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-24">24 October 2002</phrase> with the aim of raising by 5,000 the number of people applying for social work training by 2004. Since the start of the campaign, applications have seen the first increase since 1995 and provisional figures suggest a year on year increase in applicants of 8.3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.6/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is able to accept credit/debit card payments for some driver and vehicle transaction fees, sales of attractive vehicle registration marks, penalty charges and, in certain circumstances, for vehicle excise duty (VED). DVLA does not know of any practical difficulties for the motorists in using these forms of payment. The customer benefits from a speedier delivery of the service required and the agency benefits from the early settlement by electronic transfer of funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.6/2">DVLA is seeking to extend the availability of credit card payments for VED. This move will be feasible if arrangements can be agreed for recovering the cost of credit card commission charges.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.0/1">Magistrates' courts committees have responsibility for the collection of a range of financial penalties imposed by the courts, including not only fines, but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders and some maintenance orders. The table below shows the arrears for the financial years in question. It is not possible to extract fines from the total, and neither is it possible to differentiate between the amount of debt that is uncollected and the amount of debt that is unenforced, as this is not reported to the Court Service.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.69.0/4"> <td>England &amp; Wales</td> <td>True arrears</td> <td>Actual arrears(6)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.69.0/5"> <td>1999&ndash;2000</td> <td>&pound;417,501,826</td> <td>&pound;227,361,076</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.69.0/6"> <td>2000&ndash;01</td> <td>&pound;419,137,608</td> <td>&pound;225,908,941</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.69.0/9">(6) True arrears are the amount of the debt outstanding, including debt that is being collected in instalments but not yet due for payment. Actual arrears are the amount of outstanding instalments that are in arrears.</p>
