The SEUPB also recruited temporary staff during 2002 to cover maternity leave and short-term peaks in workload. In addition, former Northern Ireland Partnership Board staff were seconded to the SEUPB during the first half of 2002 to complete work on the closure of PEACE I.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.6/1">The list of countries eligible for debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative is not fixed. Any country can be added to the list if it meets the three eligibility criteria: the country must be eligible only for concessional lending from the IMF and World Bank; it must face an unsustainable debt burden after the application of traditional debt relief mechanisms; and it must have demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/2">Those countries that are not eligible for debt relief under the HIPC initiative can still approach the Paris Club (the unofficial grouping of major bilateral creditors) for relief. In December 1994, Paris Club creditors agreed to implement a new treatment, &quot;Naples terms&quot;, on the debt of the poorest countries. Eligibility for the Naples terms is assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the track record of the debtor country with the Paris Club and the IMF, and various criteria, including having a high level of indebtedness, being only eligible for IDA financing from the World Bank, and having a GDP-per-capita of 755 dollars or less. Creditors agreed in September 1999 that all Naples terms treatments would carry a 67 per cent. debt reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/3">On the basis of current debt ratios, none of the four countries named would be eligible for the HIPC initiative, but Haiti could potentially meet the Naples criteria. Cambodia received Naples terms relief in 1995 and its debt:export ratio is currently slightly higher than the 150 per cent. threshold. Around 80 per cent. of this debt is bilateral debt owed to Russia and the US. The latest available figures for Georgia suggest that their debt:export ratio is below 150 per cent. Haiti has a level of external debt significantly above 150 per cent. of exports, but would need to make significant progress in strengthening governance and institutions before it could qualify for debt relief. Finally, World Bank country data for Afghanistan give its debt:export ratio as significantly below 150 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/4">The UK stands ready to provide generous debt reduction should these countries meet the relevant criteria and approach the Paris Club for debt relief.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.2/1">The table below shows data for the 27 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) that have qualified for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative. These are the only HIPCs in which the IMF and World Bank have carried out debt sustainability analyses. Most of the HIPC countries that have still to qualify for the relief have yet to emerge from prolonged conflict and accurate figures are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/2">A meaningful comparison between debt levels in 1983 and 2003 is almost impossible, as the figures for these years have been calculated in different ways. Furthermore, figures for 1983 are based on 1983 prices and those for 2003 are based on 2003 prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/3">Figures for debt relief do not include additional bilateral assistance outside of the HIPC initiative, nor do they include any topping-up of debt relief that could potentially be provided. Total debt relief in 2003 will therefore be greater than that shown.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/4">A breakdown of total HIPC relief is unavailable, so amounts of both principal and interest written off have not been included in the table. In addition, debt per head of population is not typically used to show a country's level of indebtedness. A more accurate indicator would be the debt: export or debt: government revenue ratios.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.2/5">Figures for 2003 are not yet available for GDP per capita. Again, the use of constant 1995 prices makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from these data. Finally, rather than showing debt relief likely to be remitted over the next two years, the table shows the total debt stock being written off under the HIPC initiative, since this relief is already being delivered on the flow of repayments.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.2/1">The total additional costs arising from the September sittings of the House in 2003 cannot yet be assessed. This is largely because the major works contracts running through the summer are not yet complete and, until they are, contractors will not submit claims for expenditure resulting from any delay and disruption. These claims may then be disputed. Most contracts were also let on the basis of a September sitting, not a 12-week recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/2">The House authorities estimate that the contracts were some &pound;160,000 more expensive than they would have been, which amounts to about 1 per cent of the average summer works spend, and is due mainly to the need to accelerate work on certain areas required by Members during the sittings.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/3">No useful forecast can be made for September 2004 while the figures for 2003 are unknown. Some costs will be unavoidable if only one House sits.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">No new criminal offences were created by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Anti-social Behaviour Act created a number of new offences: Closure of premises where drugs are used unlawfully Remaining on or entering premises in contravention of a closure notice. Obstructing a constable or authorised person acting under Section 1(6) (service of a closure notice) or Section 3(2) (entering the premises or doing anything reasonably necessary to secure the premises against entry). Remaining on premises in respect of which a closure order has been made. Entering the premises. Dispersal of groups Knowingly contravening a direction given under Section 30(4) (to disperse, to leave the relevant locality or prohibiting a return to the relevant locality). Firearms Carrying an air weapon (whether loaded or not) or an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Possession by a person under the age of 17 of an air weapon or ammunition for an air weapon. Firing by a 14 to 16 year-old of an air weapon beyond the boundary of private land under the circumstances where he has the permission of the occupier to shoot unsupervised. Possessing, purchasing or acquiring, or manufacturing, selling or transferring any air rifle, air gun or air pistol which uses, or is designed or adapted for use with, a self-contained gas cartridge system. If at the time that this provision comes into force, a person has such a weapon, it will be an offence to continue possession without a licence. The environment Permitting premises to be open without reasonable excuse in contravention of a closure order issued because a public nuisance is being caused by noise coming from the premises. Selling an aerosol paint container to a person under the age of 16. Public order and trespass Making preparations for or attending a rave within 24 hours of a direction being given under Section 63(2) of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 where a person knows the direction has been given which applies to them. Failure by a person to leave land as soon as reasonably practicable when knowing that a direction under Section 62A of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 has been given which applies to them. Entering any land in the area of the relevant local authority as a trespasser with the intention of residing there within three months of a direction under Section 62A being given. High hedges Failing to comply with a remedial notice to take action in relation to a high hedge. Intentionally obstructing a person exercising the powers to enter the neighbouring land in order to carry out their functions under the Act. We expect all of these measures to be brought into effect during 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.5/1">There is to be a review of the basis of the FCO's travel advice, and an internal review of the FCO's security strategy for its posts abroad. Terms of reference are annexed. The conclusion of the travel advice review will be placed before both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/2">Since September 11, 2001, it has been increasingly clear that we face a form of international terrorism which aims not only to take life randomly by suicide attack, but which seeks to use fear and instability to undermine the freedom and prosperity which the terrorists hate.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/3">Our policy must be to deny the terrorists any advantage. We must take prudent precautions, while minimising the disruption which terrorists want to cause. Some disruption is, of course, inevitable if we are to make likely targets as secure as we can. But we must all be clear that total security is not possible. Everybody who goes about their business in a modern city and elsewhere makes a balanced judgment of risk against security. People continue to go about their daily lives&mdash;vigilantly, amid sound precautions&mdash;because they are not prepared to give the terrorists satisfaction. Our determination to maintain as normal a life as possible is a weapon against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/4">It is important that British citizens travelling abroad should have the best possible information on risk, from the Government. We have extensively reviewed and improved our travel advice since Bali. But we have asked officials to look again at some of the underlying issues, in light of recent experience. What is the right balance between information, warning and advice? We are clear that our advice should give the most detailed and timely factual information possible, but in what circumstances should this information be complemented, where appropriate, with advice not to travel? What is the impact and the cost of our warnings not to travel? And what would be the implications of a different approach? We may conclude that the nature of our advice is as good as we can make it, or we may find that improvements are necessary. We will be seeking as many views as possible including, of course, that of Members of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/5">Security is always at the top of our agenda. We keep the security of all our posts under constant review and frequently re-assess the risks and the measures needed to manage them in the light of changing threat levels. Funds have been authorised for the most urgent expenditure. Following the attack on our consulate in Istanbul, which showed that our overseas missions and staff are in the front line, we immediately asked all posts to check their security measures. We are also looking at additional measures we can take at high-risk posts. In addition, we have instigated an internal review of the FCO's security strategy, in particular the balance between security and operational effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/6">The terms of reference for these reviews are as follows: Travel Advice Review Terms of Reference (i) How can FCO advice best help UK travellers?</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/7" class="indent">How can our travel advice best help its users to make informed, responsible decisions about possible risks overseas, particularly from terrorism, and ways they can minimise them?</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/8" class="indent">What should be the balance in our travel advice between information, warning and advice (ie between description of risks in particular countries and prescription of action in response)?;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/9" class="indent">How far can risk analysis and its presentation be made more objective (eg through statistical analysis and comparison with non-terrorist hazards)?</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/10" class="indent">What would be the implications of variations in this balance for the FCO, others in HMG who help produce the advice, and its users?</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/11" class="indent">How do we link threat level assessments and public information?</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/12" class="indent">How far should we take into consideration the capabilities of host governments in reaching decisions on travel advice? (ii) What are the wider implications of FCO travel advice?</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/13" class="indent">In responding to a terrorist attack, how can we ensure prudent precaution does not become over-reaction which risks playing into the hands of the terrorists? Methodology</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/14" class="indent">During the review we will consult key stakeholders:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/15" class="indent">Departments within HM Government, including the Home Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department for Transport, the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office;</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">The report of the internal inquiry into the incorrect deduction of tax from Service attributable pensions recommended that, in addition to the Inland Revenue refund and repayment supplement, consideration should be given to further compensation for those affected by the error. The Inland Revenue allowed a significant concession in waiving the time limits that normally apply in refunds of tax. However, representations have been made that the Ministry of Defence should pay further compensation to those pensioners for whom the effect of the error persisted over a considerable number of years. The Government accept that, where individuals suffer a financial loss as a result of the Government's administrative errors, then the onus is on that department to restore those individuals to the position they would have enjoyed had the errors not occurred. The Ministry of Defence has already accepted responsibility for the errors which led to tax being wrongly deducted and has apologised unreservedly. We further accept that, in certain cases, payments made so far have not provided full compensation for the cost of the errors to individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/2">We have therefore decided that further ex-gratia compensation will be paid to those who were in receipt of pensions outside the normal six-year Inland Revenue repayment period. Compensation will be calculated by applying compound interest, using the retail prices index plus 2 per cent, to the tax wrongly deducted, net of the estimated repayment by the Inland Revenue. We will also pay ex-gratia compensation, calculated in the same way, to those who suffered from the related error of delays in payment of benefits under the Armed Forces pension scheme, including using the Inland Revenue repayment formula for compensation for errors within the normal six-year period. Payment will be made as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/3">It will, however, take some months to complete all payments because the necessary data on each individual are held mainly on manual records. We deeply regret the errors made but we hope that this offer of compensation will draw matters to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/4">Finally, I would like to express my considerable gratitude to those pensioners, in particular Major John Perry and Captain John Lewis, who have worked tirelessly to bring this matter to our attention and to help with its resolution.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.2/2">The review body recommends a final increase of 6.8 per cent for all Regular and Reserve defence medical services medical and dental officers, in addition to the 3.2 per cent interim award already implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, representing a total increase of 10 per cent. The review body also recommends a pay increase of 3.225 per cent for medical and dental cadets and an out-of-hours supplementary payment of &pound;8,500 to junior doctors. In addition, the review body recommends that there should be no further increase in the values of sustained quality payments, trainer pay and distinction awards, above the interim 3.2 per cent increase already implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/3">The cost of these recommendations to the defence budget, including the interim award already implemented, will be some &pound;14.5 million. This will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.2/1">Through personal, social and health education (PSHE) all pupils should learn about taking on responsibility and the consequences of their actions in relation to sexual activity and parenthood. Sex and relationship education should give young people a clear understanding of the arguments for delaying sexual activity. There has been a 10 per cent fall in the under-18 conception rate since 1998. This is an encouraging sign of progress in implementing the teenage pregnancy strategy, a key element of which is improved sex and relationship education.</p>

The introduction of citizenship education alongside the PSHE framework, providing for pupils to be taught about responsibilities whether moral, social, or parental, effectively complement the personal and social development of pupils provided at home.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.2/2">The Council reached partial political agreement on the articles of a new regulation to replace Regulation 1408/71 co-ordinating social security systems for people moving from one member state to another. In particular, member states reached a compromise on unemployment benefit for people who live in a member state other than the one where they last worked. This relates to a reimbursement system that member states have agreed to: the last state of work will reimburse part of the unemployment benefit paid by the state of residence. The UK retains a parliamentary scrutiny on this regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/3">The Council discussed the Commission communication on structural indicators for next year's spring Council and took note of the opinions of the Economic Policy Committee, the Working Group on Environment, Employment Committee and Social Protection Committee. The presidency invited the General Affairs and External Relations Council to adopt joint conclusions as close as possible to the existing draft.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/4">The Council adopted conclusions on disability, on immigration, integration and employment and on gender equality indicators. The Council also agreed a general approach on a Council decision establishing a Social Protection Committee. Council noted the other business items without comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/5">In the consumer affairs part of the Council, a resolution on the safety of services was adopted without comment. There was a general policy discussion on the proposed EC Regulation on Consumer Protection Co-operation, and the UK supported the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/6">The main health business related to the proposal for a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Discussion focused on the scope of the centre, which is due to be operational by 2005, with member states agreeing it should concentrate initially on communicable disease, with the possibility of broadening the remit following external evaluation of its operations at a later date. Issues still to be resolved include the legal base, where the UK retained its reserve, and data protection requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/7">A draft Council decision was adopted authorising the Commission to negotiate the revision of the International Health Regulations under the framework of the World Health Organisation, within its area of competence.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/8">The Council conclusions emerging from a conference on Healthy Lifestyles: Education, Information and Communication were adopted. These cover action on lifestyles monitoring and evaluation and impact assessment, aimed to help to develop a European action plan to promote healthy lifestyles.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/9">The Council Recommendation on Cancer Screening advocating mass cancer screening through clearly established and scientifically proven methods in quality controlled screening programmes was also adopted, as was the Council Resolution on Pharmaceuticals and Public Health Challenges&mdash;Focusing on the Patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/10">The Council adopted Council conclusions on medical devices which acknowleged the importance of medical devices in health and social care, endorse the good work done so far and invite further work to strengthen co-ordination, interpretation and implementation of the sectoral directives in the interests of protecting public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/11">The Council received information from the Italian Presidency on the threat posed by malaria. The French delegation presented information on raising tobacco tax to help to reduce tobacco consumption and the Irish delegation presented proposals for the forthcoming Irish presidency where the emphasis will be placed on cardiovascular disease and e-health matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.2/1">In the event of a successful London Olympic bid, Camelot's estimates, as reviewed by the National Lottery Commission, are that new Olympic lottery games could raise &pound;750 million towards the costs of staging the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Lottery duty of 12 per cent of total sales would be deducted, in line with the current arrangements for all National Lottery games, resulting in estimated gross revenue to the Exchequer of approximately &pound;340 million. However, the net increase in revenue to the Exchequer is likely to be significantly lower, perhaps in the region of &pound;140 million. This estimate is based on Camelot's assessment that over half of new Olympic lottery sales might represent diversion from existing lottery games.</p>
