	<p pid="a.191.2/3">If their travel is not on party business, Front-Bench spokesmen may recover the costs of travel on parliamentary business within the United Kingdom from the Peers' Reimbursement Allowance scheme, on the same basis as Back-Bench Members. In common with other Members, Front-Bench spokesmen may not claim subsistence costs arising from such journeys under the Peers' Reimbursement Allowance scheme, since such allowances can only be claimed after attendance at a sitting of the House or a committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/4">Cranborne money is the money provided by the House to fund the Opposition parties in the House of Lords. The House agreed to a substantial uprating of Cranborne money funds in 2002. It is up to each party to choose how to use the Cranborne money funds allocated to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.9/1">The Ministry of Defence is announcing the publication of a new report entitled Improving the Delivery of Cross Departmental Support and Services for Veterans, which the department commissioned from King's College London last year. The publication of this study demonstrates the commitment of the Government as a whole to the veterans initiative through the participation of a working group which included members from the Department of Health, Home Office, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Her Majesty's Treasury, Department for Work and Pensions and veterans' organisations. The aim was to produce a map of veterans' needs, with emphasis on the more vulnerable veterans, match this against current provision and identify priority research gaps. This involved a literature survey, detailed interviews with &quot;at risk&quot; personnel, and analysis and further interviews of an existing cohort of personnel for ex-service outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.9/2">This study is a preliminary scoping study and will inform the direction of policy and research. It therefore represents an important contribution to the veterans initiative. The report conclusions confirm that &quot;For many (indeed most) personnel military life is 'a great leveller'; it is a positive experience (especially for disadvantaged youths who enter service early), allowing them to enjoy a more favourable life trajectory&quot;, and that &quot;Over three-quarters of service leavers do well and gain employment after leaving&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.9/3">The report finds that there is little peer-reviewed published UK literature on outcomes of veterans, and that most published research concerns US service and ex-service personnel, from which it would be inaccurate to draw extrapolations. It also shows that mental health is an important issue&mdash;most personnel do not develop problems as a result of their service, but the small percentage that do can face a range of difficulties in civilian life, including access to appropriate treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.9/4">The Government welcome this report and would like to thank Professor Wessely and his team for their work. The report recommends a number of actions, as well as further research on ways to help the most vulnerable groups. We can confirm that we will look in detail at these recommendations and will evaluate them against existing policies and activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.9/5">A copy of the full report will be placed in the Library of the House, and also on the websites of the MOD and Veterans Agency, at <a href="http://www.mod.uk">www.mod.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.veteransagency.mod.uk">www.veteransagency.mod.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="a.194.2/1">The existing night low flying system (NLFS) will remain unchanged in principle, but some adjustments are being made to its structure and management to improve the efficiency of the system and reflect an increasing requirement for helicopters to be able to train at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.2/2">The NFLS is divided into two by a line from Swansea in the west to Colchester in the east. The southern area is allocated to rotary-wing aircraft and the northern area to fixed-wing aircraft, with small exceptions to account for locations where rotary-wing aircraft are based in the fixed-wing region and vice-versa. This basis remains unchanged, but the area available to rotary-wing aircraft will be increased and the system made more flexible by the introduction of sectors that may now be allocated to either fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft. In addition, we are introducing some management changes to make the procedures that units use to book in to the system more efficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.2/3">The Government understand that military low flying training is disturbing, and can reassure the House that there is not expected to be a significant impact for those on the ground as a result of these changes. The existing basis of the NFLS will remain, and for most of the country there will be no change to the structure of the system. Where change is being introduced, the impact is generally expected to be limited to the possibility that those on the ground may witness different aircraft types than may currently be the case, and will be small in scale. We have considered the requirement for a sustainability review and recognise that some parts of the changes may lead to such a requirement, although, as stated, the overall impact is likely to be small. Where necessary we can confirm that more detailed work may be carried out. Detailed environmental impact and sustainability studies are being carried out in respect of AH 64, which is likely to be one of the major users of the revised NLFS.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.2/4">Finally, night flying is essential if our aircrews are going to meet the demands that are placed upon them. These changes will assist with these demands.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">Potato brown rot is a serious disease of potatoes listed in the Plant Health Directive (2000/29/EC). A Control Directive (98/57/EC) is also in place, requiring member states to carry out surveys and take specific measures in the event of an outbreak. Potato brown rot is not established in the UK, but the organism which causes the disease has been detected in some watercourses, resulting in irrigation and spraying prohibitions for some potato and tomato growers. The organism persists in water through woody nightshade, another host plant, with roots in contaminated watercourses.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">Defra (then MAFF) instigated a programme in 1998 to establish whether the removal of woody nightshade from the banks of selected watercourses would result in the elimination of the organism. This work is being co-ordinated by the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate with input from a number of government and industry organisations. Decisions about the introduction and removal of restrictions are taken by Plant Health Division, following an annual stakeholder meeting at which the plans and results for the monitoring and woody nightshade programmes are discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/3">In 2002, following two years of negative results, including testing at increased sensitivity in the second year, it was established that the organism had been eliminated from two watercourses associated with the River Nene (the Willowbrook and Ise) and part of the Nene itself, as well as the Hogwell Sewer in Kent. As a result, irrigation and spraying restrictions were lifted from these watercourses in March 2003. Defra's monitoring and woody nightshade removal programme is continuing in 2003 and details of plans and progress, as well as information about watercourses currently under restriction, are available on Defra's website at http://defra/planth/brownrot.htm</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/1">Subject to the will of Parliament, the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill will give primary care trusts new duties for commissioning local National Health Service dental services. Primary care trusts will have a duty to secure the provision of primary dental services either through contracts with individual practices or by providing services themselves. With these new responsibilities, the &pound;1.2 billion currently held centrally for funding dental services will pass to primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/2">Until then, we will continue to work with the NHS and the dental profession to support NHS dentistry and to reform it to meet local needs. We are today announcing additional funding of &pound;65.2 million to support change and help improve access, quality and choice for patients. The funding will be targeted at those primary care trusts where access is a real problem and will be on top of the &pound;1.2 billion which is currently held centrally and which will in time go to primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/3">The &pound;65.2 million will be used as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/4" class="indent">&pound;35 million to enable primary care trusts to improve access, choice and quality for patients;</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/5" class="indent">&pound;30 million for information technology to integrate dentistry within the national information technology programme;</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/6" class="indent">&pound;200,000 to develop dental leadership skills within strategic health authorities and primary care trusts to support them with the dental change agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/7">This funding comes on top of the &pound;9 million announced last month for the NHS support team that has been set up to work with those areas where it is hardest to find an NHS dentist and a further &pound;1 million to help primary care trusts, local dental committees and dentists to prepare for the change in the way dental services are commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/8">There are many examples of excellent NHS dental services and we want to reward NHS dentists and make practice in the NHS an attractive option. The programme of reform we are now embarked on will enable the NHS, dentists and patients to influence local services in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/9">As well as the changes flowing from the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, we have also asked Harry Cayton, the director for patient experience and public involvement at the department, to undertake a review of patient charges for NHS dentistry. This review involves patient groups and other stakeholders and will be reporting to Ministers by April 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.3/1">The Department of Health has set three objectives to support the elimination of mixed-sex accommodation with a target to achieve these in 95 per cent of trusts by December 2002. The objectives are designed to deliver separate sleeping areas, separate toilet and washing facilities and safe facilities for the mentally ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/2">The National Health Service has made excellent progress. At the target date: 98 per cent of NHS trusts provided single-sex sleeping accommodation for planned admissions and had robust operational policies in place to protect patients' privacy and dignity; 95 per cent of NHS trusts met the additional criteria set to ensure the safety of patients who are mentally ill (this has now risen to 96 per cent); and 93 per cent of NHS trusts provided properly segregated bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women. This has risen to 95 per cent.</p>
