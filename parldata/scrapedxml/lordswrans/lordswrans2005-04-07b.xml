	<p pid="b.128.8/1">The UK Government are committed to the goal of 100 per cent debt relief for poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa. DfID continues to press for the rapid and full implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. This initiative is delivering real benefits to some of the world's poorest countries. To date, over $70 billion in debt relief is being provided to 27 countries, including 23 in sub-Saharan Africa, reducing their debts by around two-thirds on average, and freeing up resources for spending on poverty reduction. The UK goes beyond the HIPC initiative and writes off 100 per cent of bilateral debts for HIPC countries and holds in trust any debt service payments received from HIPC countries that have not yet qualified for debt relief, to be returned for spending on poverty reduction once qualified.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.8/2">Despite the successes of the HIPC initiative, the UK believes that we must go further still. Many bilateral donors have joined the UK in providing 100 per cent bilateral relief, but multilateral institutions currently provide relief at around half this level. The UK has therefore announced a major new initiative for relief of 100 per cent multilateral debt. The UK has committed to paying its share (10 per cent) of the debt service payments owed to the World Bank and the African Development Bank on behalf of eligible countries, and is actively working to encourage other countries to participate, allowing realisation of our goal of 100 per cent. multilateral debt relief. DfID is also urging the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to consider options for financing its share of 100 per cent debt relief, including through the use of internal resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.8/3">DfID is keen to ensure both the equitable treatment of HIPC and non-HIPC countries and that the savings accrued from this debt relief are spent on achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs). For this reason, relief will be extended to all countries that have formally completed the HIPC process and all other International Development Association (IDA) (i.e. eligible to borrow only from the most concessional lending arm World Bank) low-income countries with sound public financial management systems. Twelve African countries currently meet these criteria, but this number will increase as more countries complete the HIPC process or reach the public financial management standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.8/4">Broader and deeper debt relief was discussed at the G7 Finance Ministers meeting in February, where it was agreed that further debt relief was needed, and in principle, as much as 100 per cent multilateral debt relief. We will continue to work with G7 countries, the IMF and the World Bank to put this principle into action and encourage them to join us in this initiative, so that no poor country in Africa committed to poverty reduction and the MDGs has to choose between servicing its debt and funding development. Canada has recently announced that it will also pay its share (4 per cent), and we hope that others will join us soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.8/5">In summary, although the UK is committed to the goal of 100 per cent bilateral and multilateral debt relief for the world's poorest countries, and much has been achieved to date, we recognise that there is still further to go. We will therefore continue to work hard and take the lead within the international community in ensuring that broader and deeper debt relief is provided for poor countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.130.9/1">Sri Lanka is a middle-income country with a relatively small proportion of people living in absolute poverty (approximately 1 million, or 6 per cent of the population are estimated to be living on less than $1 per day). It has nearly achieved most of the millennium development goals. Poverty reduction in Sri Lanka is dependent upon ending the 20-year civil war, and achieving lasting peace. DfID's programme in Sri Lanka is therefore focused on peace-building and conflict-prevention, both of which are crucial to poverty-reduction in Sri Lanka. We aim to support the wider international effort in Sri Lanka and to reduce Sri Lanka's vulnerability to falling back to lower-income status. DfID works closely with the FCO and MoD under the framework of a joint peace-building and reconciliation strategy. We will be reviewing the strategy towards the end of this year, and will make announcements about future support following this review about future support.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.9/2">Following the tsunami, the UK announced that Sri Lanka would be added to the list of countries eligible for the UK's multilateral debt initiative. Under this initiative, the UK will pay a share (10 per cent, or around &pound;55 million) of Sri Lanka's debt service costs to the World Bank until 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.9/3">DfID does not have a &quot;country office&quot; in Sri Lanka. A small team based in the British High Commission in Colombo helps deliver the Sri Lanka programme, which is managed by our Bangkok office.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.9/1">There are very little data on the number of people who have died in Darfur. The World Health Organisation (WHO) survey on mortality, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-15">15 October 2004</phrase>, estimated that between the beginning of March and end of September cumulative excess deaths were between 35,000 and 70,000. The UN Emergency Response Co-ordinator, Jan Egeland recently suggested that there had been up to 180,000 deaths in Darfur. We understand that this figure is extrapolated from findings of the WHO survey. However, the WHO survey was only of internally displaced people in camps. Though it asked respondents to report deaths during the previous two months, it is not possible from the answers provided to calculate with confidence how many of the deaths reported were due to violence or other causes prior to arrival in the camps.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.9/2">DfID recognises the need for more accurate data, and the UK is funding a second crude mortality survey by the World Health Organisation in conjunction with the Sudanese Ministry of Health. We expect results by the end of May. This can, however, give only a snapshot of the situation. We are unlikely ever to get a full picture of deaths from this conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.9/3">According to the latest UN humanitarian needs profile for Darfur, at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March 2005</phrase> there were 2.45 million people in Darfur affected by the crisis and in need of humanitarian assistance. Of these, 1.86 million were displaced. There are an additional 200,000 refugees from Darfur across the border in eastern Chad.</p>

	<p pid="b.138.9/1">The Government welcome the focus of Human Rights Watch on an issue that will require further effort from the Turkish Government, and broadly supports the recommendations of the report <i>Still Critical</i>. We would concur with the report's conclusion that the Turkish Government's current proposals have the potential to address the recommendations of the United Nations Special Representative on Internal Displacement in large measure, if they are implemented quickly and thoroughly. We maintain a high level dialogue with the Turkish Government on their domestic reform programme, including on the issue of internally displaced persons.</p>

The European Commission's 2004 regular report on Turkey's progress towards accession included an assessment of the progress made by the Turkish Government in addressing the return of displaced persons. The European Commission, as mandated by the European Council in December 2004, continues to monitor the situation and will report again this October. Our embassy monitors the human rights situation in Turkey closely and maintains a regular dialogue with the Commission office in Ankara.</p>

	<p pid="b.139.5/1">A status letter may be issued in the circumstances described. However a status letter would not normally be sent in cases where the documentary evidence possessed by a person conclusively shows him or her to be a British national. Instead a letter confirming recognition of the person's nationality status on production of those documents should be sufficient confirmation of his or her status.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.5/2">A status letter should be issued only if it is certain that the person in question wants one, or if one is needed to confirm recognition that that person possesses British nationality (e.g. in order to obtain a British passport).</p>

	<p pid="b.140.1/2" qnum="HL1666">What improvements they have been able to make since the summer of 2004 in the systems for booking family and next-of kin visits to prisoners and for informing next-of-kin when prisoners are moved from one prison to another.</p>

	<p pid="b.140.2/1">The Prison Service has a statutory obligation to encourage and assist prisoners to maintain meaningful family ties as an integral part of their rehabilitation. Regular contact with family can help the prisoner to achieve a better transition from imprisonment to resettlement within the community. Successful reintegration is important in reducing the likelihood of reoffending and, in turn, meeting the prime objectives of protecting the public and reducing crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.2/2">One of the aids to improving communication and contact with families is an efficient telephone booking system for visits. Many establishments now provide such a service. The Prison Service is also developing a new electronic booking system which is initially to be rolled out to eight establishments and will be made available to other prisons in due course. Comprehensive written information on visiting arrangements is now available for families and other visitors and further guidance will be issued shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.2/3">With regard to the transfer of prisoners, it is well established policy and practice in such circumstances to provide at least one special letter in addition to the statutory allowance, and prompt access to a telephone. Alternatively, staff may call on behalf of the prisoner. There are a small number of prisoners (for example high risk prisoners) where, for operational and security reasons, details of their transfer cannot be provided until the transfer has been completed. The onus is on the prisoner to determine who should be contacted. For privacy reasons, there is no obligation to contact next of kin.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.2/4">Since summer 2004, approximately 10 per cent more telephones have been made available to prisoners across the estate, increasing their number to 3,615.</p>

It will be for individual schemes to decide what benefits will be payable to surviving civil partners.</p>

Under the regulations, an employer may lawfully provide different benefits as between people who are married and those who are not married. The Government are currently seeking views on amendments to the regulations. Those amendments will provide that, for service after civil partnership is introduced, it will become unlawful to provide different benefits to civil partners and married persons on the grounds of their sexual orientation.</p>

	<p pid="b.152.0/1">The review of policy for the long-term management of the United Kingdom's (UK's) low-level radioactive waste is the responsibility of government (i.e. UK government and the devolved administrations). The aim of the policy review programme is to issue a consultation on the policy around the turn of the year. The initial stages of the review are being overseen by the Government's Radioactive Waste Policy Group (RWPG), made up of UK government, devolved administration and regulatory body representatives. RWPG's task is to consider the issues and potential solutions, on the basis of sounding stakeholder views, and to deliver drafts of consultation material for Government to consider. The steering group that RWPG has itself established to manage its work consists of representatives of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the Scottish Executive (SE), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Environment Agency (EA), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). The steering group is jointly chaired by Defra and the NDA. Representation from these organisations may change over time. Steering group meetings are also attended by representatives of: British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), British Energy (BEn), Nirex and GE Healthcare to assist with the preparation of data on the types and volumes of waste to be dealt with; University College London (UCL) which has been appointed as the independent facilitator for two stakeholder workshops to be held during the course of 2005; and Atkins Environment which is providing more general technical support to the work. The steering group's remit is to provide draft consultation material for the full RWPG to consider by around October/November 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.152.3/1">A licence granted by the department to allow the shooting of cormorants provides a defence for the licensee against prosecution under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for the actions allowed under that licence. It does not exempt the licensee from any firearms legislation and/or other legislation which is designed to offer protection to the public, which must be complied with. As such, protection of the public is not affected by whether or not shooting takes place under a Defra licence and so no special measures are needed.</p>
