	<p pid="a.61.5/1">The Guidance on the Methodology for Multi-Modal Studies, issued in March 2000, recognised that local authorities have powers to introduce road user charging schemes. The guidance also noted that, although there were no plans to introduce more widespread charging schemes on the inter-urban network, it was important that all potential options for resolving problems within study corridors were explored. The guidance therefore advised that it would be &quot;appropriate for the studies to examine the contribution that charging on selected corridors and sections of the trunk road network might make to the delivery of the Government's transport objectives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">In addition, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Goverment and the Regions wrote to the chairs of regional planning bodies on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-24">24 May 2002</phrase>. Among other things, his letter said that multi-modal study recommendations &quot;should build in flexibility as to what should be done now given that we do not believe that a system of road user charging for cars could be introduced this decade and that no decisions have been made about the longer term introduction of road user charging&quot;. The same advice was conveyed to the study teams.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.5/1">Decisions on whether to support an application for clemency are taken at ministerial level. When considering an application for clemency on compassionate grounds, Ministers will as a general rule mirror the policy applied by the UK prison services when considering applications for early release on compassionate grounds submitted by prisoners in the UK. Each application for support will be considered on its merits on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/2">Ministers would not normally support a plea for clemency on compassionate grounds if a prisoner transfer agreement exists between the UK and the sentencing state and a transfer to the UK could be completed within a reasonable time frame. In such circumstances, any request for early or temporary release on compassionate grounds could then be made to the appropriate UK prison authority.</p>

There have been no deprivations since 1973, although a number of cases have been considered. The names given to British nationals have changed over time as new legislation has been introduced.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.8/1">The Strategic Rail Authority's accountants have advised that Network Rail should be consolidated into the accounts of the Strategic Rail Authority. This judgment is based on the application of generally accepted accounting practice (GAPP). This is the system used in the UK to prepare accounts for companies and other types of bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/2">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) determined that Network Rail should be recorded as a private sector body in national accounts. ONS's judgment is based on the application of the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). The rules of ESA95 are used across Europe for the preparation of national accounts, which is an integrated set of macro-economic statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/3">Since Network Rail will be classified to the private sector, its own expenditure and borrowing will not be included in public sector statistics such as public sector net borrowing. But any payments by government to Network Rail will score in those statistics.</p>

Our pension paying offices also arrange for the regular payment of pensions to retired Gurkhas, who are entitled to an immediate pension after only 15 years service.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">Separately, the department supports the work of the Gurkha Welfare Trust, an independent charity established in 1969 to provide financial, medical and community aid to Gurkhas and their families when they leave the British Army. The Ministry of Defence makes an annual grant in order to pay for the administrative costs of its field arm, the Gurkha Welfare Scheme (GWS), headed by our defence attache in Kathmandu. It spends some &pound;6.5 million each year in Nepal and our contribution enables all the money raised by the trust through charitable donations and public appeals to be used solely for welfare purposes. The GWS now also provides, even in the most remote areas of Nepal, primary healthcare, first aid and emergency treatment, doctors' clinics and elementary dentistry, all free of charge. It is also involved in community projects and the award of one-off hardship payments in respect of individual catastrophes. No genuine case of hardship is ever turned away and its work not only benefits our ex-servicemen, but is also of value to the infrastructure of Nepal as a whole.</p>

These proposals will impact on the way performance tables for secondary schools are compiled in future. The Green Paper sought views on how these issues might be addressed.

	<p pid="a.70.6/1">The Radio Authority issued a press release in May 2001 to advertise the Access Radio pilot project, inviting interested parties to submit a letter of intent. It also wrote to groups which had attended an Access Radio seminar in February 2001 and to community groups that had broadcast under the authority's short-term restricted service licence in the previous year. Fifteen groups were selected from the 200 letters of intent which were received by the deadline. One of these, Northern Visions Radio (NVR) in Belfast, has stated in its promise of delivery, which forms part of its licence, that &quot;under the Good Friday Agreement and the European Charter for Minority Languages NVR will seek to encourage the use of the Irish language and Ulster Scots&quot;. NVR commenced broadcasting on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-09">9 March</phrase>. Their licence lasts for one year.</p>

The NIFTC welcomes applications for training from all sectors of the community, including those working in minority languages. The NITFC has received no specific approaches regarding training in Ulster Scots in the last two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.5/1">I presume the noble Duke is referring to the article on research on foot and mouth disease by Dr Donaldson in the Veterinary Record of <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-12">12 May 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/2">Instructions issued to the State Veterinary Service on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-06">6 April</phrase> state that the key methods of transmission of foot and mouth (FMD) have been &quot;through animal, human, mechanical or airborne transfer between neighbouring farms&quot;. In the light of the epidemiological background, it is believed that susceptible animals on farms neighbouring a farm where infection has been confirmed will have been exposed to the infection of FMD. The culling of susceptible animals on contiguous farms was vital to prevent further onward spread of the disease. The Winslade case was one where my department obtained a High Court injunction to enable the culling of cattle on a contiguous farm.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/3">The article by Dr Donaldson concerns itself with only one route of transmission&mdash;airborne spread. His research shows that with the particular strain we were dealing with, airborne spread was unlikely to play much part in the lateral spread of disease. But in the 2001 outbreak the other routes were important. Analysis has shown that nearly 80 per cent of cases occurred within 3km of existing infected place and the likely method of spread was put down to one or more of the other routes of infection given above. Dr Donaldson's paper downplays these other routes in the belief that livestock farmers operated good biosecurity. However, this was not always the case.</p>
