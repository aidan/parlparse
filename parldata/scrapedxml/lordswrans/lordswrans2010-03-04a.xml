	<p pid="a.359.2/1">The composition of the Afghan delegation to the London conference on Afghanistan was a matter for the Afghan Government. The Afghan Government ensured that all relevant Ministers were in attendance. The spokesperson for the Afghan Women's Network gave a presentation on behalf of Afghan women to the London conference and circulated a Written Statement on this to all conference participants. A delegation of Afghan female leaders were also involved in a series of events in the run up to the conference. They took part in a civil society conference where they made statements, and questioned and lobbied FCO Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/2">Members of the delegation also attended a reception on the eve of the conference, where they used the opportunity to lobby President Karzai, Hillary Clinton and other Foreign Ministers. The UK regularly discusses women's rights with members of the Afghan Government, NGOs and parliamentarians and continues to urge the Afghan Government to uphold the Afghan constitution, which demands equal treatment of men and women.</p>

The UK is committed to gender equality and fully supports implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 to protect the rights of women and girls in areas suffering conflict and to incorporate their perspectives in conflict resolution and peacekeeping planning.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.3/1">Defra has worked with various equine sector stakeholder groups to quantify the maximum compensation value. The policy to cap the maximum payment to &#163;2,500 for disease-free animals is proportionate and fair to the horse owner, and does not place an unfair burden on the taxpayer. There is an overriding consideration of protecting public expenditure in an outbreak situation and also of protecting against the problems associated in attempting to accurately place a market value on a high-value horse immediately before it was killed.</p>

	<p pid="a.368.2/1">The Government do not hold statistics for how many UK officials in EU institutions have studied at the College of Europe. However the college estimate that from a total of 675 British alumni, at least 80 are currently working in EU institutions, and at least a further 80 to 100 are actively engaged on EU affairs either in Brussels or in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.2/2">The Government believe that UK nationals are under-represented in EU institutions, and are undertaking a programme of activities to resolve this, including the relaunch of the European fast stream, better co-ordination of secondments of UK officials to EU institutions, and work to identify and address issues which may deter UK nationals who are considering a career in the EU. The role of the College of Europe is included in this programme, and the Government will be restoring a number of scholarships to the College of Europe for this year, while undertaking a review of the best ways to meet the programme's objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.370.2/36">Estimates of the quantities of fish discarded are obtained by UK fisheries laboratories, which send observers to sea to record fish discarded and retained by fishing vessels. Sampling of Scottish-registered vessels started in the mid-1970s and vessels registered in England and Wales have been sampled routinely since the mid-1990s. The sampling applies to vessels registered in UK ports and does not distinguish between vessels under UK ownership and those with owners of other nationalities. It is only possible to sample a proportion of the vessels participating in any fishery and provide estimates of the quantities of discards of the main commercial species, which may not be representative of all UK fisheries. Details of such estimates are provided in the tables below.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.2/37">The current system for recording catch data does not allow us to differentiate why each fish is discarded. Regulatory reasons for discarding include the fish being undersize (below minimum landing size), over-quota or where catch composition rules require that certain species must not exceed a stated proportion of landings when using particular gear types. Commercial reasons include high-grading (the discarding of legally landable fish to conserve quota for more valuable fish) or where there is no market for the fish caught. Recently, the EU introduced legislation to eliminate high-grading, and fishers must now retain all fish caught, which can be legally landed.</p>

	<p pid="a.372.5/1">In my previous reply, I explained that, because of a significant change in the process of obtaining consent to inspections, direct comparisons should not be made between the results of the 2007-08 survey of child dental health and previous surveys. It is therefore premature to conclude that dental health in the Heart of Birmingham has worsened. In the 2007 Index of Multiple Deprivation, Heart of Birmingham Primary Care Trust was the most deprived of all 152 PCTs. In the 2007-08 survey, the average number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) for the Heart of Birmingham PCT was 1.67 compared to a national average for England of 1.11. Manchester PCT, which was the fifth most deprived, but does not have the benefit of fluoridated water, had an average DMFT of 2.39. We need further experience of conducting child dental health surveys where the positive consent of parents/carers to inspections is required before judging if they are as reliable as those in which consent was assumed if no objection to the inspection was received.</p>

	<p pid="a.373.2/1">Halal food products are subject to the same requirements and official controls as non-Halal foodstuffs and, as such, would be inspected by authorised officers at all stages of the food chain to ensure compliance with food safety and food labelling requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.2/2">There is no requirement in United Kingdom law to provide the method of slaughter on food labelling. Therefore, Halal labelling is voluntary. However, there are general legal provisions outlawing false or misleading labelling and if a Halal claim is made then manufacturers must make sure they do not use it misleadingly. Authorised officers are asked to consider action, where appropriate, against food business operators who sell and misdescribe Halal foods, in the same way as they would for any contravention of food law in food premises generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.2/3">The Government take incidents of food fraud seriously and have put resources in place to help authorised officers effectively target and address illegal activity, including any incidents of this type.</p>

	<p pid="a.374.2/1">If pensions were equalised on a year-for-year basis for all those Gurkhas who left service before <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> at the same level as the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 (AFPS75), there would be a one-off capital cost of circa &#163;500 million for pension arrears. Detailed costings have not been carried out but the figure of &#163;500 million would relate to the underpayment of immediate pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.2/2">There would be some Gurkhas (mainly above the rank of sergeant) who would have served long enough to qualify for an immediate pension under AFPS75. These individuals would have been underpaid in AFPS75 terms from the date that they left service, having reached the immediate pension point. This would mean that their pensions were in arrears, and there would therefore have to be back payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.2/3">The main beneficiaries would be officers, who generally serve long enough to reach the immediate pension point (16 years from the age of 21) compared with other ranks who usually served for less than the 22 years (from age 18) required to qualify for an immediate pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.2/4">MoD's policy on Gurkha pension arrangements is based on grounds of principle and fairness; once an individual has left public service it has been the policy of successive Governments not to change retrospectively the terms of their pension arrangements. MoD's position that pensions should not be equalised for those who left service before <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> has been successfully upheld in the High Court.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.2/2">The Department for Work and Pensions does not withdraw national insurance numbers once they have been allocated except in very limited circumstances. This is because a national insurance number, even if only used for a limited period, links an individual to their national insurance contributions record which may be relevant in any future claim to benefits or state pension. The limited circumstances in which a national insurance number would be withdrawn are (a) as a result of an administrative error such as where a duplicate number has been issued, or (b) where, as a result of checks made, there is no evidence of activity on the national insurance number in the six months following allocation. Such actions, where appropriate, would be applied to any national insurance number allocated and are not specific to foreign nationals who have left the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.383.2/1">In addition to any permission needed from the landowner, the placement of trestles for oyster cultivation in Tremerlin Cove in the Helford River would need the consent of Natural England, if the trestles were to be situated in that area of the cove notified as a site of special scientific interest. Such consent would be needed under the provisions of Section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. NE has not granted any such consent in the past 10 years, but has taken action to ensure the removal of trestles (for the cultivation of oysters) which were placed within the SSSI without consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.2/2">The Marine and Fisheries Agency (MFA) also exercises controls which may apply to works associated with shellfish cultivation. The MFA's consent is required, pursuant to Section 34 of the Coast Protection Act 1949 (CPA), for the deposit of objects or materials on any part of the seashore within the SAC lying below mean high water springs and the removal of objects or materials on any part of the seashore lying below mean low water springs, if the operation causes or is likely to result in obstruction or danger to navigation. Section 35 of the CPA contains exceptions to these requirements. The MFA has not granted any consent for the placement of trestles at Tremerlin Cove in the past 10 years. It is currently considering an application under the CPA for the placement of sub-tidal cages in a different area of the river.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.2/3">It is for the consenting authority to consider whether an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is required for any development proposal, under domestic legislation implementing the EIA directive, where that legislation is applicable. It is also for the consenting authority to consider whether to undertake any appropriate assessment required under the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c) Regulations 1994 (as amended), which implement the EU Habitats Directive in Great Britain.</p>

We have long recognised that the treaty body system would profit from strengthening to render it more efficient and effective. This has become more important as the work of the treaty bodies has grown with new instruments and increased ratifications. We are looking at how to follow up on this valuable initiative and have discussed it with the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights emphasising our support for the continued work of the treaty bodies and their independence.</p>

	<p pid="a.388.6/1">An order under the Transport and Works Act (TWA) can in certain circumstances authorise works which would interfere with public navigation rights, but the obtaining of a TWA order is not a compulsory requirement. A TWA order cannot be made where its primary object could be achieved by an order under the Harbours Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.6/2">The main benefit of obtaining a TWA order for such works is that it provides a defence of statutory authority against an action for nuisance arising from the interference with the common law right of navigation. It is, however, entirely a matter for the person proposing to carry out such works to decide whether they require the protection that a TWA order can give them.</p>

	<p pid="a.389.2/1">The UK Government recognise the importance of women's political participation and their involvement in peacebuilding efforts. We currently support work in a number of conflict-affected states to build women's political empowerment and use our position at the UN to influence the work of the Peacebuilding Support Office to ensure that women's roles are considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.2/2">As part of the review of our national action plan, we are considering how best to progress work in these areas. We have sought the views of civil society and are planning to hold further discussion, including on these issues as part of the process. However, as the review is not yet complete, we are currently unable to provide details of our future plans to support these two areas.</p>
