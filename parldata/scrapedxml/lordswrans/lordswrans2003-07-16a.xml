	<p pid="a.118.5/1">The principle of appointment on merit is central to the judicial appointments process. Those appointed should be those who are best qualified for the job, irrespective of gender, ethnic origin or sexual orientation, However, it is important to be able to make appointments from the widest possible pool of applicants, and the judicial appointments process should seek to bring forward the most talented candidates for appointment from the diverse groups within our society. A judiciary which better reflects the diversity of the population it serves will enhance public confidence in the justice system. The creation of a judicial appointments commission will provide a fresh opportunity to look at the ways in which the appointments processes work.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-07-16a.121.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="121"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030716/text/30716w02.htm#30716w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.121.0/1">The report of my review has been published today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and sent to those who contributed their views to the review or who were invited to do so. A copy has also been placed on the website of the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, which can be found at <a href="http://www.lslo.gov.uk">www.lslo.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/2">The fundamental objective of my review has been to improve public confidence in the decisions of the CPS and the way the Crown Prosecution Service takes decisions and carries out its statutory role in cases arising from a death in custody. Some important themes have emerged from this review, and the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that changes to CPS practice are needed in a number of respects.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/3">The core themes that emerged from the review and in relation to which changes are being implemented clustered around the following: the role of the CPS during the criminal investigation; how the Crown Prosecution Service can best deliver high-quality, efficient decision-making that commands public confidence; and how the CPS can communicate more effectively with the families of people who die in custody where there is a criminal investigation into the circumstances in which that person died.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/4">The review sets out a package of measures to improve the practice of the Crown Prosecution Service in its handling of deaths in custody. The following measures are being or have been implemented:</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/5" class="indent">1. The CPS definition of deaths in custody, which will identifiy those cases that will be subject to the special internal procedures set out in this report, will be brought into line with that of the Home Office where police-related deaths are concerned. The definition so far as it relates to deaths in prison custody will remain the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/6" class="indent">2. While any deaths in custody that are referred to the CPS for advice or prosecution will continue to be dealt with by the casework directorate (as recommended in the Butler review), the pool of Crown Prosecution Service lawyers taking decisions in death in custody cases will be widened to speed up the decision-making process and to enable the most senior lawyers in the service, including the Director personally, to advise on and to take decisions in individual cases. In order to increase the available lawyers involved, steps are or will be taken to enable suitably qualified lawyers below senior civil servant level in the casework directorate to take decisions; and to alter the current arrangements for decision-making to allow greater input by senior lawyers into the most critical casework decisions that the service faces. I announced this change in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-27">27 February 2003</phrase> at col. WA 47.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/7" class="indent">3. The pool of counsel instructed to advise will be widened.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/8" class="indent">4. The independent police complaints commission will become fully operational in 2004. As it will have the role and capacity to undertake some investigations in-house, including death in custody cases, the Crown Prosecution Service is discussing with the IPCC how it proposes to carry out its functions in these cases and how the relationship with the Crown Prosecution Service will operate, particularly in relation to early advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/9" class="indent">5. A wide-ranging training programme for all those who take decisions in death in custody cases has been commenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/10" class="indent">6. A new package of measures to increase the transparency of the decision-making process and to involve families more will be implemented. This will mean earlier meetings between the case lawyer and the family and better arrangements for keeping the family informed of progress and increasing their opportunity to have input during the decision making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/11" class="indent">7. More proactive case management systems: there is already a scheme to facilitate proactive case tracking and management to case plans agreed at the outset.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/12" class="indent">8. The Director of Public Prosecutions is taking a new enhanced role in overseeing all cases arising from a death in custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/13" class="indent">9. The casework directorate, supported by the equality and diversity unit of the CPS, will take steps to engage with different communities, not only through special interest and campaign groups, but through the legal community, the media and members of the public more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/14" class="indent">10. Statistical information will be compiled that will enable the CPS to demonstrate its performance, identify any patterns and identify any scope for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/15" class="indent">11. As best practice, reviewing lawyers in death in custody cases will continue to attend relevant parts of any inquest in the case to view crucial evidence being given.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/16" class="indent">12. The CPS will publish a booklet to explain to families where the Crown Prosecution Service fits into the process and what they can expect from the CPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/17">The overall objective of all the reforms is to put in place changes that will contribute to and support high-quality and fair decision-making, efficient decision-making and arrangements for communicating with families that will tend to promote confidence in the decisions taken and in the process itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/18">I am grateful to all those who contributed their time and expertise by responding to the consultation paper I issued last year, or attending the public seminar or by letting me know their views in other ways.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-07-16a.123.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="123"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030716/text/30716w02.htm#30716w02_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.123.5/1">We are pleased to inform the House that we have today published the key findings from the report of the independent review of the operation of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS). The review was established in March this year to consider the ways in which NASS operates and provide me with recommendations to improve its performance. We are grateful to the review team for the work they have undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/2">The review team found that NASS was established to undertake a much simpler role than the complex one which they now perform. That role is made even more complicated by being a very visible part of the asylum system. Despite that, the review team found that NASS was showing signs of improvement in its operational performance, strategic planning and relationships with partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/3">However, they also found that some key issues still need to be addressed. They found that NASS had faced real difficulties in getting on top of its job. External pressures such as Sangatte, an upsurge in asylum applications in 2001 and significant ongoing recruitment and training gaps contributed significantly to NASS's current problems and it had failed to establish a clear strategy to provide purpose, direction and governance of its activities. It had been established as a distinct part of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, (IND) something which had contributed to a lack of proper integration with other parts of the asylum process and unrealistic expectations surrounding issues such as social integration.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/4">The review team found that there were still considerable gaps in NASS's ability to deal effectively with its external partners such as local authorities or the voluntary sector. Partly, this was a lack of understanding of the roles of these other organisations, but also a simple lack of effective and agreed processes to ensure that issues ran smoothly. The review team also found weaknesses within some of NASS's core operations. IT was critical to the business but was neither fully exploited, nor properly integrated with the IT used elsewhere in IND. The review team said that specific improvements to processes or resolution of long-standing policy impasses were possible which would provide much-needed service improvements. The basic customer service provided to NASS's wide range of stakeholders needed to improve. Within this were concerns such as the difficulties with telephone contact with NASS. The review team supported NASS's regionalisation project and pointed to a need for many more aspects of NASS's business to be handled at a local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/5">Looking across the range of issues covered, the review team said that for NASS to perform at its best it needs to:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/6" class="indent">be clear what is expected of it and how its success will be judged;</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/7" class="indent">have the financial and managerial resources to do the job;</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/8" class="indent">have a thorough understanding of its own strengths and weaknesses;</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/9" class="indent">have a clear view of what it needs to do to improve its performance;</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/10" class="indent">understand its impact on the whole end-to-end asylum process;</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/11" class="indent">sort out some of its key business processes and procedures; and</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/12" class="indent">get better at working with the rest of IND in a fully joined-up operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/13">Since completion of the review, NASS's senior management team has been strengthened, as has the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's ability to deal more effectively with social integration issues. More widely, NASS and other IND staff are currently analysing the proposals contained in the report and will submit an action plan to us shortly. This action plan will form the basis of a major programme of work designed to improve NASS's performance. We shall make a further statement about the action taken in the light of the review in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase> we published the report of an appraisal of the care of recruits in initial training, carried out by an independent team. Today we are publishing the report of a follow-up appraisal carried out by the same team, which has continued to monitor progress, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/2">The overall assessment arrived at by the re-appraisal is that the initial training system is proving highly successful in continuing to deliver a large number of high-quality, motivated young people for service in the Armed Forces, most recently in the very demanding combat and environmental conditions of the Gulf. All three Services' training organisations, however, are still very tautly resourced, notably in the area of supervisory and instructional manpower, for their very high throughput of trainees. The most significant risks are carried in the larger Army training establishments. The team concludes that a good deal has been done, but that further progress will require additional investment of manpower and resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/3">Alongside the re-appraisal report, we are publishing a departmental progress report, which provides an overview of the action we have taken since February. A wide range of measures has been set in hand to improve processes and procedures, in line with the recommendations of the first appraisal report. These have included work to identify the resource implications of the recommendations. One of the most significant criticisms in February was of inadequate numbers of instructors, especially at some of the large Army training establishments. The Army has identified a requirement for additional instructors and support staff. One hundred and six of these vacancies were assessed as urgent. Most have been filled already and all will be filled by <phrase class="date" code="">11 August</phrase>. This is a significant achievement on the Army's part, at a time of major operational commitment overseas, and reflects the very high priority that the Army puts on the initial training and care of its soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/4">Inevitably, however, as the re-appraisal indicates, it takes time for all the policy changes that we are putting in place to be implemented, especially where extra resources or new infrastructure are required. As the re-appraisal notes, the increased numbers of instructors and supervisory staff are still building up. They and other improvements we are putting in place have the potential to significantly improve the training environment. But we are certainly not complacent and recognise that progress must be maintained and extended. In line with the latest recommendation of the team, we will carry out a further assessment of progress in summer 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">United Kingdom forces continue to make good progress in helping Iraq become a stable and united state.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/2">The vast majority of Iraqis welcomed the fall of the Saddam regime. The newly formed Governing Council has given Iraqis a representative voice after decades of oppression. The coalition will work with the Governing Council to rebuild Iraq. It will hand over to an elected government as soon as possible. The UK is playing a major role, and has seconded experts to work in the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad in a wide range of fields: political, financial, legal, security, health, education, roads, forensics, war crimes, prisons, culture and communications. We are also assisting in the training of a new Iraqi army and the Iraqi police.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/3">Since the collapse of the former regime and the announcement of the end of decisive combat operations on <phrase class="date" code="">1 May</phrase>, the coalition's main effort has been directed towards establishing a safe and secure Iraq. Security is an essential part of the political and economic rehabilitation of the country, and coalition stabilisation operations continue. Those who violently oppose the coalition represent a desperate minority. In the south, UK forces have developed close links with local communities, and have helped to improve the availability of water, food, power and medical supplies, which had previously been used as a means of control by Saddam Hussein. Iraqis are making the most of their new freedoms. However, the security environment remains difficult in places, particularly in Baghdad and the surrounding area. We are assisting our coalition allies in a number of ways, including sharing British expertise in urban operations, derived from many years' experience in Northern Ireland and the Balkans.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/4">The roulement of UK forces set out in my Written Answer to the noble Lord, Lord Lofthouse of Pontefract, of <phrase class="date" code="">11 June</phrase> (Official Report, cols 33-35 WA) continues. Today, about 11,000 UK servicemen and women drawn from all three Services remain in the Gulf region and Iraq. The deployment of 3 (UK) Division, 19 Mechanised Brigade and 101 Logistic Brigade is nearing completion. The Royal Navy is maintaining a presence of five vessels in the Gulf. The Joint Helicopter Force of 18 helicopters based at Basra continues to support forces on the ground. We are considering the scope for rear-basing two RAF Tornado GR4 in the UK, leaving six in theatre with a number of supporting aircraft, in line with the reduced requirement for sorties.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/5">UK forces are already working closely with military contingents from a number of countries, and further forces are due to deploy over the coming weeks. Headquarters 3 (UK) Division formally took over command of the Multinational Division (South East) (MND(SE)) on <phrase class="date" code="">12 July</phrase>. This division is now responsible for coalition forces in four provinces in Southern Iraq, namely Al Basra, Maysan, Dhi Qar and Al Muthanna. Nine countries have committed troops, and discussions continue with a number of others. When fully assembled, non-UK multinational contributions to MND(SE) should total some 5,500 military personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/6">In Al Basra province a Czech field Hospital and a company of military police, over 300 Czech personnel in all, will be attached to Headquarters MND(SE). The Czech Field Hospital has been doing valuable work in Iraq since May. 38 Engineer Regiment of 19 Mechanised Brigade will work alongside a 140-strong Norwegian company in the Al Basra and Maysan provinces. We also expect the deployment of around 40 New Zealand engineers with a small support staff for humanitarian and reconstruction tasks. Also in Maysan province, a Danish battlegroup of some 450 personnel including a 30-strong Lithuanian contingent has for some weeks been operating out of Al Qurnah. In Al Muthanna province, a 1,100-strong Dutch battlegroup, comprising a Marine battalion, engineer company, medical facility and a military police platoon, will be based in As Samawah. In addition, three Dutch Chinook helicopters will be deployed to Tallil. The Italian mechanised brigade in Dhi Qar province will be 2,800 strong, and will be supported by a Romanian mechanised battalion and military police company (520 personnel), and a 130-strong security force company of Portuguese National Guard in a policing role. These contributions to MND(SE) represent a powerful symbol of the international community's commitment to the future of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/7">The rotation of the UK divisional headquarters, the deployment of international contingents, and the inception of MND(SE) makes this an appropriate juncture to take stock of planned force levels. This process is continuing. If necessary, we will make further adjustments to our deployed forces. We remain committed to maintaining appropriate forces in Iraq for as long as necessary and no longer.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-24">24 July 2002</phrase> (WA 81&ndash;83) it was announced that the Ministry of Defence was discussing with the University of Manchester a detailed study of the factors underlying the figures for road traffic accident deaths. There are indications that the excess of motor vehicle accident deaths among Gulf veterans occurred principally during the first six years after the cessation of hostilities (to <phrase class="date" code="1997-03-31">31 March 1997</phrase>) and that this trend has reversed in the following six years to <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/3">Furthermore, the numbers of incidents are relatively small, the information on each accident is insufficiently detailed to allow meaningful analysis and a considerable amount of time has elapsed since <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-01">1 April 1991</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.132.3/1">Ministers have received a number of recent written representations from, and on behalf of, the National Association of Health Stores (NAHS) expressing NAHS's concerns over the impact of the Food Supplements Directive and the implementing regulations. In particular, NAHS voice particular concerns over the current composition of the lists of permitted substances in the annexes to the directive and asked that the United Kingdom seek an amendment to the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.3/2">Ministers have responded recognising those concerns and setting out the Government's view that there was no possibility of negotiations on the directive being reopened. Many member states wanted a much more restrictive regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.3/3">No aspect of the directive needs to be implemented by the industry until <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August 2005</phrase> and the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 make use of flexibility in the directive that means marketing of some products may not be affected until <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.3/4">Food supplements containing vitamins and minerals and their sources missing from the positive lists that were on the market when the directive came into force may continue to be marketed beyond <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August 2005</phrase> provided that dossiers to support their addition to the positive lists have been submitted to the European Commission before <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July 2005</phrase> and provided that the European Food Safety Authority has not given a negative opinion on such use.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.5/2" qnum="HL3484">What assessment they have made of the impact upon consumer choice and the United Kingdom food supplements industry of the possible setting by the European Union of maximum permitted levels for nutrients in food supplements at levels substantially lower than those which are currently permitted in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.0/1">The Government's firm position is that safety should be the primary concern, and that maximum limits should be set at levels that are based on scientific risk assessments and not limited by considerations of nutritional need, thus protecting public health without unnecessarily limiting consumer choice or unduly restricting trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/2">Article 5 of Directive 2002/46/EC on food supplements sets out principles for setting EU maximum limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements, although no specific figures have yet been set. Discussion on maximum limits at EU level will follow publication of advice from the European Food Safety Authority. We do not expect the European Commission to issue its proposal on maximum limits before the end of this year.</p>

The applicants Professor David Gordon (Manchester) and Dr Christopher Hall (Daresbury Laboratory) refer to this investment forming an institute for functional and molecular imaging (IFMI). Co-applicants include Professors Pat Price and Terry Jones, and also researchers from Liverpool and Salford. Total investment is &pound;5.7 million split equally between MRC and EPSRC.

	<p pid="a.137.0/1">As part of a programme to expand the range of services offered by NHS Direct, work has begun to develop and run an NHS Direct information service across all digital TV platforms in England. This service will complement the existing NHS Direct services accessed via the telephone, the Internet and at electronic information points. The development of the service by the Department of Health follows a series of successful pilot projects conducted during 2001&ndash;02, which explored possible health applications of digital interactive television. The NHS Direct digital TV service, which will be launched in 2004, will provide information on health conditions and treatments, healthy living, medicines, health advice for travellers, health and safety advice and details of local NHS services, including performance information.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.0/3">The current focus of our work on this project is to identify and select, through a competitive public procurement exercise, a commercial partner with whom the department will work to develop and run the NHS Direct information service. As part of this procurement exercise, potential partners are required to demonstrate how they would provide a service which meets our objectives of extending the reach of NHS Direct services, improving the speed and convenience for those accessing health information and information on the NHS and encouraging appropriate self-care. This procurement process is ongoing. We expect to be able to announce the award of a contract in October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.0/4">Following the selection of a commercial partner to develop and run the service, we will be consulting widely on the content of the service&mdash;with patient groups and their representatives, with the NHS and local authorities, with agencies such as the Food Standards Agency and the Health and Safety Executive and with groups and agencies with interests and experience in providing services to those with hearing and sight disabilities. We have already had discussions with, for example, the Deaf Broadcasting Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.6/2">The Forward Look is the Government's publication of government-funded SET and R&amp;D expenditure data compiled by the Office for National Statistics. Forward Look highlights the outcome of the latest spending review as well as historical trends in government expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/3">The theme for Forward Look 2003 is &quot;making a difference&quot;. Entries from departments, research councils, learned bodies and devolved administrations set out to explain, with examples of tangible outcomes, how SET is helping them deliver policy and public services in their priority areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/4">Forward Look 2003 also aims to illustrate how the economy and society can benefit from science and technology, as we explore new areas of science and look for ways of exploiting technology. It helps government in their efforts to engage the public in a meaningful way to learn about and express their views about the possible directions of science and its impacts on society. Forward Look 2003 will be of value to all of us interested in science, and government-funded research and science policy in particular. The accompanying tables provide an authoritative reference point to where government research spending has been going, what it is being used to achieve and where future spending is to be focused.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/5">Forward Look 2003 shows that there has been a further substantial increase in the overall science budget as a result of the 2002 Spending Review, with the research councils receiving new funding to increase the volume of top-quality research and to take forward specific new projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/6">Forward Look 2003 sets out in detail how the Government's significant investment in science is being spent. Funding for science, engineering and technology is increasing from &pound;8.46 billion in 2002&ndash;03 to &pound;8.61 billion in 2004&ndash;05 in real terms. In particular we are focusing on investing in our excellent science base because cutting edge science is at the heart of a successful economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.5/1">The Government recognise that special regard should be given to the unique status of the National Lottery and its contribution to good causes. Although this is a matter for the broadcasting regulators, we would envisage that it should be permissible for lottery programmes to inform the public about the National Lottery, National Lottery draws and the benefits to the public from the lottery. Ofcom will be consulting on the development of its codes and we should expect it to give the National Lottery Commission and other interested parties an opportunity to comment.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">Expenditure on export subsidies and the associated volumes of exports are notified by the EU to the World Trade Organisation. However, the information is not available by destination country and thus subsidised exports to the Republic of Moldova are not separately identified. The total value of EU exports of agricultural products to Moldova was 51 million euros in 1999, 59 million euros in 2000 and 60 million euros in 2001. Information on the price in Moldova is not readily available.</p>
