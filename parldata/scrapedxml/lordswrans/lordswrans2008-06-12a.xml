We continue to press the Iraqi Government to ensure adequate protection for all of Iraq's people, regardless of faith or political persuasion, and to take tough measures against those perpetuating the violence which is affecting all sectors of Iraqi society. Although we do not support the use of the death penalty, we are encouraged by the recent conviction of the killer of Archbishop Rahho of Mosul as an example of Iraqi commitment to tackling these problems.</p>
