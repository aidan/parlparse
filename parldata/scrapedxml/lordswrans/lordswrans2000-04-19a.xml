	<p pid="a.99.2/1">The World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported a steady increase in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the North Caucasus. Although no data are available on the TB incidence rate within Chechnya, WHO believes the increase there is likely to be particularly pronounced.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">WHO have reported that the increased incidence of TB in the North Caucasus is likely to have negative consequences for public health and place greater strain on the Russian TB health services.

	<p pid="a.99.5/1">At the end of 1999 84 per cent of CDC's total investment portfolio was in poorer countries and 51 per cent was in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. CDC plans its business strategy taking account of the requirements placed on it by its investment policy. These are entrenched by means of the special share. It is a requirement that over a rolling five year period 70 per cent of new investments should be in poorer countries. The aim of making at least 50 per cent of new Investment each year in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is a target, and success in meeting it may be affected by local factors outside CDC's control. It is the intention of CDC year on year to strive for compliance with it. CDC is taking steps to structure its deal generation capacity in such a way as will ensure an adequate deal flow from the countries targeted under the investment policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">A grant of &pound;20 million was agreed with the Government of Zimbabwe in 1981. This funded 42 resettlement projects for the benefit of refugees and landless people following the Independence war. British funds were used for land demarcation and fencing, provision of water and sanitation, construction of schools, clinics, and other buildings, also crop packs and training. The grant was largely disbursed by 1989; however it was eventually closed in 1996 with &pound;3 million unspent. Over a similar period, the counterpart funds to &pound;27 million in programme aid were used by the Government of Zimbabwe to fund its share of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/2">An ODA evaluation in 1988 found that the majority of families settled had benefited considerably through the provision of increased opportunities for income generation and the availability of services such as health and education. The programme had also been successful from the national economic perspective having an economic rate of return of approximately 21 per cent. The Zimbabwean Comptroller and Auditor General carried out a value for money study of the programme in 1993. Despite identifying a number of shortcomings, the study concluded that the exercise was well planned in accordance with clear policies and procedures. It had benefited mainly the landless rural poor, most of whose standard of living had significantly improved.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">I am pleased to announce that, following extensive consultation with the Government of Gibraltar and with their support, and with the encouragement of our EU partners, the United Kingdom has successfully concluded discussions with Spain to overcome difficulties which have arisen on a number of issues within the European Union concerning Gibraltar. As a result, arrangements have been established whereby formal communications and notification of decisions between Gibraltar authorities and their counterparts in other member states under EU legislation will be conveyed through a unit established in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. The arrangements will enable Gibraltar to derive immediate benefits in the development of its banking and insurance industries. They will unblock important measures for the development of the single market and in the Justice and Home Affairs field to the benefit of the UK and Gibraltar and prevent similar blockages in the future. The arrangements uphold the constitutional position of Gibraltar, while at the same time removing a major obstacle to the development of EU business. The arrangements are being notified to the Secretary General of the Council in Brussels together with an exchange of correspondence between the UK and Spanish Permanent Representatives to the EU. A copy of the exchange of correspondence and the arrangements will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">The identity card issued in Gibraltar will be recognised as a valid travel document throughout the EU, following some reformatting which is proposed by the Government of Gibraltar to associate the identity card with the UK as the member state responsible for Gibraltar. The UK Permanent Representative to the EU is writing to the Permanent Representatives of all other EU member states to inform them of the proposed reformatting. A copy of this letter will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/3">Arrangements will be established under the Schengen Convention to enhance co-operation between the Royal Gibraltar Police and the Spanish police forces in the fight against transfrontier and other crimes in the region, as part of the Europe-wide fight against crime called for at the Tampere Special European Council last October and in keeping with Gibraltar's longstanding commitment in this respect. These arrangements have been initialled. The intention is that they will be signed by the Home Secretary and his Spanish counterpart, as required by the Schengen Convention, when the Council Decision on the UK Schengen application is adopted. A copy of the initialled text will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/4">A revised version of the draft Council Decision on the UK's Schengen application, including the relevant addition covering Gibraltar which has hitherto been left open, will be circulated by the Presidency shortly. It will provide for Gibraltar's participation in all the provisions in which the UK participates (except the Schengen Information System and cross border surveillance). It will be submitted to the scrutiny committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/5">The Government welcome the outcome of these discussions. It represents a very good outcome for the UK, for Gibraltar and for all our EU partners. We hope that it will also help to improve the climate of dialogue and the spirit of co-operation with regard to Gibraltar between Spain, and the UK and Gibraltar.</p>

Translink have informed us that the average age of the Ulsterbus fleet at April 2000 was 11.3 years. The Department for Regional Development has recently approved the purchase of new buses with the &pound;1.7 million Bus Grant allocated for 2000-01 and 2001-02, subject to 50 per cent matching funding from the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Translink have advised that it is likely any bus purchase will be directed towards the Ulsterbus fleet.

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">The recruitment process to find the Commissioners will begin shortly and applicants will be asked to declare any political activity within the last ten years. It will be for the selection panel to determine whether that activity has been such as to make the applicant unsuitable for consideration for appointment. For the Commission to perform effectively the functions given to it by Parliament, it must command wide confidence that it is entirely independent and non-partisan. Accordingly, Commissioners must not be, or perceived to be, associated with any political party.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/2">We also think it is right that there should be statutory disqualifiers.

	<p pid="a.119.0/1">In reaching his decision on the proposals by Bristol local education authority to close Merrywood School, published on <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-05">5 July 1999</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State took account of the consultation on those proposals, and all other factors which appeared to him to be relevant, including the increased travelling for pupils. It was not relevant for him to consider documents related to previous proposals, such as the 1994 consultation document. The Social Exclusion Unit's role is a strategic one, and it does not extend to issues which are dealt with by a single government department. The unit therefore has no role in advising on individual proposals for school organisation changes, which are decided by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment in accordance with his statutory responsibilities. In reaching a decision the Secretary of State was satisfied as to the provision the local education authority were proposing to make for young people who are excluded or alienated from school, and commended the work of the Knowle West Community Steering Group in examining possibilities for the development of lifelong learning opportunities in the area.</p>
