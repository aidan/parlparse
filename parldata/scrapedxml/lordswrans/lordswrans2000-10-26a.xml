	<p pid="a.54.1/2" qnum="HL4393">Whether permitted hours of opening for licensed premises and registered members' clubs in England and Wales will be extended on 31 December.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-10-26a.54.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="54"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001026/text/01026w01.htm#01026w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.54.2/1">New Year's Eve is regarded as a special occasion and licensing justices and the magistrates' courts may, on receipt of application, grant special orders of exemption under the Licensing Act 1964, allowing licensed premises and registered members' clubs to remain open beyond the normal permitted hours. There is no limit on the extension which may be granted. This has been the practice on every New Year's Eve in the years before the millennium. All licensees and registered members' clubs wishing to apply for extensions should do so as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">This year <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-31">31 December</phrase> falls on a Sunday. Permitted hours for pubs, nightclubs, restaurants and registered members' clubs in England and Wales on a Sunday normally end at 10.30 p.m. The Magistrates' Association and the Justices' Clerks' Society have jointly issued guidance to the licensing justices and magistrates' courts suggesting that an extension to 12.30 a.m. on New Year's Day morning would normally be appropriate. Magistrates will be able to determine what is appropriate for their local area and may determine a later time. Where extensions are granted, this will help people to enjoy a festive New Year as they have done in the past under similar procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">Because of the unique nature of last year's millennium celebrations, permitted hours were extended nationally by amending the Licensing Act 1964 using a deregulation order, approved by Parliament, which came into force in July 1999. The Government had originally proposed applying this arrangement to all future New Year's Eves but limited it to Millennium Eve after concerns expressed by the House of Lords Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee. The millennium arrangements worked well; and the Government wanted to make a further deregulation order for this New Year's Eve to provide a more typical test of the national extension. But in March the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee said in its ninth report (1999-2000 Parliamentary Session, <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-15">15 March 2000</phrase>) that it would be highly unlikely to support any further licensing deregulation ahead of general licensing reform. To bring an appropriate deregulation order into force before next New Year's Eve, under the timescales dictated by the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 for mandatory public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, would have required the Government to initiate the process by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">In July the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee agreed to give consideration to a further proposal in respect of New Year's Eve. By then it was too late, consistent with the requirements of the 1994 Act, to bring forward a similar order which could come into effect for this New Year's Eve. As my right honourable friend the Home Secretary made clear in reply to a question in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-20">20 July 2000</phrase> (Official Report, House of Commons, col. 329W), the timescales for statutory public consultation and the subsequent parliamentary process were dictated by the 1994 Act and it was now unlikely that the process could be completed in time for next New Year. We examined whether, with the co-operation of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee and colleagues in both Houses, it was possible to obtain an order in a shorter time than that initially envisaged. We concluded that if we had done so it would have been open to legal challenge with an uncertain outcome. We have therefore decided against taking that course. We intend, however, to prepare such an order to apply to New Year's Eve next year, which will then provide a further test of the success of a standard national exemption.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/5">We remain wholly committed to the general reform of licensing law as described in the White Paper Time for Reform, published in April this year, which would include provision for the Secretary of State to set appropriate opening times nationally for licensed premises for any special national celebrations.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.8/1">The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-14">14 June</phrase>, provides a framework for the completion of the modernisation of financial services regulation announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in May 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.8/2">Parliament will be asked to approve secondary legislation under the Act. The Treasury has today issued two consultation documents: on the scope of FSA regulation and on the framework for the promotion of financial services. In the document on scope there are draft Orders on regulated activities; when regulated activities are and are not being carried on by way of business; persons who will be exempt from the requirement for FSA authorisation; the exemption of appointed representatives of an authorised person; and activities which will not be exempt regulated activities under Part XX of the Act. In the document on the framework for promotion of financial services there are draft orders on financial promotion and on the promotion of collective investment schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.8/3">The Government have previously announced a number of areas which they propose should be subject to FSA regulation in order to strike a better balance between the interests of providers and consumers of financial services. The principal change is the regulation of mortgage lending, on which the Treasury has today issued a further consultation document. Other areas which the Government propose be brought into the scope of FSA regulation are pre-paid funeral plans, deposit taking by credit unions and Lloyd's insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.8/4">Copies of all three consultation documents have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Further copies are available from the Treasury and can also be accessed via the Treasury's website (<a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk">www.hm-treasury.gov.uk</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.58.3/1">In our public consultation paper Rate Relief for Horse Enterprises on Farms (August 2000) we proposed that small, newly established horse-related enterprises on working farms, including riding schools, should receive rate relief. The consultation paper suggested that such enterprises with rateable values below &pound;6,000 should receive mandatory rate relief of 50 per cent, with the local authority having the discretion to increase the relief to up to 100 per cent of the rates bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/2">Other than attracting rate relief these farm-based enterprises would be treated no differently from other horse-related enterprises. The implementation of the rate relief scheme would require primary legislation. We are currently considering the responses to the consultation paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.6/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions has today commenced the duties on local authorities under Part II of the Local Government Act 2000 to consult on and draw up proposals for new constitutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.6/2">My right honourable friend has also published guidance on new council constitutions for English local authorities and associated statutory directions, together with guidelines on the consultation process. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.6/3">My right honourable friend has also today laid before the House copies of the following regulations: Local Authorities (Functions and Responsibilities) (England) Regulations 2000; Local Authorities (Arrangements for the Discharge of Functions) (England) Regulations 2000; Local Authorities (Referendums) (Petitions and Directions) (England) Regulations 2000; and Local Authorities (Proposals for Alternative Arrangements) (England) Regulations 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.6/4">This is an exciting time of change for councils as they start to consult local communities on their new constitutions, which will lead to greater efficiency, transparency and accountability. In many areas councils have already begun consulting local people and experimenting with a form of new arrangements. The guidance will help councils build on what has already been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.6/5">The Government expect the consultation to be meaningful and wide-ranging and to engage local people in discussions about the full range of options for change, including the chance to vote for a directly elected mayor if they want one. That is why today my right honourable friend is also publishing guidelines on consultation which offer practical help to councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.6/6">The framework is now in place for councils to begin the formal process of consulting local people and drawing up proposals for their new constitution. It is now for councils to ask their communities how they want to be governed. Where people want a directly elected mayor they will be able to have one.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-21">21 February</phrase> this year my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport announced the Government's conclusions on the recommendations of the independent review panel on the future funding of the BBC. In addition to a range of measures designed to improve BBC efficiency and accountability, the Government introduced a new funding formula which provides for changes in the licence fee of RPI plus 1.5 per cent for each year from 2000-01 to 2006-07. This formula will enable the BBC to provide a strong and distinctive schedule of benchmark quality programmes and remain at the forefront of the development of digital broadcasting services.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">Application of the RPI figure of 3.3 per cent for the year to September 2000, plus 1.5 per cent, to the current unrounded licence fees produces new rounded totals of &pound;109 for a colour licence and &pound;36.50 for a black and white licence. The new licence fees will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>. The necessary regulations to bring these fees into force will be laid before the House in due course.</p>
