	<p pid="a.12.3/1">We remain concerned about the plight of Dr Oscar Elias Biscet and other political prisoners in Cuba. We are particularly worried about political prisoners such as Dr Biscet who are reported to be suffering poor health yet are not provided with adequate medical treatment. The UK considers Dr Biscet's imprisonment to be a violation of his civil and political freedoms. At the time of Dr Biscet's detention, the UK and EU condemned these violations and called for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Cuba.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/2">The UK, along with our EU partners, is committed to seeking improvements in civil and political freedoms in Cuba. We regularly raise the situation of political prisoners in Cuba with the Cuban authorities both in London and Havana and call for their immediate release. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-30">30 April</phrase> my right honourable friend the then Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, expressed concern about political prisoners and other human rights issues during a meeting with Cuban Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade, Antonio Carricarte.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.5/2">We continue to support the commitment of EU Foreign Ministers in April 2004 to end Turkish Cypriot isolation and facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community. The Financial Aid Regulation is an important step towards this goal and represents the biggest EU aid programme per capita. The practical projects it funds have the potential to make a real difference to the lives of ordinary Turkish Cypriots.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.0/2">Mortality statistics are a key indicator of health in a population, as recognised by the World Health Organisation. The continued monitoring of Gulf veterans' mortality, as detailed in my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-16">16 July 2007</phrase> in the <I>Official Report</I> (<I>WS 4</I>), therefore provides a level of ongoing health monitoring. The latest statistics and the methods that are used to complete them are available on the internet at <a href="http://www.dasa.mod.uk/natstats/gulf/intro.html">www.dasa.mod.uk/natstats/gulf/intro.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/3">The MoD does not have access to medical or other health records of Gulf veterans who have left the Armed Forces. Routine monitoring of the health of these veterans is therefore not possible. The only illness for which central records are kept is cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/4">Nevertheless, the MoD remains committed to investigating Gulf War veterans' illnesses openly and honestly. Cancer registration data for the UK Gulf veterans and the Era comparison group are held by the Defence Analytical Services Agency. In 2003, the data were forwarded to Professor Gary Macfarlane, then of the University of Manchester, for analysis and publication in the peer-reviewed medical literature (Macfarlane et al (2003), &quot;Incidence of Cancer among UK Gulf Veterans: Cohort study&quot;, <I>British Medical Journal</I> 327, December 1373-76).</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/5">The medical assessment programme, based at St Thomas's Hospital in London, also continues to investigate the health concerns of those who served in the Gulf, or who believe that their health has suffered as a direct result of the Gulf conflict. The overall findings of these investigations are detailed in a number of publications but did not reveal any medically unexplained conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/6">A follow-up to the Gulf health research first published by Professor Simon Wessely of King's College, London, in January 1999 was sponsored by the MoD and published in the <I>British Medical Journal</I> in December 2003. The study found that, at follow up, Gulf veterans continued to report poorer health than other military personnel, but the overall health gap had narrowed slightly.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The European Commission food security committee met in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-05">5 September</phrase>. The UK delegate asked a specific written question on whether water and sanitation assistance could be provided under the food security budget line. The Commission's answer was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The projects to be financed under the proposed 2007 Annual Action Plan for North Korea would be selected via one or two call(s) for proposals. So these projects will be selected on the quality of the proposals submitted in response to these calls. Therefore, it is not possible to specify in advance what proportion of the programme might be spent on water and sanitation. The currently drafted guidelines for the planned call(s) for proposals 2007 foresee the possibility for integrated Food Security projects to include water and sanitation components; such as the rehabilitation of rural water schemes and ecological sanitation facilities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/3">While health was not specifically mentioned in the Commission's response, it is clear that assistance to water and sanitation will have an impact in terms of better health and hygiene outcomes. We will look at this aspect as Commission proposals are developed.</p>
