The UK has allocated up to $590,000 this financial year to help implement the Afghan Social Outreach Programme (ASOP) in Helmand.

	<p pid="a.206.0/1">The National Health Service Constitution published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-21">21 January 2009</phrase> includes seven principles that will guide the NHS. The third principle refers to the NHS commitment to innovation and to the promotion and conduct of research to improve the current and future health and care of the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/2">The NHS Constitution also commits the NHS to two pledges relating to informed choice. In the explanation for these pledges, the accompanying handbook makes the following statement about research.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/3">Research is a core part of the NHS. Research enables the NHS to improve the current and future health of the people it serves. The NHS will do all it can to ensure that patients, from every part of England, are made aware of research that is of particular relevance to them. The NHS is therefore putting in place procedures to ensure that. patients are notified of opportunities to join in relevant ethically approved research and will be free to choose whether they wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/4">The procedures under development will not allow the NHS to disclose a person's confidential records to researchers without consent and are intended to inform patients about research so that they can choose whether to take part. The procedures will ensure that, when the NHS supports preparations to notify patients of opportunities to join in relevant ethically approved research, staff who use care records to select those patients are bound by a duty of confidentiality and use confidential information no more than necessary for the purpose. Special permission under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006 is required before health service bodies may disclose a person's confidential records without consent to researchers not engaged in that person's care.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.3/2">The agency has also produced a series of design guides in the &quot;Design for Patient Safety&quot; series, which aim to improve the labelling and packaging of pharmaceutical products. These have been issued to pharmaceutical companies to assist them in producing products that minimise the risk of mis-selection and other patient safety incidents. These materials are also used by National Health Service medicines procurement groups to purchase products which are safer in use. A design guide on &quot;The Dispensing Environment&quot; which identifies ways that good design of the dispensing environment can help improve the accuracy of the dispensing process has also been produced by the NPSA.</p>

The MHRA has, as part of an EU-wide action, agreed to send a &quot;dear doctor/healthcare practitioner&quot; letter to the relevant NHS staff, and made proposals for changes to the packaging for Advagraf to emphasise that it differs from Prograf. In addition, MHRA included the issue in its December edition of the Drug Safety Update, with a further article in the January 2009 edition. These should help to make prescribers, pharmacists and patients aware of the brand being prescribed, whatever the manufacturer, and the associated dose regimen. MHRA has also highlighted the issue to other information providers, including the British National Formulary and the National Prescribing Centre.</p>
