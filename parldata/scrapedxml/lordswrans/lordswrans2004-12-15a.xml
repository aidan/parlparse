	<p pid="a.83.5/1">There has been a significant number of studies on this subject over the years and it would not be practicable to list every piece of research or every commissioning body. However, there have been two recent, comprehensive and authoritative analyses of these issues which have been published by public bodies in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/2">The report, <i>Community Differentials and New TSN</i> was funded by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and published in 2003. This study considered differentials between Protestants and Roman Catholics over a range of social policy areas including health, education, housing and the labour market. The author concluded that socio-economic differentials between the two main religious communities in Northern Ireland have decreased; however, labour market gaps still remain, with unemployment among Catholics higher than that for Protestants. The author's conclusion is that the ratio of unemployment rates will continue on a downward trend, albeit at a slow pace.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/3">The book <i>Fair Employment in Northern Ireland: a generation on</i> was funded by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and published in 2004. In concluding, the editors argue that the future use of the unemployment differential as a labour market indicator can be challenged in two ways. Firstly, the absolute falls in unemployment to the current low position have directed attention to other indicators. Secondly, that increasing questions about the meaning of headline unemployment data cast doubt on the present and future use of the unemployment differential.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/4">Copies of both reports are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/5">There is ongoing research in this area commissioned by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister which is due to report in early 2005 with publication to follow.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.5/1">As stated in my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-07">7 July</phrase> (<i>WA 81</i>) an exemption from the Employment Directive: Council Directive 2000/78/EC was obtained only in relation to the recruitment of teachers in schools in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.5/2">European Equal Treatment Directive 2000/78/EC as initially proposed would have meant that the exemption in the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 would have had to be removed without having regard to the issues and sensitivities of the local community in relation to the education of their children and the complexion of their schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.5/3">Following negotiations with the European Commission it was agreed that in order to maintain a balance of opportunity in employment for teachers in Northern Ireland while furthering the reconciliation of historical differences between the major religious communities, the provisions on religion or belief in the directive should not apply to the recruitment of teachers in schools in Northern Ireland in so far as is expressly authorised by national legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.5/4">This change was introduced by the Fair Employment and Treatment Order (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 which came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-10">10 December 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">The underspend in 2003&ndash;04 mainly reflected slippages in both the capital investment programme and executive programme fund projects. These slippages have been honoured in 2004&ndash;05 to continue or complete the relevant projects or schemes and the money allocated for them has been fully used.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/2">A determined programme of action is in place to reduce hospital waiting lists and waiting times across Northern Ireland. This has resulted in 95 per cent of patients receiving their treatment within 12 months and almost 75 per cent within three months. Moreover, in-patient and day-case waiting lists have fallen by 10,000 over the past two years. A regional steering group has been established to oversee a significant regional programme of work to further reduce waiting times. Targets have been set to ensure that by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, other than in exceptional circumstances, no patient is waiting for in-patient or day-case treatment for more than 18 months, and by March 2006, no longer than 15 months. An additional &pound;8.5 million was allocated in 2004&ndash;05 to support this work.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.5/1">All organisations responsible for public records carry out the disposal of records not identified as worthy of permanent preservation according to agreed disposal schedules. The mechanism covering disposals of public records is set out in Section 3 of the Public Records Act 1958, which places a duty upon every person responsible for such records to make arrangements for their safe-keeping and for the selection of any records which ought to be permanently preserved.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/2">Departmental action to select records worthy of permanent preservation, and to destroy those not selected, is carried out under the guidance, co-ordination and supervision of the Keeper of Public Records and trained National Archives staff. The National Archives (TNA) has developed a raft of policies and guidance in the area of records management and selection. Precise criteria for the disposal of public records vary from department to department, in accordance with their business needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/3">Further information can be obtained from the National Archives website at: <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/recordsmanagement">www.nationalarchives. gov.uk/recordsmanagement</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/4">The Freedom of Information Act has undoubtedly brought a renewed focus on good records management, and paragraph 9 of the Lord Chancellor's code of practice on records management (issued under Section 46 of the Act) recognises that the managed destruction of records is a proper and necessary part of efficient record keeping.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/1">The SaBRE campaign is a Ministry of Defence funded national marketing campaign which was launched in 2002. It aims to win and maintain the support of employers for the volunteer reserves and its goal is to ensure that 80 per cent of reservists in employment work for supportive employers. SaBRE's principal aim is, therefore, to gain the support of employers who are unsupportive, or whose support is unknown. It also works to ensure that supportive employers remain so.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">Accommodation is generally available for parents attending their sick children in hospital. This ranges from separate overnight facilities to folding beds by the child's bed and use of a sitting room, kitchen and washing facilities. The nature of the accommodation usually reflects the child's needs and length of stay. The <i>National Service Framework for Children: Standard for Hospital Services</i> issued in April 2003 states that facilities should cater for parents and siblings with suitable provision for overnight stays and access to meals and relaxation. No charge should be made for accommodation. A number of papers note the beneficial effects of parental access to their children whilst in hospital and subsequently in managing the transition from hospital to home, safely and without delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.3/1">In setting up the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) recognised that for it to be a credible organisation with the professions, CABE needed to include active representatives from a number of relevant fields. Therefore commissioners and their advisers have professional connections with the architectural and property development industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/2">The Cabinet Office's <i>Guidance on Codes of Practice for Board Members of Public Bodies</i> (October 2004) states that board members of non-departmental public bodies should declare any personal or business interests which may conflict with their responsibilities as a board member. Interests should be declared in a register of interests, which should be open to the public. In addition, members of public bodies should not participate in the discussion of matters in which they have a pecuniary interest. Where there may be a perceived conflict of interest, members should not participate in the discussion and should withdraw from the meeting. CABE has its own &quot;operational framework&quot; which incorporates this guidance, and has developed a guidance note on &quot;Managing Conflicts of Interest&quot;. CABE has a register of commissioners' interests available to the public on request.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/3">Following concerns about conflict of interest issues at CABE, an independent report was published in June 2004 which examined how conflicts of interest were managed (<i>Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment&mdash;Audit of Conflicts of Interest</i>, June 2004, HC 678). The report concluded: &quot;CABE has taken reasonable steps to ensure it is operating in accordance with the principles defined by the Nolan Committee. As one of the steps, the Accounting Officer has been proactive in monitoring the higher risk of potential conflicts of interest&quot;. To protect public perception of CABE's impartiality, the report made recommendations to strengthen the procedures. The department accepted all the report's recommendations and most of them (23 out of 28) have been implemented. The remainder should be completed by the end of March 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.3/1">Policies relating to the prevention of suicides on the railways are kept under constant review. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the independent railway health and safety regulator, continues to take a proactive approach to ensuring that unauthorised access to the railway infrastructure is minimised. However, it is virtually impossible to prevent a determined individual from gaining access to the railway.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.3/2">The rail industry's Rail Fatality Management Group works with other agencies, including mental health organisations, to deal with the problem of suicides on the railways. The group is working to develop guidelines for preventing suicides and handling their aftermath.</p>

The new maximum fines have been brought in by the first commencement order under the 2004 Act for offences occurring on or after <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-04">4 October 2004</phrase>. It is too early to say what effect this will have on the level of prosecutions by street authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.9/2">The 2004 Act also introduced a system of fixed penalty notices for breaches of seven offences under the 1991 Act. This is intended to provide street authorities with an alternative system of pursuing offences without recourse to the magistrates' courts. The aim will be to set a fixed penalty level which will act as a deterrent to possible offenders, yet will be low enough to make payment attractive so as to avoid involving the courts. The Department for Transport plans to consult shortly on the proposals for fixed penalty notices, including the level of penalty.</p>
