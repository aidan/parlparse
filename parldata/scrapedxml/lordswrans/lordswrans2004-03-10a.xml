	<p pid="a.173.5/1">The decision to offer no evidence against Katharine Gun was made by the Crown Prosecution Service as an independent prosecuting authority. It was a decision taken solely on legal grounds and in accordance with the code for Crown Prosecutors. There was, in this case, a clear prima facie breach of Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989. However, Senior Treasury Counsel prosecuting this case gave advice, with which the Director of Public Prosecutions fully concurred, that there was no longer a realistic prospect of convicting Katharine Gun. The evidential deficiency related to the prosecution's inability, within the current statutory framework, to disprove the defence of necessity to be raised on the particular facts of this case.</p>

We do not think a universal ban on smoking in all public places is justified while we can make fast and substantial progress in partnership with industry. Over the years we have seen real increases in smoke-free workplaces. In 1996, 40 per cent of people reported their workplace as being completely smoke-free. The latest figures for 2002 show this has risen to 50 per cent, with an overall figure of 86 per cent of all workplaces having banned smoking completely or limited it to smoking rooms.

	<p pid="a.177.5/1">In this speech on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-04">4 February</phrase>, the executive director of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) referred to the fact that the European Parliament and member states, as well as the European Commission, may request EFSA to issue a scientific opinion on matters falling within its mission. In doing so he was referring to the provision set out in Article 29(1) of Regulation 178/2002/EC.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.5/2">The Government do not intend to seek a review of the nutrient sources used in products on the United Kingdom market but not included in the list of permitted ingredients set out in the Food Supplements Directive. Substances already on the lists in the annexes have been assessed for safety by the former Scientific Committee on Food. Transitional procedures for amending the lists are set out in Article 4(6) of the directive. General procedures for adding substances to the lists are set out in recitals 10 and 12 and in Article 4(5) of the directive. Additional substances may be put on the lists following assessment of dossiers of information supporting their safety by EFSA. We understand that the food supplements industry is already preparing a number of such dossiers.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">Agenda for Change has been developed in partnership with National Health Service staff organisations to deliver to NHS staff a fair and flexible employment framework that supports career development and offers greater rewards for those who take on extended roles. The new system includes flexibility for NHS employers to apply recruitment and retention premia where necessary on top of basic pay. We do not expect the new system to have any adverse impact on delivering either the national service framework for older people or services in rural areas. Our information suggests that there will be 100 per cent compliance with the national service framework for older people 2004 milestone.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.5/1">The Medical Research Council announced funding in May 2003 for two trials which will look at the effectiveness of various treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The first trial is known as PACE (Pacing, Activity and Cognitive behaviour therapy: a randomised Evaluation). PACE will be led by Dr Peter White at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, Dr Michael Sharpe of the University of Edinburgh and Dr Trudie Chalder of King's College London.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/2">The second trial, known as FINE (Fatigue Intervention by Nurses Evaluation) will test two different treatments that are particularly suited to those who are too ill to attend a specialist clinic. FINE will be headed by Dr Alison Wearden at the University of Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/3">Once an application for funding has been approved, preparations need to take place. These include discussions of practical arrangements with the trial centres, recruitment and training of the staff needed to run trials, and obtaining final approval of the trial protocol by ethics committees. The current estimated start of recruitment of patients into both trials is the summer or autumn of 2004. They are expected to take up to five years to complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/4">Entry criteria were originally proposed in the applications for funding. Final confirmation of the criteria by the multicentre research ethics committee is expected by May 2004. Unconfirmed criteria for both trials are that participants will: meet the Oxford diagnostic criteria for CFS; score four or more on the eleven-item Chalder fatigue scale; score less than 75 per cent on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) physical functioning scale. Both trials will also collect and compare data relating to other internationally accepted diagnostic criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.5/5">All participants will provide informed consent, will be of either gender, and will be aged at least 18 years old. For PACE, participants will be attending one of six specialist CFS services in the United Kingdom. Participants in FINE will be in primary care and the trial is expected to involve severely affected patients, including those who are bed or house-bound and who may not be able to take part in other treatments that require hospital or clinic attendance.</p>
