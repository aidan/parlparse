	<p pid="a.75.11/2">The Government also provide the in-work credit to eligible lone parents, and couple parents in London, who have been on benefits for at least a year, during their first year in work. This further improves incentives to work.</p>

Since 1997, the Government have reduced by 540,000 the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of over 70 per cent, so more households can keep more of their income as they progress in work.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.6/1">I would like to clarify my Answer about the proposed National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL). NNL is being set up with the intention of protecting the skills of Nexia Solutions, in particular with respect to decommissioning skills. Its major clients will be the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and the site licence companies, including at Sellafield. BERR will finalise the business case for the NNL when it is clearer about the revenue stream from the Sellafield site licence company, whose research programme will have a significant impact on NNL's immediate revenue. The process for the contracting of the site licence for Sellafield is current. In the mean time, Nexia Solutions has been able to carry on providing its vital services to industry and the NDA without interruption. We anticipate the setting up of NNL as soon as the business case is agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.3/1">As part of ongoing work to tackle illegal imports of products of animal origin (POAO), Defra and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have always worked in co-operation with stakeholders, major airlines and airport authorities. They have been made fully aware that meat, food and plants can carry animal/plant pests and diseases, which can pose a risk to our environment and our agricultural and horticultural industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/2">As part of our joint strategy for raising travellers' awareness of the rules on personal imports of POAO, high visibility posters in line with the European Union (EU) model prescribed in Commission Regulation 745/2004 are displayed at ports and airports. These advise incoming passengers that meat and dairy products from non-EU countries are prohibited and have recently been refreshed and updated. Appropriate sites, including in baggage reclaim areas, are agreed with BAA and the other airport and port operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/3">HMRC has local representatives who are in contact with BAA and other airport and port operators to discuss and negotiate various issues, including where posters are sited. For example, during 2005-06, in response to avian influenza outbreaks in a number of countries, HMRC arranged with BAA and other operators for additional temporary &quot;bird flu&quot; posters to be displayed at UK ports and airports. These were placed in passenger terminals at arrivals and departures and highlighted the risk of bringing illegal meat and meat products into the UK. BAA and other operators also provide facilities for the storage and removal of any seized POAO items.</p>

During 2006 and 2007 some of these meetings covered the 15th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA 15). We also held additional meetings with non-governmental groups throughout 2007 specifically to discuss the UK's approach to the IDA negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.6/2">There was a half-day session between the World Bank, IDA donors and African civil society opinion-formers as part of the second IDA 15 replenishment meeting in Maputo in June 2007. In October the World Bank organised a workshop for UK civil society to consult on its progress report on conditionality. Also in October, the lead negotiators from the UK and other donors met with civil society groups in Washington to discuss the replenishment in the margins of the third replenishment meeting. The draft outcome document of the negotiations was placed on the World Bank's website for public comment. The comments were discussed at the final replenishment meeting in Berlin in December and some were incorporated into the final version.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.5/1">I understand that Royal Mail does intend to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns by issuing a special stamp and miniature sheet in January 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/2">There are currently no plans for issuing in 2009 a Bank of England bank note including Robert Burns as an historical character. The Bank of England regularly receives representations to include historical figures on the back of its new bank notes. The Governor of the Bank of England makes the final decision on the historical figure to be represented on the back of their new bank notes.</p>
