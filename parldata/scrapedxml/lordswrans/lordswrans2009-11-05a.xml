	<p pid="a.85.5/1">Authorised treatment facilities are required to carry out certain depollution activities on all end-of-life vehicles, including removal of the battery, tyres and fluids, and the removal or deployment of any airbags present. A certificate of destruction must also be issued to the last holder or keeper, and the vehicle may not be returned to the road. Authorised treatment facilities may then dismantle certain parts for resale or for recycling, before sending the depolluted vehicle on to metal fragmentisers, for processing into secondary raw materials.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.2/1">A minimum of 85 per cent of the weight of end-of-life vehicles, including those arising under the Government's scrappage scheme, must be reused, recycled or recovered by vehicle manufacturers or authorised treatment facilities, as required by the End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulation 2005. A maximum of 15 per cent may be sent for final disposal. On average, around 75 per cent of the weight of ELVs is reprocessed into secondary ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and reuse, recycling and energy recovery of non-metallic materials, such as oils, tyres, glass and plastic, in varying degrees, also take place.</p>
