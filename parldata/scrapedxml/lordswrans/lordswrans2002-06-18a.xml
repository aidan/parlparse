	<p pid="a.69.2/1">The criteria for setting the Government's objectives for policing under Section 37 of the Police Act 1996 are that they should focus police authorities' resources on those areas of policing which the Home Secretary considers to be a priority for the forthcoming year. This year's objectives are:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2" class="indent">To help create safe communities by reducing crime, anti-social behaviour and disorder through effective partnership working, including reducing the availability of Class A drugs;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3" class="indent">To reduce the fear of crime in all sections of the community and in particular to increase the trust and confidence in policing among minority ethnic communities;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/4" class="indent">To increase the number of offences for which offenders, and particularly persistent offenders, are caught and brought to justice, in partnership with other criminal justice agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/5">The objectives are set at a strategic level and do not lend themselves to specific cost analysis. It is for each police authority to decide how best to manage its resources to meet the objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/6">To date, no performance targets for police authorites have been set under Section 38 of the Police Act 1996. However, targets have been set for reductions in domestic burglary, vehicle crime and, in five major cities, robbery under Section 5 of the Local Government Act 1999.</p>

The Government are committed to introducing a specific offence of trafficking in prostitution in the current Nationality Immigration and Asylum Bill. Confiscation figures in England and Wales for all offences other than drug trafficking, as set out below, illustrate the current use of confiscation powers.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.0/18" class="indent">Amounts remitted &pound;8.1 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/19">The Government have initiated a programme of work to strengthen the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in depriving criminals of their benefit from crime with a view to doubling the amounts recovered from drug traffickers and other serious criminals. The components of the programme are new powers under the Proceeds of Crime Bill, currently going through Parliament, the planned creation under the Bill of an assets recovery agency, the asset recovery strategy which the Government agreed with law enforcement, prosecution and other agencies last autumn; and a grant scheme to help police forces appoint additional financial investigators. The Government have also established the Recovered Assets Fund under which up to half of receipts from recovered criminal assets are available to be recycled into projects under five headings, including the asset recovery strategy.ralph</p>

	<p pid="a.71.0/1">As we set out in the White Paper, Secure Boarders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain, the Home Office is considering what kind of support and advice can be provided to the victims of trafficking and also how we might improve the way in which victims are identified and dealt with by the police and Immigration Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">The Government are working with the voluntary sector on the provision of services to victims of trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation and to identify the cost implications of such services. The Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are running a number of prevention projects aimed primarily at raising awareness and educating potential victims (mostly women and children) in the dangers of being trafficked: &pound;3 millon has been given for the International Labour Organisation's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) programme in the Greater Mekong region (parts of Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam). This involves a number of interlinked interventions to raise awareness and prevent trafficking and to withdraw women and children from exploitation and reintegrate them back into their own or new communities.</p>

The vast majority of new asylum seekers who are destitute are supported directly by NASS. The only exception would be where a newly arrived asylum seeker sought to join the household of a pre-existing asylum seeker who was in receipt of support under the interim scheme by either a local authority or of benefits from the Benefits Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/2">Some asylum seekers remain supported by local authorities under the interim scheme.

We will be consulting again on a specific set of proposals in the light of responses and legal advice. Differences of treatment on the grounds of age are capable of objective justification under the directive in certain circumstances.

	<p pid="a.78.8/1">Before a GM crop can be grown commercially decisions are needed under several different regulatory controls. This includes legislation on the approval of pesticides (if the GM crop is a herbicide-tolerant variety), on the approval of new agricultural plant varieties (the national list), the EU Novel Foods Regulations and the EU directive on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms. Prior to the possible commercialisation of GM crops, the government are also considering the terms on which they might co-exist with non-GM production.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.11/1">The Government strongly support composting as a way of getting value from biodegradable waste by improving soil quality and replacing non-renewable products such as peat. We are actively encouraging the composting of green waste&mdash;at home, at municipal civic amenity sites and when separately collected by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.11/2">The Government's Waste Strategy 2000 set a national target of recycling or composting 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005. To ensure that all local authorities contribute towards meeting this target we have set individual statutory performance standards for recycling and composting for all authoritites in England. Authorities are being asked, on average, to double recycling by 2003&ndash;04 and triple it by 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.11/3">We have provided additional financial support to local authorities for waste management. The Spending Review 2000 announced the framework for the Government's support to local authorities up to 2003&ndash;04. This included an annual increase in the revenue support to local authorities for environmental protection and cultural services (EPCS), which includes waste management services. By 2003&ndash;04 this support will have risen by &pound;1.1 billion over the 2000&ndash;01 provision. Consistent with the general local authority financial framework, it is for individual local authorities to decide the proportion of their budget that should be directed to waste management work</p>
	<p pid="a.78.11/4">The spending review 2000 also provided a &pound;140 million household waste minimisation and recycling fund for local authorities to help them fund recycling and composting initiatives and meet their statutory performance standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.1/2" qnum="HL4589">For how long the main A2 road from central London to the Channel Tunnel and the Channel ports has been blocked; how much time is expected to elapse before it is re-opened; what discussion they have had with the local authorities to whom responsibility for maintenance of the road has been delegated; and whether they will resume responsibility for major trunk roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">The section of the A2 inside London is the responsibility of the Mayor and Transport for London (TfL). The road is closed at Blackheath because of a large hole on the carriageway. TfL Street Management has been working closely with Greenwich and Lewisham councils to ensure that the road reopens to the public as soon as possible. Further information can be obtained from:</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/8">On the A2 outside London there are periodic closures for demolition works in connection with the widening scheme between the A2 at Cobham and Junction 4 on the M2. Clear diversion routes are in place on these occasions to minimise disruption and delays to travellers.</p>
