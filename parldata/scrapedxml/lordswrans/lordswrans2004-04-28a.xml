	<p pid="a.87.1/2" qnum="HL1992">Whether, following the distribution of local authority circular LAC(2004)5&mdash;Review of Children's Cases, they will ensure that medical and social workers working with children are aware of issues arising over the medical evidence for Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, also known as fabricated or induced illness in children, by issuing supplementary guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">The Government's guidance, Safeguarding Children in Whom Illness is Fabricated or Induced (2002), sets out the processes to be followed when there are concerns a child may be or is having illness fabricated or induced. In addition, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health issued a report on Fabricated or Induced Illness by Carers (2001). It describes the role of paediatricians and child health services and how they should work with other agencies on this issue. We have no plans to introduce additional guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.5/1">As stated in Every Child Matters: Next Steps, the Government are committed to embedding the five outcomes identified by children into their programme for change to improve the well-being of children and young people. This includes the recognition that, in each local area, young people need &quot;opportunities for personal development, learning and recreation outside school hours, including access to sport, art and cultural activities&quot;. The five identified outcomes for children are: being healthy; staying safe; enjoying and achieving; making a positive contribution, and economic well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.5/2">The Children Bill seeks to reflect these outcomes legislatively&mdash;providing a context to ensure work by all parties is clearly based on what children and young people have told us is important. The translation of the outcomes into legislation has had to reflect wording which is appropriate for legislation. However, the intent remains unchanged. We are confident that the combination of the outcomes that refer to &quot;education and training&quot; and &quot;social and economic well-being&quot; do encompass the important matters of play, recreation and leisure activities. This ensures that these areas will be covered by the legislative framework and included in the work that local agencies do in assessing the needs of local children and young people and making arrangements to meet them.</p>
