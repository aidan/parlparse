The PSNI senior investigating officer conducted a number of television and press interviews and pictorial presentations of the notes have been shown. In addition, the serial numbers for three batches of new Northern Bank &pound;10 notes, which were stolen in the incident, have been issued. The value of the notes is &pound;16.5 million.

	<p pid="b.20.5/1">The requirements laid down in Regulation 6(3) of the Animals and Animal Products (Import and Export) (No. 2) Regulations 2004 implement provisions set out in EU Directives 91/68/EEC for sheep and goats and 64/432/EEC for cattle and pigs.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.5/2">These directives apply to and must be implemented by all member states. The EU Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) visits member states to check on the implementation and enforcement of this and other EU legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.5/3">The timetable for such visits is set annually by the FVO. Following a visit, the FVO produces a written report. This report highlights any deficiencies in implementation. The member state concerned is required to produce an action plan setting out remedial action. If the action plan is not followed and the member state does not comply with the requirements of the legislation, one of the courses of action open to the EU Commission is to take legal proceedings (that is, infraction proceedings) against the offending member state.</p>

Only two of the department's six agencies record taxi fares separately from general travel and subsistence costs. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency spent &pound;26,824.05 in 2002&ndash;03, and &pound;38,281.37 in 2003&ndash;04. The Driving Standards Agency began recording taxi costs separately in 2003&ndash;04, and spent &pound;4,116 in that period. Information for the other agencies could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.2/1">No such assessment has been made. The priority is to make best use of existing capacity. The new timetable includes a substantial increase in the frequency of trains from Yeovil and Salisbury to London. The development of the railway in the south-west will be considered by the Strategic Rail Authority's forthcoming regional planning assessment for the region. This will look at the development of the railway over the next five to 20 years, and its role in supporting the economic and wider development objectives of local, regional and central government.</p>
