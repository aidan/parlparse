	<p pid="d.89.2/1">The Government have significantly increased their dialogue with China on African issues in recent months. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister, my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, and I have discussed Africa-related issues with senior members of the Chinese Government in London, and my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs did so in Beijing in July this year. Senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Department for International Development (DfID) officials, including both Permanent Under-Secretaries, have discussed Africa during visits to Beijing. The FCO and DfID both plan to further formalise this dialogue: DfID plans regular senior official level talks with the Chinese on development issues with a strong emphasis on Africa. FCO and DfID posts in Beijing and in Africa are also developing their contacts with Chinese colleagues, including on opportunities for practical co-operation. Through this dialogue we will be encouraging China, in line with its growing engagement in Africa, to get more involved in relevant multilateral initiatives and actively to reinforce Africa's own agenda for promoting good governance and sound economic management.</p>
	<p pid="d.89.2/2">The UK also strongly supported the agreement by the EU and China at their summit in September to develop a structured dialogue on Africa. The EU hopes this will be able to start early in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="d.89.5/1">The impact of aviation on climate change is not limited to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Stern's conclusion on the non-CO2 impacts of aviation reflects the estimate made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the total climate change impact of aviation is two to four times greater than that of its CO2 emissions alone. This is due to some of the other emissions released, including nitrous oxides (NOx), particulates and water vapour, and their specific effects at altitude. There is, however, a need for further research to quantify these effects more accurately.</p>
	<p pid="d.89.5/2">Our aim is for aviation to join the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as soon as possible. Under the UK's chairmanship, the EU Environment Council agreed that emissions trading seems to be the best way forward and called on the Commission to produce a legislative proposal by the end of 2006. One of the key issues that will need to be considered as part of any proposal is how the non-CO2 impacts of aviation should be covered. There are technical challenges and scientific uncertainties surrounding the inclusion of non-CO2 effects in emissions trading. We believe that it is important to set out a pathway to improving understanding of the climate impacts of aviation and the trade-offs involved.</p>

	<p pid="d.90.5/1">The UK Government have consistently provided voluntary financial contributions in support of the clean development mechanism (CDM) in line with the Kyoto scale. For 2006, the UK provided $740,000. With current pledges paid and a levy on credits being taken to cover administrative expenses of the mechanism, it is expected that no further such contributions will be needed.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.5/2">The Government are on track to meet their Kyoto target and are therefore not intending to purchase credits from the CDM for compliance. However, the Government are purchasing credits from CDM projects to offset emissions from air travel undertaken in the course of official business. These will be sourced from small-scale energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The Government are facilitating involvement of businesses in the CDM market by approving the participation of companies not only from the UK but further afield. The list of 183 approved projects until November 2006, which covers a range of different mitigation activities, is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/internat/kyotomech/documents/cdm-dna-approvals.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/internat/kyotomech/documents/cdm-dna-approvals.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.5/3">The CDM market has grown enormously in the past year, with an estimated 1,300 projects and 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the pipeline to 2012. The UK is the major private sector participant in the CDM market, with UK companies participating in some 28 per cent of currently registered CDM projects and with an estimated $2 billion of private funds invested in London.</p>

	<p pid="d.91.2/1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a methodology for calculating the relative climate effects of different greenhouse gases. This provides the relative contribution of a tonne emission of each gas, relative to the effect of a tonne emission of carbon dioxide integrated over a fixed time period. A 100-year time horizon has been chosen in view of the relatively long time-scale for addressing climate change. This factor is known as the global warming potential (GWP).</p>
	<p pid="d.91.2/2">GWPs are given in the table below for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. These were published by the IPCC in its third assessment report.</p>

	<p pid="d.91.2/11">The GWP values used for calculating national greenhouse gas emissions reported to the United Nations framework convention on climate change are by international agreement taken from IPCC's second assessment report and differ slightly from the values shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="d.91.2/12">Taking account of GWPs and the level of emissions of different gases, the UK greenhouse gas inventory shows that in 2004 carbon dioxide accounted for about 84 per cent of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Methane and nitrous oxide contributed about 8 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Research conducted by the Hadley Centre takes account of the detailed effects of these gases on the climate including the interactions between the gases, the oceans and the terrestrial biosphere.</p>

	<p pid="d.97.2/1">Historic environment (HE) champions provide leadership for heritage issues within their local authority. They help to ensure that its policies, plans and strategies promote sustainable development of the historic environment&mdash;including realisation of its economic, social and environmental potential&mdash;in ways that support local, regional and national priorities. In doing so, they encourage communities to take ownership of their heritage. In the medium term, HE champions will also have an important role in engaging their local authority with implementation of reforms arising from the Government's heritage protection review.</p>
	<p pid="d.97.2/2">Since 2004, when DCMS and DCLG Ministers wrote to local authorities urging them to appoint member-level HE champions as a symbol of their commitment to heritage issues, more than half of authorities in England (223) have taken the opportunity to do so. I am arranging for details of current HE champions to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. An up-to-date list of local authorities with an appointed champion is available on English Heritage's historic environment local management website (<a href="http://www.helm.org.uk">www.helm.org.uk</a>). This provides access to information, guidance, case studies and training opportunities for elected members and officers, and is a resource for everyone with an interest in local stewardship of the historic environment. By the end of 2006, it will also feature an interactive map providing details of champions alongside other useful contacts, such as county archaeologists and conservation officers.</p>
	<p pid="d.97.2/3">In addition to resources made available through the HELM website, English Heritage offers newsletters, training, publications and support to help champions carry out their role, to keep them up to date, develop their skills, share ideas and build partnerships. It is working with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment which promotes the appointment of complementary design champions to achieve this.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-12-04d.104.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100788" speakername="Lord Truscott" colon=":" colnum="104"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61204w0003.htm#06120416000169">
	<p pid="d.104.5/1">The investigation of competition cases, and the approach adopted in doing so, is a matter for the Office of Fair Trading. I have therefore asked the office to provide a response to the point raised by the noble Lord. This is reproduced below.</p>
	<p pid="d.104.5/2">The Office of Fair Trading receives around 1,200 competition complaints each year. It cannot pursue all of these complaints and thus uses a set of published criteria to assist in prioritising those cases that it should take forward. These criteria are used to help the OFT judge how best to use its limited resources; maximising its impact for the benefit of UK consumers. The most recent set of criteria was published in October 2006, but related criteria have been in use since autumn 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.104.5/3">Subject to strategic questions around the best mix of cases for the OFT to pursue (including whether the OFT is itself best placed to pursue a particular matter), the OFT's prioritisation criteria for competition cases are set out in the following six steps:</p>
	<p pid="d.104.5/4">an estimate of the direct consumer benefit that would result from intervention&mdash;or, in other words, the consumer harm that would be reduced/removed by taking action;deterrent effect&mdash;including any estimate of the wider consumer detriment reduced/removed as a result of deterrence;any aggravating or mitigating factors;the precedent, policy or profile value of the particular case;an estimate of the OFT resources required to achieve the desired outcome in the case; andan estimate of the likelihood of success.</p>
	<p pid="d.104.5/5">Any predation case, whether involving national or local firms, would be assessed against these criteria and a decision reached on whether OFT action was warranted as a matter of administrative priority. These criteria permit the OFT to take forward all forms of predation cases, whether involving national or local firms. For example, a &quot;local&quot; predation case might not be rated highly on step 1 of the above criteria but might rate higher on some other criteria, in particular deterrence or precedent value. Equally, a &quot;national&quot; case may be rated highly on step 1 (for example, because of the greater number of consumers affected), but then less well on other steps.</p>

	<p pid="d.105.2/1">All roadshow venues and locations for the 2012 roadshow were agreed in conjunction with the London 2012 nations and regions group and regional stakeholders. Venues were selected to ensure that there was a wide and diverse coverage of events and locations from within each region in England and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As well as all four capital cities and other major towns, the roadshow visited 2012 competition venues, sporting events, venues with special significance for the Olympic or Paralympic movement, cultural venues and tourist attractions.</p>
	<p pid="d.105.2/2">A number of events were held in major regional centres in order to be accessible to as many people as possible. Guests from across a much wider area than single constituencies were invited and attended these events.</p>

	<p pid="d.111.5/1">Under the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) is entitled to a 50 per cent share of revenues from oil production in southern Sudan. State governments in both northern and southern Sudan are also entitled to at least 2 per cent of revenues from oil produced in their state. An independent National Petroleum Commission, comprising representatives of the national Government, GOSS and oil-producing state governments, has been set up to monitor oil revenue-sharing arrangements. Oil production and revenue data are also made available to the public on a monthly basis.</p>
	<p pid="d.111.5/2">Once oil revenues are transferred to GOSS or southern state governments, the funds are spent according to GOSS and state government financial regulations. These are being improved and strengthened with support from the international community. The World Bank manages a trust fund for southern Sudan to which donors (including the UK) have pledged a total of $103.9 million. The fund is in support of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and programming has been developed through consultation with the Government of Southern Sudan and a national needs assessment exercise. As manager of the fund, the World Bank carries the responsibility for ensuring that donor contributions are safeguarded. All projects approved for funding are subject to World Bank fiduciary regulations and procedures and it is our view that these are applied rigorously.</p>

	<p pid="d.114.2/1">Discussions with the vice-president of the Bevin Boys Association and research by officials have revealed no register of conscripted coal miners who served in the mines during the Second World War. It is understood that much of the official information on the Bevin boys was destroyed in the 1950s.</p>
