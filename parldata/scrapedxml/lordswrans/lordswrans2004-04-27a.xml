	<p pid="a.79.2/1">The Chief Executive of Water Service (Mrs Katharine Bryan) has replied to the noble Lord in response to this Question.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mr Trevor Haslett (on behalf of the Chief Executive of the Water Service) to Lord Kilclooney dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-07">7 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question (PQ 1197) about proposals to provide a new sewage disposal works in the village of Ballywalter, County Down. The Chief Executive of Water Service was asked to respond as the issue falls within her operational responsibility, and I am replying on her behalf as she is currently on annual leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/4">Under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Regulations (NI) 1995, Water Service will have to upgrade waste water treatment facilities at a number of coastal discharge points on the east coast of the Ards peninsula, including Ballywalter. It is estimated that this will cost around &pound;10 million, and is part of a larger investment of around &pound;650 million required to upgrade waste water treatment works across Northern Ireland over the next six years. This level of investment cannot be met by public expenditure alone. Water Service, in liaison with the Strategic Investment Board, is therefore taking forward a major public/private partnership programme to upgrade both water and waste water treatment facilities. The provision of new waste water facilities for the east coast of the Ards peninsula is currently included in the &pound;130 million PPP waste water programme and it is planned to award the contracts for the procurement of the waste water infrastructure projects in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">Tables 1 and 2 of Civil Partnership: A framework for the legal recognition of same-sex couples provided information about a wide range of partnership schemes in other countries for comparative purposes. It is not appropriate for all these relationships to be listed in Schedule 14 to the Bill. In some cases this is because the overseas relationship in question does not meet one or more of the &quot;general conditions&quot; contained in Clause 154, for example because it does not involve registration of the partnership. It is not considered appropriate to treat relationships of this kind as civil partnerships. In other cases, it was decided not to include a relationship in Schedule 14 until further research has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/2">Officials continue to gather information on relationships in other countries and territories in order to determine whether they should be added to the list contained in Schedule 14. There will be a continual need to review and update this list as new kinds of relationship come into effect in other countries. Clause 153 of the Bill allows for the schedule to be amended by subordinate legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/3">The absence of a relationship from Schedule 14 does not preclude the parties to such a relationship from being treated as civil partners in the UK, if the relationship meets the &quot;general conditions&quot; laid down in Clause 154, provided the other requirements of Clauses 152 to 158 are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.0/1">The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 implement into UK law Directive 2001/20/EC relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. The regulations were laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase> to enable the UK to fulfil its obligation under European Community law to implement the directive by <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">The Government have consulted extensively with stakeholders on the UK regulations. Consultation has been ongoing through workshops and meetings with key stakeholders including the pharmaceutical industry, ethics committees, those responsible for medical research and development in the National Health Service, the academic community and medical research charities. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency conducted a formal consultation exercise between February and May 2003 and received over 160 responses from a wide range of stakeholders including the pharmaceutical industry and those involved in non-commercial trials. Following this, the Government established a Medical Research Council/Department of Health joint project to help to develop practical solutions to some of the potential problems identified by non-commercial trialists. Throughout the process of drawing up the regulations I have had numerous meetings with, and written to, various groups and individuals with interests in non-commercial trials to keep them informed of progress and to seek feedback. Where possible, the Government have taken account of the concerns of stakeholders in the regulations laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/3">Scrutiny of these regulations will be the same as for any other statutory instrument under the negative procedure. The regulations have been brought to the attention of Parliament and it is always open to Members to lay a prayer against such regulations. I wrote to a wide range of stakeholders including Front- Bench spokesmen on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase> to inform them of the laying of the regulations. I understand that a Starred Question has been tabled for response in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-05">5 May</phrase> and a Prayer against the regulations will be debated in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-25">25 May</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.3/16">(1) Annual figures cover births occurring in each calendar year. However, a very small number of births are registered too late to be included in the counts for the appropriate year and are instead included in those for the following year.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/17">(2) Mean is the arithmetical average time elapsed.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/18">(3) Median represents the time within which exactly half of the children were registered.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the National Statistician, Len Cook, to the Earl Russell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-27">27 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question concerning how British subjects leaving a foreign domicile and resuming a British domicile are classified in the annual statistics of net migration. (HL2459)</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">The Office for National Statistics estimates the number of British citizens entering the United Kingdom using data from the International Passenger Survey and the Irish Central Statistical Office. They are identified from the nationality shown on their passport.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">A migrant is defined as someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for a period of at least a year, so that the country of destination effectively becomes the country of usual residence. Thus, only British citizens returning to the UK with the intention of staying for a year or more, having spent over a year living abroad, will be included in the annual statistics of net international migration.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-04-27a.84.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="84"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040427/text/40427w02.htm#40427w02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.84.3/1">We have introduced regulations under Part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requiring all new trains entering service from <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase> to be accessible to disabled people. During the past two and half years, over 1,400 new fully accessible rail vehicles have entered service and there will be over 1,000 more within the next 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2">The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations specify a range of features to help disabled people, including those who need to travel in wheelchairs. The regulations require the operator of a regulated rail vehicle to supply a boarding device (generally a ramp) to enable wheelchair users to board and alight from the train. The ramp can be either stowed on the train or kept at the station but it must in either case be made available for use when a disabled passenger needs it.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/3">The regulations also require a table to be provided for passengers using the wheelchair accessible space. They stipulate that the lowest point on the underside of the tabletop in a regulated vehicle must be not less than 720 mm vertically above the floor of the vehicle. This dimension is prescribed to ensure that a wheelchair user is provided with comfortable legroom below the table when it is in use.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/4">I am not aware that any new trains are being fitted with tables that do not comply with these specifications. If this were the case, the operators would be in breach of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/5">Trains that came into service before the regulations were introduced are not subject to these requirements as a matter of law although many do offer good levels of access both to wheelchair users and other disabled people.</p>
