	<p pid="a.65.2/1">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has not brought forward any specific proposals to create a Common European Asylum System. However, the Lisbon treaty does call for such a system to be established and the European Commission has proposed a number of measures that move towards creating it.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/2">The Government strongly believe in the importance of practical co-operation on asylum policy within the EU. We do not judge that adopting a common EU asylum policy is right for Britain. We believe there are many issues in this area where all EU member states have much to gain by working together. We will be active in promoting effective co-operation and consider participation in legislative proposals on their merits, in consultation with our European partners and relevant EU institutions.</p>

The department's Diversity Project Board aims to ensure that there is an inclusive approach to cultural policy-making, while Arts Council England (ACE)-one of the department's directly-funded bodies-encourages the participation of ethnic minorities in major regular cultural festivals through Race Equality audits, Race Equality Action Plan, and audience development initiatives such as Maximise.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/2">ACE regularly funded organisations such as Asian Arts UK, Sampad and the Milap Festival Trust specialise in encouraging diverse artists and attracting diverse audiences. Arts Council England also provides core funding for a range of community-led festivals and carnival work which reaches out to diverse communities, including St Paul's Carnival in Bristol, the Africa Oye Festival in Liverpool, Stockton International Riverside Festival and the range of artists they fund who perform at the Notting Hill carnival.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.5/1">The prescribing of fertility drugs that can lead to ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) is not a licensable activity under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and is therefore not regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The HFEA does not routinely collect information about cases of OHSS occurring in connection with treatment at each HFEA licensed centre, other than where this is reported in the context of an adverse incident report. While the HFEA receives limited data about OHSS it is not possible from these data to calculate the incidence of OHSS for each clinic in relation to the population treated.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/1">First, when pharmacists provide NHS Pharmaceutical services, under their terms of service (paragraphs 20 and 21 of Schedule 1 of the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005), in cases where a pharmacist has supported a patient's self care, for example in the sale of an over the counter product, the pharmacist, shall, in appropriate cases, keep and maintain a record of any advice given, and of any drugs supplied when the advice was given, and that record shall be in a form that facilitates:</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/3">Secondly, in the handling of any patient sensitive information, pharmacists are governed by the Data Protection Act and their professional standards; a number of these standards relate to consent, confidentiality and appropriate record keeping. Furthermore, community pharmacists are now engaged with the NHS Information Governance Toolkit. Compliance with level 2 (expected by <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>) will demonstrate attainment of National Health Service standards and requirements.</p>

Those individuals who are resident and domiciled in the UK are liable to UK tax on their worldwide income and gains. Those who are resident but not domiciled may claim the remittance basis of taxation. Those claiming the remittance basis pay tax on their UK-source income and gains as they arise but are taxed on their non-UK income and gains only if they are brought into the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">There are separate provisions for MPs and Members of the House of Lords by which they are deemed to be resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled in the UK for income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax purposes. Therefore, they are liable to tax on all their worldwide income, gains and assets regardless of their actual status.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.3/1">The UK Border Agency aims to process 90 per cent of applications for business visit visas within 15 working days, 98 per cent in six weeks and 100 per cent in 12 weeks. The agency's customer service standards, and a guide to recent processing times at each of the agency's visa application centre overseas, are published on its website at <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gsi.gv.uk/visas">www.ukba.homeoffice.gsi.gv.uk/visas</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/2">Business visit visa applications lodged in India are currently being processed well within the published target time. In August 2010 (the last published information), for example, 1,129 business visit visa applications lodged in the New Delhi visa application centre were concluded, of which 72 per cent were decided in two working days and 98 per cent in 15 working days.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/3">The position is similar in China, where in August 2010, 866 business visit visa applications lodged in the Beijing visa application centre were concluded, of which 34 per cent were concluded in two working days and 96 per cent in 15 working days.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/4">Demand for visas in both India and China rises substantially over the summer months, which can lead to longer processing times than at other times of the year, but the UK Border Agency works hard to meet its published customer service standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/5">In addition, fast track programmes exist in both India and China and continue to operate through the summer, providing a faster turn around time for companies that send significant numbers of staff to visit the UK.</p>

This information could be obtained only by checking individual records and therefore at a disproportionate cost.</p>
