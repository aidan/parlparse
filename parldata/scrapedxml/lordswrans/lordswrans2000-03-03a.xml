	<p pid="a.115.1/2" qnum="HL1196">What was the cost of setting up the Prison Service website; who is responsible for maintaining it; what is the estimated cost of maintenance for the year 2000-2001; and whether any improvements in content are planned.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/1">The initial cost of setting up the Prison Service website is commercial in confidence. The contract was subjected to a rigorous tendering process, and the successful company was chosen on the basis of price, technical competence and previous experience in establishing government websites.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/2">The site is maintained in-house by the Prison Service's media relations unit. Currently there is one permanent website manager, who is assisted by one other member of staff. In order to ensure that the content is as accurate as possible, updates are undertaken only once individual prison establishments and groups and units from prison service headquarters who provide the information have agreed the contents.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/3">It is estimated that the cost of maintenance for the year 2000-2001 will be in the region of &pound;36,000. This figure comprises the following:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.115.2/6"> <td></td> <td></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.115.2/7"> <td>Staff costs:</td> <td>&pound;33,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.115.2/8"> <td>Hardware costs:</td> <td>&pound;3,000 (server rent costs)</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.115.2/11">Forthcoming content improvements over the next 12 months include publication of all non-restricted Prison Service Orders, more detailed information on each individual prison establishment, increasing the number of prison service reports and other publications which will be available on-line, details on the Prison Service's Management Board, and an on-line version of the service's in-house magazine Prison Service News. In addition, there will be increased hyperlinks, both internal and external.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.0/1">None. I understand that the RAC and AA have always used one method of assessing accommodation throughout Great Britain. They decide what will be of most service to their members, so we are pleased that they have also worked so constructively with the English Tourism Council to agree on a single quality standard for England, in accordance with the national tourism strategy.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-03-03a.120.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100399" speakername="Lord McIntosh of Haringey" colon=":" colnum="120"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000303/text/00303w01.htm#00303w01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.120.0/1">There is presently no recognised concept of a &quot;national heritage park&quot; and no formal approach has been made to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport for support of this project. Legislation, following extensive public consultation, would be required to create &quot;national heritage parks&quot; and to then apply the designation to the Goodwin Sands. It may be that the concept could be explored in the Government's review of policies relating to the historic environment currently being undertaken by English Heritage.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/2">The Government are aware that proposals are being developed locally for the designation as a maritime heritage park of an area of the Goodwin Sands where four shipwrecks designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 are located.</p>
