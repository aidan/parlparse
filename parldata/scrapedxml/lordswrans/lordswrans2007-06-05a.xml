	<p pid="a.182.8/5">The ONS has carried out recent consultation on requirements for information on ethnicity and identity, and we are currently considering all the responses to this consultation.

	<p pid="a.182.8/6">Space constraints mean that there are limits to the number of questions and tick-boxes that can be accommodated in the 2011 census.

	<p pid="a.182.8/7">A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals, including the wording of any questions about ethnicity and identity, is scheduled to be published in 2008. However it will not be possible to confirm what questions and response categories are to be included in the 2011 census until the consultation and question testing programme is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.2/1">In January this year, the Office for Criminal Justice Reform issued revised guidance on arrangements for the use of interpreters and translators in the criminal justice system, aimed at ensuring that only suitably qualified interpreters and translators are used in criminal proceedings. The guidance stipulates that every interpreter working in courts and police stations should be registered on one of the recommended registers; that is, the National Register of Public Service Interpreters (NRPSI) or the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People (CACDP). We believe that NRPSI continues to represent an appropriate standard for interpreting in criminal proceedings. I have placed a copy of the guidance in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.0/2">London landfilled about 2.7 million tonnes of municipal waste in 2005-06&mdash;this is 64 per cent of the total municipal waste of 4.2 million tonnes. A further 0.77 million tonnes (18 per cent) was incinerated. This compares to national figures of 62 per cent landfill and 10 per cent incineration for municipal waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">In 2005-06, about 0.3 million tonnes of London's municipal waste (12 per cent of that landfilled or 7 per cent of the total) was landfilled and 100 per cent of incinerated waste was incinerated within the area of the Greater London Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">Greater Manchester incinerates 8 per cent of municipal waste and landfills 69 per cent, while Birmingham incinerates 64 per cent and landfills 20 per cent. As Greater Manchester and Birmingham are not government regions, it is useful to note for comparison that the north-west region incinerates 3 per cent and landfills 70 per cent and the West Midlands region incinerates 31 per cent and landfills 44 per cent of municipal waste. Table A, below, contains further information.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">The Environment Agency is not aware of any definite plans to increase landfill capacity in London. However, it is expected that a new 585,000-tonne capacity incinerator will be built in the London Borough of Bexley during the next three years. This will help London achieve its landfill allowance targets in 2010 and 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">The above figures all refer to municipal waste. However, in London, non-municipal waste is around 14 million tonnes. In all, about 6.6 million tonnes of London's total waste is landfilled. Around 1.3 million tonnes (19 per cent) is landfilled within London and the remaining 5.3 million tonnes (81 per cent) is disposed of at landfills mainly in adjacent regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">We do not have figures available for Greater Manchester or Birmingham on total waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.2/2" qnum="HL3781">Why separating waste collection and contracting for waste disposal is inappropriate in London when a two-tier system exists outside London and produces higher levels of recycling and greater landfill self-sufficiency.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.3/1">As the only wholly urban region in England, London faces particular challenges. It is therefore more appropriate to compare London's performance on recycling with metropolitan boroughs, which have a similar range of performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/2">As we move to new, more sustainable ways of managing waste, it is becoming increasingly important to integrate collection and disposal. Joint working is particularly important in two-tier areas, where responsibilities for waste collection and waste disposal are split between different authorities. The Government have proposed new powers to allow the creation of joint waste authorities, where authorities wish to work together to discharge some, or all, of their waste functions.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.0/1">Greywater harvesting systems are still largely regarded as a developing technology in the UK. Research conducted in the area of greywater harvesting has tended to conclude that these systems are not generally economic, except perhaps for larger users such as hotels and public buildings. The feasibility of installing greywater systems in households still needs to be established.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/2">To address the information gap, the Government's market transformation programme is looking at technologies that could potentially reduce overall water consumption by reusing rainwater and/or greywater. A project has been started to develop the necessary evidence, economic case, feasibility, performance standards, policy action plan and impact scenarios to determine the best use of rainwater/greywater technology.</p>
