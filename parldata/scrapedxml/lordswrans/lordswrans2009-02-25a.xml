	<p pid="a.93.5/1">The reprocessing of recyclable materials in the UK, and the export of such materials for recycling abroad, are not mutually exclusive. The Government support both.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/2">The waste and resources action programme (WRAP) and the national industrial symbiosis programme (NISP) are working to find alternative markets for recyclates in the UK. Since its creation in 2000, WRAP has provided &pound;50.7 million through its grant funding programme on direct interventions such as increasing the capacity of a particular market or supporting new markets for recyclable materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/3">Specific examples include:</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/4">&pound;2 million to support the creation of the first UK plants to deliver closed loop recycling of waste plastics back into material for food packaging with a capacity of 35,000 tonnes per year; and&pound;17 million to a company to enable an extra 321,000 tonnes of recovered newspapers and magazines to be recycled each year. This led to all UK-sourced newsprint being made from 100 per cent recycled paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/5">Alongside this support for reprocessing in the UK, and since a large share of the world's manufacturing base is overseas, it makes sense for the UK to help supply export markets with recyclable raw material, and so reduce the carbon impact of using virgin raw materials in their place.</p>

We will shortly be consulting widely on the basis of proposed changes only in respect of kitchen and dining facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/2">Pupils in schools are not covered by the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 in relation to the provision of drinking water and toilets.
