	<p pid="a.130.2/1">When a prisoner enters the prison system he is allocated a prison number which remains with him throughout his sentence. The unique prison number consists of two letters denoting the prison in which he was received followed by four numbers, which are issued consecutively. The Home Office Prisons Service is aware of the number as it is recorded on the inmate information system (IIS). The prison number is not made available to police. The reason for this is that the unique identifier for the police is the police national computer number, which is generated when the charged person's details are recorded on the PNC. If the offender is subsequently sentenced to a further term of imprisonment after release then he is allocated a different unique prison number. A new offender management system (C-NOMIS) is being developed for the prison and probation services, which will allocate a unique number for an offender serving a custodial or community sentence. This number will be retained if further offences are committed, enabling the services to maintain a view of the criminal history of the offender, and effectively creating a &quot;for life&quot; unique number that will overcome the above problem.</p>
