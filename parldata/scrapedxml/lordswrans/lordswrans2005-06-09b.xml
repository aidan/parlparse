	<p pid="b.95.2/1">Niger was included in the DfID-supported work with Anti-Slavery International aimed at eradicating child domestic servitude and trafficking by establishing a network of non-government organisations in six countries in west Africa to combat abusive employment and cross-border recruitment of young children as domestic workers. The DfID provided &pound;70,000. The project was completed in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/2">The DfID is working closely with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and non-governmental organisations to tackle descent-based slavery and other forced labour issues elsewhere in west Africa. Through a &pound;15 million partnership framework agreement with the ILO, the DfID is funding a $1.9 million programme (approved in 2003) to combat forced labour and trafficking in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Togo.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/3">Although the DfID does not have a direct assistance programme with Niger, as part of efforts to strengthen UK/France co-operation on development issues in Africa, DfID has agreed to provide an initial &pound;7 million, through the French development programme, in support of Niger's basic education policy, with particular emphasis on getting more girls into primary education.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.3/1">The Government define affordable housing as including social-rented housing and other forms of sub-market housing (known as intermediate housing). Social-rented housing is housing at social rents (i.e. subject to the rent restructuring regime) and accessed via local authority or RSL housing registers. Other forms of sub-market housing include forms of low-cost home ownership such as shared ownership and Homebuy and housing available at intermediate rents (above social rent but below market rent). Affordable housing can generally be accessed only by existing social housing tenants or people on waiting lists, or others groups specifically identified, such as key workers. It is typically in receipt of public subsidy, but can also be provided by other means; for example, through &quot;Section 106&quot; planning agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/2">In addition, planning policy guidance note 3: housing (PPG3) requires a local planning authority to define what it considers to be affordable in its areas in terms of the relationship between local income levels and house prices or rents for different types of households. This is used in considering planning applications for both market and sub-market housing.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.2/1">Directive 2003/35/EC, which amends Directive 85/337/EEC dealing with environmental impact assessment and Directive 96/61/EC on pollution prevention and control, will be transposed by a number of legislative instruments. Proposals for transposing the amendments to Directive 85/337/EC, as far as projects falling within the planning system in England are concerned, are set out in a consultation document published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March</phrase>, and the directive will be implemented, in the light of comments received, as soon as possible after the consultation period ends on <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase>. There will be separate legislative instruments to transpose the amendments to that directive for projects falling outside the planning system, and for projects in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. Regulations to transpose the amendments to Directive 96/61/EC via the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 2000 (England and Wales), and separate regulations for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Gibraltar, are expected to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-25">25 June 2005</phrase>. Further regulations to transpose the amendments to that directive via the Offshore Combustion Installations (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Regulations 2001 will come into force later this year.</p>
