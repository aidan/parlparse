	<p pid="a.145.3/7">There has already been progress on the Task Force's interim recommendations, published in the 1999 report Driving the Agenda. For instance, we announced in March that we would be spending &pound;6 million this year on a Cleaner Vehicles Programme to take forward the Task Force's recommendations on retrofitting. Industry has acted too, with the motor industry adopting a label providing information about emissions on all new cars. We look forward to seeing rapid progress on the recommendations contained in this report.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.5/1">It is not our policy that there should be a small number of large capacity animal carcass incinerators instead of a large number of small-scale animal carcass incinerators.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/2">Our policy on waste is set out in the draft waste strategy, A Way With Waste. This emphasises the priority the Government places on tough environmental standards for all types of incineration. It also makes clear that wastes should be disposed of as close to the point of production as possible, consistent with the need for effective environmental controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/3">We now expect the proposal to be adopted as a directive in the autumn, subject to the progress of the final stage of negotiation. The deadline for transposition into UK law will be two years after adoption. The proposal is therefore likely to apply to new plant from autumn 2002. Existing plant will not, however, have to comply until five years after adoption--ie autumn 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/4">We are looking at implementation options which will minimise the burden on small scale animal carcass incinerators and pet crematoria while ensuring that there are appropriate environmental safeguards.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.2/1">It is the Environment Agency's advice that it is likely that no animal carcass incinerators under 50kg/hr capacity would be fitted with the necessary emissions abatement equipment to meet the standards for dioxins and other pollutants in the proposed waste incineration directive. The cost-benefit analyses prepared for the Department by Entec UK Ltd (copies of which are in the House Library) in Appendix 1 pp. 58-59 noted a lack of emissions data for such plant, but assumed that equipment to abate nitrogen oxides, hydrogen chloride and heavy metals would be needed, plus a secondary combustion chamber to permit sufficient residence time to achieve the dioxins limit.</p>

Apart from these, each request for transport is judged on its own merits. Factors considered include: the ability to achieve the required delivery date; the size of the load; the suitability and location of railheads; security and public safety considerations. An assessment is also made of extra effort caused by double-handling at road-rail interfaces and &quot;out-of-gauge&quot; operating considerations. Unless there are overriding reasons to use either road or rail, then the solution which offers the best value for money is normally selected.</p>

There is an overall shortfall in those specialising in histopathology, there have been problems in establishing higher specialist training places, trainees do not wish to go into the discipline and it requires extra training over and above that required in histopathology.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.6/3">For 2000/01, we intend to establish 40 new higher specialist training places in histopathology, with new money from the Medical and Dental Education Levy. We have written to National Health Service trusts and health authorities explaining the importance that we attach to the delivery of extra training places in the light of commitments on improved cancer services. We are looking to Regional Offices to use their influence to encourage them to co-operate with Regional Postgraduate Deans in providing the necessary funding and establishing posts. At the same time, the Royal College of Pathologists and the Regional Postgraduate Deans are looking at ways to attract more higher specialist trainees into histopathology in general and paediatric training posts in particular.</p>
