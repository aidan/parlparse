	<p pid="b.23.8/1">Securing Afghanistan's Future (SAF), a Government of Afghanistan and International Community endorsed strategy published in March 2004, puts forward a programme of investments to lay the foundations for the sustained economic growth needed to support a financially sustainable state that is capable of undertaking social development and poverty reduction. All DfID interventions are consistent with SAF as well as the Government's national development framework (NDF).</p>
	<p pid="b.23.8/2">Within this, the Government have a number of national priority programmes, which have the endorsement of numerous donors and government including DfID, through significant funding. These include the National Emergency Employment Programme (NEEP), the National Solidarity Program (NSP) and the Micro Finance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA). NEEP targets interventions in rural productive assets, mainly roads, irrigation schemes, social infrastructure and water drinking supplies. The NSP is the Afghan Government's flagship programme for community empowerment, local self-governance, and socio-economic development in rural areas. MISFA is the Apex Institution that provides micro-credit to rural Afghan individuals and communities. These interventions are grounded within the National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS) and are the major component of Pillar II, Alternative Livelihoods.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-02b.24.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="24"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050302/text/50302w01.htm#50302w01_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.24.2/1">The economy of Afghanistan has long been agriculture-based. The agriculture sector has traditionally been subsistence-orientated, and the growing of cereal crops (mainly wheat) has dominated. Other crops and vegetables, such as grapes, apricots and almonds, have the potential to be exported. The production of cereal products is inversely linked to the production of the poppy. For Afghanistan to become a self-sustainable economy by 2015, economic growth must be in the order of 9 per cent per annum. This will come not only from an expansion in agricultural production but also from other sectors of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.2/2">Within the agriculture sector this growth will come from technical progress in the production of cereals and rebuilding the livestock sector, which produces milk and meat. Other sources of growth should include in the industrial sector, transport and power, including road construction through general economic growth and demand. In addition, there is significant potential in oil, gas and mining. Afghanistan has significant deposits of a number of minerals. The Government also hope that as a result of private investment the manufacturing sector will expand. Financial services and tourism are expected to expand in the medium-term.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.2/3">DfID is supporting these sectors in a number of ways, by providing &pound;3 million to support Research in Alternative Livelihoods Fund as well as targeted interventions with the Ministry of Mines (&pound;4 million) to assist with the assessment and marketing of mineral deposits in Afghanistan. DfID is supporting the Ministry of Commerce (&pound;4 million) in developing a private sector development strategy as well as targeted interventions such as access to credit and markets in rural areas and for specific agricultural products, as well as providing services for business development.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.3/1">The detailed obligations for subtitling are set by Ofcom, within the framework established by the Communications Act 2003, and are set out in its code on television access services. I am arranging for copies of that code to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Monitoring of compliance with those obligations is also the responsibility of Ofcom and the code requires relevant broadcasters to submit quarterly returns covering quarters starting from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>: the first quarterly returns are therefore not yet due.</p>

The audience share of BBC Parliament is well below the level set by Ofcom as the threshold at which access obligations arise.

	<p pid="b.28.8/1">This information is not currently available. National Health Service foundation trusts (NHSFTs) are independent organisations. They are no longer accountable to Ministers or the Department of Health but to their local communities, primary care trusts, Monitor (the statutory name for which is the independent regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts) and Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.8/2">The Department of Health holds only that information about NHSFTs that Section 19(a) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 allows. This precludes the collection of operational data from NHSFTs unless specifically listed in Schedule 6 of the Terms of Authorisation (akin to a &quot;licence&quot; to operate) for NHSFTs.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.8/3">Compliance with single-sex accommodation objectives is included in Schedule 6. NHS trusts, including NHSFTs, are required to report compliance on an annual basis. Reports of compliance at <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase> are currently being collated and we will report on this at a later date.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.8/4">Nationally, at December 2003: 99 per cent of NHS trusts provided single-sex sleeping accommodation for planned admissions and have robust operational policies in place to protect patients' privacy and dignity; 99 per cent of NHS trusts met the additional criteria set to ensure the safety of patients who are mentally ill; and 97 per cent of NHS trusts provided properly segregated bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.8/5">The small percentage of NHS trusts which have yet to achieve the objectives have hospital development works underway, whose completion will bring them to the required standard. These figures do not include NHSFTs, the first of which were established from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.8/6">NHS trusts are not required to report upon the provision of single-sex accommodation in relation to unplanned admissions. In such circumstances the use of mixed-sex accommodation may be unavoidable, as the need to provide urgent treatment or care will take precedence over the requirement to segregate men and women. This is regrettable. However, no hospital will turn a patient away because a bed appropriate to their gender is not immediately available.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.5/1">We published Standards for Better Health in July 2004. Every English National Health Service body including NHS trusts is required to take these into account.
