	Afghanistan: Humanitarian Aid
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="b.209.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.209.1/2" qnum="HL512">Whether they have made an assessment of Oxfam's recent report which indicates that more than &pound;7 billion of international aid money spent in Afghanistan in the past six years has not met the urgent humanitarian and development needs of the Afghan people because aid has been either insufficient or delivered ineffectively.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-12-06b.209.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100958" speakername="Baroness Vadera" colon=":" colnum="209"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71206w0001.htm#07120652000026">
	<p pid="b.209.2/1">DfID welcomes Oxfam's latest report and agrees with a lot of its conclusions. DfID agrees that there needs to be a stronger co-ordination and greater alignment of aid with national and local priorities and increased use of Afghan resources; that further major reforms are required in public administration, anti-corruption and the rule of law; that sub-national governance needs to be reformed and resources channelled more directly to communities; that each PRT should develop a phased, conditions-based exit strategy; and that more investment is required by the donor community in the areas of health and education.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.2/2">DfID also realises that while expectations for development in Afghanistan are high, improving the capacity of the Government and civil society in Afghanistan is a long-term process. We have seen evidence of some improvement and this will need to continue with full support from the international community.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.2/3">The Government of Afghanistan recently outlined their views on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan in a draft aid policy paper. A key proposal within this paper is increased co-ordination behind the Government's own established national priorities. DfID and other like-minded donors fully support the proposals outlined and will help ensure that they are implemented. The Government's full plan for reconstruction and development, the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), will be presented to the international community in March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.2/4">Although it is the second largest bilateral donor, DfID's &pound;107 million commitment this year is small compared to US and multilateral financing, which accounts for a large proportion of the &pound;2 billion plus committed to development in Afghanistan this financial year. This is why co-ordination of international assistance and improved effectiveness of aid is a major objective of DfID's policy support to Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.210.0/1">The national online matching service is still being trialled in two Learning and Skills Council (LSC) areas in the south-west and south-east. The emerging findings show that young people value a single point for information and application on apprenticeships, while employers value the opportunity to advertise their vacancies and receive applications through the vacancy matching service. There are no plans to publish a report on the trials. However, the current apprenticeships review will receive proposals from the LSC on the shape of the national online matching service. The review's report will be published early in 2008.</p>

We will, in 2008, introduce an online matching service that will greatly improve our ability to collect data on the number of people seeking an apprenticeship place, and on the places available.</p>

However, rises over recent years in numbers of apprentices participating and numbers of employers offering places informed our recent commitment to a major expansion of the apprenticeship programme, with funding to increase overall places from 250,000 today to more than 400,000 by 2010-11, provided high quality employer places are available. We expect that the new national matching service, to be introduced online in 2008, will greatly reduce the risk of young people failing to find a suitable apprenticeship place.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.8/2">We have put in place the investment to enable us to achieve this. A new numeracy strategy and marketing campaign in 2008 will drive higher demand for courses. More embedding of basic skills in vocational qualifications will increase the number of achievements, as well as improving success rates. Our work with employers and business, including the employer skills pledge, will also drive greater demand for literacy and numeracy skills.</p>

Rather than mobilising extra resources for a particular use, such as UNRWA schools, we encourage other donors to make similar long-term core funding commitments to UNRWA.</p>

	<p pid="b.216.6/1">The personal progression system (PPS) was supported by Equal European Union funding to develop initiatives to raise levels of employability amongst disadvantaged groups of the long-term unemployed. The Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (NIACRO) led a partnership with the Northern Ireland Prison Service and Probation Board for Northern Ireland (PBNI) focusing on prisoners with a history of long-term unemployment. The PPS ran from 2002 for three years and was externally evaluated. Approximately 400 prisoners were involved in this programme. The lessons learnt were integrated into the follow-up project called ReachOut (2005-2007), which addressed the attainment of stable, permanent employment for ex-offenders. The Prison Service and PBNI agreed in November 2007 to support NIACRO in its bid for European structural fund support to develop the next phase, known as Jobtrack and which will focus primarily on preparing prisoners for employment on release.</p>

	<p pid="b.218.5/1">Following the loss by HMRC of personal confidential information, the Prime Minister asked the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, to carry out spot checks on the compliance by government departments with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.5/2">This does not entail any legislative change. In practice it will mean that the Commissioner may carry out assessments of government departments on the basis that he will not be refused consent. The proposed spot checks will initially be focused on Whitehall departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.5/3">The Thomas/Walport Review on information sharing will be asked to consider the case for providing the Information Commissioner with unfettered access to assess the processing of personal data within the private and wider public sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.5/4">The Government are also considering the Information Commissioner's request to create a new offence under the Data Protection Act of knowingly or recklessly failing to comply with the data protection principles contained in the Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.2/1">Following the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA), the UK pledged &pound;317 million for Sudan for the period from 2005 to 2007. The UK now stands to exceed its pledge for this period, having disbursed over &pound;290 million so far, and our financial commitment to Sudan has increased to &pound;110 million in 2007. The UK's assistance has been focused on supporting the implementation of the CPA and in building the capacity of the southern Government to provide basic services for their population.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.2/2">A large number of UK officials work on Sudan, including on development and political CPA issues. Amongst those there are 14 staff in the London-based joint DfID/FCO Sudan unit, the 27 staff in the DfID Khartoum office, as well as officials in the British Embassy. In Juba, south Sudan, the UK works through the joint donor office, which has 12 staff working exclusively on assistance to south Sudan.</p>
