	<p pid="a.51.2/1">Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board, an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Keene.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">Magistrates receive advice and training on both the general approach to sentencing and to sentencing for specific offences. The major source for guidance on motoring offences is the <i>Magistrates' Court Sentencing Guidelines</i> drawn up by a number of magistrates and others for the benefit of the magistracy as a whole, and effective from <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>. These guidelines are included in the <i>Adult Court Bench Book</i> and used nationally. The <i>Adult Court Bench Book</i> is accessible to everyone through the public JSB website. The guidelines provide a structure for determining an appropriate penalty within the limits set by Parliament. They require the magistrate to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the defendant's personal circumstances and, if a fine is appropriate, the defendant's means.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">For speeding offences, the guidelines propose that a number of miles per hour over the speed limit should be the primary (but not the only) factor in determining seriousness, and suggests different fine levels, penalty points and/or disqualification depending on the speed and other seriousness factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/4">There are no specific guidelines for the offences of &quot;illegal number plates&quot; or &quot;illegal noisy exhaust systems&quot; . They are within a general category of vehicle defect offences, and the guidelines suggest, as a starting point, a fine. Magistrates will use their usual process for determining the seriousness of the offence to fix the amount of that fine.</p>

Such equipment is not required because commercial aircraft ventilation systems are designed to supply air of an acceptable standard. This is confirmed at initial certification and, thereafter, each aircraft is subject to scheduled maintenance actions to ensure those standards are maintained. Where problems are encountered in service these are investigated and changes or repairs are introduced as necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.3/1">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has recently drafted a European technical standards order (ETSO) that provides an up-to-date technical specification for a carbon monoxide detector for aviation use. This draft ETSO has been submitted to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) with a recommendation for adoption as a European standard. At the same time the CAA submitted a proposal for changes to EASA's certification specifications that would mandate the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in future aeroplane designs.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/2">These proposals were made as a direct result of experience of accidents, and they were supported by a preliminary regulatory impact assessment. The proposals, if adopted, would require installation of carbon monoxide detectors only in single-engined aeroplanes with forward-mounted engines, since the worldwide experience of accidents and incidents does not support the need for installation of carbon monoxide detectors in other aircraft.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.11/1">The requirements for electrical efficiency were set out in the terms and conditions of the original competition; that is, 36 per cent. electrical efficiency, based on the lower heating value of the fuel as received at the installation, assuming a moisture content of 35 per cent. The output was defined in the grant application submitted by the project developer.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.11/2">To ensure that the installation will be built according to the description in the proposal the offer letter contains requirements attached to the payment milestones. These are for the independent consultant to certify that the project has first been designed, and then built, essentially as described in the application.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.11/3">Up to 85 per cent. of the total grant is payable on satisfactory completion of performance tests. Should the installation fail to reach the maximum rated output specified in the proposal, and in the opinion of the independent consultant is unlikely to do so, the department reserves the right to reduce the maximum grant pro-rata to reflect the actual output.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.11/4">Requirements are amendable but consideration of any amendment would need to ensure that it is in line with the objectives of the scheme and that revisions are not likely to affect the original assessment of the competition and subsequent allocation of funding. We have no plans to amend the electrical efficiency requirement. No grant increase would be made if the applicant exceeds 36 per cent. electrical efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.5/1">The inspection arrangements that will apply for the purposes of the licensing arrangements introduced under the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 have not been finalised.

	<p pid="a.57.5/2">The Gangmasters Licensing Authority has proposed that a risk-based approach should be adopted in relation to application and compliance inspections. However, the authority has acknowledged that there may not be sufficient evidence available initially, to move immediately to a risk-based approach for application inspections. The Gangmaster Licensing Authority board has recommended that if there is insufficient evidence to establish a meaningful risk profile from the outset, inspections should be conducted for all applicants for an initial period. A risk-based approach would be introduced at the earliest possible time, as agreed by the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.5/3">The Gangmasters Licensing Authority has proposed that licences should be continuous unless revoked. Renewal will be an administrative process triggered by payment of a fee.

We welcome the agreement between the governments of Israel and Egypt on basic security arrangements along the Gaza-Egypt border. A resolution to the issue of a crossing point on the Rafah border is also needed and is central to the future of other crossings and issues such as the port and airport.

That decision prevented the case being tried in the military justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">Following further consideration, and again with the benefit of legal advice from the Army Legal Service, senior army officers decided that the case should be referred to the Attorney-General for the question of a prosecution in a civilian court to be considered.

	<p pid="a.61.5/1">We acknowledge that the Palestinian Authority (PA) still needs considerable support post-disengagement, and we continue to do all we can to help it. A key Middle East peace process priority of our EU presidency is supporting disengagement and continued reform of Palestinian institutions. The EU is working closely with the Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement, James Wolfensohn, in order to help realise plans to boost the Palestinian economy post-disengagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">This financial year the UK plans to spend around &pound;60 million in support for the Palestinians. Around &pound;30 million of this will be in the form of bilateral assistance, with the remainder via our contribution to the EU. We will provide &pound;10 million to strengthen and promote further reform of the PA, through the World Bank Reform Trust Fund. This financial year, nearly &pound;1 million of funding from our global conflict prevention fund has been allocated to support projects aimed at promoting security sector reform. We are also committed to continued and enhanced support for Palestinian civil policing, through the EU Co-ordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support. We stand willing to assist with Legislative Council elections in January if requested by the Palestinians and we have already agreed to fund the supply of the ballot papers.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.5/1">The National Employers Skills Survey 2004, published by the Learning and Skills Council, showed that a number of sectors have difficulties finding skilled recruits. The number of skill shortage vacancies was particularly high among employers falling within the following sector skills councils: Lantra (environmental and land-based industries); Automotive (retail motor industry); Construction Skills (development and maintenance of the built environment) and Summit Skills (building services engineering). However, employers did not specify exactly which technical and practical skills are lacking. The 2005 survey, to be published in early 2006, has asked employers to give details of the particular technical and practical skills which are in short supply. Sector skills councils have been charged with setting out the actions needed to secure the right flow of skills to meet their industry requirements, and are working closely with the Department for Education and Skills and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, in the design and development of educational and training programmes, such as the young apprenticeship programme and the new specialised diplomas qualifications. Sector skills councils are also looking to develop national skills academies; these national centres of excellence which will work in partnership with the public education sector to deliver high quality, responsive learning for young people and adults.</p>
