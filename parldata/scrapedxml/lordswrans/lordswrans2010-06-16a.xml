	<p pid="a.118.0/1">Under the European medicines legislative framework manufactured medicines placed on the market require an appropriate product licence. Directive 2004/24/EC had the effect of confirming that this requirement applied fully to herbal medicines once the transitional period under the directive expires on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April 2011</phrase>. For these products, either a marketing authorisation or a traditional herbal registration will be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">The option exists for European Union member states to create regulatory arrangements under Article 5.1 of directive 2001/83/EC for those designated as authorised healthcare professionals to commission an unlicensed manufactured medicine to meet the special needs of an individual patient on the professional responsibility of the clinician. However, herbal practitioners are currently not subject to systematic professional regulation. In 2009, the department, along with devolved health departments, consulted on the regulation of practitioners of herbal medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine. Once we have considered the consultation responses we will make clear how we intend to proceed, including as to the possibility of creating a scheme under Article 5.1 for herbal practitioners.</p>

A further &#163;0.52 billion will be saved by stopping low value spend. As the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said in his announcement of the &#163;6.2 billion savings, &quot;we want to protect the key front-line services which people depend upon ...&quot; For example, money allocated to individual school budgets, to local authorities for Sure Start, and funding for core 16-19 participation will be protected from any in year spending cuts. The Government will also remove the ring fences around over &#163;1.7 billion of grants to local authorities in 2010-11, to give them greater flexibility to re-shape their budgets and find savings in the areas set out above, while maintaining the quality of services to their customers.

This will consider payments on account made, claims to be billed and whether for example the provider will be continuing to conclude cases for existing clients. One reason that LSC funding arrangements aim to reconcile claims against payments is to ensure that public funds are protected.</p>

All school admission arrangements have to comply with the statutory requirements of the school admissions code and related legislation. This ensures that all school places are awarded in a fair and open way. Schools that are their own admission authority will continue to be able to set their own admission arrangements and must ensure that they are compliant with the code. Many faith schools already admit children that are of another, or of no faith, helping ensure that their intake reflects the diversity of these communities. To support our new expansion of the academies programme we have made it clear that existing faith schools that convert to become academies will retain the ability to set their own admissions criteria and may continue to use faith based criteria in line with the admissions code.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/3">We fully understand how important it is for schools to have and express their own distinct ethos. This is why the admissions code allows all schools to include in their admission arrangements a factual statement about their ethos. However, this is just one way for a school to communicate its ethos; schools are also free to develop and underline their ethos through their curriculum, assemblies and daily acts of collective worship.</p>
