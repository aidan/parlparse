To meet the aim of deploying injectable badger vaccines in a way which supports the long-term goal of oral vaccination, resources need to be concentrated on vaccinating as many badgers as possible. Carrying out diagnostic work would be expensive and would divert resources away from badger vaccination. This would not demonstrate a practical long-term method for vaccination.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.0/1">The European common fisheries policy (CFP) will be reformed by the end of 2012. The European Commission published a Green Paper on reform to the CFP and presented this to the Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-23">23 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/2">The UK Government welcome the Green Paper's call for fundamental reform and much of its analysis of the problems with Community fish stocks. However, the solution is not to withdraw from the CFP&mdash;fish stocks moving across Community waters require a common approach&mdash;but to build on and improve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/3">The UK is considering its response to the Green Paper, but we need a reformed CFP to focus more effectively on achieving sustainable fisheries and to devolve appropriate powers and responsibilities to those involved in the industry. We need more emphasis on long-term planning supported by robust science and better integrated fisheries and marine conservation policies, and to tackle the waste of dead fish being thrown back in the sea while enabling fishermen to land more fish while catching less.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.3/1">The White Paper <I>Communities in </I><I>C</I><I>ontrol </I>was published in July 2008. The overall aim is to pass power into the hands of local communities, to generate vibrant local democracy in every part of the country and to give real control over local decisions and services to a wider pool of active citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.3/2">These reforms require widespread changes in policy and practice by the whole range of public sector agencies, and most do not require legislation. For those proposals where legislation is required, the major provisions are included in the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill, which is currently before Parliament. They include the proposed new duty on local authorities to promote democracy, measures to boost the role of petitions in local democracy, an extended duty on public authorities to secure the involvement of persons in their functions, steps to strengthen local authority overview and scrutiny procedures, provisions on local freedoms and honorary titles, and changes to Widdicombe rules on politically restricted posts in local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.3/3">Given the scope of this Session's Bill, we have decided not to publish further draft provisions on empowerment for pre-legislative scrutiny during the current Session. We will discuss with key stakeholders how best to take forward any remaining proposals where legislation may be required. In particular, we will consider our response to a recent consultation on <I>Changing Council Governance Arrangements, </I>which raised issues on elected mayors, and will discuss with the National Association of Local Councils how best to take forward proposed reforms to parish governance. We do not currently propose to take forward a number of more minor proposals, namely on remote attendance and voting by councillors, payments for councillors on loss of office, and incentives to vote in local elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.5/1">The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced an investigation into the collapse of the Bernard Madoff (Madoff) investment scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-08">8 January 2009</phrase>. This was in response to widespread public concern in the UK about Madoff's UK operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/2">The SFO investigation is looking at all aspects of the affair as they touch on the UK, but does not contemplate a prosecution of Madoff in the UK. There are sound legal and public policy grounds for this, which I set out below.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/3">For a prosecution to be brought in this country, it would have to be shown that an offence had been committed over which the UK courts had jurisdiction. It may be that by causing intermediaries to solicit investment in the investment scheme, Madoff has committed fraud in the UK. It is likely that by moving money invested with him via the accounts of Madoff Securities International Ltd (MSIL) in London, he has committed the offence of money-laundering. It would, however, be a bar to prosecution if Madoff could show that he had already been convicted of offences covering the same alleged conduct (this is the legal doctrine of &quot;autrefois convict&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/4">Madoff pleaded guilty to an indictment containing 11 counts in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-12">12 March 2009</phrase>. The indictment to which he pleaded included charges of money-laundering, fraud and perjury. It is almost certain that any conduct that might give rise to criminal liability in the UK is covered by the offences to which Madoff has pleaded guilty in the US. Accordingly, there could be no prosecution in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/5">There are good public interest reasons not to conduct separate proceedings in this country. As a result of his guilty pleas, Madoff's bail was revoked and it is widely anticipated that he will receive a sentence that will mean he spends the rest of his life in prison. In those circumstances it is difficult to see what purpose a UK prosecution would serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/6">Of course, one of the principal concerns for investors will be the payment of restitution. The US Criminal Court will administer property forfeited by Madoff for the benefit of all investors. This process will work in tandem with the compensation scheme administered by the Securities Investments Protection Corporation, which reimburses losses up to $500,000 to those with named accounts with Madoff.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/7">The SFO investigation is focusing on the activities of MSIL, and is playing a significant role in helping investors to understand how the fraud operated.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/8">The SFO is anxious that the interests of investors in the UK are taken into account, and is taking active steps to trace and preserve assets falling under the jurisdiction of the UK courts so that they can be returned to investors.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/2">Factors that can affect the funding profile for member states include the changing status of convergence regions, changes to rates of voluntary and compulsory modulation and ad hoc changes to budgetary allocations (an example of this is the Spanish allocation as set out below).</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">In the case of the United Kingdom, the doubling of the allocation from 2007 to 2008 is due to the inclusion of voluntary modulation from 2008. Prior to this, voluntary modulation was not included in the UK allocation details.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/4">For Spain, the reason there is a fourfold increase from 2007 to 2008 is that a number of the Spanish regional programmes (Andalucia, Aragon, the Balearics, Asturias, Comunidad Valenciana, Rioja and the Canary Islands) were approved in 2008 not 2007. Approval was given for the 2007 allocations to be transferred to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/5">For Belgium, the declining profile is due to the reduction in convergence funding. The Belgium region of Hainault is a convergence phasing-out region.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.2/1">To answer would require the examination of individual cases and would therefore incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/2">Paragraph 287 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395) requires that an applicant for indefinite leave to remain by the spouse of a person present and settled in the UK is still the spouse of the person he or she was admitted or granted an extension of stay to join, that the marriage is subsisting, and that each of the parties intends to live permanently with the other as his or her spouse.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">Paragraph 289A of the Immigration Rules relates to victims of domestic violence, and states that a spouse who was previously granted a probationary period and who is able to produce such evidence as may be required by the Secretary of State to establish that the relationship was caused to break down permanently before the end of that period as a result of domestic violence may, subject to meeting the other requirements of the rule, be granted indefinite leave to remain.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.5/2">The UK has a vision for the marine environment to achieve &quot;clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse seas&quot;, and reducing pollution to the marine environment is an essential component of achieving this vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/3">Pollution enters the marine environment mainly from land-based sources such as industry, agriculture, power generation, transport and households, but also from shipping, and offshore industries. In the UK and those countries bordering the north-east Atlantic Ocean that are members of the European Community (EC), pollution is generally well controlled, particularly through the requirements of various EC directives (for example, the water framework directive, the integrated pollution prevention and control directive and the marketing and use directive), which set risk-based limits and thresholds designed to protect the receiving waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/4">The Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have a number of countries not subject to EC requirements, some of which may be less advanced in pollution control practices and standards. This will be a key reason why Sweden is targeting these seas within its proposal.</p>
