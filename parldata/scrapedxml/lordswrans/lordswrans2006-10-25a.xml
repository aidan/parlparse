	<p pid="a.238.5/1">Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 did not begin to take place in departments until after equality schemes approved by the Equality Commission were in place, around mid-2001. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06 in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure there were nine equality-related consultations undertaken. (Listed in table below with number of responses received for each).</p>
	<p pid="a.238.5/2">For each consultation we consult with groups and individuals who have requested that they be included in our Section 75 consultation list (a copy of which has been placed in the Library), which was established as part of our equality scheme for these purposes. This list is updated continuously, but at least every year. Backdated lists are not kept.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.5/3">In addition to equality-related consultations, the department consults with key stakeholders as part of good policy-making practices generally, and because one must consult on legislation even where no adverse equality impacts have been identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.5/4">With regard to the noble Lord's second Question, the information on what extent and what form consultation responses addressed equality of opportunity issues could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, for every equality-related consultation issued, policy makers record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses received is published (usually on the department's website). All of this information is publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.5/5">It is difficult to identify specific changes that have occurred to a policy as a result of consultation alone. This is because, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development cycle&mdash;through, for example, pre-consultation or informal consultation&mdash;there will be no negative equality impacts evident.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.0/1">Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 began after equality schemes were approved by the Equality Commission in 2001. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, in the Department of Finance and Personnel there were approximately 26 equality-related consultations and a list of these can be found in the following table. The noble Lord may also wish to refer to the department's website at <a href="http://www.dfpni.gov.uk/index/about-us/publications">www.dfpni.gov.uk/index/about-us/publications</a> where the department's statutory five-year review of its equality scheme and the department's annual reviews to the Equality Commission are publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/2">For each consultation the department consults with groups and individuals who have requested that they be included. The Department of Finance and Personnel Section 75 consultee database was established as part of the department's equality scheme for these purposes. This database is updated on a regular basis in consultation with those Section 75 groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/3">In relation to whether and how groups respond to consultation, this information is not readily available in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the noble Lord may wish to note that for every equality-related consultation issued, officials record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses is published (usually on the department's website).</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/4">In relation to policy changes arising from consultation, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development process, there may be no changes to the policy per se at a later stage following consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.247.0/1">The Equality Commission formally approved the Departments Equality Scheme in March 2001. Since then, the department has formally consulted on 14 equality impact assessments as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/2">Provision of relevant, accurate and timely information and advice about Social Security benefits.Private Sector Housing Grants.Accommodation for Travellers.Unauthorised Encampments.District Council's Community Support Programme.Child Support Northern Ireland Field Operations.41 Compact between Government and Voluntary and Community Sector.Urban Regeneration&mdash;Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy.Urban Regeneration&mdash;Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy for Belfast.Urban Regeneration&mdash;Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy for other Regional Towns and Cities.Urban Regeneration&mdash;Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy for the North West.Uptake of Social Security Benefits.Customer Service (access to Social Security Benefits).Town/City centre reinvigoration.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/3">The department consults a variety of groups and individuals who have requested that they be included in our Equality Consultee Mailing List. The list is available on the department's website at <a href="http://www.dsdni.gov.uk">www.dsdni.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/4">In relation to whether and how groups respond to consultation, this information is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, for every equality-related consultation issued, policy makers record to whom consultation documents are issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses and more lately an analysis of these are published at the end of each individual consultation exercise. Information on the department's annual progress report to the Equality Commission and the five-year review of the equality scheme is available on the website at <a href="http://www.dsdni.gov.uk">www.dsdni.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/5">In relation to policy changes, consultation is just one stage in the equality impact-assessment process. When equality is effectively mainstreamed into decision-making from the outset of the policy development process, it is very difficult to attribute specific developments or changes to any particular aspect of the policy development process.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.6/1">The Firelink contract was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March 2006</phrase> and extended to include Scotland and Wales in June. After completion of detailed implementation plans by the contractor, infrastructure work is expected to commence in the first region&mdash;the south-west&mdash;before the end of 2006. Firelink will then be rolled out on a regional basis over a two and half year period. As fire vehicles are converted to Firelink they will be able to use the system for voice communications. Once FiReControl is in place in a region there will be an ordered transition by each fire and rescue service to the fully integrated system.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.6/2">On FiReControl the construction of the first four regional control centres (RCCs) is well under way with contracts let for four others. Procurement of the London RCC site is in progress. Over the coming months we expect to appoint the prime contractor to deliver the IT solution and the first local-authority controlled companies that will manage RCCs to be established. A draft of the full business case will be published in October and we will publish another version in the new year after contracts are signed with the IT suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.2/1">In line with the Civil Service Code the Cabinet Office has in place a process that enables members of staff to raise in confidence any issues of concern. That process extends to include concerns about matters of financial reporting, disclosure of other information or value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/2">The Cabinet Office has a fraud and negligence policy that is clearly communicated to all staff and includes details of how to report concerns. The main point of reporting is the &quot;central contact&quot; that is located in the financial management division.

	<p pid="a.249.2/6" class="indent">&quot;16. If you have a concern, you should start by talking to your line manager or someone else in your line management chain.

If you become aware of actions by others which you believe conflict with this Code you should report this to your line manager or someone else in your line management chain; alternatively you may wish to seek advice from your nominated officer. You should report evidence of criminal or unlawful activity to the police or other appropriate authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/8" class="indent">&quot;18. If you have raised a matter covered in paragraphs 15 to 17, in accordance with the relevant procedures, and do not receive what you consider to be a reasonable response, you may report the matter to the Civil Service Commissioners&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.5/1">The effectiveness of a school is judged by Ofsted on a common grading scale. Grade 1 is outstanding, grade 2 good, grade 3 satisfactory and grade 4 inadequate. Grade 4 inadequate is divided into two categories; schools requiring special measures and schools requiring significant improvement. In both categories a school would be judged not to be providing an acceptable standard of education. Placing a school in one or other category requires further consideration of whether the capacity for improvement is demonstrated by the school. If it is, a school may be judged to require significant improvement and if not the school may be placed in special measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/2">Ofsted's most recent published information sets out the total numbers of schools in each category as of <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.253.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-19">19 September 2006</phrase>, the South Eastern Education and Library Board (SEELB) published Development Proposal No. 178 for the closure of Groomsport Primary School with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-31">31 August 2007</phrase> or as soon as possible thereafter. The publication of the development proposal initiates a two-month statutory consultation period during which representations in support of or against the proposal can be made to the Department of Education. The two-month consultation period ends on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-20">20 November 2006</phrase>. Following the consultation period, the minister with responsibility for education will make a decision on the development proposal in light of all the information provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/2">Prior to the publication of the development proposal, the SEELB carried out its statutory requirement to consult with the school's board of governors, parents and teachers as well as consulting with all schools likely to be affected by the proposal. In addition, the commissioners appointed by the Department of Education to carry out the SEELB's functions, met with a delegation from Groomsport Primary School to hear directly their views and concerns on the proposed school closure.</p>
