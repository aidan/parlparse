	<p pid="a.282.0/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised that it holds information on the number of embryos used in licensed research projects. These projects often have several objectives; the HFEA does not hold information on the number of embryos used for each objective. The purpose of deriving human embryonic stem cells is recorded on HFEA research licences. The HFEA has issued a General Direction 0002 requiring centres to maintain a record, in any format, of the total number of embryos created, used or disposed of during a project of research.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/2">The HFEA has advised that it will take a significant amount of time to compile the information requested by the noble Lord, relating to number of embryos used under each research licence for the purpose of deriving embryonic stem cells. Therefore, I have asked the authority's chief executive to endeavour to complete this work within 20 working days and I will write to the noble Lord as soon as I receive the information and place a copy of my letter in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/3">The HFEA has advised that the intended aim of deriving stem cells from embryos created using the nuclei from a patient with type 1 diabetes in research licence R0152 was to improve treatment of this disease. The authority's Licence Committee decided, in March 2005, that this objective falls under the following research purpose, as set out in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001: Regulation 2(2)(c), &quot;enabling any such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease<I>&quot;</I>. The use of embryos created by somatic cell nuclear transfer for treatment purposes is unlawful in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.0/4">The HFEA has advised that it has not authorised the use of cells obtained from children in licensed research project number R0152.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.0/1">The UK's nuclear regulators (the HSE and the Environment Agency) have assured me that, as they have previously stated, June 2011 will mark the end of their assessment of the safety and environmental submissions for the designs currently undergoing generic design assessment (GDA).</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/2">If, at that point, the regulators are satisfied with the design safety case and environmental submission provided by the GDA requesting parties, then they will issue an HSE design acceptance confirmation (DAC) and an Environment Agency statement of design acceptability (SoDA) and call a formal end to the overall GDA process.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/3">If, however, there remain a number of significant unresolved issues that the regulators were confident could be resolved, then they may decide to provide an interim DAC or SoDA. In this case, resolution plans for such issues would need to have been developed by the requesting parties and agreed with the regulators. Once all the issues contained within these resolution plans had been addressed to the satisfaction of the regulators, then the overall GDA process would be brought to an end. The timing of this would depend upon the number and substance of any remaining issues together with industry's work to implement any resolution plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/4">The change to this process, which is based on resolving concerns raised in discussions between the regulators and stakeholders, is designed to add further clarity and certainty to the overall site licensing and permitting processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/5">Further guidance on the management of GDA outcomes has recently been published by the regulators and can be found on the internet at: <a href="http://www.hse">http://www.hse</a>. gov.uk/newreactors/reports/management-gda-outcomes.pdf.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.3/13">At present, there are few analyses comparing risk-adjusted outcomes of patients transplanted in the United Kingdom with those in continental Europe and the United States. One study (Dawwas et al, Gut 2007) found that risk-adjusted survival at one year was higher in the UK and Ireland than in the US for adults with chronic liver disease but there was no difference in those with acute liver failure. Smaller and informal comparisons suggest that risk-adjusted outcomes are certainly no worse in the UK compared with other countries.</p>
