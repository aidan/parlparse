It would not be practical for an additional &quot;family liaison officer&quot; to intervene in the many different locations, with the many support staff already working to support the families.</p>

In addition, individual service men and women will have been referred by their unit's primary care provider to other NHS hospitals, or an individual might have been admitted as a result of accident or illness without reference to their parent unit. The numbers of individuals falling into these categories is not recorded centrally and could be established only at wholly disproportionate cost by examining the personal medical file of every service man and woman, which would additionally require the permission of all individuals. From previous work, it is estimated that there might be around a further 15 to 25 service personnel as in-patients in NHS hospitals on a typical day, in addition to those in the MDHU and RCDM hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.2/1">Information on mental health conditions suffered by personnelwho served in Bosnia, the 1990-91 Gulf conflictand the Falklands conflict is not held centrally. Comprehensive figures on the number of personnel who served in the conflicts in question and who have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could be compiled only by examining their individual medical records. For those who have left the Armed Forces, this would also need to include their NHS records because upon leaving the Armed Forces, or on demobilisation for reservists, it is the long-established practice that responsibility for medical care passes to the NHS. This has been the case since 1948 under successive Governments. A patient's medical records can only be viewed for non-clinical reasons with the express consent of the individual concerned, to protect patient confidentiality. Therefore, the information exists but is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.3/2">The new personal identifiers provisions will apply to proxy votes. The elector who appoints the proxy will have to supply their date of birth and signature when applying for a proxy vote, and they can be checked by the electoral registration officer (ERO) against any previously provided by the elector to the ERO or local authority.A person appointed as proxy who wishes to vote by post will&mdash;like other postal voters&mdash;be required to provide their date of birth and signature when they apply for a postal vote and, at elections, they will have to provide them on the postal voting statement, and if the personal identifiers do not match this may lead to the vote being invalid.Persons appointed as a proxy who vote in person at a polling station will have to sign for their ballot paper, like all other polling station voters. These signatures will be kept after the election and may be scrutinized if there is a police investigation into alleged fraud or an election petition.There is a new offence of falsely applying for a postal or proxy vote. This new offence was brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-11">11 September 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN, which replaced the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy&mdash;COMA&mdash;in 2001) concluded in 2003 that COMA's advice on trans-fatty acids (TFAs) was still current and that a further risk assessment of TFAs in its 2004-05 work programme was not warranted. TFAs were not therefore singled out for specific action.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2">The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out a risk assessment on TFAs in 2004 and concluded that they raise blood cholesterol levels, thereby increasing the risk of coronary heart disease. These findings were in keeping with COMA's 1994 conclusions. EFSA further noted that evidence from human intervention trials, strengthened by findings from epidemiological studies, supports the idea that the effect of TFAs on heart health may be greater than that of saturated fats. However, in line with SACN opinion, EFSA states that given current intake levels of TFAs, their potential to significantly increase cardiovascular risk is much lower than saturated fatty acids which are currently consumed in excess of dietary recommendations in many European countries.</p>

Previous analysis by the IFS suggests that the 1997 tax and benefit system had over 300,000 working parents with an MDR over 90 per cent. Their more recent analysis suggeststhat the number of working adults with MDRs over 90 per cent is now 160,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is currently holding discussions with the proposed receiving bodies, prior to consultation, with a view to determining what the advantages and disadvantages of a transfer would be in each case. A full public consultation will be held early next year. Allowing for the statutory 12-week consultation period, decisions will be taken by the middle of 2007, when a summary of consultation responses will be published on the Defra website.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.5/1">The Government do not have any powers to direct the courts or citizens advice bureaux to prioritise different kinds of bills. For people on benefit who have run up arrears, the Department of Work and Pensions' third party deduction scheme makes statutory provision for an amount to be diverted from benefit direct to creditors for specified items of household expenses, including water costs. However, bills for other items mentioned by the noble Baroness are not included in the scheme and advisory bodies such as the citizens advice bureaux are aware of this.</p>
