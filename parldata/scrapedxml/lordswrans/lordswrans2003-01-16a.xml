This includes the provision of signs indicating the location of bridges and their specifications, particularly height. Network Rail investigates all reported incidents as quickly as possible and is trialling new electronic systems to reduce the response time and the amount of delays to services. Its prime objective is to ensure that railway safety has not been compromised. Delays to trains may occur until necessary checks and any required remedial works have been carried out.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-14">14 January</phrase> my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary chaired a meeting in London attended by representatives of the Quartet and Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. We are grateful that they were able to attend and contribute. They were joined through a video link by Palestinian Authority Ministers and civil society representatives, as the Israeli Government had unacceptably denied permission for them to travel to London. This arrangement was no substitute for a face to face conference, but we believe the meeting to have been constructive and wide ranging. It will support and complement the efforts of the Quartet on the road map towards a two-state settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/2">Palestinian reform is only one part of the work required to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, but it is an important part. It is clear that the Palestinians are committed to the reform of their institutions and have already started that process. But there remains much to be done, and they need support and encouragement. At the meeting they repeated their condemnation of violence against civilians as a means of achieving Palestinian ends and briefed us on their plans for a new Palestinian constitution, political, economic and administrative reform and the creation of a Palestinian state.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/3">This is an objective the whole international community shares. The next step will be meetings in London in early February of the Taskforce on Palestinian Reform and of Quartet envoys. It will take action from all sides, including Israel, to maintain momentum and implement the roadmap.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/4">Her Majesty's Government urged the leaders of all sides to demonstrate the courage necessary to realise their obligations towards one another and turn that realisation into a genuine process of negotiation.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/5">The Foreign Secretary has placed a summary of his understanding of the proceedings and outcomes from the meeting in the Library of the House. The key elements were:</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/6" class="indent">An agreement that we need practical action to begin implementing the clear Palestinian declaration against violence and terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/7" class="indent">A new Palestinian commitment to work on constitution. We expect an agreed outline by the end of this month and have promised to support their work on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/8" class="indent">A clear commitment to finalising preparations for free, fair and open elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.8/1">The House of Lords Refreshment Department purchases from a wide range of suppliers and, when appropriate, purchases fairtrade products. The department currently purchases fairtrade bananas and mangoes on an occasional basis. There is, however, no policy to favour the purchase of fairtrade products. Fairtrade coffee was supplied in the peers' guest room for a trial period in 1998 but was withdrawn from sale after poor take-up.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.2/1">Today sees the launch of the first ever science and technology strategy for the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/2">Science and technology have been important tools in the fight against crime for many years. However, as criminals become more technologically aware, so it becomes vital that the police service is not only properly equipped to combat this new strain of criminals but also that the tools they use are as effective and efficient as possible. From early on in the police reform process the major stakeholders in policing identified the need for an overarching strategy for the police use of science and technology&mdash;a commitment which was made in the police reform White Paper: Policing a New Century: A Blue Print for Reform. <sup>1</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/3">We established the police science and technology strategy group to bring together the key stakeholders and commissioned them to identify and prioritise the police's requirements for science and technology. This work has formed the basis of the overarching strategy that we are launching today.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/4">The purpose of the S&amp;T strategy is to ensure the police service is equipped to exploit the opportunities in science and technology to deliver effective policing as part of a modern and respected criminal justice system. To achieve this, the strategy identifies three key aims: to establish priorities for current and future science and technology applications and research; to co-ordinate the development and implementation of technology between users and suppliers to ensure a coherent and effective process; and to implement processes for future scanning to ensure that the police service can exploit new technology at the earliest opportunity and is prepared for new technology-based threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/5">These activities will support the delivery of national priorities for policing as identified in the national policing plan. This strategy will inform local planning as forces, police authorities and key providers draw up their individual plans for the use of science and technology. Hence, the role of this strategy is not to usurp or replace individual plans and strategies but to provide a framework for their successful development. This provides the opportunity for a more co-ordinated approach in those areas where that is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/6">An important first step in this new process was the identification of the capabilities which science and technology can enhance to deliver more effective policing. The most important of these have already been outlined in the national policing plan: the effective use of intelligence gathering technology, secure exchange of data and mobile data input and retrieval, effective management of investigation and case handling, and maximising the value of evidence including the use of DNA.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/7">The process of prioritising, improving co-ordination and scanning for future threats and opportunities is not a static one but will be developed and improved upon over the coming year. This strategy sets out how this process will be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/8">Despite being very different in their roles and status, the Forensic Science Service, Police Information Technology Organisation and Police Scientific Development Branch will all play important roles in delivering the strategy. The strategy, along with the priorities it has identified, will provide the framework for their individual plans for 2003&ndash;04 and beyond to ensure a more co-ordinated approach to meeting the science and technology needs of the police service.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/9">This first overarching strategy, developed with both the key stakeholders and independent experts, marks a significant step but is not the culmination of our work. The next and perhaps most important step is that of implementation. This, with our partners in the police science and technology strategy group, will be our main focus for the year ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">The DNA expansion programme is a major government initiative that has been developed to enable the police to make maximum benefit of DNA in tackling crime. Home Office funding has been made available to enable the police to take DNA samples from all people cautioned or charged with a recordable offence and from as many crime scenes as possible. The database has already played a leading role in solving a large number of crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/2">A number of prisoners and mentally disordered offenders do not have DNA on the database as they were convicted before the DNA expansion programme enabled every offender to be DNA sampled. An exercise is now under way to identify those offenders without DNA on the database and to ensure that a sample is taken before they are released from prison or hospital. This prisoner DNA sampling programme is being run under the auspices of the existing DNA expansion programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/3">A dedicated programme management team has been recruited and is developing plans to ensure that the majority of those without DNA profiles on the database do provide them by summer 2003. Centrally managed but regionally based teams of police officers working in close co-operation with prison and mental health establishments will ensure a speedy completion of the exercise with minimal impact on the estabishments involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/4">The exercise will underpin the Home Office aims of reducing crime, increasing the efficiency of crime investigation and increasing successful prosecutions. If known offenders can be linked to their offences more often and more quickly, then we will be able to detect and deter more crime in the future and also improve victim reassurance and so contribute to reduction of the fear of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/5">The prisoner DNA sampling programme and the broader DNA expansion programme are clear examples of the use of science and technology to reduce crime and improve the effectiveness of the police. In the national policing plan, published recently, we state our commitment to ensure that the DNA database covers all known active offenders by 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.3/1">Treatment with Enbrel and Remicade has been available to patients in Northern Ireland since November 1999. In recognition of the high cost of these and other specialist drugs, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland made an extra &pound;3 million available in the June 2002 monitoring round. It is for each health and social services board individually to determine how best to deploy these funds to meet local need. Specific proposals to reduce the waiting lists for biologic therapies are currently being considered by the boards.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/2">In England and Wales we do not hold information centrally about drugs prescribed and dispensed in hospitals, which is where Enbrel and Remicade are supplied. Therefore, we cannot provide information on how widely available this treatment is to National Health Service patients. However, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence issued guidance on these drugs in March 2002. It recommended that consultant rheumatologists, or consultant paediatric rheumatologists in the case of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, should prescribe these drugs in accordance with the guidelines set out by the British Society for Rheumatology or British Paediatric Rheumatology Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/3">We have issued directions obliging health authorities and primary care trusts to provide appropriate funding for recommended treatments. This is in line with our manifesto commitment to ensure that patients receive drugs and treatments recommended by NICE on the NHS if deemed appropriate by their clinicians. The NHS has three months from the date of publication of each technology appraisal guidance to provide funding so that clinical decisions made by doctors involving NICE recommended treatments or drugs can be implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 provides that the creation of human embryos outside the body and the use of those embryos can only take place under the conditions of a licence issued by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. The authority would not issue a licence for embryos to be created for subsequent sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/2">It is essential that couples who are considering donating their embryos for research should receive proper counselling. It is appropriate for research institutions to support fertility clinics to provide that counselling in order to ensure that patients are able to make a fully informed choice about whether to donate their embryos for research, and to enable those donations to take place if the patients so wish. In line with this, the Medical Research Council (MRC) is to make funding available to clinics to employ nurse co-ordinators who will ensure that the donor couple are fully informed and able to make such choices of their own free will, and also to liaise with researchers to inform them if embryos become available. The MRC is not offering financial or other inducements in exchange for human embryos.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.2/1">It is impossible at this distance of time to reconstruct the complex series of events in this case so as to identify with any degree of accuracy how many instances of human error occurred in relation to disclosure. I can however say that no one has been disciplined as a consequence of any such error. This is because any errors were made in good faith and did not constitute misconduct. Moreover, in so far as the question suggests that errors affecting disclosure occurred on appeal, it is incorrect; the errors occurred at the pre-trial or trial stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">I refer the noble Lord to the decision of the Court of Appeal, which expressed itself entirely satisfied about five things. First, prosecuting counsel had access to everything they wanted to see and examined all relevant or potentially material matter in accordance with the relevant legal tests. Secondly, the trial judge was correct to rule as he did in relation to the disclosure and non-disclosure of the matter before him. Thirdly, no one attempted to conceal from the Court of Appeal any relevant or potentially material matter. Fourthly, public interest immunity was rightly claimed in relation to matters which the court saw, because it affected national security at the highest level and would, if disclosed, present a clear and immediate threat to life. Fifthly, apart from two matters, there was nothing of significance before the Court of Appeal which was not before the trial judge.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/3">Having ordered disclosure of those two matters to the appellants in a suitable form and having heard submissions in relation to them, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that no injustice was done to the appellants by not having access to them at trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/4">The two matters which the court ordered should be disclosed were further information prior to the bombings suggesting that a terrorist organisation unconnected to the appellants may have been contemplating an attack on the Israeli embassy and an explanation as to the circumstances in which a document was not shown to counsel and a later document was not shown to the trial judge. As to the information, the court was satisfied that this would have had no impact on the trial. As to the documents, the court accepted the explanation put forward and said that this explanation disposed of any sinister implication.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.3/1">Smallpox vaccine was administered routinely to UK civilians of school age until the mid-1970s. Armed Forces personnel were also vaccinated upon enlistment and routinely re-vaccinated every three years. This programme was abandoned in the early 1980s following a declaration by the World Health Organisation that smallpox had been eradicated. Smallpox vaccine can produce mild adverse reactions common to many vaccines, including a sore arm, mild fever, headache, fatigue and a permanent scar at the vaccination site. In a very small proportion of people, vaccination against smallpox can produce more serious adverse reactions including serious skin reactions and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Records of adverse reactions to smallpox vaccine among Armed Forces personnel from that era were not kept centrally and the information requested could only be provided at disproportionate effort. Smallpox vaccine was not given to UK Armed Forces personnel during the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict. We are confident that none of the vaccines given to UK Armed Forces personnel at the time of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict would have produced serious adverse reactions similar to those than can arise from smallpox vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/2">We announced our intention to vaccinate a small cohort of Armed Forces personnel against smallpox. I refer the noble Lord to the Answer I gave to my noble friend Lady Goudie on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-02">2 December 2002</phrase>,WA 73&ndash;74. UK Armed Forces personnel offered smallpox vaccine will be rigorously screened so as to eliminate, as far as possible, the risk of a serious adverse reaction. Smallpox vaccine would not be administered alongside other vaccines except in an emergency.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">I believe my noble friend refers to Mr Douglas Robertson and his award of war pension by the Veterans Agency and I have answered this Question accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/2">The overwhelming consensus of medical and scientific opinion is that there is no evidence to support the existence of a discrete medical disorder called &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot;. Accordingly, this term is not used as a diagnostic label in respect of awards of war pension. However, this does not prevent Gulf veterans who are ill from getting a war pension. A war pension can be paid for any disablement provided a causal link to service is accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/3">The Veterans Agency noted that Mr Robertson's GP used the term &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; to describe his medical condition. However, this label did not influence the outcome of his claim for a war pension. In accordance with standard practice the decision to award a war pension was based on case specific facts, the relevant standard of proof and contemporary medical understanding.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.5/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary said yesterday that he would report further to the House, when he was able to do so, about the operation in Greater Manchester on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-14">14 January</phrase> in which a police officer, DC Stephen Oake, died.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/2">The basic facts about this incident have not been confirmed by Greater Manchester Police. In the late afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-14">Tuesday 14 January</phrase>, two immigration officers, with the support of Greater Manchester Police, entered premises in Crumpsall Lane, Manchester, for the purpose of detaining, pending deportation, an individual whom the Home Secretary had certified earlier in the day under the provisions of Part IV of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001. In addition, the officers of Greater Manchester Police had obtained a warrant to search the premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/3">Three men present at the premises were detained. Nine Tactical Aid Unit officers, who had entered the premises, assisted in securing these men and in making the scene safe. All these officers were wearing full protective equipment, including body armour, and remained in the premises. Fourteen Special Branch officers were there to undertake aspects of the operation involving investigation and intelligence gathering. These officers were not wearing body armour.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/4">The exact detail of what took place is still under investigation and will be the subject of an inquiry. But, as is already known, it is clear that a violent incident occurred during which DC Oake was fatally stabbed. Three other officers were stabbed and a fourth officer sustained a broken ankle. One of these officers remains in hospital, suffering from stab wounds to the abdomen. His condition is stable and he is likely to leave hospital next week. The other three officers have now been released from hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/5">Following the struggle, the situation was brought under control by the police and all three men were arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Subsequently, one man was released from these provisions and immediately detained by the Immigration Service. He is currently detained in prison under Part IV of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act. The second man has also been released from the provisions of the Terrorism Act and remains in the custody of Greater Manchester Police pending investigation into the death of DC Oake and injuries to the other officers. The third man remains detained under the Terrorism Act and is now in the custody of the Metropolitan Police.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/6">Armed response vehicle resources were available throughout the operation for immediate deployment as required, but firearms officers were not deployed in specific support of this operation. The inquiry will obviously examine this. All the Tactical Aid Unit officers who entered the building were wearing full protective equipment, including body armour.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/7">The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, Michael Todd, has, with the agreement of the Home Secretary, established an inquiry which will be led by a senior police officer from outside the Greater Manchester police force. The inquiry will be held with the support of the Immigration Service. The senior investigator from Greater Manchester Police will be a detective superintendent and, from the Immigration Service, an assistant director.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.5/8">The inquiry will concentrate on all aspects of planning, briefings, communications and implementation of the operation. The key objective will be to learn the lessons from this tragic incident, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary made clear in his oral statement to the House yesterday. The preliminary findings will be available within four weeks.</p>
