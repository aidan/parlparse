Copies were placed in the Library. The Scottish Executive has begun a parallel consultation. The main proposal is that local planning authorities should be required to consult the officially safeguarded aerodromes or NATS instead of the Civil Aviation Authority. I believe that the individual aerodromes should be better placed than a single central organisation like the CAA to monitor the development of potentially significant proposals, and that the continuing involvement and local knowledge of aerodrome managements should make it easier to reconcile development proposals with the safe operation of the aerodromes.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.3/1">Her Majesty's Government's objective is to ensure that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is seen to contribute to sustainable development, as enshrined in the founding agreement of the WTO. We do this through pressing for sustainable market access liberalisation and ensuring coherence between WTO and global environmental governance. Where necessary we seek to clarify WTO rules to support legitimate environmental regulation while ruling out unwarranted protectionism.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/2">We and our European partners are committed to launching a new trade round. A new round will strengthen the global economy and help raise living standards in developing countries. A key part of the EU's and UK's approach is that a new round must support global sustainable development. This means it must have an environmental dimension.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/3">We want to maximise the 'win-win' potential of trade liberalisation where there are positive environmental impacts. Where there are negative impacts, we are pressing to eliminate perverse subsidies which are both trade-distorting and environmentally damaging. Agriculture and fisheries are two key areas where we will pursue this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/4">We also want to see WTO rules clarified in two key areas so that legitimate environmental policy is not undermined. The interface between WTO rules and Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) must be addressed to prevent friction between two major bodies of international law. The legitimacy of voluntary environmental labelling schemes must be recognised. We take seriously the concerns of developing countries about &quot;eco-protectionism&quot; and we are working actively with our EU colleagues to ensure that these concerns are addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/5">We take part, through the EU, in the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment established by the Uruguay round and use this committee to engage in active dialogue with developing countries and others on clarifying the relationship between MEAs and WTO rules. We also take every opportunity to use appropriate bilateral meetings to press arguments in favour of ensuring that MEAs are fully reflected in the policies of the WTO.</p>

Furthermore, it appears that the existing United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already requires State Parties, which include all the participants in the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention negotiations, to criminalise all such conduct irrespective of the medium through which it is committed.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-04-02a.84.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="84"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010402/text/10402w04.htm#10402w04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.84.2/1">Health and safety considerations have been of paramount importance in the development of Airwave, the new radio communications system for the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/2">Airwave will use the Terrestrial Trunk Radio System (TETRA). This is an advanced digital technology system which will improve police effectiveness and have a positive impact on the safety of police officers' operational environment. It will do this through such features as emergency buttons on police radio handsets, more secure operation through encryption, better quality sound and by facilitating communications across police boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/3">Airwave has been designed to enable the use of terminals which comply with guidelines issued by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) on exposure to electro-magnetic fields.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/4">An issue has arisen in connection with the report of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (the Stewart Committee), commissioned by the Minister of Public Health and published in May 2000. The report is concerned with the possible health effects of mobile phones, their base stations and transmitters. In his foreword to the report, Sir William Stewart states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/5" class="indent">&quot;the balance of evidence does not suggest that mobile phone technologies put the health of the general population of the United Kingdom at risk. There is some preliminary evidence that outputs from mobile phone technologies may cause, in some cases, subtle biological effects, although, importantly, these do not necessarily mean that health is affected&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/6">The report proposes that a &quot;precautionary approach&quot; be adopted until more robust scientific information becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/7">At one point in its report, the Stewart Committee makes reference to research on the possible effects of radio frequency emissions at or near a modulation of 16Hz (cycles per second); TETRA terminals (but not base stations) operate at 17.6Hz. On this, the conclusion of the Stewart Committee (paragraph 5.59) is that:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/8" class="indent">&quot;although the weight of evidence suggests that radio frequency exposure (at around 16Hz modulation) at average levels too low to cause significant heating does increase the release of calcium from brain tissue, there are contradictory results. The suggestion that these effects occur significantly with fields that are amplitude modulated at extremely low frequencies is intriguing but difficult to interpret. Further, the finding is of no obvious relevance to mobile phone technology, where the amplitude modulation within the critical frequency band is very small. If such effects occur as a result of exposure to mobile phones, their implications for cell functions are unclear and no obvious health risk has been suggested. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, amplitude modulation around 16Hz should be avoided, if possible, in future developments in signal coding&quot;. (Calcium has a vital role in the function of neurones (nerve cells) and other cells). These conclusions are based on observations in animals and human cell tissue in the laboratory; the effect has not been observed in human beings.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/9">While no obvious health risk has been suggested by the Stewart Report, it recommended a precautionary approach and we recognise that there are concerns. Accordingly we have approached the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and the National Radiological Protection Board and they have each agreed to conduct a review of the relevant science. Also the focus of the recently announced Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme being initiated by the Government in response to the Stewart Report is on emerging technology and we anticipate that further research in areas that are directly relevant to TETRA will be supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/10">On the basis of current evidence on health and safety issues, there is no reason to delay the roll-out to police forces of the Airwave system. We will, however, keep these issues under close review, publishing the results of the research as it is concluded, or sooner if it suggests any risk, acting fully in accordance with those results.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.5/1">Following the end of the consultation period in October 2000, the Review of Crime Statistics--which aims to enhance the accuracy and consistency of crime recording and to improve the quality of statistical data--has been subject of a review by a group of experts drawn from key stakeholder organisations and academia. The group's function was to consider the continued relevance and appropriateness of the recommendations in light of the consultation. The Experts' Group report indicated its continued support for the Review of Crime Statistics recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/2">A copy of the group's conclusions is being made available on the Home Office website (<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>), and has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/3">An Implementation Group with representation from the main stakeholders, including the Association of Chief Police Officers, has been established by the Home Office, to oversee the delivery of the review's 66 recommendations over a five-year period. Its key deliverables will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/4" class="indent">More consistent recording of crimes by police forces throughout England and Wales</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/5" class="indent">The use of the Internet to collect and disseminate statistical data</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/6" class="indent">Collection of new information and better use of existing information to help explain crime trends</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/7" class="indent">Improving the machinery of government to help limit the demands of police officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/8">In July 2000, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) published its report On the Record, which also included eight recommendations relating to crime recording and associated issues. As the two pieces of work serve to support a consistent view on the subject, it has been agreed to take forward work on the HMIC recommendations within the implementation of the Review of Crime Statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.5/1">My honourable friend the then Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Spellar) in another place announced on <phrase class="date" code="1997-06-10">10 June 1997</phrase>, Official Report, col. 372W, that the Government had put in hand a programme to develop improved baton round equipment with reduced injury potential. A new baton round, designated the L21A1, is now available and has been issued to police forces in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and to the Army. The existing baton round will be withdrawn once all personnel have been trained in the use of the new round. It is planned to begin to deploy the new round on an operational basis from <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-01">1 June</phrase>. Revised guidelines for the use of baton rounds in situations of public disorder which apply in the same terms in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were issued to the police on <phrase class="date" code="1999-08-01">1 August 1999</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.5/2">Used, as it will be, with a new optical sight, the new baton round is more consistently accurate than the old, and the probability of it causing serious or life-threatening injury has been reduced. This has been verified by an independent medical assessment, a copy of which has been placed in the Library today by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence. Although there will be smaller risk of serious injury or death when the new baton round is used, that risk has not been eliminated, and the new round like the old will be used in situations of public disorder only in accordance with the existing strict guidelines. Details of use in Northern Ireland will, as now, be reported on every occasion and be copied to the Office of the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland and to the new Policing Board when it is established.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.5/3">In addition to its possible use in situations of public disorder, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) considers that the improved accuracy of the new baton round makes it suitable for use in dealing with people who are posing an immediate threat to life in circumstances in which use of a firearm would otherwise be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.5/4">The Government share the view of the ACPO and of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland that efforts should continue to find an acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternative to the plastic baton round. A research programme to that end has been embarked upon, and a document reporting the outcome of its first phase and setting out the next steps in the work programme has also been placed in the Library today by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.2/1">Last year I set up a working group, chaired by David Nissen, CB, the Solicitor to the Department of Trade &amp; Industry, to conduct a review of the arrangements for instructing advocates to prosecute cases on behalf of the Government. Following that review and consultation within government and the legal profession, new arrangements come into force today that will govern the instruction of advocates (whether barristers or solicitor-advocates) in private practice in prosecution cases for the following government departments and non-departmental public bodies: HM Customs &amp; Excise; Departments of Social Security/Health; Inland Revenue; Department of Trade &amp; Industry; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; Intervention Board; Health &amp; Safety Executive and the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/2">I will be setting up a single panel of advocates for prosecution cases divided into three lists: A, B and C according to the level of experience of the advocate. Appointments will be for three years with the possibility of further renewals, I hope to annnounce the first recruitment exercise for the new single panel in the autumn. Further details about the application and selection process will be given closer to that time. There will be annual recruitment exercises and advertisements for applications to the new panel will be published. There will be equal opportunities monitoring of the application and selection process and particular care will be taken to encourage applications from women and members of the ethnic minorities. Appointment to the panels will be open to solicitor-advocates.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/3">From today, as a transitional arrangement until the new single panel is set up, my current lists of advocates for the departments named will be operated as a single list with instructing solicitors in those departments free to instruct advocates on the other lists. Those currently on a list will be expected to apply to join the new panel in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/4">Also from today, the role of my clerk in nominating advocates from the lists for instructions/briefs, the re-allocation of returns and off-list nominations of counsel will cease. This was a considerable burden placed upon the chambers of each Attorney-General, which in these times can no longer be justified. From now on departments will be responsible for dealing directly with clerks concerning the delivery of instructions and the re-allocation of returns. Departments will be responsible for monitoring the fair spread of instructions across the lists and the equality of performance of advocates. There will be an Administrative Unit, based at HMCE, responsible for central monitoring that will report to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/5">I am confident that the new arrangements will serve prosecuting departments and NDPBs well. The system will be open and fair and will offer greater opportunities than in the past for prosecutors to do government work.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.6/1">I have today issued three directions. The first is a budget direction for the CLS, as required under Section 5 of the Access to Justice Act 1999. The budget for 2001-02 includes the following provisions:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/2" class="indent">the same budget as in 2000-01 for controlled work and new services, of &pound;232 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/3" class="indent">within that budget, &pound;5 million for the new Partnership Innovation Budget, and an increase in other support grants (from &pound;1.5 million to &pound;5 million);</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/4" class="indent">as last year, a minimum of &pound;20 million to be spent on services provided by not-for-profit bodies; and</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/5" class="indent">an increase in the budget for high-cost cases, from &pound;1 million to &pound;4.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/6">The second direction brings a number of tribunals into the scope of the CLS by allowing advocacy services to be funded. They are the VAT and Duties Tribunal; the General and Special Commissioners of Income Tax; and the Protection of Children Act Tribunal. In the first two, my decision is based on the need to provide representation where the interests of justice require it, because of the potential for the tribunals' powers to be interpreted as criminal penalties. In the third, my decision is based on the overwhelming importance to applicants of being allowed to challenge decisions to place them on the Protection of Children Act List and List 99.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/7">The third direction revises the circumstances in which cases that are normally excluded from scope can be funded. The main changes from my first direction, made in April 2000, are:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/8" class="indent">excluded cases involving the liberty of the applicant will be funded, in line with the Government's obligations under the Human Rights Act;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/9" class="indent">it will be easier to take action for professional negligence, even where the original service was provided in an area of law that is outside the CLS's normal scope;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/10" class="indent">the treatment of cases against public authorities has been revised to make it easier to bring actions for judicial review or serious wrongdoing, and to match the direction to the way the Funding Code treats equivalent work that is in scope; and</p>
	<p pid="a.101.6/11" class="indent">the treatment of mixed cases has been clarified, to restore the Government's original intention that only cases where the excluded element is minor or incidental to the main issue can be funded.</p>
