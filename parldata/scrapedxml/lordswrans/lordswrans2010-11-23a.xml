	<p pid="a.294.0/1">Due to improved measurement, prevention/detection capability and consistently raising the profile of insurance fraud both within the industry and in the public domain, the insurance industry has reported an increase in the number of fraudulent insurance claims that are being detected by insurers and through reports from the public who are increasingly playing a role in helping to identify insurance fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/2">The use of specialised software by the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB) since 2006 has helped to identify more fraudulent activity in particular areas of the industry, particularly in relation to crash for cash frauds and the involvement of professional enablers, which remains a core focus of attention for the IFB and industry in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/3">The insurance industry is an important partner of the National Fraud Authority (NFA) which co-ordinates the implementation of the National Fraud Strategy with partners in Government, law enforcement, the third sector and industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/4">As part of this, the NFA works with partners to develop improved information sharing to enable the prevention and disruption of fraudulent activity. The insurance industry is represented by the IFB on a NFA Taskforce to prevent fraud by improving the sharing of information about incidences of fraud across sectors of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/5">The IFB also shares intelligence and data with, for example, the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau-operated by the City of London Police-the Solicitors Regulation Authority and the Ministry of Justice. Since its formation, the IFB has helped the police make over 426 arrests in connection with organised insurance fraud, resulting in almost 100 convictions to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/6">Working with its membership and with the police in joint investigations, the bureau has successfully disrupted actions of criminal gangs concerning crash for cash frauds.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/7">Action Fraud, the national fraud reporting centre run by the NFA, refers individuals and businesses with concerns about insurance fraud directly to the insurance industry's confidential Cheatline, managed by the IFB.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/8">As part of the insurance industry's continued commitment to reduce fraud, the operational capacity of the Cheatline was increased in September 2010 and the improvements provide a more enhanced facility to deal with the increase in reports being made, which are complemented by online Cheatline reporting.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.2/1">The law on joint enterprise forms part of the law on secondary liability, which treats as criminal the activities of those who aid, abet, counsel or procure others to commit crimes. Where a crime is committed by two or more people, each may play a different part but if they are in it together as part of a joint plan or agreement, they are each guilty.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/2">Although the Ministry of Justice's court proceedings database holds data on the total number of convictions for offences in England and Wales, it does not hold information on whether those offences were committed as part of a joint enterprise; or whether any of the offenders convicted for their part in a joint enterprise denied wrongdoing at the time of the trial or subsequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/3">We are aware that some concerns have been raised about joint enterprise law, particularly in response to the Your Freedom consultation and in correspondence. The majority of these appear to be based on a misunderstanding of the law and have expressed concern that innocent bystanders may be convicted unfairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.2/4">A small number have been raised by the friends or families of gang members who consider that their involvement in the gang's criminal activities was not significant enough to warrant conviction for the offences in question. Ultimately, it is for the jury to decide on the scope of the joint enterprise and the mind of the parties to it in each case, taking account of all the evidence heard at the trial.</p>

It would require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions before an arrest warrant could be issued in such circumstances.

	<p pid="a.305.0/17">Catering and Retail Services (CRS) has responsibility for the provision of catering facilities to Members, their staff and guests, staff of the House and other visitors. The unique nature of the House makes an operating loss, and therefore a subsidy, unavoidable. In particular, trading in Members' dining and bar outlets is limited to the sitting periods of the House, while the other outlets trade for 46 weeks in the year on Mondays to Fridays only. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of the business of the House during sitting weeks requires a flexible catering service which involves higher levels of labour resource than industry norms. Finally, in line with many government departments and external organisations, prices in some of the catering outlets are lower than average high street levels, although many of these prices will be rising from <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.0/18">It is worth emphasising that the banqueting service and the gift shop are both profitable, which helps to lower the overall subsidy level.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.0/19">In summary, the subsidy has reduced significantly in recent years thanks to the hard work of CRS staff, and it will decrease yet further over the next two financial years.</p>

	<p pid="a.305.3/1">It is very difficult to calculate the figure requested. The most helpful method is perhaps to focus on the costs incurred on average by a new Member which would clearly not have been incurred had the Member never been appointed. The table below sets out those figures. It must be borne in mind that the average disguises a wide variation in the real costs incurred by different Members; and that the Members' reimbursement scheme figures are calculated using claims under the old system rather than the new one, which has been running for less than two months.</p>

This is an average of the figures from the last three financial years. The figure for each year was obtained by dividing the total annual net resource costs of the House by the number of Members on the last day of that financial year. It would be unwise to read too much into these figures because a large proportion of the House's costs consist of fixed overheads, such as the costs of maintaining the parliamentary estate, which do not necessarily increase when the membership increases.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.6/1">Members of the Judicial Pension Scheme make no contribution towards their personal pension benefits. However, they do pay a contribution towards the contingent pension benefits for their spouse or civil partner and any dependant children. The contribution rate for members of the 1981 scheme is 2.4 per cent (for those in the 15-year scheme) or 1.8 per cent (for those in the 20-year scheme) of gross salary. The contribution rate for members of the 1993 scheme is 1.8 per cent of gross salary up to the pension cap.</p>

ASLCs are assessed by the Government Actuary to be broadly consistent with the level of contributions that might have applied to meet the scheme's current and on-going future liability, had the scheme been funded on an approved or registered basis. The Government Actuary reviews the contribution rates following a full scheme valuation at least every four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.6/3">The annual total of judicial pension payments for 2009-10 was &#163;76.458 million. The total of employer's contributions for 2009-10 was &#163;83.941 million and &#163;4.315 million for member's contributions.</p>

Pitcairn depends heavily on New Zealand for the provision of a wide range of administrative and professional services, and in this context officials are in regular discussion with officials of the Government of New Zealand about the territory. But this Government remain committed to Pitcairn, as they remain committed to all of the Overseas Territories. And we respect the principle of self-determination for the people of Pitcairn, as we respect it for all peoples of the Overseas Territories.

This will remove 880,000 people from income tax altogether, and 23 million taxpayers will benefit by up to &#163;170 per year. Benefits from this change are restricted to basic-rate taxpayers.</p>

	<p pid="a.323.0/2">Freedom of expression and of the media remain key areas for reform in Turkey with regard to the EU accession process. The EU progress report for 2010 addresses this issue, and makes clear that while there have been some positive developments, there is still much work to be done before Turkey fulfils the EU criteria on respect for freedom of expression and the media.</p>

	<p pid="a.323.6/1">The UK automotive industry has developed an industry consensus view of the technology roadmap towards the decarbonisation of the transport sector. Fuel cell electric vehicles are identified within this as one of the range of technology options required, with introduction to the general market forecast from the latter half of this decade. The ongoing work required on low-carbon technology road mapping, including the identification of areas of growth opportunities for the UK industry, is being carried out through the Automotive Council, which is proving to be an excellent example of joint industry and government working.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.6/2">At present, production of fuel cell vehicles is primarily at a research, development and demonstration phase, and in the short term, volumes are therefore likely to remain limited to low numbers of niche vehicles and demonstrator programmes. However, some vehicle manufacturers have suggested that fuel cell vehicles may be commercially available earlier than previously forecast, perhaps starting to be seen from as early as 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.6/3">The Technology Strategy Board's Low Carbon Vehicles Innovation Platform is currently delivering over 340 ultra low-carbon vehicles in a demonstration programme. This includes a hydrogen-powered city prototype vehicle and a converted hydrogen fuel cell black cab. Continual monitoring is being undertaken throughout the programme with an assessment at the end of the trial.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.2/1">The Government do not hold an estimate of the number of charging posts that will be in the United Kingdom by the end of 2014. Such an estimate would be very difficult to generate as the electric vehicle market is at a formative stage. There is a lack of empirical evidence about the number of charge points required to sustain a set number of electric vehicles or where people will choose to charge their vehicles in the future-at home or at public charge points. Depending on how people choose to charge their vehicles, the number of public charge points required will vary widely, making any estimates at this point unreliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/2">Following the Spending Review, the coalition Government are providing up to an additional &#163;20 million to the Plugged-In Places scheme to support a small number of places to install a critical mass of charging infrastructure in their areas. This scheme will help the Government understand the future infrastructure requirements for electric vehicles and contribute to meeting the coalition agreement commitment to mandate a national network of charging infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.5/1">In 2008, the Government commissioned research to assess the scope of the transport sector to switch to electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Under the report's mid-range scenario, it was estimated that 9,000 plug-in hybrids could be on the road in the UK by 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.5/2">In the intervening period, the Department for Transport has maintained a dialogue with relevant manufacturers about the production of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and supply levels for the UK. Plug-in hybrids are not likely to become available in significant numbers until 2012, two years later than the date of introduction forecast in the 2008 research. The uptake trajectory could therefore be somewhat slower.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.5/3">More detailed information from manufacturers about numbers of vehicles in production and supply to the UK has been provided on a commercially confidential basis, and I regret that I am therefore unable to disclose this.</p>
