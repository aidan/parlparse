	<p pid="a.68.3/1">Council Directive 96/48/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system lays down requirements for compliance with Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) which, subject to provisions for derogations, must be met when certain categories of work are undertaken on the railway lines covered by the directive. No TSIs have yet been published, but the latest draft TSI relating to control-command and signalling subsystems, if adopted, would require that signalling systems compliant with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) should be installed as part of these works.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/2">The draft TSI also recognises that existing systems, which include the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS), may continue to be used after the TSI has been published. TPWS therefore could be said to comply with the directive. However, TPWS does not comply with ERTMS specifications, which use different technology and provide a higher level of protection.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.6/1">The Government have been concerned about enforceability of regulations on total working time in relation to lorry owner-drivers. We believe that the main purpose of working time legislation is to protect employees from being forced to work long hours by employers, and only employed workers are covered by the main Working Time Directive EC 93/104, as amended by Directive 2000/34. Self-employed drivers have more freedom to work the hours they choose and to take rest when they please.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.8/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-28">28 July</phrase> that he was establishing a new Cabinet Ministerial Group on Children and Young People's Services which would be chaired by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment as Vice Chair, and which would be supported by a new cross-cutting Children and Young People's Unit to be located in the Department for Education and Employment. He also appointed my right honourable friend the Minister of State and Deputy Home Secretary as Minister for Young People with day to day responsibility for the unit and the co-ordination of the Government's strategy in England on vulnerable children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.8/2">The Children's Fund will form a major new part of the Government's strategy to tackle child poverty and prevent social exclusion. The fund will support services to work with children and their families and prevent children and young people falling into drug abuse, truancy, unemployment and crime. It will be worth a total of &pound;450 millon over three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.8/3">The new interdepartmental Children and Young People's Unit, based in the Department for Education and Employment, will run the Children's Fund in England at official level. The unit's remit will be set by the new Cabinet Ministerial Group on Children and Young People's Services. The unit will have its own Request for Resources within the Department for Education and Employment's Estimate. The Head of the Children and Young People's Unit, once appointed, will be an additional Accounting Officer within the department. As is usual, the appointment as additional Accounting Officer will be made by the Treasury and a copy of the letter of appointment, setting out the respective roles and responsibilities of the additional Accounting Officer and the Permanent Secretary of the Department for Education and Employment as Principal Accounting Officer, will be sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Clerk of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.8/4">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment will be answerable to Parliament for the Children's Fund and the work of the unit. However, my right honourable friend the Minister for Young People, will normally answer parliamentary Questions on the Children's Fund and the unit in another place, and in the case of Oral Questions will do so during Department for Education and Employment Question Time. The Government expect that the relevant Select Committees will normally wish to invite him to appear when they examine the Children's Fund and the Government's strategy on services to tackle disadvantage among children and young people. I shall answer for the Government in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.8/5">The Government will liaise as necessary with the House authorities to ensure that these arrangements work well and secure effective accountability for this innovative policy.</p>

	Non-attendance at School: Parental Fines

	<p pid="a.71.1/2" qnum="HL4321">Why they are proposing to raise the level of fines for parents found guilty of their children's non-attendance at school when they stated in the Written Answer by Baroness Blackstone on 18 May (WA 37-38) that they do not know the average fine levied or the number of parents who have received the maximum fine of &pound;2,500.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-10-30a.72.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100052" speakername="Baroness Blackstone" colon=":" colnum="72"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001030/text/01030w02.htm#01030w02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.72.0/1">Our proposal to raise the level of the fine for non-attendance at school is one of the measures in our strategy to combat truancy highlighted by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-19">19 October</phrase>. It will give legal effect to the announcement which he first made last year. The &pound;2,500 maximum fine is the subject of a clause in the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill currently under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">Every day at least 50,000 children are off school without permission--the majority with their parents' knowledge. Even when prosecuted, 80 per cent of parents do not appear in court and can be fined as little as &pound;10. Recent evidence shows that some parents are fined an average of &pound;50 to &pound;100, and a number incur fines at the maximum level of &pound;1,000. But more detailed information on the numbers of parents found guilty and average fines is not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/3">Raising the level of the fine will help combat the unacceptable culture that condones absence from school without permission. Most importantly, our proposal will force parents prosecuted for school attendance offences to turn up in court to face the consequences of their actions, or risk arrest. It will also give Magistrates greater flexibility when deciding on the fine level to impose when parents are found guilty.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">Estimates of take-up of Income Support in 1999-2000 will be published next year. On <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-29">29 April 1999</phrase> (Col. 513), I gave an illustrative estimate of the increase in expenditure on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA) together, if their take-up were to increase to 90 per cent. The primary assumptions behind that estimate were the estimated levels of DLA and AA caseload take-up based on the 1996-97 Disability Survey follow-up to the Family Resources Survey. As noted in my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-10">10 October</phrase>, these figures cannot reliably be converted into cash terms. The illustrative amount, given in April 1999, was produced based on two main further assumptions:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/2" class="indent">(a) The entitled population has not changed from 1996-97, and increasing caseload simply reflects increasing take-up, rather than any changes in the adjudication process.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/3" class="indent">(b) The group newly taking up benefit receive an average amount of the appropriate DLA component or AA. It is possible that those who are not taking-up benefit will have an average entitlement below that of the current recipient group.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/4">Due to the difficulty of carrying forward 1996-97 results to later years, no reliable estimates are available for 1999-2000.</p>
