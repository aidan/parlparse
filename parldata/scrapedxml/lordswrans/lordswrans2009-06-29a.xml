In addition, a possible human health risk from atypical scrapie cannot be ruled out, so for these reasons precautionary controls in sheep remain in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the Charity Commission. I have asked the commission to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/2"><I>Letter from Andrew Hind, Chief Executive, Charity Commission, dated June 2009</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/3">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/4"><I>Parliamentary question (HL4407)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/5">We recognise that there is scope for problems in membership charities if proper attention is not paid to their governance arrangements. For this reason we published a report on membership charities in March 2004, which provides best practice guidance. This includes information on the holding of elections and voting procedures. This is available from our website at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk">www.charitycommission.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/6">For the most part, the running of elections is the responsibility of the charity trustees. They must act in accordance with their governing document, charity law, and where appropriate, company law.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/7">In our experience, a problem with voting at an election meeting is indicative of a wider dispute or disagreement in the charity. Only in very limited circumstances will the Commission become involved in such a dispute, usually where there are no validly appointed trustees. Instead, those involved should try and use all available methods to resolve the dispute themselves. Our website contains information to help them do this&mdash;&quot;Conflicts in your Charity: a statement of approach by the Charity Commission&quot;, and I will arrange for a copy of this to be placed in the Library of the House. For instance, where a more formal approach is required, professional mediation can be a quick and cost effective way to resolve a dispute.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/8">We would only become involved if there were matters of serious concern and where it was necessary and proportionate for us to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/9"><I>Parliamentary question (HL4408)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/10">Whether we will take action in a case will depend upon the issues involved, the risks to the charity and whether our intervention is necessary and proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/11">There may be legitimate reasons why notification of an election meeting has not been received. For instance, if the charity was not informed of a change of address or the person's membership had lapsed. However it may be indicative of a wider dispute or disagreement in the charity. In my response to a previous question (HL4407) I outlined the Commission's approach to disputes in membership charities and the sources of information available on our website.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/12">In the first instance, the members should take the matter up with the trustees and ask why they were not sent notice of the meeting. If they do not receive a satisfactory answer then they could consider what further action to take. The charity may have a procedure for dealing with disputes or disagreements. The governing document may also indicate what options are open to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/13">If we were made aware of the situation, then we would provide the trustees with advice and guidance to help them resolve the situation and ensure that the charity adhered to best practice. Our experience is that disputes in membership charities are best resolved by the members themselves rather than by any direct intervention from us.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/14"><I>Parliamentary question (HL4409)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/15">We take a lot of trouble to make sure that, in making decisions, we get them right first time. However, we do recognise that from time to time a customer may consider that we have not taken the correct decision. We therefore have procedures in place that enable an interested party to ask for one of our decisions to be reviewed. These are set out on our website at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/reviewproc.asp">http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/reviewproc.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/16">The review, undertaken by a senior Commission officer, will decide whether our final decision is the right one in the sense that it is a proper exercise of our powers and consistent with our statutory objectives. We also check that the reasons for our decisions have been adequately expressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/17">If a customer is not satisfied with our final decision they may be able to appeal or make an application for review to the Charity Tribunal. This is an independent body set up under the Charities Act 2006 to hear appeals against our decisions or applications for review of our decisions. It is part of the Tribunals Service, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice. It provides an independent route of appeal for charities which have exhausted our own decision review process. Further information is available from its website at <a href="http://www.charity">www.charity</a>. tribunals.gov.uk.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/18">For those decisions that cannot be appealed to the Charity Tribunal, appellants can seek a review of the decision through the Commission's Outcome Review Panel procedures or, of course, through judicial review. For standard of service issues, the Commission has established complaints procedures. If, having been through these procedures the complainant remains dissatisfied, complainants have further recourse through the Commission's Independent Complaints Reviewer and thereafter the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman (further details on all of the above can be found at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/compproc">http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/compproc</a>. asp).</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/19">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.2/1">This is not a new obligation as the UK is already required by an existing EU directive and through its membership of the International Energy Agency to hold emergency oil stocks for use in oil supply disruptions. We support the new directive as it aligns the EU and IEA systems while maintaining member states' flexibility to design and operate systems best suited to their individual national needs. There will be no additional costs to implement the revised directive since we expect any administrative costs to be absorbed within the existing resources for managing the UK's current oil stocking system. There should be no impact on prices as a result of implementation of the revised directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.5/1">Aviation is not excluded from the Equality Bill. Clause 27, which makes it unlawful to discriminate against harass or victimise a person because of a protected characteristic when providing services, protects someone when they are requesting a service and when they are being provided with a service. That applies to aviation. Schedule 3, Part 7 provides an exception to Clause 27 for services in connection with air transport, but it relates only to disability, where there is a separate European regulation in place. EU Regulation 1107/2006 made it unlawful for airlines to refuse to carry disabled andless mobile passengers; and airlines have to give assistance to all people of reduced mobility. The UK fully supports these principles. Regulation 1107 is directly applicable in UK law and is enforced by SI 2007/1895.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.5/2">There is no need to include aviation in Clause 28 for the reasons stated above.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.0/1">UN member states are not privy to correspondence between individual member states and the UN Human Rights Council's special procedures. However, in an addendum to her report to the 10th session of the Human Rights Council, the special rapporteur details her correspondence with Iran including where she has and has not received replies to her concerns raised on various cases. This addendum can be found on the Human Rights Council website at <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/109/80/PDF/G0910980.pdf?OpenElement">http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/109/80/PDF/G0910980.pdf?OpenElement</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/2">The UK has a standing invitation to UN special procedures, strongly believes that countries must co-operate with them for them to be able to work effectively, and we encourage co-operation whenever we can. The council has no means beyond such encouragement to persuade governments to provide timely responses. As with the afore-mentioned addendum, points raised by special procedures are usually covered in their regular reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.6/1">The Lisbon treaty would insert a new Article 46A into the Treaty on European Union (Article 47 in the consolidated version of the treaty) which provides that &quot;the Union shall have legal personality&quot;. Articles 216-219 of the consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Article 2(173) of the Lisbon Treaty) sets out the legal basis and procedures that would apply for negotiation and conclusion of international agreements between the Union and third countries or international organisations. There is no substantive change to the existing position. The European Community presently enters into international agreements within Community competence under the current Treaty establishing the European Community. The Treaty on European Union also provides for the conclusion of international agreements in Articles 24 and 38. Those agreements are given effect through legislation where that is needed to implement them and they create obligations at the EU level for the member states in those areas of competence.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.6/2">In the same way such agreements concluded by the Union within its competences under the Treaty on European Union, and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union would be implemented through legislation where necessary and would create obligations for the member states at the Union level. Council decisions on the conclusion of agreements are currently subject to parliamentary scrutiny and that would continue to be the case under the treaties as amended by the Lisbon treaty.</p>

The present economic climate, coupled with changes to the way that people choose to access news and other information, have placed the print media sector under unprecedented strain. Structural changes will inevitably involve a review of current working patterns, which, among other things, will often lead to a reduction in the overall numbers employed. Such circumstances require proprietors to make some difficult commercial decisions and it would not be appropriate for government to intervene directly in this process. Nevertheless, we keenly understand the hardship caused by job losses and we recognise the need to work with the industry to alleviate this distress.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.2/1">Out of the 260 Lords Questions answered up to <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-15">15 June</phrase>, the Northern Ireland Office referred to websites on 15 occasions. Ten of these were answered substantively, but in order to provide noble Lords with additional information on the subject, the Answers included links to websites where further information could be found.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/2">A further two adhered to the protocol outlined in my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-17">17 June</phrase> by providing weblinks because the information requested could have been provided in the answer only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/3">For the remaining three Answers, the information requested was held by bodies that are independent of the Northern Ireland Office: in two cases the Chief Electoral Officer and in the third case a committee of the United Nations. It was therefore judged more appropriate to refer to the website of those bodies so that noble Lords had access to those organisations' own statements on the matters in question rather than an interpretation of these statements by government Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.0/1">In the recent negotiation of the implementing rules for the new EU wine regime, the UK argued strongly that EU wine makers should have the flexibility to produce wine with a lower alcohol content. These negotiations concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-19">19 June</phrase> and I am pleased that from <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-01">1 August 2009</phrase> the new rules will allow the use of new techniques to reduce the alcohol content of wine by up to 2 per cent, thus enabling EU wine makers to respond to consumer demand for reduced alcohol wine.</p>
