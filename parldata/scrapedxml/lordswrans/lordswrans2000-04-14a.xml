	<p pid="a.69.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2" qnum="HL1949">Whether they have any evidence that the decline in overseas aid worldwide of over 20 per cent in real terms between 1992 and 1997 has now been reversed; and what pressure they are bringing to bear on members of the Development Assistance Committee to ensure this reversal.</p>
</ques>

	<p pid="a.69.2/1">In 1998, the latest year for which figures are available, official development assistance (ODA) rose by US$3.6 billion to almost US$52 billion, an increase on 1997 of 9.6 per cent in real terms. This resulted in the ODA/GNP ratio for all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Member countries rising from 0.22 to 0.24 per cent. Fifteen of the 21 DAC member countries reported a rise in net ODA disbursements in real terms. But we need to monitor year on year progress. DAC figures are based on calendar not financial years and this can produce distortions.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">The Government have started to reverse the decline in the UK's development assistance budget and have made clear their commitment to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP. They have called on all donors to reverse the trend in declining ODA and challenged the donor community to increase official development finance to US$60 billion by this year. We also continue to press for better focused and more efficient assistance by both bilateral and multilateral donors. It is only by the whole international system working collaboratively and backing the leadership of governments and people in developing countries against measurable improvements in poverty reduction year on year that the aim of poverty elimination will be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">I am pleased to announce that the report of the review of the organisation of public sector ombudsmen in England is published today. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House and are also available from the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/2">The start of the review was announced by the then Minister for the Cabinet Office on <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-30">30 March 1999</phrase> and forms part of the Modernising Government agenda. The review, which was carried out by a team in the Cabinet Office, was wide-ranging: it covered the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Service Ombudsman for England and the Local Government Ombudsmen for England, and looked at the potential interaction between those ombudsmen and other independent complaints authorities such as the independent Housing Ombudsman and the Data Protection Commissioner. The review team consulted widely with those who have an interest in the ombudsmen system, including all Members, the ombudsmen themselves, central and local government, representative bodies (such as the Local Government Association and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives) and external interest groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/3">The main recommendations in the report are that the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Health Service Ombudsman in England and the Local Government Ombudsmen in England should be merged into a collegiate structure (a new Commission); that the present requirement for complainants to put their complaints via a Member to the Parliamentary Ombudsman (the &quot;MP filter&quot;) should be removed; and that their procedures be simplified and made more flexible.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/4">The Government welcome the review's focus on providing a more customer-orientated ombudsman service. It recognises that the recommendations raise a number of significant issues about the status and constitution of the ombudsmen. Accordingly, we shall now be consulting widely before reaching our final conclusions on implementing the review's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.2/10">(1) Cost of each additional day awarded is calculated by multiplying the estimated number of awards of additional days served by the average number of days (14) awarded to give the total number of additional days awarded each year. This figure is then multiplied by the daily cost of a prison place in each financial year (taken from the annual cost per prison place, divided by 365 days). Annual cost per prison place for 1999-00 is provisional.</p>
