	<p pid="a.53.2/1">Legacy's preferred bidder status gave them exclusive negotiating rights up to <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase>. While their bid has made progress towards meeting the preferred bidder terms, they have not met them. Legacy's exclusivity has therefore expired and the Government have decided to terminate the existing competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">During the period of Legacy's preferred bidder status, the Government have not sought any alternative proposals for the Dome. The Government would now like openly to test the market and will therefore ask English Partnerships to invite any interested parties to lodge with it expressions of interest for the Dome and the regeneration of the peninsula. The Government, like the Mayor of London and the London Borough of Greenwich, believe the Dome should be retained as part of the regenerated peninsula, and offers will be invited on this basis. There have been considerable expressions of interest from other parties which have been logged by English Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">Within this framework, Legacy will of course be able to put forward its proposals, which will be fully considered on merit alongside others.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/4">Expressions of interest will be assessed by an advisory team, which will report to English Partnerships, who will shortly publish details of the arrangements and rules for this process.</p>

I can now confirm that, by virtue of a Commencement Order made under the Act, the date of implementation will be <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-19">Monday 19 February 2001</phrase>. On that day, the Terrorism Act 2000 will replace the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996. As a consequence of the new judicial extension of detention arrangements which will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-19">19 February</phrase>, the United Kingdom will be in a position to lift the derogations entered under Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and I can confirm that it is our intention to deposit notifications with the Council of Europe and the United Nations to this effect early next week. To take account of any detentions under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 made up to midnight on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-18">18 February</phrase>, these notifications will lift the derogations as of <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-26">26 February 2001</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.5/1">Escalators are an important part of the service on London Underground, and it is important that across the system as a whole they work smoothly and consistently, but above all safely. The management of its escalators is a matter for London Underground (LUL) and they carry out rigorous, routine checks on all escalators as part of their continuous programme of safety monitoring. They have a planned forward programme of investing in new escalators where older ones need to be replaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.5/2">LUL's escalators are subject to very heavy-duty usage, and in many cases they are specially built for each individual location and have to be installed piece by piece on site. The actual time for each renewal can therefore vary according to the location and the inherent difficulties such as space etc. However I understand from London Underground that over recent years the time taken to replace escalators has reduced because of improved practices.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.3/1">Air Traffic services in Oceanic airspace are provided on a monopoly basis. When the National Air Traffic Services Ltd public/private partnership is established, charges for these services will be subject to price regulation by the RPI-X method, which is the standard model for monopoly regulation in the United Kingdom. The charge cap, or &quot;X&quot; factor, will be set for a period of five years and will, for the first five-year period only, be set by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/2">We received advice from the CAA in August which set out how it proposed to approach the economic regulation of NATS and recommended that the &quot;X&quot; factor for NATS' Oceanic services be set at 10 per cent for the first year and 2 per cent for each of the next four years. We have considered the CAA's advice carefully, alongside representations from air users who will pay these charges and from NATS, which has also provided revised estimates of traffic levels and system costs which have a significant effect on the first year of the quinquennium. We have consequently decided to set a cap of 2 per cent for each of the five years, and that there should be no delay penalty term for the present.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/3">The Government regard investment in the Oceanic sector as important and believe that the approach to charge control should reflect this. I have therefore agreed with the CAA that it should be receptive to any proposals, made with the support of air users, to revisit the price cap when investment is made with a view to significant improvements in the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.8/1">Section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998 does not apply to Private Bills. However, like all legislation, any Act resulting from the passage of such a Bill can be judged in the courts, either in the UK or in Strasbourg, for its compatibility with the ECHR. As my right honourable friend the President of the Council announced in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-11">11 January 2001</phrase>, in future when Private Bills are deposited promoters will be asked to undertake a full assessment of the compatibility of their proposals with the ECHR and to make a statement setting out their conclusion as to whether the Bill is compatible or not. A Minister in the government department within whose policy responsibilities the subject matter of the Bill falls will make a formal statement saying that he believes that the promoters have undertaken a full assessment and that he does not (or, if necessary, that he does) see any need to dispute their conclusions.</p>

The running costs limit will be increased by &pound;2,504,000 from &pound;245,165,000 to &pound;247,669,000. This increase is required to fund delivery of the pledge on persistent youth offenders, deployment of Higher Court Advocates in the Crown Court and diversity and equality issues and to achieve improvements against CPS and CJS targets. An increase in capital expenditure of &pound;500,000 will be used to fund the introduction of joint CPS/Police criminal justice and trial units.</p>

The running costs limit will increase by &pound;1,550,000 from &pound;6,432,000 to &pound;7,982,000.The increase in net running costs is due to an increase in capital charge following a revaluation of TDS's premises (Queen Anne's Chambers).

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">No recipient is entitled to keep her war widow's pension if she remarries or lives with a man as his wife. War pensions legislation differs from the Armed Forces Attributable Pension Scheme, in that Ministry of Defence legislation has, since <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-31">31 October 2000</phrase>, allowed a widow to keep her attributable pension if she remarries or starts to live with a man as his wife. When a question arises whether a war widow is living with a man as his wife, the War Pensions Agency normally uses the services of the Benefits Agency to investigate the case. Trained staff follow established procedures, including interviewing the widow and, if possible, the person who may be living with her as her husband. A specially trained officer of the War Pensions Agency considers the information gathered, and any other relevant evidence, when deciding whether war widow's pension should remain in payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/2">In each of the five cases referred to by the noble Lord, the evidence used comprised the record of the interview(s), including detailed accounts of the living arrangements and financial arrangements of the household. The information was provided by the widow, and where possible, by her partner. The cost of each individual investigation is not available. None of the five decisions was appealable to an independent tribunal. However, subject to the approval of Parliament, changes being introduced as a result of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 will provide a right of appeal to the Pensions Appeal Tribunal on such decisions made from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-09">9 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
