	<p pid="c.63.2/1">Nine local authority &quot;trailblazers&quot; have piloted information sharing index approaches with financial support from my department. In these areas, indexes have worked effectively to help improve well-being and welfare, including child protection, by providing a tool to enable practitioners to identify quickly a child and see who else is working with that child so that they can contact them to discuss whether it is appropriate to share information. This in turn supports earlier, more effective intervention.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase>, I laid in the House of Lords Library the report <i>Learning from Information Sharing and Assessment Trailblazers</i> detailing the main lessons learnt from the trailblazer authorities' work. In some trailblazer authorities, authorised users of the indexes include members of youth offending teams and police officers whose roles bring them into frequent contact with children and young people, through domestic violence cases, youth offending programmes, &quot;Safer Schools&quot; partnerships and other specialist roles relating to children and young people. No trailblazers' indexes have users from the probation service, which provides services primarily in respect of adults.</p>

	<p pid="c.65.5/1">The department's policy on air travel is contained in the travel and subsistence chapter of its staff handbook. Official travellers are encouraged to use the most cost-effective methods of travel which will help them to reach their destinations safely, in good time and in reasonable comfort. Air travel may be used for journeys overseas and for long-distance travel within the UK. Flights with a duration of less than 2.5 hours must be booked economy class, and flights in excess of 2.5 hours may be business/club class. Upgrades to higher classes of ticket may only be made in exceptional circumstances, such as when there are no tickets available in the approved class, where the facilities in economy class do not meet the needs of pregnant or disabled travellers, or when necessarily accompanying someone travelling in a higher class. Any benefits such as air miles accrued as a result of official travel may not be used for personal travel, but may used to offset the cost of future official journeys where possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.65.5/2">Policy on air travel in the department's agencies is broadly similar to that in the central department, and identical in the cases of MCA, VCA and DVLA. DSA does not have a specific air travel policy, but requires that all journeys must be arranged as economically as possible, taking into account the cost of the travel and the cost of official time. VOSA allows air travel when this is more economical because of savings in travel and subsistence expenses and VOSA time; or the urgency of the journey justifies the cost. With a few exceptions all travel must be made at standard or economy fares. HA allows air travel for overseas journeys, but expects such journeys to be undertaken in the most economical and efficient manner. For UK travel HA's preferred mode of transport is rail, but it permits travelling by air where this offers overall savings in terms of fares, subsistence and official time. Where these criteria are not met, air travel may nevertheless be allowed if the urgency of the journey justifies the extra cost. The presumption is that staff will travel economy class. GCDA has no specific policy on air travel.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.0/1">As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister explained in his Statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-19">19 December</phrase>, the European Council of 15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December 2005</phrase> succeeded in achieving agreement on the next EC budget for the 2007&ndash;13 financial perspective. As part of the package, the member states reached agreement on future structural and cohesion funds spending.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.0/2">The Government have argued consistently that, following enlargement, it is right that the structural funds should be focused to a greater extent on the poorest EU member states. The agreement will enable the EU to address priorities in the new member states while still maintaining some funding for richer member states, in particular their poorer regions. The older EU member states (the EU15) will face reductions in spending compared with current levels, reflecting their comparative prosperity and the need to support the economic convergence of the new member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.0/3">The degree to which member states can determine how structural funding is used in their regions will be determined by the separate structural fund regulations, which are still being negotiated. Each member state's national strategic reference frameworks (NSRF) will set out the broad objectives for future programmes within each member state. Within their strategic frameworks, member states will have considerable flexibility in directing structural fund spending in accordance with agreed EU aims for regional development. The Government are planning to consult on the UK's draft NSRF over the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.9/1">The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) report published in 2003 included a study of 24-hour urinary excretion of fluoride in a sample of adults aged 19 to 64 in Great Britain between July 2000 and June 2001. The report noted:</p>
	<p pid="c.67.9/2" class="indent">&quot;Safe intakes of fluoride for adults are 0.05mg/kg/day. Overall, 1 per cent. of men and 3 per cent. of women had a urinary fluoride excretion per 24 hours that suggest intakes of fluoride above the safe level. This proportion ranged from none of those aged 19 to 24 years to 2 per cent. of men and 6 per cent. of women aged 50 to 64 years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.67.9/3">In this age group the relevant concern is that excessive intake of fluoride over many years may lead to clinical skeletal fluorosis. This condition is associated with a long-term fluoride intake several times higher than the &quot;safe intake for fluoride&quot; cited in the NDNS report. Furthermore, urinary fluoride excretion over 24 hours is largely determined by fluoride intake in the previous few days; therefore, the range of recent daily fluoride intakes estimated by the authors of the report may be wider than the range of long-term average daily fluoride intakes in the population.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.9/4">The report's findings do not imply that fluoride intakes in adults in Great Britain will lead to clinical skeletal fluorosis. The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment concluded in September 2003 that,</p>
	<p pid="c.67.9/5" class="indent">&quot;based on the current information available and the dietary intakes estimated from the 1997 Total Diet Study, no adverse effects other than mild to moderate dental fluorosis would be expected to be associated with fluoride intake from food, either in adults or in children, at the intake levels in the UK&quot;. (COT Statement 2003/03)</p>
	<p pid="c.67.9/6">Thus, the results of both recent surveys are consistent with the absence of reports of clinical skeletal fluorosis attributable to fluoride intakes in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.9/7">The requirement in Section 90(a)1 of the Water Industry Act 1991 (introduced by Section 58 of the Water Act 2003) is for strategic health authorities (SHAs) to monitor the health of populations receiving fluoridated water and applies to SHAs with existing fluoridation schemes. In producing guidance on how SHAs should implement this requirement, we will consider how intakes of fluoride should be monitored.</p>

	<p pid="c.72.5/1">It is not possible to answer the question in the format requested as the department does not record centrally volumes of court proceedings to identify MMR/MR vaccine litigation. The Legal Services Commission (LSC) is responsible for publicly funded legal services in England and Wales. The LSC records the number of legal aid certificates issued, but does not record the point in time when proceedings commence under these certificates. The LSC is not aware of any damages that have been awarded so far in respect of the MMR/MR vaccine litigation.</p>

	<p pid="c.73.2/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) has undertaken internal reviews of the MMR/MR litigation and monitored its progress as it does with all publicly funded multi-party actions. As litigation is still in progress, it would not be appropriate to comment further on this case. The funding for the MMR litigation commenced in the early 1990s. Since then, the LSC had made significant changes to the funding of multi-party actions generally. Key changes include the introduction of affordability criteria, tendering based on quality and price, and &quot;risk rates&quot; to share the risk between the LSC and the service providers, so that service providers would be unlikely to profit from a case which was unsuccessful.</p>

	<p pid="c.77.8/2">The funding per mile of road varies between local authority areas for a number of reasons including because demands on funding (such as those related to public transport, congestion, road safety and capital road and bridge maintenance) vary between different types of area and road. Some figures are affected significantly by one-off major projects. The quality of local transport plans and their delivery also affects some capital funding allocations.</p>

	<p pid="c.80.3/1">The UK welcomed the closure of the case against Orhan Pamuk, but remains concerned that a number of individuals in Turkey continue to face prosecution and conviction for the non-violent expression of opinion. Cases of concern include the suspended sentence already handed down to Hrant Dink under Article 301 for &quot;insulting Turkishness&quot; in a series of articles he wrote on Armenian identity.</p>
	<p pid="c.80.3/2">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary raised this with his Turkish counterpart when visiting Ankara on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>. We will continue to stress to Turkey the need to ensure that the right to free speech is respected in line with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the standards required for EU accession, including when discussing the tragedies of 1915&ndash;16. It was encouraging that a conference debated this issue on 24&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-09-25">25 September 2005</phrase> in Istanbul, and we welcome the Turkish Prime Minister's subsequent statement stressing the importance of respect for opposing points of view, and expressing his desire to live in a Turkey which enjoyed freedom in the widest sense.</p>

	<p pid="c.81.2/1">The UK's contribution to the Western European Union (WEU) and its assembly in 2005 was &pound;1.7 million. The budget for 2006 has yet to be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.2/2">The member states of the WEU undertook, in the Brussels Treaty (1948, modified 1954) to provide each other with a mutual defence commitment. This mutual defence commitment remains, although when NATO was established in 1949, WEU members accepted that it would be carried out through NATO. In 1992, the WEU agreed it should be ready to undertake the Petersberg tasks&mdash;humanitarian and rescue missions, peacekeeping, peacemaking and crisis management. Following the development of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) the WEU transferred these crisis management functions and responsibilities to the EU under the Nice Treaty in 2000. This transfer continues and the Western European Armaments Group, part of the WEU, transferred its responsibilities to the European Defence Agency in 2005. The WEU assembly remains active, bringing together parliamentarians from 28 European countries, and has oversight of intergovernmental co-operation in European defence, particularly in the field of armaments. The Government see value in this collective oversight and the WEU assembly will remain in being for as long as Article IX of the modified Brussels treaty remains in force, member governments go on funding the assembly and national parliaments support it. The UK is not currently engaged in any discussions about the disbanding of the WEU.</p>
