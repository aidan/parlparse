	<p pid="a.43.6/2">Up to &#8364;440 billion of the sum would be provided by euro-area member states (and others who choose to participate) through a special purpose vehicle.

	<p pid="a.43.6/3">Up to &#8364;60 billion of emergency finance could be provided in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Lisbon treaty. Should this element of the mechanism be called upon, the European Commission would raise the money on the capital markets, guaranteed by the EU budget. Loans would be granted in parallel with IMF programmes and would be subject to policy conditionality. Only where there were defaults on loan repayments would there be a cost to the EU budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.6/4">In this circumstance, all member states would be liable for a share through their monthly subscriptions to the EU budget: based on the UK's contribution to the 2010 EU Budget, the UK's share would be approximately 13.6 per cent of any increase, or up to a maximum of around &#8364;8 billion. Any increase to the UK's contribution would be within the limits of the EU own resource ceiling already agreed by Parliament through the European Communities (Finance) Act 2008.</p>
