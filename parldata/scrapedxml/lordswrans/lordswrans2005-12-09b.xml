	<p pid="b.129.3/1">The steps so far taken to place HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; in a state of reduced readiness include the de-storing and de-fuelling of the vessel. As part of this work, most of her fluid systems, including the freshwater, saltwater, fuel oil and hydraulic systems have been isolated and drained in order to limit degradation. In addition, much of the high value and potentially vulnerable equipment, including the gas turbines, weapons and radar systems, has been removed for storage, repair or refurbishment for possible reuse. However, it is not practical or cost effective to remove all of the equipment and, for example, large items such as gearboxes and diesel generators are being individually preserved or stored in a dehumidified area within the ship's hull. It is estimated that it would take approximately nine months to reverse these steps.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-09b.133.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="133"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51209w02.htm#51209w02_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.133.2/1">There are many separate statutory provisions available to Defra officials (&quot;inspectors&quot;) providing for entry and inspection or search of business premises and homes located in England and Wales. There is no single code of enforcement and investigation powers akin to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and a comprehensive and exhaustive list of all of the statutory provisions currently in force is not readily available but I mention some examples below. (Chapter Eight of <i>The Law of Entry, Search and Seizure</i> (4th Edition) (2005) by Professor Richard Stone of Lincoln University is a very useful guide to the law and sets out the sorts of powers that exist).</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/2">Without a power to enter and inspect or search the relevant premises, business premises or where appropriate home, the law could probably not be properly enforced. Most legal provisions creating obligations or restrictions on activity will therefore have entry powers in the enforcement provisions. For a recent example which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-17">17 November 2005</phrase> see the Salmonella in Broiler Flocks (Survey Powers) (England) Regulations 2005 SI No. 2927, Regulation 5(3)(a) of which provides a power to enter premises to take samples of faecal material from broiler chickens.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/3" class="italic">Premises and business premises</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/4">Generally, inspectors have a routine right to enter premises, including land, at all reasonable hours for the purpose of ascertaining whether legal requirements are being complied with. It is normally an offence to refuse entry. In some cases inspectors must have reasonable grounds to believe that a state of affairs exists before seeking to enter such premises&mdash;see, for example, Section 19(2) of the food and environmental protection Act 1990 in relation to pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/5" class="italic">Use of reasonable force and warrants to enter business premises</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/6">Sometimes reasonable use of force can be used to achieve entry and inspection or search of business premises&mdash;see for example paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of food and environmental protection Act 1990 in relation to pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/7">But where entry is refused and a power to use reasonable force is not available a warrant to enter and inspect or search can normally be sought from a magistrates' court&mdash;see for example Section 16(5) of the Animal Health Act 1981, as inserted by Section 7 of the Animal Health Act 2002, in relation to &quot;animal treatment entry warrants&quot;. Before granting a warrant to enter the magistrate must be satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for entry for enforcement of the relevant regulations. Reasonable use of force can normally be used to execute such entry warrants.</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/8" class="italic">Domestic premises</p>
	<p pid="b.133.2/9">Where inspectors wish to enter and inspect or search domestic premises, and this is usually when a criminal offence is suspected, the law invariably requires a search warrant. The magistrate granting the warrant must be satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for entry for enforcement of the regulations. Where such entry warrants are used for investigative purposes the occupier must be informed of his legal rights in accordance with paragraph 6.7 of Code B to the Code of Search (2004) issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.2/1">Westminster City Council has the responsibility for addressing rough sleeping in the local area. While the Government do not set targets to reduce rough sleeping in specific areas such as that in Victoria Street opposite New Scotland Yard and around Westminster Cathedral, there have been significant reductions in the level of rough sleeping across all of Westminster with the last published count on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-08">8 March 2005</phrase> recording 133 rough sleepers across the borough, compared to 175 recorded in April 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.2/2">Westminster acknowledges that rough sleeping around Victoria Street continues to be one of London's most visible and troublesome hotspots. From July 2005 Westminster moved to a buildings-based model of service delivery, with the emphasis on rough sleepers coming indoors for rapid assessment. The aim is to help vulnerable people into appropriate services that will enable them to sustain accommodation, to divert others new to the area, and bring about real reductions in people using the area to bed down at night.</p>
