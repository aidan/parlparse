	<p pid="a.267.5/1">The Bolan Park was built in Bolan, Lashkar Gah, in 2007 at the request of the governor of Helmand and in response to an identified local need: it functions as a symbol for security and development in the area. The park is providing much needed recreational space and facilities for the people of Lashkar Gar and the surrounding area, in particular women and children. One of the first major events hosted at the park was a US-funded agricultural fair to promote legal livelihoods, attended by 1,700 Afghans. The park was also used for a successful cultural event organised by the Helmand governor, which attracted more than 2,000 local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.5/2">The UK provided funding for the park through the provincial reconstruction team. This park is open to men, women and children with one day each week being set aside for women's exclusive use. The park cost around &pound;420,000 and was built alongside the Helmand river. The costs of the park reflect the fact that during construction gabion walls were put in place to support the river bank, which helps prevent erosion, and to support the Bolan bridge. In addition, the park has extensive lighting which is important for improving security at night.</p>

The Legal Services Act 2007, which reforms the regulation of legal services in England and Wales, makes it absolutely clear that approved regulators of legal services are able to take proactive action&mdash;short of making orders for redress&mdash;where there are a potentially large number of clients who have been affected, but who may not know they have a complaint. These regulatory arrangements will be monitored by the newly established oversight regulator, the Legal Services Board. In addition, the newly established Office for Legal Complaints (OLC) will remove complaints handling from the legal professional bodies, with oversight from the newly established Legal Services Board. The OLC will administer an ombudsman scheme that will provide consumers with a quick, fair and accessible complaints system. This new body will be empowered to make a range of orders for redress, including up to &pound;30,000 redress.</p>
