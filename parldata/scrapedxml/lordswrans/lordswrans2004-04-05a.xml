	<p pid="a.184.2/1">Waterways Ireland operates in euros. Its budget for 2002 was set at 37.24 million euros or &pound;21.99 million using an exchange rate of 0.59.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/2">The budget for 2003 was set in euros at 35.89 million euros or &pound;22.61 million using an exchange rate of 0.63. Unfortunately, the Answer given by my predecessor the late Lord Williams of Mostyn on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-10">10 March 2003</phrase> (WA 163) was incorrect due to an administrative error. The Answer stated the agreed allocation to Waterways Ireland for 2002 as &pound;21.26 million. As stated above, the correct figure is &pound;21.99 million. I apologise for this inadvertent mistake.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/3">Comparison of the sterling equivalents shows an apparent increase, however this is simply a consequence of a movement in the relevant exchange rate. The underlying budget decreased by 1.35 million euros or 3.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/4">The budget for 2003 was based on a business plan submitted by the body to the sponsoring departments north and south.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/5">The agreement on apportionment of costs between the two jurisdictions is that Northern Ireland contributes 15 per cent of the running costs of the body and the Republic of Ireland contributes 85 per cent. Each government funds 100 per cent of the capital costs of projects undertaken in their jurisdiction. This formula has not changed. ra/and shirley</p>

The UN and other international agencies are now present in some areas of Darfur, though limited access means limited ability to protect the most vulnerable and respond to needs. A key concern is protection of civilians. DfID has contributed over &pound;8 million in response to the crisis and seconded four humanitarian officers to the UN to reinforce its response. Ceasefire talks in N'Djamena are a welcome first step to resolving the crisis.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.2/1">The Government have intervened in two cases currently pending before the US Supreme Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/2">The Government, together with the Australian and Swiss Governments, filed an amicus brief on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-23">23 January 2004</phrase> in the Sosa v Alvarez case which concerns the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). It is hoped that this case will serve as a test case on the scope of the ATS. The concern addressed by the Government's amicus brief is the use of the ATS by US courts to gain extra-territorial jurisdiction over non-US nationals or companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/3">The Government also filed an amicus brief on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-03">3 February 2004</phrase> jointly with the Irish and Netherlands Governments in the case of Empagran SA v Hoffman La-Roche Ltd. This case is of considerable importance for determining the future jurisdiction or scope of US competition law and the Government considered that it was important that the US courts are aware that their decisions have implications for competition regulation in jurisdictions outside the US.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.0/1">Home Office funding that could be accessed by sport organisations includes: Positive Activities for Young People, Positive Futures, the Building Safer Communities Fund, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's Purposeful Activity for Asylum Seekers and the Youth Justice Board's Youth Inclusion Programme. Although Home Office funding does not go directly to sports organisations, sport is recognised as a key mechanism for engaging individuals and communities. Indirectly sports clubs and organisations contribute much to the development of active and safe communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">For example, diversionary schemes that engage young people in sports or recreational-based constructive activity targeted to steer those young people most at risk away from crime are a key to the Government's programme for reducing youth crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP) is a national scheme to provide developmental activities during all school holiday periods for young people at risk of becoming involved in offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">PAYP received &pound;25 million single pot funding for 2003&ndash;04, to which the New Opportunities Fund, Department for Education and Skills and the Home Office contributed, bringing together funding streams previously going into Connexions Summer Plus, Splash, Splash Extra and community cohesion activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">The programme aims to reduce youth offending and encourage and support young people to return to education or training. The emphasis is on providing quality sports, arts and creative activities that are not only appealing but focussed on the young person's individual needs, equipping them with new skills, improving their self-esteem and breaking down ethnic and cultural barriers. Key worker support&mdash;provided through the Connexions service&mdash;helps those most at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">Another programme is Positive Futures, which is a national sport and activity-based programme for young people and is addressing the multiple issues associated with problematic substance misuse. It is targeted at marginalised young people in the 10&ndash;19 age range living in the top 20 per cent most deprived communities, according to the indices of multiple deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">Although Positive Futures is primarily a drug prevention programme it addresses issues of social inclusion, crime reduction and community cohesion. 20 per cent of the 14,000 project participants last year were from black and minority ethnic communities. simone</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8">Positive Futures brings together in one programme the support of a number of government departments and agencies including the Home Office, Department of Health, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Connexions (Department for Education and Skills), Sport England, Youth Justice Board and the Football Foundation.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/9">Positive Futures is managed through local partnerships that appoint lead agencies to deliver sports, educational and drug awareness programmes. These lead agencies can be sports organisations (e.g. Toxteth Tigers Basketball Club, Leyton Orient Community Sports Programme, etc) crime reduction, drug services, charities, local authorities or voluntary/community agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/10">There are 107 projects in England and Wales in the top 20 per cent most deprived areas in the country (according to the index of multiple deprivation). There have been just fewer than 35,000 participants since its launch in 2000. It is funded nationally by:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/11" class="indent">the Home Office (&pound;15 million over three years from SR 2002),</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/12" class="indent">the Football Foundation &pound;3 million over SR 2002 period),</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/13" class="indent">Sport England (&pound;0.5 million for 2003&ndash;04).</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/14">All Home Office funding has been allocated for the SR 2002 period, however Football Foundation funding can be accessed by applying directly to it. Sport England funding is targeted at the evaluation programme and workforce standards initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/15">Sports agencies could potentially be allocated funding under the Building Safer Communities (BSC) Fund to promote crime and drugs reduction. This fund, which totals &pound;74 million this year is primarily allocated to crime disorder reduction partnerships (CDRP) to fulfil a number of crime reduction priorities, both national and local. But where CDRPs can demonstrate a clear link between certain youth inclusion interventions (such as sports activities) and crime reduction, BSC may in theory be used for that sort of activity and CDRPs may sponsor those activities and bodies to carry out local activities on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/16">All of the Youth Justice Board's prevention and early intervention programmes promote social inclusion, crime reduction, drug-use reduction, social cohesion and anti-racism. The Youth Justice Board's (YJB) funding is mainly channeled through youth offending teams (YOTs) and does not directly fund sports organisations to run any projects such as Youth Inclusion. However, sports organisations are involved in the delivery of activities within some of the projects funded by YJB. The 2003 evaluation of the Youth Inclusion Programme (YIP) did show that sporting interventions were the most popular form of intervention with young people at risk of becoming involved in crime. Many YIPs are linked to Positive Futures and have the same client group.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/17">The Purposeful Activities for Asylum Seekers scheme provided funds for 38 organisations in 2003 that ran sporting activities. It is our intention that sports activities run under this funding scheme would help to promote social inclusion and anti-racism by bringing together asylum seekers with members of their local community in a friendly situation encouraging co-operation and communication.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/18">Any organisation wishing to apply for Purposeful Activity funding is eligible to run sporting activities as long as they do promote social inclusion and community cohesion. Organisations running sports-orientated events as a means of entertainment that could be interpreted as serving only asylum seekers and excluding the local community would not be eligible for funding. ra</p>

	<p pid="a.192.2/1">The Government are committed to delivering high quality decisions at all stages of the asylum system. Many improvements have already been made, including setting a specific target for decision quality, introducing quality assurance systems involving both internal and external assessment, enhanced training and use of language testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/2">We are determined to build on these improvements to ensure that the highest standards are consistently achieved. We are discussing with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees how they might work with us to provide an additional external assessment of the quality of decisions. We are looking at other ways of strengthening the quality of assurance systems, including sampling a cohort of the same cases at each stage of the initial decision process. We are developing greater external input to our training from other organisations with specialist skills and have introduced the Independent Country Information Advisory Panel to ensure that the country information is as accurate, objective and up to date as possible. These and other measures will continue to drive up the quality of initial decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/3">Despite the rapid fall in the number of asylum applications in 2003, down to 49,370 and 41 per cent lower than in 2002, we have maintained the resources available for decision-making on asylum claims. This has enabled us to reduce the backlog of outstanding applications to 24,500&mdash;the lowest level for a decade&mdash;and to increase the investment in initial and refresher training for asylum caseworkers. ra</p>

	<p pid="a.194.8/1">Since the study was published in 2002, the respective responsibilities of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) and local authorities have been clarified in the House of Lords (R vWestminster City Council (ex parte NASS)). On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-25">25 March 2004</phrase>, the Home Office issued a consultation document on proposals for the support of asylum seekers with care needs. The consultation document aims at establishing a clear process for asylum seekers with care needs so that they can receive appropriate care and that the most vulnerable cases are recognised, and suitable care organised, at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.8/2">NASS has special teams that deal with complex and specific cases of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.8/3">All NASS staff receive induction training that covers race and equality issues. It is important that all staff dealing with people with diverse needs are properly equipped to both understand and help meet them as required. The approach in NASS is to ensure our staff treat people with dignity, civility and understanding and our learning and development opportunities focus on this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.8/4">NASS officials are also working with a local authority-led working group that is considering how to collect data on asylum seekers with care needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.8/5">We have also introduced induction centres. As part of the induction centre process health screening, including an assessment of primary healthcare needs, is offered. The asylum seeker is given a record of the health assessment to take with them on dispersal. ra</p>

No child in the United Kingdom is deprived of UN rights but entry to the United Kingdom solely to claim such rights should not be permitted. It would not be right for the immigration rules to be utilised simply in order to make use of convention rights when there already exists in United Kingdom law comprehensive provision for the care and protection of children. The Children Bill does not alter the Government's conclusion that the reservation is necessary to maintain an effective immigration control.</p>

This would include providing a suitable private consultation area for patients. We hope to conclude discussions shortly, and, subject to a further ballot of contractors, implement the new framework later in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.5/1">Some of the new and extended provisions of the revised social charter are not clearly defined and appear to require open-ended commitments from governments. The European Committee of Social Rights (ECSR) considered the application of the revised charter by the first states that had ratified it, for the first time in 2002&ndash;03. In its conclusions on the first national reports, the ECSR stated that it will progressively determine its interpretation of the amended and new provisions and has asked the relevant countries for a range of additional information to help it do so. The UK Government hope that definitions will be clearer following forthcoming interpretations from the ECSR in 2004&ndash;06, to help to inform its decisions on which of the new or extended provisions of the revised charter it can accept with a view to ratification.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.6/1">My previous response stated that any attempt to estimate the level of imports of biomass or its source would be highly speculative and the data unreliable. Consequently, it would be also doubtful that we could make any such calculations on transportation costs in terms of average carbon equivalent emissions per MWh of electricity generated as they would again be based on unreliable and not readily available data.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/2">However, a recent study carried out in support of the Renewables Innovation Review made a comparision of the CO2 emissions from imported Baltic woodchips and home-grown willow for combustion CHP. This information is the closest we have to that requested but it is related to CHP rather than co-firing. The results as compared to emissions from combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) were as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.206.6/5"> <td></td> <td></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.206.6/6"> <td colspan="2">&mdash; CO2 emissions for willow combustion CHP:</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.206.6/8"> <td>Using imported Baltic woodchips:</td> <td>up to 138g/kWh (an increase of up to 90g/kWh over UK fuel because of transport)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.206.6/9"> <td>&mdash; CO2 emissions from CCGT:</td> <td>387g/kWh</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.206.6/12">There is a significant increase in emissions from imported fuel compared with the use of domestic resources, but emissions from imports are still just over a third of the emissions from CCGT.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.5/1">The rising trend in home accidents involving wooden floors is a reflection of the increasing popularity of this type of flooring. The Department of Trade and Industry has no plans to take any specific action with regard to the instructions provided by manufacturers or fitters. As with other similar flooring surfaces, such as ceramic tiles and vinyl, consumers should take the normal precautions to reduce the risk of falling accidents. These include wearing slip-resistant footwear, avoiding polishing under rugs and mats and mopping up immediately any spilled liquid.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.2/52">The construction of the sites was funded by &pound;120 million of Sport England lottery funding and partnership funding from a variety of sources depending on each individual project. The sources of partnership funding ranged from sponsorship, direct university funding, local authorities, regeneration funding and funds raised by sports clubs. There was partnership funding on all of the English Institute of Sport sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/53">The sites are owned by the individual agency(s) who received lottery funding and, as such, are responsible for the ongoing operation of the sites. Some of the sites are owned by universities (such as Bath and Loughborough), some are owned by local authorities (including Manchester and Birmingham City Councils), others by sports clubs (such as Hayling Island Sail Club) and some are enhancements to existing national sports centres (Bisham Abbey).</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/54">National governing bodies (NGBs) are charged a fixed pre-agreed amount to use the facilities. The facilities costs are met from the NGBs' current world class plans, and the remainder of the costs being accessed by the sites via an application to Sport England. Thus there is sufficient funding to ensure athletes have required use of the facilities and the facility owners have certainty of funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.2/55">Across the network, &pound;1.5 million has been set aside by Sport England to cover the costs of all NGB's facility hire costs in 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04. Funding in the NGB lottery-funded world class performance plans augments this figure. In effect therefore, NGBs do not have to allocate any of their own resource to cover the costs of the usage and delivery of services in the English Institute of Sport network. The funding identified above does not cover any revenue deficits generated by the facilities and is targeted at meeting the costs of the NGB usage only. Any operational deficit is met by the site owners.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.2/1">The costs of elite governing body use of the English Institute of Sport sites are met through governing bodies' world class performance plans and a lottery-funded facility hire programme. This ensures that governing bodies have autonomy in deciding the most suitable location for their athletes to train and facility owners have confirmation that there will be funding available to cover their overheads. Facility owners have to apply to Sport England to access the facility hire budget and each application is assessed to ensure maximum benefits are derived from the funding. In addition Sport England monitors the grants to measure their effectiveness on an ongoing basis for the duration of the grant period. The programme is in its infancy, but the early indications are that governing bodies are gaining sufficient access to sites and facility owners are able to meet their requirements effectively as there is sufficient funding in place to cover their costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.8/1">The up to &pound;2.375 billion funding package described in the memorandum of understanding between the Government and the Mayor of London published in June 2003 makes allowance for the potential public sector contribution to support the staging of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This is in addition to private sector sources of funding such as sponsorship and television rights. Beyond this, the Government, as stated in the memorandum of understanding and reiterated in a departmental minute presented to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-02">2 December 2003</phrase>, have given a commitment to be the ultimate guarantor for the Games. On current contingency plans, the Goverment would expect to discharge this responsibility, should it arise, in a sharing arrangement to be agreed as appropriate with the Mayor of London and for their part seeking additional National Lottery funding.

They set out how the main elements of a directive have been, or will be transposed into UK law. They are available in print from departments and should also be accessible via departmental websites. The full text of UK legislation which transposes EU directives into UK law can currently be accessed at no charge using the search engine on the HMSOnline website (<a href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk">www.hmso.gov.uk</a>), where entry of details of the directive will provide a link to the legislation which transposes the directive into UK law. This can be, however, a cumbersome arrangement for users and Her Majesty's Stationery Office, as part of its plans for the future development of Legislationonline later this year, plans to deliver an improved facility for users where they will be able to link directly from the full text of the UK legislation to the full text of the directive as published on the Europa website.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.2/1">Since their inception in the early 1970s, it has been the nature of special adviser appointments that they should be outside the rules of fair and open competition as they are personal appointments made by the Minister at his or her request to meet particular needs. For these positions, Ministers seek a combination of political and personal commitment, relevant expertise and personal trust and confidence. It is because of this combination of qualities required for the job that the Civil Service order in council and the Civil Service Commissioners' recruitment rules recognise that it is necessary to exempt such posts from the normal Civil Service recruitment rules. simone</p>

	<p pid="a.217.5/1">Information on the number of complaints received by the Parliamentary Ombudsman is set out in her annual report. Information on the number of complaints received by parliamentary ombudsmen in other countries is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, I have written to the noble Lord offering him a factual background briefing from the Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration on the handling of complaints by equivalent ombudsman schemes in other countries. I understand that France operates a similar scheme to that operated in this country in terms of access to the ombudsman.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.2/1">Under the terms of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, complaints to the Parliamentary Ombudsman must be made through a Member of the House of Commons. The review of the public sector ombudsmen in England, published in 2000, considered the case for introducing legislation to create a direct right of access by members of the public to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. As my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March</phrase> made clear, discussions with the Ombudsman on this issue are continuing.</p>
