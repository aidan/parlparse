	<p pid="c.193.5/1">The revised guidance document <i>Working Together to Safeguard Children</i>, which the Government plan to publish in spring 2006, will set out guidance for children's social care, police and other agencies on how to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, including children who are the victims of trafficking. The Government have recently published for consultation a comprehensive draft UK action plan on human trafficking, which recognises the need to improve our knowledge of the scale and nature of the issues affecting children.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.5/2">The Government recognise the importance of identifying at the earliest opportunity any children who may have been trafficked. Operation Paladin, funded by the Government and based at Heathrow Airport and the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon, demonstrates our commitment to combating child trafficking. Operational staff at these locations work together to identify children who may have been trafficked, and set an example of a positive multi-agency partnership between the Metropolitan Police, immigration officials and children's social services.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.5/3">The Home Office is continuing to develop the Government's strategies to combat child trafficking, including a review of identification and assessment processes, training for front-line operational staff, and a review of how current practice might be improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.5/4">The consultation on the Government's draft UK action plan on tackling human trafficking seeks the views of interested organisations on how this work should be taken forward. The consultation concludes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-05">5 April</phrase>, and responses to it will further assist in improving identification procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.5/5">An obligation to notify private fostering arrangements to the appropriate local authority was created and brought into force by the Children Act 1989. The Children Act 2004 strengthened the role of local authorities in a number of ways, including a requirement that each local authority should actively promote public awareness in their area of the legal requirements as to notification. The notification requirements are designed to assist local authorities in promoting the welfare of privately fostered children, rather than as an enforcement measure against organised crime.</p>

We will continue to argue that this should be based on the need for rural development and not on historical expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.0/2">The UK has also chosen to undertake significant voluntary modulation from Pillar 1 to ensure that sufficient funds are available for domestic rural development. It is possible to transfer up to 20 per cent. of Pillar 1 funds in this way to agreements made after 2006. This is vital to the UK and in England it will fund our new environmental stewardship scheme. However, Ministers are still to decide what level may be needed and on the likely size of the new rural development programme to operate from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>. In England, we are currently planning to launch a public consultation concerning the content of the new England rural development programme for 2007&ndash;13 in February 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.199.2/1">During the pause for reflection following the French and Dutch referendums, the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) will evolve on the basis of the arrangements set out in the Nice Treaty. On that basis, the Government were able to use their recent presidency of the EU to drive forward our agenda for ESDP to be more active, more capable and more coherent. Key achievements include the finalisation of the requirements catalogue of military assets needed for the missions the EU wants to undertake, the completion of a concept for comprehensive planning for EU crisis management and a range of operations in the Balkans, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. We expect the Austrian and following presidencies to be able to make similar progress on the same treaty basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.2/2">The European Defence Agency and the development of EU battlegroups are referred to in the Constitutional Treaty as criteria for participation in the proposed &quot;permanent structured co-operation&quot; in ESDP. But both are independent of that treaty: the former is separate from the single institutional structure, with a legal basis created by a joint action in July 2004; the latter is a capability initiative established by EU council conclusions in June 2004. Both came into effect before the French and Dutch referendums. Neither requires or depends on implementation of any section on ESDP in the Constitutional Treaty.</p>

The advice on use in pregnancy was that, ideally, pregnant women should stop smoking without using NRT but, if this is not possible, NRT may be recommended to assist a quit attempt as it is considered that the risk to the foetus of continued smoking by the mother outweighs any potential adverse effects of NRT.</p>
