	<p pid="a.129.2/1">The spokesperson for the Afghan Women's Network was the only Afghan woman who attended the main London conference. She gave a presentation on behalf of Afghan women and circulated a written statement on this to all conference participants. A delegation of Afghan female leaders was also involved in a series of events in the run up to the conference. They took part in a civil society conference where they made statements, and questioned and lobbied FCO Ministers. Members of the delegation also attended a reception on the eve of the conference, where they used the opportunity to lobby President Karzai, Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton and other Foreign Ministers. In addition, the delegation attended a parliamentary meeting which took place at the House of Commons to discuss gender, peace and security in relation to Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">Other conference attendees were Foreign Ministers from ISAF partners, Afghanistan's immediate neighbours and key regional partners together with representatives from NATO, the World Bank, IMF and other international organisations. Three of these participants were women.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/3">The UK is fully committed to gender equality and fully<I></I>supports implementation of UNSCR 1325, to protect the rights of women and girls in areas suffering conflict and to incorporate their perspectives in conflict resolution and peacekeeping planning. To encourage the Afghan Government to implement this resolution we are funding various programmes, to promote women's equal participation in governance and to build awareness of women's rights among civil society and policy-makers. This includes funding of &#163;200,000 to support the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission; &#163;737,000 to UNIFEM's Elimination of Violence against Women Special Fund; and &#163;500,000 to a five-year women's empowerment programme.</p>

The Government have no immediate plans to promote one particular starchy food above another. All government healthy eating messages look to promote food choices that are lower in saturated fat, sugars and salt.</p>

These payments are used to drive high performance and form part of the pay award. There are two types of award: in-year bonuses, which consist of special individual performance awards and non-pay rewards that recognise strong performance in particularly demanding tasks for situations. Staff in receipt of a special bonus may also have received an annual performance award. Annual performance awards are paid to members of staff who receive a highly successful performance rating.</p>

The performance-related pay scheme is designed to help drive high performance and support better public service delivery. Performance awards are non-consolidated and non-pensionable. The percentage of the pay bill set aside for performance-related awards for the SCS is based on recommendations from the independent Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>

The department was created by merging the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS). DIUS and BERR were themselves created as part of a machinery of government change in June 2007. This means that BIS in its current format did not exist to award performance awards in any of the previous three years. The information below has been drawn from various data sources and provides details for both of the former departments that were merged to create BIS.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.3/1">Mr Jackson has raised concerns around the circumstances in which family members may be appointed as personal welfare deputies under the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/2">It is important to make clear that any decision to appoint a deputy in a given case is entirely a matter for the Court of Protection and will be taken based on the individual circumstances of the case. If an applicant is unhappy with the court's decision then they are at liberty to appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/3">In making any such decision, the court's powers are subject to the provisions of the Act and, in particular, to the principles of the Act and the requirement that any decision is in the best interests of the person concerned. The court must also have regard to the Act's requirements that a decision by the court is to be preferred to the appointment of a deputy and, where the appointment of a deputy is necessary, their powers should be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/4">The code of practice issued under the Act specifically advises that deputies in personal welfare cases will only be required in the most difficult cases, such as those involving important and necessary actions that cannot be carried out without the court's authority, or in situations where there is no other way of settling the matter in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity. In many cases the existing provisions of Section 5 of the Act will generally provide sufficient authority to make decisions in the best interests of the person lacking capacity without the need for a deputy to be appointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/5">It was never the intention of the Act that personal welfare deputies would be routinely appointed without establishing to the court's satisfaction why the appointment is necessary and in the best interests of the person concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.2/1">Proposals are being developed to introduce dedicated funding for selected clinical placements as part of the review of the Multi-Professional Education and Training (MPET) budget, which was commissioned following Lord Darzi's Next Stage Review. Implementation has been delayed at the request of stakeholders who have asked the department to ensure that any changes are carefully considered and, where appropriate, piloted before implementation, so as to avoid any unforeseen consequences such as destabilising clinical education, or organisations providing National Health Service services. The department supports this prudent approach and currently plans to start implementation in April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/2">Currently, the cost of supporting clinical placements for nurses, midwives and allied health professionals is included within general service prices. These costs are fully funded but the total costs are not identified or funded separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/3">Cost data collected from a sample of NHS organisations (as part of the MPET Review), to inform possible future placement rates, suggested that the aggregate sum invested in clinical placements for undergraduate medical students exceeds estimated costs by around &#163;100 million per annum. The cost of clinical placements for pre-registration non-medical students proved more difficult to assess, because of the wide range of courses, settings and support provided in respect of different clinical placements. The review therefore concluded that it was not possible to establish a single, simple, universal non-medical clinical placement rate from such a limited costing exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.2/4">Proposals have therefore been developed to use the placement rate that is used successfully for undergraduate training in social care, pending more accurate identification of the non-medical clinical placement costs through the annual reference costing exercise that is undertaken by all NHS trusts. These proposals are currently being considered with the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.3/1">The costs associated with increasing numbers of assessments have been included in the administrative component of table 2 in the Impact Assessment for the Personal Care at Home Bill. The costs of assessment for those already receiving free care or partially funding their care are in the system already. A copy of the Impact Assessment has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/2">In the absence of firm data at this stage, we have assumed that the average cost of an assessment is &#163;200 and that 135,000 extra individuals will be assessed per year, giving an overall cost estimate of &#163;27 million per year, as shown in the impact assessment. This has been included in the estimated overall annual costs of &#163;670 million per year for 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/3">Councils that are not currently differentiating between people in the Fair Access to Care Services (FACS) Critical band and those in the Substantial band are not following the current FACS guidance, which makes it clear that councils should be doing this already.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/4">There would clearly be some additional assessments for people who are self-funders, or those with previously unmet needs and these are reflected in the estimates. For those in the FACS Critical band, who will need a further assessment of their personal care needs, we will be developing a simple, national tool to determine people's personal care needs which will ease the burden on authorities and ensure a consistent national approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/5">No separate estimate has been made of the numbers of additional staff who may be required to carry out assessments. It is for councils to decide how best to use the additional funding they will receive to manage services. In some cases, this may involve the redeployment of existing staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/6">The cost of implementing the Personal Care at Home Bill will be reviewed after 12 to 18 months. Any decisions on funding allocations to councils will be made in light of the review findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/7">The funding of &#163;670 million available for the proposed measures requires councils to make significant efficiency savings (of &#163;250 million in a full year) and this pressure, along with the scope for further efficiency gains, will be considered as part of the normal Spending Review process.</p>
