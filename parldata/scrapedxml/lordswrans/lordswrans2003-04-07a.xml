	<p pid="a.2.8/1">The Government have received no requests, in recent months, for a review into the law on sexual offences in Northern Ireland. However, the Government are conscious of the pressing need to conduct such a review and are fully committed to doing so. The Government have received a number of requests for the full extension of the Bill to Northern Ireland in response to the campaign of the Northern Ireland Gay Rights Association. Part 2 of the Bill will extend to Northern Ireland in so far as the measures determining the notification requirements for sex offenders are concerned. The extension of this part of the Bill follows a Home Office lead review into the Sex Offenders Act which included Northern Ireland within its scope. However, while some aspects of Part 1 will extend to Northern Ireland, to ensure that registration requirements can operate on an equal basis with England and Wales, the greater majority of the provisions contained in Part 1 will not. Part 1 of the Bill was framed on the basis of a review of sex offences which did not include Northern Ireland. It is therefore right and proper that we proceed with a public consultation and review of this issue for Northern Ireland before similar reforms can be enacted there.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">As part of our agenda on modernising local democracy, the Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, has laid before Parliament regulations dealing with remuneration and pensions for members of local authorities. This is in line with our White Paper commitment to reduce the burden of red tape on local authorities and providing councils with flexibilities in managing their business, balanced by local accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/2">The Local Authorities (Members' Allowances) (England) Regulations 2003 (the &quot;allowances regulations&quot;) replace six existing sets of regulations and put in place a consolidated and simplified regime for allowances.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/3">The Local Government Pension Scheme and Discretionary Compensation (Local Authority Members in England) Regulations 2003 (the &quot;pensions regulations&quot;) will allow councils to decide whether their councillors should have access to the local government pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/4">These two sets of regulations give effect to the broad policy announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November 2002</phrase> in our response to the Urban Affairs Select Committee Report on the Local Government Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/5">Both the allowances and pensions regulations, which we have introduced following extensive and detailed consultation, will provide a simple, fair system for remunerating local councillors. Local authorities will have discretion to come up with remuneration schemes reflecting local circumstances. The system also provides for clear and transparent local accountability since councils will have to have regard to the recommendations of local independent remuneration panels. This approach is in line with our commitments given in the White Paper, Strong Local Leadership, Quality Public Services, to remove unnecessary red tape and regulation from local government, and balancing this freedom with the responsibility to be clearly accountable to their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/6">The allowances regulations replace the six previous sets of regulations dealing with allowances for elected local authority members, dating back to 1991 <sup>1</sup> , which we have now revoked. As before, councils will be able to decide for themselves the levels of allowances for elected members, and in doing so will have to have regard to the recommendations of a local independent remuneration panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/7">The allowances regulations make a number of changes to the system of allowances, following from consultation we conducted in 2001 and further detailed discussions with key stakeholders, including the Local Government Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/8">Local authorities will now determine their own travel and subsistence allowances, having regard to the recommendation of their independent remuneration panels. The Secretary of State will no longer be involved in setting maximum levels. Councils will have to set out the circumstances in which they will pay these allowances, so that these are open to public scrutiny. Local authorities and other bodies will be able to pay a cycling allowance to be determined in the same way as other travel allowances.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/9">Parish councils will be able to make payments to their members, and in doing so will have to have regard to the recommendations of a local independent panel. This brings the allowances to parish councillors very much in line with the allowances for principal councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/10">Combined fire authorities and the conservation boards of areas of outstanding natural beauty will be able to establish their own schemes of allowances, rather than members being paid by their constituent authorities. All secondary authorities which set up allowance schemes for their members will be required to have regard to the recommendations of the panels of those authorities which make nominations to the secondary authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/11">Councils will be able to pay co-opted and appointed members of principal councils a &quot;co-optees' allowance&quot;. This will be determined by the local authority, taking into account the recommendations of the independent remuneration panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/12">Authorities will be able to make provision for the withdrawal of allowances where a member has been wholly or partially suspended because of a breach of the code of conduct. Authorities will be able to make provision for the repayment of any allowance which has been paid in respect of a period when a member was suspended, or had ceased to be a member.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/13">The council's local independent remuneration panel will make binding recommendations on which councillors may be eligible for access to the local government pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/14">The Association of London Government may pay special responsibility allowance to those serving on it. The ALG must establish a scheme specifying for which responsibilities the allowance may be paid, and the levels of payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/15">The allowances regulations clarify that authorities may backdate changes to their allowances to the beginning of the financial year. They similarly clarify that authorities may alter their allowance levels by reference to an index.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/16">The allowances regulations finally provide a transitional period until <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-30">30 September 2003</phrase> to allow authorities to make any necessary changes to their schemes in line with the revised arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/17">The Local Government Pension Scheme and Discretionary Compensation (Local Authority Members in England) Regulations 2003 modify the principal regulations, The Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 1997. They are intrinsically linked to the allowances regulations. In effect the amendments provide access to the local government pension scheme (LGPS) to those councillor members whose authorities, acting on the recommendations of the locally appointed independent review panel (IRP), decide should be eligible for membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/18">The key changes to the LGPS as it applies to eligible councillor members are: they will be treated as if they are in local government employment for the purposes of the regulations; an eligible councillor will have positively to elect to become a member of the LGPS; a councillor member's pay in any year comprises (a) the basic allowance and (b) any special responsibility allowance payable under the allowances regulations; pension benefits will be calculated by reference to career average pay not final salary; the retirement age for a councillor will be age 70; and councillor membership will not count towards calculating any other period of local government employment/LGPS membership. An eligible councillor will be able to contribute to AVCs to enhance his pension benefits where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/19">Essential consequential changes have also been made to the injury allowances and gratuities provisions of the Local Government (Discretionary Payments) Regulations 1996 to exclude eligible councillors, the Mayor of London and members of the London Assembly in connection with their employment. The Local Government (Early Termination of Employment) (Discretionary Compensation) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 have also been amended so that the calculation of discretionary compensation for redundancy for a person does not include a period of membership as a councillor member, Mayor of London or member of the London Assembly that he may have in the LGPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/20">The regulations reflect our commitment made during the passage of the Local Government Bill which gave rise to the Local Government Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/21">The provisions for pensions take into account the commitment of local councillors, and their contribution to public life. Many members of local authorities may have lower personal or occupational pension provision than they could otherwise have had, due to missing out on full time employment or forgoing promotions and other opportunities on account of their public duties. The pensions regulations address this disincentive from serving in local politics.</p>

The three-month public consultation looking at the siting of satellite dishes and antennae will offer communities five choices, ranging from no change to full deregulation, except in particularly sensitive areas such as national parks and conservation areas. The Government are committed to delivering equality of access to broadband and digital TV across the country and this document is an important step in that direction.

We have also been considering whether to proceed with contract negotiations in respect of the Grand Ocean Hotel in Saltdean. I can now confirm how we intend to proceed with induction centre arrangements nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/2">In light of a thorough review of all the facts, we have decided not to proceed with an induction centre at the Coniston Hotel, Sittingbourne, and not to proceed with negotiations at the proposed site in Brighton.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/3">These decisions reflect the facts of the two cases, and the arguments put forward, and do not diminish in any way our commitment to having a national network of induction centres. In creating such a network, we intend to build on existing arrangements by proceeding in partnership with regional consortia and voluntary groups. Induction centres bring about obvious benefits in helping us to process asylum applications quickly and efficiently and allowing us to tell asylum seekers what is expected of them and to give them health screening. At Dover the induction centre is working well and we will build on this to develop the good practices that will be subsequently implemented at other centres. bern</p>

	<p pid="a.12.1/2" qnum="HL2422">What was the outcome of the visits to the United States by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary from 20 to 27 March.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-04-07a.13.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="13"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030407/text/30407w03.htm#30407w03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.13.0/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister visited Camp David on 26 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary joined him there on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase>. The Prime Minister dined with President Bush and the Foreign Secretary with Secretary Powell (in Washington) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase>; and they attended a session of plenary talks on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase>. The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary then went on to New York to call on the Secretary General of the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/2">Much of the discussions focused on the future, looking beyond the conflict but reviewed first the military situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/3">They noted that the military campaign was on track. The outcome was not in doubt. The coalition were prosecuting it with vigour and determination, but in a way which minimised, as far as humanly possible, civilian casualities and damage to infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/4">The coalition were also working intensively to ensure humanitarian relief. In recent days RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; has delivered humanitarian supplies (including water, rice and lentils) at Umm Qasr; the drinking water plant in the same town has been repaired and the drinking water pipeline from Kuwait completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/5">The Prime Minister and President Bush made clear their joint commitment to reuniting the UN Security Council in expectation of further work on the post-conflict political process and reconstruction.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/6">At Camp David, the Prime Minister and President Bush agreed that progress on OFF was the key humanitarian priority. More than half of Iraq's people depend on OFF for their food. So it was urgent for the Security Council to give the Secretary General authority to start getting OFF food to them. The necessary security Council Resolution (1472) was indeed adopted unanimously in the Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/7">The Prime Minister and President Bush made clear that we would seek new UN resolutions to affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, to ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief and endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/8">President Bush made clear US commitment to the establishment of a new Iraqi government chosen by the Iraqi people themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/9">The Middle East peace process was a major feature of the Prime Minister's discussions with President Bush. President Bush, the first US president to do so, publicly restated his vision of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security and reiterated his commitment to implementing the roadmap. He noted that he saw an opportunity to bring renewed hope and progresss to the entire Middle East.</p>
