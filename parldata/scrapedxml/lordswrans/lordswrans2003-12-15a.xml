	<p pid="a.100.2/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary indicated recently that there is no obvious limit on the number of migrants entering the United Kingdom. This is not to say there should not be limits, but that immigration should be managed flexibly according to the needs of the economy on the one hand and the capacity of public services and the impact on community cohesion on the other. This is precisely the Government's policy of managed migration.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.0/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister welcomes the commitment expressed by the Audit Commission to a strategic approach to inspection. The other bodies which inspect local government have also expressed a commitment to the principles of proportionality and co-ordination. This is in line with the Government's policy on the inspection of public services, which was published in July this year. Significant progress has been made; inspections are better targeted to where they will do most good and the timing and content of such inspections are better co-ordinated. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believes much more can still be done to improve the effectiveness of inspection and is working with all those who inspect local government to deliver this.</p>

This new draft planning policy statement carries forward the &quot;town centres first&quot; approach established in PPG6 (1996), and clearly sets out positive planning policies, which will encourage investment and growth in city, town and other centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/3">This statement makes clear that development should be focused in existing centres in order to strengthen and, where appropriate, regenerate them, and that local planning authorities should: select appropriate, existing centres to accommodate the need for development; identify sites within and adjoining these centres for development or redevelopment; and provide for the growth of the town centre, expanding the town centre boundary where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/4">Due to the need for clearer and more concise statements of governmental policy, this PPS does not include technical advice or good practice guidance. The intention is to publish separately a number of companion guides addressing the implementation of the policy. These will include advice on: assessing need and impact in respect of new retail and leisure development; applying the sequential approach; and strategies for smaller centres.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.2/1">In 1998, in response to public concern, Ministers initiated a high priority review of all anticholinesterase compounds approved for use in non-agricultural and agricultural pesticides. The reviews of products for non-agricultural use have been undertaken by HSE. These include products containing the organophosphate compounds azamethiphos and dichlorvos. The independent, expert Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) has considered all the available physical chemistry, efficacy and human health data supporting the individual active ingredients and made recommendations to Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/2">The risk assessments for azamethiphos in the recent UK review addressed chronic inhalation exposure to residents (adults and children) using scenarios based on reasonable worst case exposures, including prolonged exposure in a small room. Azamethiphos is considerably less volatile than dichlorvos and therefore much less likely to be present in the air. Vapona strips containing azamethiphos act more like baits; they contain attractants to bring the flies to the mat where the insecticidal action is via direct contact.</p>

This is because those returning to work after early July 2003 could claim after <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-03">3 October</phrase> and have the element backdated to the return-to-work date. Because of this likely underestimation, figures for the 50-plus element are not provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/17">Six million families were expected to benefit from the CTC and WTC by April 2004 and 5.9 million families are already doing so. Of these, 1.35 million families were expected to receive the higher support available through WTC, incuding 250,000 families without children. At <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-03">3 October</phrase>, 1.7 million were receiving WTC. More families than expected are therefore receiving the largest awards so that the most help is going to the families who need it most.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.6/1">My department is financing a number of bird studies associated with offshore wind farm developments but nothing is planned on the impact of colour on bird strikes. The requirement to paint nacelles and blades submarine grey was necessary to minimise visual intrusion when the wind farms are viewed from the shore. Each developer will have consulted widely on the proposed development but consultees on the draft orders included the relevant local council, port and water authority, the Chamber of Shipping, Countryside Agency, the Crown Estate, English Heritage, English Nature, Environment Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Royal Yachting Association, Radiocommunications Agency, RSBP, the Trinity House Lighthouse Service and a number of government departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.0/1">The extent to which retailers and others disclose their use of technology to customers or the wider public is a decision to be taken by the companies concerned. Some customers have concerns over the use of radio frequency (RFID) tags that could result in an unwillingness to shop at particular establishments should those concerns not be addressed. There are examples of where this has happened. There are also instances where retailers have successfully introduced or piloted innovative RFID systems and this success has, in large part, been due to the retailer explaining to staff and customers why the technology is being used and the limitations to its use, and offering customers the choice of removal or deactivation of RFID tags on purchase.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/2">It therefore appears that disclosure and choice in the use of RFID tags makes sound business sense and should be encouraged. The Department of Trade and Industry is in discussion with RFID technology suppliers and users to determine whether a disclosure regime similar to that applied to the use of closed circuit television (CCTV) would be helpful in this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.3/1">Last December, we announced the steps that the Department of Health was taking to strengthen our plans against any deliberate release of biological agents, including smallpox. That announcement included three main components: improved vaccine stocks; a plan of action; and a cohort of immunised staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/2">We have no evidence of a specific threat of smallpox attack on the United Kingdom. However, it is sensible and prudent to ensure that the National Health Service can deal effectively with any potential threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/3">Over this last year, we have taken action to increase substantially our stocks of smallpox vaccine, and have announced a contract for a second procurement. This will enable us to provide new vaccine for the whole population, if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/4">Our plan of action has been updated and revised following discussion and comment. The plan revisions incorporate valuable input from a wide range of medical experts and groups within the NHS as well as other government departments. Implementation of the plan is being co-ordinated by the Health Protection Agency's (HPA) regional leads. We are today publishing the revised plan, copies of which are available in the Vote Office and can be accessed on the Department of Health website at: <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/smallpox/smallpox.htm">www.doh.gov.uk/smallpox/smallpox.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/5">Regional smallpox response groups have been established in England, and core team members vaccinated in advance. We now plan to vaccinate a small number of ambulance workers to assist these groups, and to support the initial response to a smallpox emergency. Corresponding arrangements are being made for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/6">The department's primary strategy is still to contain and &quot;ring vaccinate&quot; around any outbreak.</p>

Courses and seminars specifically on parliamentary work vary from half a day to two days in length. Some include a visit to the Palace of Westminster.
