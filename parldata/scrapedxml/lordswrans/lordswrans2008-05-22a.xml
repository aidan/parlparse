In the UK, we have taken the view that currently the only fully effective method of removing spinal cord from sheep over 12 months of age is by splitting the carcase first so that both the food business operator and enforcement officers can clearly see whether or not spinal cord remains present.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/3">As I mentioned in my earlier Answers, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has advised the department that it is currently examining the effectiveness of alternative methods of removing spinal cord and verifying removal that do not require the carcase to be split. This will involve witnessing these alternative methods in action. The FSA has advised the department that they will arrange to meet with industry representatives to discuss the issue once their initial investigations have been completed.</p>

Our embassy in Minsk monitors details of arrests and detentions. We work closely with our EU and US partners to raise our concerns and maintain effective pressure for improvement, including through regular meetings of EU heads of mission in Minsk where human rights, religious freedoms and options for further action are discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/2">We are very concerned by the Belarusian Government's actions against protesters involved in the demonstrations on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-25">25 March</phrase> (and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-26">26 April</phrase>). On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-29">29 April</phrase> the EU issued a statement highly critical of recent regime actions and the French ambassador, as EU presidency in Minsk, made a formal demarche on Foreign Minister Martynov. We were similarly concerned to learn of the re-arrest of five individuals recognised by the EU as political prisoners, especially coming so soon after their release.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/3">We are aware of a fine, equivalent to US$650, imposed upon a Protestant leader and pastor of the New Life Church for organising a signature campaign to petition amendments to the 2002 religious law. The organisers of the campaign were judged not to have registered the group collecting signatures. The harsh treatment of the New Life Church pastor reflects a wider issue about the registration of non-governmental organisations and civil society groups and human rights violations in general, about which the EU regularly raises concerns. Meanwhile, the continued curtailment of religious freedom for Christians is of concern.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.2/2">Our embassy in Minsk, along with EU partners, continues to raise human rights concerns with the authorities.

	<p pid="a.208.2/1">The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that net deforestation rates (which include felling have fallen since 1990-00, but that some 13 million hectares (about the same area as England) of the world's forests are still lost each year, including 6 million hectares of primary forests.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/2">The FAO expects croplands in the developing world to expand by a net 3.8 million hectares a year over the next three decades. Gross expansion will be greater, because some farmland is abandoned and new demands may increase the pressure. The 10 countries with the largest net forest loss per year between 2000 and 2005 had a combined net forest loss of 8.2 million hectares per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/3">The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from deforestation to be about 5.8 GtCO2/yr during the 1990s, and more recently 8.5 GtCO2/yr in 2004, which accounts for just over 17 per cent of global CO2 emissions. This is similar to the estimate in the Stern review, which was just over 8 GtCO2/yr for the year 2000. Deforestation has a particularly strong effect on emissions because trees in tropical forests typically hold, on average, about 50 per cent more carbon per hectare than trees outside the tropics.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/4">In Montreal in 2005, the Conference of Parties (COP) under UNFCCC called for a two-year process to explore how deforestation in developing countries could be integrated into the climate process. A decision was agreed by the COP in Bali in 2007 which recognised that deforestation should be included in a post-2012 climate agreement and set out a process under the Bali action plan for establishing how to achieve this before the COP in Copenhagen in 2009. The UK Government are highly supportive of this decision, and are taking forward research in line with the Bali action plan to inform the development of an EU position.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.0/1">The UK/Croatia strategic partnership is delivering in many key areas. Among other projects, the UK has supported the development of alternative dispute resolution in the Croatian courts helping to reduce case backlogs and speed citizens' access to justice. There has been a wide programme of scholars visiting the UK, many with funds matched by host institutions or Croatian ministries. A UK anti-corruption adviser has provided legal and practical advice to the Ministry of Justice, towards meeting the requirements of the accession process. Co-operation between the two sides has led to UN-accreditation for the annual police peacekeeping training, held in Croatia, which also brings in participants from regional neighbours. Trade missions in both directions have developed direct business links, especially in priority sectors such as ports, financial services, and the environment. The two partners have also communicated the benefits of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation membership to the Croatian public, paving the way for a rise in levels of popular support and an invitation at the Bucharest summit.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.6/1">The UK/Croatia strategic partnership launched in March 2007 is a valuable framework for co-operation between the two countries. It sets out the areas in which the UK supports Croatia&mdash; in which there is a two-way exchange of ideas, experiences and best practice in light of the shared strategic goal of Croatian membership of the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)&mdash;and Croatia's role in spreading stability and prosperity to its neighbours.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.5/1">The Food Standards Agency's (FSA's) activities on salt include both consumer awareness campaigns, and work with the food industry to reformulate products with lower salt levels. The 0.5 gram reduction in salt intakes that has been achieved so far as a result of this work is estimated to have resulted in 3,500 lives being saved annually. It is not possible to estimate the morbidity avoided specifically.</p>

Through the UPR, we welcomed Pakistan's recent decision to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. We also asked how Pakistan plans to ensure the full implementation of these covenants to safeguard the rights of all citizens of Pakistan including non-Muslim minorities, by repealing laws that discriminate against them. In addition, we asked Pakistan's delegation to the UN Human Rights Council what practical and legislative plans the Government of Pakistan have to safeguard religious, social and cultural rights for minorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.5/1">The job specification for the head of the UK Trade and Investment Defence and Security Organisation, was part of a 12-page information pack for applicants, a copy of which has been placed in the House Library for reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.5/2">The post was publicly advertised in the <I>Sunday Times</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-09">9 March 2008</phrase>, in accordance with the guidance set out by the Office of the Civil Service Commissioner. UKTI engaged an executive search agency from the Cabinet Office call off contract to run the search and advertisement on behalf of the department. The advert described the role in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.224.5/3" class="indent">&quot;UK Trade and Investment is taking on responsibility for HM Government's strategic engagement with business in support of UK defence and security sales overseas. The newly formed UKTI Defence and Security Organisation will comprise a mix of civilian and military staff, working within a wider organisation which draws on staff from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Ministry of Defence. The Head of UKTI DSO will sit on the UKTI Board and report to its chief executive, be based in Westminster, but travel extensively.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.5/4" class="indent">The key focus of this role is to lead UKTI DSO in its work to promote British defence sales worldwide by developing and maintaining close relations with overseas Governments. The Head of UKTI DSO will act in an ambassadorial capacity, presenting the UK's capability with impact at the highest levels and personally taking the lead in marketing to potential clients. He/she will also drive the development of UKTI DSO's service offering in the security sector and its role in attracting inward investment, as well as its engagement with business stakeholders on promoting the highest possible standards in the defence and security industries. Important stakeholders include other parts of government, the armed forces, the UK defence industry, and the broader business community. An important element of the role is the leadership of some 200 staff, and the integration of the new group into UKTI.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.5/5" class="indent">Candidates for this high profile, externally-facing role will be accustomed to operating at board level, to dealing with governments at Ministerial level and to leading complex negotiations. Knowledge of the defence sector would clearly be relevant, but UKTI is equally interested in considering candidates from both the private and public sectors with significant experience of leading international negotiations. An established leader of change is sought, with a strong international background, excellent communication skills and strategic ability&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.0/1">WRAP and its partners are running the &quot;Love Food Hate Waste&quot; consumer-facing campaign to address this issue directly. The campaign is being delivered in partnership with the Women's Institute, local authorities, the UK grocery sector, the food industry, government and organisations such as the Food Standards Agency. Its aim is to develop practical advice, to help us all get the most from the food we buy, and to waste less of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/2">The campaign highlights quick and easy things that consumers can do to reduce the amount of food thrown away, including better planning before going shopping, and storing perishables in the fridge. WRAP is also in discussion with retailers to extend in-store advice about home storage. If followed, this should prolong the life of the food that is purchased.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-08">8 May 2008</phrase>, WRAP published a report entitled, <I>The Food We Waste</I>. This report provides an objective assessment of the amounts and types of food that we buy, but do not eat. Key findings from the research are that, in the UK, we throw away around one third of the food we buy, and of that, 61 per cent (4.1 million tonnes a year) was avoidable waste. The most common reason for food being wasted is that it is left unused until it goes off or out of date; this accounts for 61 per cent (2.5 million tonnes) of the avoidable food waste. Of this, almost 1 million tonnes is not even touched, and at least a tenth (340,000 tonnes) is still in date. We also cook and prepare too much, resulting in an additional 1.6 million tonnes of food waste a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/4">This research report will help the campaign to focus on the key areas for future behaviour change.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/5">Progress on the campaign, which was launched in November 2007, will be evaluated with the rest of WRAP's 2006-08 business plan and will be set out in detail in WRAP's annual review for 2007-08, due to be published in October 2008.</p>
