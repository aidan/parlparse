	<p pid="a.266.2/1">Well run pubs are part of the solution to alcohol misuse through the provision of a regulated and civilised environment. A well managed pub is one that complies with licensing law and promotes the four statutory licensing objectives in the Licensing Act 2003. For example, offences under the Licensing Act 2003 include selling alcohol to a person under 18 years of age or to a person who is drunk, allowing disorderly conduct on the premises and breaching the conditions attached to a premises licences.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.2/2">The statutory licensing objectives include the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, the prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm. Responsible pubs work with the police and licensing authorities on best practice initiatives such as Best Bar None and local pub-watch schemes, which help to promote these objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.2/1">There are a number of established national statistical surveys that collect data on alcohol-related health harms and alcohol-related crime and disorder. The Government have always been clear that the licensing of premises where alcohol is sold cannot be considered in isolation from other factors such as national and local alcohol strategies and other interventions to reduce and prevent alcohol related crime and disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/2">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) evaluation of the impact of the Licensing Act in 2008 found there were signs that crimes involving serious violence may have reduced since the changes to the licensing regime, but there was also evidence of increases in the small proportion of violent crime occurring in the small hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/3">The evaluation also suggested that licensing reform has not been accompanied by an overall increase in alcohol consumption. The evaluation concluded that licensing regimes may be one factor in effecting change to a country's drinking culture, but do not appear to be the critical factor.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.6/1">MoD Consignment Tracking (CT) enables visibility of equipment moving within the Joint Support Chain (JSC), from industry to the front line, and covers every physical activity that happens to a consignment during its journey. It provides a demonstrable link between the consignor's and consignee's inventories, starting with an issue or task issue order requiring movement through the JSC and ending with receipt onto account by the consignee. The MoD uses a range of measures to track equipment across the JSC, governed by the <I>Defence Logistic Support Chain Manual</I>, which provides the general and system specific processes and procedures for all stakeholders within the JSC to track consignments.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.6/2">The major In-Service CT information systems include: Royal Navy Invoicing and Delivery System;Visibility in Transit Asset Logging (VITAL);Total Asset Visibility, an active Radio Frequency Identification based system, which passes movement data to VITAL; anddata from Commercial carriers' systems (including Parcelforce, Palletways and DHL).</p>
	<p pid="a.269.6/3">These CT systems in turn interface with other information systems, in order to provide logistics decision support via systems such as Management of Materiel in Transit (MMiT).</p>
	<p pid="a.269.6/4">As a result of experience from Operations TELIC and HERRICK, six major business change projects are underway, supported by information systems, to make significant improvements in the JSC, which will enable operational commanders to sustain current operations and plan for future ones more effectively. Initiatives include:</p>
	<p pid="a.269.6/5">Joint Asset Management and Engineering Solutions: for engineering and asset management across Land equipment;Consignment Visibility: to provide the necessary data for MMiT, alongside that gathered from the MOD's commercial carriers;Air Movements Operations: to ensure efficient use of the Air Transport Fleet movement planning, asset scheduling and freight processing;Management of the Joint Deployed Inventory: offers operational logistic support for enhanced visibility and improved management of the deployed inventory; andElectronic Business Capability: to provide units with seamless visibility of Land items managed under Contractor Logistic Support arrangements from industry to the final tracking point.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.6/6">In tandem with these change projects, the Future Logistics Information Services (FLIS) Project aims to further rationalise the complex supply chain delivering Logistic Information Services across Defence.</p>

However, we are engaging with the Government of DRC (GoDRC) on the importance of adhering to the constitutionally mandated term limits and holding elections within the constitutional timeframe. For local elections this means February 2011, for national elections this means September 2011. GoDRC have announced their intentions to hold elections to this timeframe, and we fully support this.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.0/1">For the purposes of registering to vote, a &quot;qualifying Commonwealth citizen&quot; is an individual who either does not need leave to enter and remain in the United Kingdom, or who does need such leave and has it (Section 4(1) and (6) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (&quot;the 1983 Act&quot;)).</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/2">Regulations made under the 1983 Act (the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001), provide that a person's application for registration must, among other things, state their nationality and include a declaration that the details given in the application are true. The Electoral Registration Officer has the power to require any person to provide information relating to the eligibility of that applicant, namely regarding their age, nationality, residence and whether or not they are disqualified (Regulation 23). Where an Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) has doubts about a person's nationality or immigration status, the ERO may require the person to provide evidence including a statutory declaration that he or she is a qualifying Commonwealth citizen (Regulation 24). Provision of false information to a registration officer for any purpose connected with the registration of electors is an offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/3">Where any elector changes address they must make an application for registration at their new address providing details of the address where they were previously registered. The procedure is the same as for other registration, and the Electoral Registration Officer may require the same information to be produced in relation to nationality.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/4">In addition, the details of all electors, whether resident in the UK or overseas (except service voters), are verified each year by way of the annual canvass. If the Electoral Registration Officer is not satisfied that a person is eligible to be registered at an address or does not otherwise fulfil conditions for registration, including nationality, then the Electoral Registration Officer may remove that elector from the register.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/5">The UK Border Agency has not issued specific advice on this issue. Electoral Commission guidance states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/6">&quot;If the Electoral Registration Officer has any doubts about the eligibility of any applicant, they have the power to require any person to provide information relating to the eligibility of that applicant, namely regarding their age, nationality, residence and whether or not they are disqualified.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/7">Additionally, if the Electoral Registration Officer has doubts about the age or nationality of any applicant, they may also require that person to provide evidence demonstrating that they meet either or both of these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/8">The items which should be accepted by the Electoral Registration Officer as evidence of a person's age or nationality include:</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/9">a birth certificate or a statutory declaration stating the applicant's date of birth; and</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/10">a certificate of naturalisation a document showing they have become a Commonwealth citizen</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/11">a statutory declaration that they are a qualifying Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or a European Union citizen.&quot;</p>

The report of the analysis, <I>Osteosarcoma Trends In the West Midlands</I>, has not been published, but a copy has been placed in the Library. The West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit compared data held on its cancer registration database on the incidence of osteosarcoma in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas by age and sex over the period 1989 to 2005. There were only 211 cases found in the West Midlands in the 17-year period, with no trend in the data identifiable. The Unit accepts that case control studies would offer the best means by which the causes of ostesarcoma could be assessed but, with such low incidence, it would take a long time for significant results to appear.</p>

	<p pid="a.288.5/1">The possible use of cats, respectable or otherwise, to control the rodent population in the Palace of Westminster has been considered and rejected on a number of practical grounds. For example, the cats would ingest mouse poison when eating poisoned mice; there would be nothing to keep them in the areas where they are most needed, or to stop them walking on desks in offices and on tables in restaurants and bars; they can carry fleas and other parasites; and many people are allergic to cat hair. However, the Administration is taking a wide range of other control measures such as significantly increasing the number of bait boxes and traps, sealing mouse access points and intensifying the cleaning regime to minimise the presence of crumbs in the bars and food outlets. The age, construction and location of the Palace of Westminster are such that it will never be possible to eradicate mice entirely, but all appropriate measures are being taken to minimise the numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.2/3">Article 10(2) of the order provides that an inspector should give 24 hours' notice of the intended entry into premises that are, or form part of, a private dwelling house. This is not intended to give an inspector a power to enter such premises without consent or by force.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.2/4">Article 10(3) of the order covers the position when entry has been refused, in which case an inspector must apply for a warrant. The possibility of refusal of entry without a warrant is specifically catered for in Article 10 of the order, which provides alternative measures that the inspector will be required to employ in order to exercise their functions. This involves obtaining a warrant.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.2/5">It is not the intention that the obstruction offences in Article 12 of the order should apply where entry with 24 hours' notice has been refused. The possibility of a refusal is specifically catered for in Article 10 of the order, which provides alternative measures that the inspectors will be required to employ in order to exercise their functions. This involves obtaining a warrant. Once an inspector has obtained a warrant, they should not be obstructed from exercising their functions.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.5/1">The fundamental principle that the police are impartial and free from political control is enshrined in legislation and was underlined in the 1998 Good Friday agreement and reinforced by the 1999 Report of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland (the Patten Report). The concept of the operational responsibility of the Chief Constable was highlighted in the Patten Report and in Northern Ireland is effected through the role of the Policing Board; it is entirely consistent with his operational independence. The agreement at Hillsborough Castle does not, therefore, change the status of the Chief Constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.5/2">Policing arrangements in Northern Ireland have worked well and continue to work well; the high level of public confidence in policing is evidence of this. The latest figures show confidence standing at 79.6 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.5/1">The Government have worked with a number of British non-governmental organisations on conflict prevention and resolution in the South Caucasus in recent years, including International Alert, Conciliation Resources and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting. Lessons specific to the South Caucasus conflict environment have included:</p>
	<p pid="a.292.5/2">domestic civil society in the South Caucasus remains weak in some areas. There is a need to work with project partners to try to build up the strength and role of civil society; a coalition of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including where international organisations partner local ones, can often be more powerful than NGOs working in isolation, as shown by the work of the Consortium Initiative on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict;monitoring and evaluation of projects is important not just for accountability and to gauge progress against objectives, but to maintain flexibility in the South Caucasus region in response to changes in the conflict environment;the importance of achieving government and elite buy-in; and of leveraging the support of other major donors. Georgia in particular saw huge international aid flows in the aftermath of the Georgia-Russia war and donor coordination remains important to avoid duplication and gaps;economic incentives can transcend administrative and political boundaries, as evidenced by International Alert's project, Economy and Conflict. This project builds consensus by identifying constituencies of people who have a stake in the peace process;working through British NGOs can be valuable. The Government benefit significantly from the established long-term links and trust that these organisations build up with local actors across conflict divides, and consequently are able to achieve more in a shorter timeframe than would otherwise be possible. It is important, however, to ensure that objectives are regularly reviewed and projects remain relevant to the Government's priorities and the needs of the local environment; andsupport to the South Caucasus media infrastructure can help to challenge entrenched stereotypes of &quot;the enemy&quot; and tackle the information isolation problem inherent in many communities in the region. It has also been valuable to fund work that fosters grassroots research and debate, building capacity among local think-tank organisations.</p>
