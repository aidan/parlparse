	<p pid="b.143.2/1">The deployment of UK Forces to Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led international security assistance force is expected to peek at around 5,700, before reducing to around 5,000 in the autumn. As with all operational commitments, we will continue to review requirements as circumstances change.</p>

	<p pid="b.143.11/1">Aquaculture in England consists largely of the cultivation of trout in freshwater and bivalve molluscs (eg oysters and mussels) in marine sites, although production is relatively small in relation to the UK as a whole and to other member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.11/2">Defra has sponsored projects investigating the nature and extent of the impact of aquatic contaminants (effluents, pesticides, antibiotics and hormones), arising from intensive aquaculture, on the reproduction, migration and survival of wild salmonids, as well as an investigation into the impact of non-native fish species on indigenous stocks. In addition, and related to shellfish aquaculture, the department has sponsored a research project assessing the ecological impact of using wild mussel seed in mussel culture. We have also commissioned a project which aims to develop best practice in movements of shellfish stock for aquaculture (to avoid further distribution of introduced pests).</p>

	<p pid="b.144.5/1">The Government are fully committed to securing an international treaty on the trade in all conventional arms. We are working with a range of partners to bring forward a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly first committee this autumn, which will start a formal UN process. We want to make good progress, but this must be at a pace that will take other countries with us. Our latest round of global lobbying clearly indicated that, while there is good support for the start of a UN process beginning with the formation of group of governmental experts, there is at this stage only very limited support for moving straight to an open-ended working group. We shall continue to work closely with a wide variety of partners in the run-up to first committee.</p>

	<p pid="b.147.6/1">European legislation states that each competent control authority shall, with regard to the requirements or standards for which it is responsible, carry out checks on at least 1 per cent. of all farmers submitting aid applications. It goes on to say, where the legislation applicable to the act and standards already fix minimum control rates, those rates shall in so far be applied instead of this minimum rate.</p>

	<p pid="b.154.0/1">Four Iraqis were alleged to have been made to walk into the Shatt Al Basra Canal; the deceased, Mr Hanoun and two others who appear not to have been known to Mr Hanoun and did not come forward as witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.0/2">Mr Hanoun provided an initial statement to the Royal Military Police, which was recorded in English with the aid of an interpreter. The statement had the usual declaration on it that the statement was true to the knowledge and belief of the witness and that he made it knowing that if it was tendered in evidence he would be liable for prosecution if he wilfully stated in it anything that he knew to be false or did not believe to be true. It was unclear, following evidence at the trial, whether the statement was ever read back to him before he signed it and there was no addendum at the bottom of the statement that had been signed by the interpreter to indicate that this had been done.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.0/3">The Royal Military Police Special Investigations Branch (SIB) then took over the case and video interviewed Mr Hanoun, assisted by a locally employed SIB interpreter. In the UK a detailed examination of the translation took place when a written transcript of the interview was prepared (it became apparent that there were significant inaccuracies with the interpretation that had taken place at the time the interview was conducted). Further written statements were taken from Mr Hanoun with the benefit of an interpreter and this process was recorded onto tape and the translations checked.</p>
	<p pid="b.154.0/4">All recordings and videos were provided to the Army Prosecuting Authority together with transcripts. The tape recordings and video of Mr Hanoun's witness interviews were not played to the court other than very small excerpts. While a full transcript of those interviews was available and used in cross-examination it was not produced to the court.</p>

	<p pid="b.166.5/1">The UK works closely with the UN mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the Kosovo Government and other international organisations seeking to improve the judicial system and tackle organised crime and corruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.5/2">The UK provides around 65 police officers to UNMIK to assist with law enforcement in Kosovo and provided expertise and equipment to increase the effectiveness of the Kosovo Organised Crime Unit (now called the Directorate of Organised Crime). We have provided witness protection equipment to the local district courts in order to enable them to secure a victim's testimony and also specialist IT training for the Kosovo Police Service. In addition, the Department for International Development is working to strengthen the new Ministries of Justice and Interior. Our contribution in supplying the witness protection equipment was recognised by Soren Jessen-Petersen, UN special representative in Kosovo, in his recent report to the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.5/3">We also contribute almost 19 per cent. of the funding to the EU's external assistance programme to the western Balkans&mdash;the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme. Between 2005 and 2006, CARDS has allocated &euro;143.5 million to Kosovo, &euro;11.6 million is devoted to justice and home affairs issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.5/4">The instrument for pre-accession replaces CARDS from 2007 as the EU's financial instrument which streamlines all pre-accession assistance within a single framework. The EU has not yet reached a decision on the financial allocations for any of the countries covered by the instrument.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.5/5">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also paid for an official from the Department for Constitutional Affairs to go to Kosovo last December to carry out an assessment on the Kosovo judicial system. The findings acknowledged progress that UNMIK has made in setting up a judicial system in Kosovo, and also highlighted the challenges that this fledgling structure still faces.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.5/6">We will continue to look for other opportunities to support the Kosovo Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.173.0/1">Economic partnership agreement (EPA) negotiations between the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the European Union are in progress. It will not be possible fully to assess what protection has been secured for these countries until those negotiations are finalised by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/2">However, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-10">10 April</phrase> the General Affairs and External Relations Council agreed conclusions, which highlighted the need for the EPAs to be &quot;development instruments complementary to the overall development efforts in order to eradicate poverty and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals&quot;. These conclusions also emphasised the need for EPAs to take into account &quot;all parties' respective political choices&quot; and stressed the importance of the scheduled review of EPAs, as outlined in the Cotonou agreement, scheduled to take place later this year. The conclusions make clear that this review should be full and comprehensive with participation by the ACP and, as supported by the UK, it should determine whether the development needs of the ACP are being addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.173.0/3">The UK has been instrumental in engaging other EU member states on EPAs through various fora established during our presidency of the EU; we believe that without this engagement these council conclusions may not have happened. The UK will work to ensure that the development commitments in these conclusions and set out in the Cotonou agreement are taken forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.175.5/1">The cornerstone of preventing obstetric fistulae is prompt access to good quality healthcare when needed. DfID is committed to helping countries expand access to healthcare, including family planning, safe abortion services, antenatal and obstetric services.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.5/2">DfID is the only major bilateral donor to have a strategy focused on reducing maternal mortality. Copies of the first progress report on the strategy have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.5/3">The effects of fistula can be devastating for the lives of girls and women, whose babies often die. Rendered incontinent, they are often rejected by their husbands, thrown out of their homes and excluded from community life. DfID is therefore committed to promoting the rights of girls and women, particularly their sexual and reproductive rights. DfID is also committed to the elimination of harmful practices such as early marriage and female genital mutilation which can significantly increase the risk of fistula.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.5/4">DfID bilateral expenditure on maternal and reproductive health has increased by 42 per cent. over the past three years to &pound;243 million. DfID targets some funding through NGOs to tackle obstetric fistula. For example, DfID has provided a grant of &pound;558,000 to the Engender Health and Women's Dignity Project to combat obstetric fistula in Tanzania and Uganda, and &pound;140,000 to the Obstetric Fistula in Africa Project. To complement our country level support, DfID channels funds through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). DfID provides &pound;20 million a year core funding and in 2004, &pound;10 million specifically for reproductive health supplies. DfID also provides an annual contribution of &pound;19 million to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and &pound;12.5 million to the World Health Organisation (WHO), whose programmes support work on women's empowerment and maternal and reproductive health.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.5/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-27">27 June 2006</phrase>, the UNFPA will be launching a high-profile media campaign on obstetric fistula. I will attend this event on behalf of the Secretary of State for International Development.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.5/6">The UNFPA has chosen to locate the campaign in the UK to maximise the political commitment of the UK to addressing the millennium development goal targeted at improving maternal health.</p>
