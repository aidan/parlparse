In particular, they must comply with the data protection principles. Among other things, these require appropriate technical and organisational measures to be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data. The Act also makes it an offence knowingly or recklessly to obtain or disclose personal data without the consent of the data controller.</p>

These regulations make provision in England for the enforcement of two new European labelling regulations for GM foods which will take effect automatically in all member states on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-10">10 April</phrase>, as well as consolidating all earlier GM labelling provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/2">The first of these, EC Regulation 49/2000, amends Regulation 1139/98 on the labelling of foods containing GM soya and maize, to extend the scope of the requirements to include foods for catering establishments, and to establish a 1 per cent de minimis threshold for the adventitious contamination of non-GM material, below which GM labelling will not be required. The second, EC Regulation 50/2000, will require for the first time the labelling of foods and food ingredients which contain GM additives and flavourings.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/3">The Government are determined that consumers should be able to make informed choices about whether or not to eat genetically modified foods, and these new regulations will strengthen further the arrangements already in place for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/4">A letter is being sent today to interested parties advising them of the content of the regulations and enclosing a copy of the text. A regulatory impact assessment for the regulations has been prepared and placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

By <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April</phrase>, arrangements will be in place for all the RTBs to work to RDA boundaries for strategic development. The two main changes are that South West Tourism will take the lead for the whole south-west region, including Dorset and Wiltshire (currently covered by Southern RTB) and Gloucestershire (currently covered by Heart of England RTB); and the Heart of England will include Lincolnshire (currently covered by East of England RTB), so it can work to East Midlands RDA boundaries. However, it is important to add that for tourism marketing activities the RTBs will work to whatever areas make sense for the consumer.</p>
