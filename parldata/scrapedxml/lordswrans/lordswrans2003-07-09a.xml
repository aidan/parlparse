Similar arrangements apply for any motorway or trunk road. That said, the noble Lord is no doubt aware that motor vehicles would only be disabled in the way he suggests as the result of nuclear attack, and we currently believe that the likelihood of such an attack being launched against the UK is very low.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.5/1">The Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 only introduces exceptions to copyright so that visually impaired people, or charitable or similar organisations acting on their behalf, can make accessible formats of books, subject to certain conditions, but without infringing copyright. The Act does not, therefore, require publishers to make accessible formats, but I understand that the publisher of the latest Harry Potter book is making efforts to ensure that it is available in accessible formats.</p>
