Particular responsibilities identified in the response are to:</p>

Preliminary short advice has already been circulated to airlines and tour operators, and more detailed advice will be issued to general practitioners and the airline industry and made available through the NHS Direct website shortly. The aim of producing such advice is to ensure that passengers have access to detailed information on the risk of deep vein thrombosis to allow them to make informed choices before they fly. The group has been particularly impressed with some of the material provided by UK airlines for their passengers in the form of pamphlets or videos.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.8/9">Representatives from airlines and other interested parties attended a meeting of the group on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-04">4 May 2001</phrase>. At this meeting the airlines gave information on current practice in relation to issues such as in-flight medical emergency equipment and noise on-board aircraft. The group is now considering whether current practice in these areas meets the needs of passengers and crew members.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.8/10">The group will also give detailed consideration to the need for further research on aviation health matters once the scoping study that is currently under way is completed in July 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.5/1">We have no plans to delete references to sound recordings in Section 72 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. We have, however, consulted interested parties on the possibility of changes to the scope of this exception to copyright governing the playing or showing of broadcasts in public places where the public has not paid for admission. Under the exception, the producers of sound recordings receive no royalties for the playing in public of any sound recordings in the broadcasts, although they will have done so for the original inclusion of the sound recordings in the broadcasts.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.0/1">The Government have taken a series of measures to strengthen the response to threats to legitimate businesses by animal rights extremists. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 provides additional powers to protect companies and individuals from intimidation and harassment. The Act also provides for regulations under the Companies Act 1985 to disapply the requirement for company directors who are at serious risk of violence or intimidation to file their home address on the public record. Instead, they will be permitted to file a service address, which will appear on the public record. They will still be required to file their home address, but this will be kept on a secure register, with access restricted to law enforcement agencies and others that the regulations may specify. My department is working on the regulations in order to lay them before Parliament as soon as possible. In May, the Government set up a ministerial committee, chaired by the Home Secretary, to develop strategies to tackle animal rights extremism.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/2">The Department of Trade and Industry has undertaken to operate banking facilities for Huntingdon Life Sciences plc, which, owing to intimidation of bank staff by animal rights extremists, has been unable to find commercial facilities in the UK, while negotiations with banks continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/3">These actions demonstrate the Government's commitment to take positive action to ensure that companies are not prevented from undertaking legitimate business through intimidation and harassment of their staff or suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.3/1">The latest assessment put direct losses to tourism for 2001 at between &pound;2 billion and &pound;4 billion. Much will depend on the length of the outbreak and its geographical pattern. My officials are gathering further hard evidence to keep the assessment up to date. The impact in 2002 or 2003 cannot be assessed now. Since the beginning of the outbreak the Employment Service has been tracking the number of claims made for jobseeker's allowance where the claimant has identified foot and mouth disease (FMD) as a cause. The total number of claims attributable to FMD between <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-23">23 February 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-01">1 June 2001</phrase> is around 6,500. For those whose employment has been affected by FMD there are additional measures in place, including training, reskilling and upskilling.</p>
