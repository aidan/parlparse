	<p pid="a.107.2/2">We expect to be able to publish shortly the results of independent monitoring from samples taken in April 2009. We will be looking at whether a majority of labels are covered by the expected information and whether the content is consistent with the 2007 voluntary agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">If we find that most labels are still not complying with the voluntary agreement, we will consider what action we can take to improve compliance, including using existing powers under the Food Safety Act to make this a mandatory requirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.3/3">Your recent Parliamentary Question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response. (HL5984)</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/4">As part of Ofsted's annual programme of survey inspections, agreed in 2008, we are undertaking a survey of education otherwise than at school. This survey will cover elective education at home, as well as those children that go missing from school. It will provide independent inspection evidence about the quality of provision and outcomes for this group of children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/5">We have identified a representative sample of 15 local authorities, based on the estimated size of the population of children educated otherwise than at school, and the location and type of the local authority, for example whether it is inner city, rural, urban, coastal or in a conurbation. Ofsted publishes the names of providers and areas visited for survey work in the final report rather than in advance of our visits, enabling us to carry out short notice visits that give us a better picture of practice on the ground. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to provide the individual local authority names at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.3/10">All home educating parents in the 15 local authorities are being offered the chance to meet inspectors and to complete a voluntary, anonymous questionnaire. The information that parents give to inspectors will contribute to the evidence base for the survey, and will help to reflect the views of parents and the young people being educated at home. The questions will be about the parents' reasons for deciding to educate at home, the numbers and ages of the children involved, what has assisted parents as home educators and what the barriers have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/11">Responses in meetings and to any questionnaires will be anonymous, and will be treated with the same high degree of confidentiality as all our inspection evidence. Local authority officers will not be present at the meetings and will not see the anonymous responses to the questionnaires, which are being returned directly to Ofsted. The local authorities will not have access to the evidence or findings other than what is included in the main report.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.6/1">The number and type of animals kept in a zoo or safari park are only material in the rating assessment in so far as they meet the expectations of visitors, given the nature and size of the hereditament in question. The animals are not rateable items and the number and type present do not directly translate to the quantum of the rating assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.6/2">Accordingly, the approach to assessment by the Valuation Office Agency does not involve a tariff for different types of animal.</p>
