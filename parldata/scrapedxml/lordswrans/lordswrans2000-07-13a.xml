	<p pid="a.37.2/1">The Government have now approved the procurement of Type 45 Destroyers, in line with our firm commitment to a modern and effective destroyer and frigate force. Subject to the satisfactory completion of negotiations, a contract will be placed later this year with the prime contractor, BAE Systems, for the first three of these ships, and including some major long-lead equipment for a further three, at an estimated cost in excess of &pound;1 billion. It is planned that the first and third ships will be assembled by BAE Systems Marine, and the second ship by Vosper Thornycroft. The first of class is expected to be launched from the BAE Systems Marine Scotstoun yard on the Clyde.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">The class is to be named the 'D' Class and Her Majesty the Queen has graciously agreed to the first of class being named HMS &quot;Daring&quot; and the second HMS &quot;Dauntless&quot;. This revives two names that have served the Royal Navy well since the early 1800s.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/3">The ships will be equipped with the PAAMS Anti Air Missile System, a collaborative programme with France and Italy, and will provide highly effective area defence against aircraft and missiles. In addition, the Type 45 Destroyer will be a multi-role, general purpose platform capable of operations across the spectrum of tasks from peace support to high intensity warfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/4">The first of class will enter service in 2007. We expect that an order for the second batch of ships will be placed around 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/5">Construction of these new ships will sustain up to 3,000 jobs directly in the shipyards over the next 10 years and will sustain or create almost as many elsewhere in the defence industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.6/1">The Government use a variety of sources to estimate the number of disabled people in the UK, including census figures. The 2001 census will include a question on illness and disability, which will provide robust information on people of all ages.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.6/2">However, the census information does not take account of the number of people covered by the Disability Discrimination Act. In particular, the census figures do not indicate whether a disability has a &quot;substantial, adverse impact on a person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities&quot;. Equally important, the census is only carried out every 10 years, so more up-to-date figures on disability need to be found from other sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.6/3">The Government use the Labour Force Survey to provide up-to-date disability figures on quarterly basis for all adults of working age. This involves interviewing adults from 65,000 households every quarter. Respondents are asked about health problems or disabilities that last for more than a year; whether these affect the work they might do and whether these substantially limit a person's ability to carry out normal day to day activities. This allows the Government to provide with a high degree of accuracy, the number of people of working age covered by the Disability Discrimination Act, as well as the economic activity of disabled people more generally.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">The Government and Railtrack recognise that the rail approaches to Liverpool Street Station require attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">Last year, my department published a revised Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse (under the Environmental Protection Act 1990). Railtrack is subject to the code, which sets out how quickly different types of railway land should be tidied of litter and rubbish to a set standard of cleanliness. The Railways Act 1993 (Consequential Modifications) Order 1999 applies to Railtrack provisions in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 requiring statutory undertakers to clear litter and rubbish from their land. Under the order, Railtrack faces being taken to court if it does not comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/3">For its part, Railtrack has put up litter awareness posters at stations. Its contractors are required to maintain the standard of cleanliness of all track and to clear litter within timescales shorter than those required by law. Also, it is working with the Tidy Britain Group, and with the Environment Agency's Flytipping Forum, to identify ways of tracking litter and associated problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.5/1">Further to my Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-26">26 June 2000</phrase>, although recommended list prices are made available to dealers, they are not publicly available. The European Commission obtained recommended retail prices for May 1999, but has not been able to obtain them for this year. However, under the draft Supply of New Cars Order 2000, which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State proposes to issue very shortly, it will be incumbent on manufacturers to notify dealers, at intervals of three months, the list price and discounts available and the volume discounts available. This will ensure greater transparency and will be beneficial to consumers.</p>

This compares with 75 known confirmed and probable cases of vCJD throughout the United Kingdom. Statistical experts advise it is unlikely that the higher number of cases in Leicestershire will have occurred by chance.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/2">A locally based investigation is now under way to look into the circumstances of this apparent cluster. To that end, the Department of Health, through its Regional Office of the National Health Service Executive, will be working closely with the local health authority and its public health department as well as with experts from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the National CJD Surveillance Unit, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre of the Public Health Laboratory Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/3">It is important to recognise that the cases we have identified will have been exposed to the infective agent many years ago. Control measures to protect public health from risk of exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy have been in place for many years and progressively strengthened over recent years, and the Government will continue to take whatever steps the experts recommend. The Food Standards Agency stands ready to assist with the investigation as necessary and will in particular wish to be satisfied that no new factor is involved in these cases which requires further action to ensure the safety of food.</p>

The British Government condemned the massacre of 1915-16 at the time and viewed the sufferings of the Armenian people then as a terrible tragedy. The current Government in no way dissents from that view. But in the absence of unequivocal evidence to show that the Ottoman administration took a specific decision to eliminate the Armenians, British Governments have not recognised the events of 1915-16 as genocide.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.5/1">Wherever developments give rise to human rights concerns, we take every realistic, responsible step to pursue those concerns. This means we discuss human rights issues with the majority of countries in the world as the need arises. We do not keep a fixed list of countries that we engage with in order to promote human rights. We follow closely the full range of human rights issues in each country and raise human rights with other governments in response to developments. Nor do we adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to responding to human rights concerns. We take the approach most likely to help the people whose rights have been abused, and engage with other governments whenever and wherever that can contribute to improvements on the ground.</p>

A measure such as the Tobin tax could also introduce economic distortions to the international financial system.</p>
