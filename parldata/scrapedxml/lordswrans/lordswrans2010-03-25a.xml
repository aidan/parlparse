To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the personal capability assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on the incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits, so for example, the decision for a customer claiming benefit on the grounds of a mental and behavioural disorder would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the personal capability assessment.</p>

The laws appear to force the National League for Democracy to expel Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners from the party, or disband and withdraw from the political process. The laws also require political parties to endorse a constitution imposed through a sham referendum and place severe restrictions on their ability to campaign. In view of these and other restrictions, planned elections cannot be free and fair. The military government appear intent on further marginalising the democratic opposition and Burma's many ethnic groups, when only a fully inclusive political process stands any chance of delivering stability and solving Burma's many problems.</p>

MINUSTAH has played a critical role in providing support to the Haitian Government for a number of years, including for free and fair elections such as the presidential elections in 2006. It will continue to do so for the next presidential elections, which we hope will take place as soon as conditions allow, and at the latest before the end of the current president's mandate.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.2/3">The UK believes that follow-up to the PDNA is best supported by multilateral institutions, including the World Bank, European Commission and Inter-American Development Bank. The UK's share of the reconstruction funding already announced by these organisations amounts to around $50 million. The UK will use our position as a major shareholder in the multilateral bodies to ensure the priorities and principles the institutions set for their allocations in Haiti address the most pressing needs-informed by the recommendations of the PDNA and the Government of Haiti's strategy for reconstruction and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.2/4">Additionally, experts from the UK Government's Stabilisation Unit are advising the Haitian Ministry of Justice on a programme of prison rebuilding. This is part of an international donor effort to rebuild and improve the prison sector in Haiti. Improving prison conditions had also been a priority before the earthquake. The work is now continuing, and the team are also providing advice to the Haitian Ministry of Justice on introducing international standards on prison management, as well as better security management and contingency planning.</p>

	<p pid="a.321.2/2">The public interest would not usually require a prosecution if the youth admitted the offence and had not previously been convicted of an offence or received a warning from the police.

	<p pid="a.321.2/3">Youths are usually only referred to the CPS for prosecution if the youth denies the offence or if the youth has already received a final warning or has been convicted of an offence. The CPS will consider each case on its merits and would take into account the interests of the youth and factors such as the reasons for begging, the prevalence of the offence in the area, whether the begging was aggressive and whether members of the public had complained.</p>
