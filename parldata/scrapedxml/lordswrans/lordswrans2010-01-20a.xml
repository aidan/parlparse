	<p pid="a.260.2/1">The Hampton Implementation Review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) forms part of a series of reviews of the work of 36 national regulators against the principles of good regulatory and enforcement practice first set out in the Hampton report, <I>Reducing Administrative Burdens: Effective Inspection and Enforcement</I> (2005).</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/2">The findings of the HFEA report reflect the views of a team consisting of peer reviewers drawn from other regulators and Better Regulation Executive officials, who visited the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in April 2009. The review conclusions are based on a range of evidence, including interviews with regulator staff and stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/3">In its report, the Hampton review team commends significant aspects of the HFEA's work as well as highlighting some areas for improvement. Since the review, the authority has already undertaken a number of steps to improve processes and address the issues raised. This work will continue, informed by the final report.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/4">The findings of the report are for the HFEA to consider and it will implement changes as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.5/1">The 2006 Aetiology and Ethnicity of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses (AESOP) study of ethnicity and psychosis in England found rates of psychosis up to nine times higher for African Caribbean communities than for the White British population, six times higher for African communities and increased risks of a smaller degree for other Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups. In contrast, rates in the Caribbean and Africa are comparable to the overall rate in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.5/2">In December 2008, over 450 community development workers (CDWs) were in post. These CDWs work directly with BME groups in their area, raising awareness of mental health issues and of available services and also highlight the specific needs of these groups to local health services in order to improve their experiences of mental health services. Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health (DRE), a five-year action plan for improving mental health services for BME communities, has developed a better understanding of BME community and service users' attitudes towards mental health and the services provided. The programme has supported the development of 79 community engagement projects nationally to forge partnerships with the voluntary and community sectors (VCS) and to develop the skills base of people involved with small BME VCS organisations. A report describing the work of DRE and an analysis of the community engagement projects is to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.5/3"><I>New Horizons-towards a shared vision for mental health</I>, which was launched in December 2009, will build on the work of the DRE programme, consolidating this work into a wider mental health equalities context. This is because it has become increasingly evident that we need to consider all strands of equality together-ethnicity cannot be dealt with in isolation. New Horizons aims to ensure that we have an integrated approach and equalities are an integral part of the programme. A Ministerial advisory group is being set up which will oversee this work.</p>

During the meeting, leaders agreed to adopt the Trinidad and Tobago Affirmation on Commonwealth Values and Principles which reaffirmed the Commonwealth's commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and human rights covenants and instruments. The affirmation also commits the Commonwealth to strengthening its work in implementing human rights through support for Governments, state institutions and civil society organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/2">The UK remains deeply concerned about the proposed introduction of a Private Member's anti-homosexuality Bill in Uganda. We used CHOGM as an opportunity to raise our concerns, including by the Prime Minister to President Museveni and I also raised it with the Ugandan Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.3/1">We have not discussed calls for a reduction in the US aid programme with the US State Department, but we are in close touch with donors to Uganda, including the US, on the anti-homosexuality Bill currently being considered by the Ugandan Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.3/2">I made clear our concerns about the Bill to the Ugandan Foreign Minister in the margins of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Trinidad in November 2009. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister also raised the issue with President Museveni of Uganda. Our High Commissioner in Kampala has lobbied the Ugandan Prime Minister and other Ministers and continues to raise our concerns in contacts with the Ugandan authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.6/1">The Government fully respect the independence of the courts of the United Kingdom. In accordance with standard practice, the Government will provide to the courts information which they request for the purposes of the consideration of a case.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.6/2">Arrest warrants can however, be sought and issued without any prior knowledge or advice by a prosecutor. This is an unusual feature of the legal system in England and Wales. The Government are concerned about the impact that the issue of a warrant in such circumstances may have on the international relations of the United Kingdom. It is important that the UK, as a permanent member of the Security Council, is able to talk to all leaders from around the world who are involved in conflicts and disputes, including current and former Ministers and officials. That is not in contradiction to our determination to uphold our responsibilities for so-called universal jurisdiction. We share the cross-party consensus to abide fully by our obligations to uphold international law on war crimes, which we did in 2005 in respect of an Afghan warlord.</p>
