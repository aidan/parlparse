The UK has also deployed a police adviser to work in the PRT to help support the reform of the Helmand ANP and identify how the UK might support the acceleration of capacity-building through training, mentoring and the provision of equipment.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>, she wrote to the Burmese Foreign Minister drawing his attention to the interest that Parliament has shown in the issue. My right honourable friend the Minister with responsibility for trade, investment and foreign affairs, Ian McCartney, summoned the Burmese ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-15">15 June</phrase> and wrote to the Burmese Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July</phrase>, urging the Burmese Government to allow all Burmese citizens the freedom to express religious belief, including the freedom for the Rohingya community to build and repair mosques.</p>

There are no plans to make to the UN joint representations with Governments of Islamic countries about the problems facing the Rohingya.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.5/1">In common with other members of the international community, we made it clear to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) before the missile launches that this would be seen as a provocative act, which would add considerable tension to an already complex regional situation. Following the launch on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary issued a Statement condemning the launch. The Statement can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website at: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage">www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage</a>&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029391638&amp;a=KArticle&amp;aid=1152008539175. We also made clear our views to the DPRK ambassador, who was summoned to the FCO, and directly to the DPRK Government in Pyongyang. The EU also issued a firm statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July</phrase> protesting against the launches and we are working with EU partners to maintain a robust line. The EU statement can be found on the presidency website at: www.eu2006.fi/news_and_documents/cfsp_statements/vko27/en_GB/1152098594098/. The UN Security Council is discussing the matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.2/1">We are very concerned about the reports of an attack on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July</phrase> on Hamrat esh-Sheikh, a city in north Kordofan. The newly formed National Redemption Front claimed responsibility. However, it seems more likely to have been carried out by north Darfur rebel groups led by the Sudan Liberation Army/Unity with some Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) involvement. This is a clear attempt by spoilers to extend the Darfur conflict which has caused so much suffering.</p>

We call on all sides to implement the Darfur peace agreement and previous ceasefires, to which all in the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and JEM have agreed.
