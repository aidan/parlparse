	<p pid="b.188.0/1">There is currently no independent review mechanism for foster carers. However, Clause 29 of the Children and Young Persons Bill currently being considered by Parliament, amends Schedule 2 to the Children Act 1989, to allow for the independent review of decisions by fostering service providers on the suitability of foster parents. This mechanism will allow all prospective and existing carers whose approval has been turned down or removed the option of having the decision reviewed by an independent panel.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.0/2">Under the Bill, the panel will not have the power to consider or resolve allegations against foster parents; this function will remain with the fostering service provider. However, the DCSF has funded the publication of a range of information and training materials relating to improving the way in which allegations against foster carers are handled and to support foster carers through that process. In addition, a review of the implementation of guidance on handling allegations is currently under way and the outcome of this review is due to be published in early 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.196.0/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 requires a report to be made to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) on every cycle of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment carried out in the United Kingdom. This report includes information on the number of eggs retrieved from the patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/2">While the HFEA has responsibility for the overall regulation of IVF treatment, decisions on whether to discontinue treatment in individual cases are matters of clinical judgment, taking account of professional guidance on the management of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). In many cases it may be possible to continue with treatment after an adjustment to the patient's ovarian stimulation regime. Details of decisions made on patient care are recorded in local health records, which can be examined by HFEA inspectors when they visit the clinic.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/3">The seventh edition of the HFEA's code of practice, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July 2007</phrase> to coincide with the introduction of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Quality and Safety) Regulations 2007 that implemented EU directive 2003/23/EC setting standards of safety and quality for human tissue intended for human application in respect of reproductive cells, requires any occurrence that is inconsistent with routine patient care to be reported to the authority. The HFEA expects an incident report from a licensed clinic whenever the clinic is made aware of a case of severe OHSS resulting in prolonged hospitalisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/4">The HFEA recognises that licensed clinics might not always be made aware of developments in patient care after initial treatment, so the data submitted via the incident reporting system is not sufficiently comprehensive to allow statistical analysis of all OHSS cases.</p>

These requirements are creating major operational difficulties for the UN Relief and Works Agency, leading to delays, higher costs and reduced outreach, ultimately limiting its ability to meet the needs of vulnerable Palestinians.

Any ice strengthening of ships' hulls for operation in ice-covered polar waters is decided by the ship owner in consultation with the classification society. The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) will be publishing early in 2008 an updated set of requirements that its members will be applying in order for a ship to be assigned one of seven ice classes, depending on the severity of the conditions expected to be encountered. The insurers of the vessel will take into account, in their assessment of a ship, any ice class that is assigned by a classification society to a ship that intends operating in such waters.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.5/2">The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting has not yet adopted any such guidelines, but has agreed comments and recommendations as to how the existing IMO guidelines for ships in operating in ice-covered Arctic waters could be used as a basis for ships operating in ice-covered Antarctic waters.
