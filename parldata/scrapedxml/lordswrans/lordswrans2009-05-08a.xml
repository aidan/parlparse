	<p pid="a.150.8/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April 2009</phrase> the Government of South Africa announced the introduction of a special dispensation permit for Zimbabweans entering South Africa. This will allow Zimbabweans to stay in South Africa for a period of six months; it will confer on them the right to schooling or education; to work; and to access basic healthcare. It is expected that this will lessen the pressures that large numbers of Zimbabwean migrants have created, such as in Musina, and will regularise economic migrants, who have previously sought to claim political asylum.</p>
