We are therefore conducting further analysis of the data. We aim to explore further the perceived effectiveness of ASBOs from the perspective of practitioners, perpetrators and communities affected by anti-social behaviour, and factors that contribute to the effectiveness of ASBOs. We also aim to draw out good-practice lessons from the findings. Publication is now planned for the new year.</p>

	<p pid="c.38.2/2">Letter from Colin Mowl to Lord Laird dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.2/3">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question asking why the question about ethnic groups in the 2007 census test in England does not include Ulster-Scots; and why it included Northern Irish. I am replying in her absence. [HL211]</p>
	<p pid="c.38.2/4">The question asking for national identity in England includes a category for &quot;Northern Irish&quot; to reflect user requirements identified through extensive consultation. The question also includes categories for &quot;English&quot;, &quot;Welsh&quot;, &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;Irish&quot;. A similar demand for the recognition of &quot;Ulster-Scots&quot; as an identity/ethnicity category in England did not emerge from the consultation and consequently the 2007 test question in England does not include a specific category, though people who wish to identify themselves in this way can do so through the write-in response option.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.2/5">The prime purposes of the 2007 census test is to assess the effect on response of posting out census forms and including a question on income, and to assess the feasibility of the major innovations in the proposed 2011 census design. The topics and questions for the test were selected on the basis of widespread consultation since the 2001 census involving local authorities, central government departments and other users of census data across the UK, but are not necessarily those that will be included in the census in 2011. The programme of consultation and testing is continuing and in particular a further consultation exercise on the ethnicity, identity, language and religion questions will be launched shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.2/6">It is important to note that space constraints on the census questionnaire will limit the number of response categories that can be used for each question.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.2/7">It will not be possible to confirm what questions are to be included in the 2011 census until the consultation and testing programme is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.2/8">A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals for the 2011 census in England and Wales is scheduled to be published in autumn 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.39.3/2">The Government take very seriously the issue of the corrupt misappropriation of public assets in developing countries and foreign bribery by UK companies and nationals. The Government will fund a new international corruption group to strengthen the UK's capacity to investigate and hence detect, deter and prosecute corruption occurring between developed and developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.3/3">The Overseas Anti-Corruption Unit within the City of London Police will increase the capacity to investigate, and to bring to successful prosecution, cases of foreign bribery by UK businesses and nationals operating in developing countries. The Proceeds of Crime Team within the Metropolitan Police will increase the capacity to investigate and recover the proceeds of money-laundering by politically exposed persons, through the UK's financial system. Assets will be recovered and returned to their country of origin. The repatriation of stolen assets will provide these countries with additional resources for poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.3/4">The UK also works internationally to provide assistance, under the mutual legal assistance scheme, in situations where individuals or Governments in developing countries want to bring a prosecution against one of their own nationals residing in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.3/5">The Government are also working through the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) to improve international co-operation on asset repatriation. UNCAC allows the freezing of assets to take place at an earlier stage. We plan to play a constructive role at the first conference of parties to UNCAC in Jordan in December.</p>

	<p pid="c.40.5/1">The relevant case file was destroyed in August 2003 in accordance with routine records management practice. The decision to refer was in fact taken before March 2001 by the then Solicitor-General. From the judgment of the Court of Appeal, it is clear that his reason for referring was a belief that, on the facts alleged and found by the jury, the sentence imposed was unduly lenient&mdash;a proposition with which the Court of Appeal agreed.</p>
	<p pid="c.40.5/2">The position on unduly lenient sentence referrals generally is that the law officers' consideration of cases is predicated on the basis that the conviction is safe. Law officers take into account the facts and circumstances of the case as it was put in the Crown Court and receive advice on sentence from lawyers involved in the prosecution. Advice on sentence is also received from experienced specialist barristers not previously involved in the case, as well as from lawyers in our own department. A case may not be referred to the Court of Appeal unless a law officer is satisfied that the sentence imposed was unduly lenient&mdash;that is to say that it fell outside the scope of what a judge could reasonably have passed in the case.</p>

	<p pid="c.42.8/1">The decisions in relation to disclosure were not in accordance with the existing guidance or, indeed, the spirit of the CPIA. The previous convictions for offences of dishonesty, and other material going to the reliability of the complainant's evidence, should have been disclosed, although whether it was actually deployed at trial would have been a matter for the defence.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.8/2">The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA) was in force at the time of this investigation and the subsequent proceedings. It then required the prosecution to make primary disclosure to the accused of any material that, in the prosecutor's opinion, might undermine the prosecution case. This test was subjective and based on the opinion of the individual Crown prosecutor, but it was supplemented by guidance for police officers and prosecutors. The guidance gave examples of potentially undermining material, including previous convictions or cautions of a witness, any other information that cast doubt on the reliability of a witness, or evidence of a motivation for making false allegations. The guidance stressed that previous convictions for offences of dishonesty would normally be relevant to a witness's credibility and should therefore be disclosed.</p>

The support available under SMarT at present amounts to roughly 50 per cent of the cost of training provided by maritime colleges. The tonnage tax features a minimum training obligation, which requires each shipping company entering the scheme to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet.</p>

	<p pid="c.51.4/2" qnum="HL102">How they plan to enforce targeted sanctions under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1591; and whether targeting the economic assets of Khartoum, its security agencies and fraudulent charities will deter the Government of Sudan from perpetrating atrocities in Darfur.</p>

	<p pid="c.51.5/1">The UK fully implements all UN and EU sanctions in relation to Sudan. This includes the targeted measures against the four individuals designated by the Security Council in April this year under Resolution 1672 (2006). On adoption of this resolution, the Government ensured that all the relevant implementing authorities were made aware of the measures so that the necessary action to identify any assets to be frozen and to restrict travel to the UK could be enforced.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.5/2">Following adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1672, we made it clear that more names would follow. We are taking this forward with our Security Council partners. We will enforce sanctions imposed against any further individuals in the same way as before.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.5/3">The UK is a leading proponent of Security Council action to improve the appalling situation in Darfur. With our Security Council partners, we will continue to consider all appropriate options, including further measures, which may help to achieve this.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-11-28c.52.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="52"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61128w0003.htm#061128115000192">
	<p pid="c.52.2/1">The Government have noted PricewaterhouseCoopers's July 2006 report and that 45 per cent of the companies surveyed were aware of the enhanced capital allowances on energy-saving technologies, the flat conversion allowance and land remediation relief. Enterprise is a critical ingredient of a flexible, modern economy. The Government are committed to ensuring a competitive and accessible tax environment to facilitate the creation and growth of new firms, promoting the exploitation of new ideas and opportunities, and enhancing competition.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.2/2">The Government note that the population of businesses surveyed for the study was limited to private companies. By focusing solely on private companies, the report excluded a large population of companies and investors that may be eligible for the tax reliefs. A number of reliefs included in the survey are specifically aimed at external investors rather than businesses. In addition, a number of companies surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers also would not be eligible for the featured reliefs on grounds of company size. Therefore, the Government's assessment is that, although the report is a useful contribution to the debate on how best to support business and the importance of awareness, it would be unwise to draw specific conclusions from it.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.2/3">Research has shown that government initiatives often take time to get into the decision-making processes of companies. HM Revenue and Customs uses a variety of approaches to raise awareness of tax issues, including information packs, online information, press coverage, simplified guides, media advertising and working with business support services and other external groups&mdash;for example, the &quot;Working Together&quot; initiative. The promotion of government initiatives is also often delivered in partnership with other government departments and external stakeholders, including business representative organisations such as the British Chambers of Commerce.</p>

	<p pid="c.54.0/1">We have not made any assessment of this. The UK has close contacts with UN agencies working in the Middle East, including in Lebanon, where we believe the UN has played a key role in helping to move forward the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701. We have no reason to doubt their competence or experience or that of other UN personnel working on the crucial security issues facing the region.</p>
