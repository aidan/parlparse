	<p pid="c.198.0/1">The case papers were formally referred by me to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-06">6 May 2004</phrase>, with a request that they consider whether a prosecution should be instituted against Trooper Williams for murder or manslaughter.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.0/2">Corporal Blair made statements to Army investigators on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-05">5 August</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-21">21 August 2003</phrase>. He was interviewed by the Metropolitan Police Service, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-27">27 July 2004</phrase>. A further statement was drawn from that interview, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-28">28 July 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.0/3">I saw the statements of 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-21">21 August 2003</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-05">5 May 2004</phrase>.

Records indicate that the transcript of the interview was first formally received into his private office on or about <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase> but the DPP believes that he discussed this material with counsel prior to <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase> on a date unknown. The DPP did not, however, see the transcript of the interview until well after the decision to prosecute had been taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.0/5">The decision to prosecute was formally made by a senior crown prosecutor, not the DPP, although he concurred in it. She decided that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Trooper Williams and that it was in the public interest to do so on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-25">25 August 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.198.0/7">The DPP informed me that he had nevertheless concluded that there was no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-15">15 March 2005</phrase>. He repeated that advice at a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
