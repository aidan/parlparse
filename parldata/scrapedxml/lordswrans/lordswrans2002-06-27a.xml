	<p pid="a.147.1/2" qnum="HL4773">What action they are taking to help ensure that the 1996 target of halving world hunger by 2015 is met.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-06-27a.147.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="147"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020627/text/20627w01.htm#20627w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.147.2/1">The importance of the 1996 target was reaffirmed in the Millennium Summit declaration. The millennium development goals are at the centre of our work in fighting poverty and hunger. In the millennium declaration the international community explicitly linked hunger with the global poverty target. Transforming this commitment into action means tackling poverty and its root causes&mdash;and making sure that food security and nutrition concerns are integrated into poverty reduction processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">The Department for International Development is responsible for leading the UK Government's contribution to achievement of the millennium goals. A wide range of actions implemented by DfID and described in the departmental report for 2002 help ensure that the hunger target is met. These include promoting broad economic growth; better education, health and social protection; revitalising agriculture; and working to assure improved governance, peace and democracy. They have produced two key documents, one on the subject of Eliminating Hunger and a consultation paper on the role of agriculture in poverty reduction. The development community has recognised these as important contributions to the policy debate. The department worked to influence the negotiation of the World Food Summit declaration in line with this analysis and will be following through at WSSD.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">But progress towards the hunger targets is too slow. In many countries the number of hungry people in increasing. The international community urgently needs to reconsider its approaches and policies to tackle hunger if we are to meet the global hunger target. We attach importance to the role of trade liberalisation in helping to achieve food security for all. Tackling hunger will require significant progress in the opening up of access to agricultural markets, particularly by developed countries. We want to see substantial cuts by developed countries in agricultural support that distorts trade. We are pushing for large reductions in all forms of export subsidies and the untying of food aid from agricultural surpluses in developed countries. And we are helping to build capacity in developing countries to negotiate and engage with international processes such as the Doha Development Round.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4">We are one of the largest providers of extra-budgetary funds to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. We are also a significant contributor to the international agricultural research system that underpins productivity increases by poor farmers in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/5">In our work with developing countries we are highlighting areas where greater efforts are needed to eliminate hunger. These include ensuring that poverty reduction strategies focus on hunger; helping create better domestic policy frameworks for agriculture; increasing access to knowledge from which to make informed decisions about technology choice; generating better responses for coping with conflict and natural disasters; developing social protection mechanisms to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable; and improving capacity to assess food insecurity so that we can identify who is vulnerable and why.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/6">The paper Eliminating Hunger, together with DfID's 2002 departmental report, will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.6/2">The United Kingdom view is that these arrangements are best considered on a case-by-case basis and that a blanket category of treatment is not the way forward.

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">At present it takes too long to extradite someone from the United Kingdom.

Ownership will transfer on a plot by plot basis over the lifetime of the joint venture with Meridian Delta Limited (MDL) and will occur only after MDL has spent substantial sums on planning, marketing and installation of the infrastructure needed to support the redevelopment of the peninsula.

A further grant of &pound;70,000 was made to Oxfam in 2000, followed later that year by a grant of &pound;240,000 to UNFPA, whose programme is ongoing.

	<p pid="a.156.2/2">This review has resulted in the identification of 33 more water bodies in England as sensitive areas: 32 are because the waters have since the last review in 1997 been found to be eutrophic or may in the near future become eutrophic if protective action is not taken. Eutrophic waters are those which are, or may be, adversely (in terms of their ecology and quality) affected by discharges from sewage treatment works serving communities of more than 10,000 inhabitants.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/3">The remaining water body, the River Itchen in the Midlands, which supplies drinking water, has been identified on the basis of elevated levels of nitrate under the terms of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/4">Identification of these areas will result in more stringent treatment being provided at 53 qualifying treatment works by water companies. This treatment involves reducing levels of phosphorus and/or nitrogen in discharges to tackle eutrophication and nitrate levels of these waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/5">These new requirements on water companies to remove these nutrients from sewage treatment work discharges will complement and add to the action required by farmers under the Nitrates Directive and by my department on diffuse pollution, which I also announced today.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/6">Lists of the new sensitive areas have today been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. Maps showing the location of all current sensitive areas (eutrophic) and (nitrate) will be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and at offices of the Environment Agency in due course.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-06-27a.157.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="157"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020627/text/20627w03.htm#20627w03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.157.2/1">One year after the creation of Defra, it gives us enormous pleasure that what were different departments are now working well together to develop an integrated approach to the problems of pollution, and especially diffuse pollution from agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/2">The increased intensification of farm production and the great steps made to reduce point source pollution from factories and sewage works mean that, as the Policy Commission on Food and Farming noted, agriculture is now clearly one of the major contributors to the pollution of water. It is also a significant polluter of air.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/3">Over time we will need to take further steps to reduce pollution from agriculture but in a cost-effective way. We therefore need to involve farmers very closely in continuing work to achieve a cleaner and healthier environment. Many farmers are committed to protecting and enhancing the environment, but much more needs to be done to raise standards across all farms to the standards of the best and to tackle the specific problem of diffuse pollution.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/4">Over the next few years we will be implementing the EU directives we have signed up to in order to improve water quality. As part of this work, later this year we will be holding a more detailed consultation with all sectors to follow up our first general consultation on implementing the Water Framework Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/5">Over 70 per cent of nitrates and over 40 per cent of phosphates in English waters originate from agricultural land. Up to a half of England's bathing waters are affected by short-term contamination by agricultural pollution, mainly by microbes from livestock manure being washed off farm land after rain. Excessive loads of fine silt are generated by soil erosion from intensively farmed land. Pesticides are contaminating drinking water sources, requiring expensive additional treatment at water works to remove pesticides before water can be supplied to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/6">No one farmer is responsible for this, but cumulatively diffuse pollution from farms is having a substantial impact on the quality of English waters. That is why we have begun a strategic review of diffuse water pollution from agriculture to identify cost-effective policy measures to prevent and control this pollution and to improve the sustainability of agriculture. We are co-ordinating this review with work announced in the Budget to review the particular role that economic instruments could play in tackling such pollution.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/7">As part of the open approach to policy development that we are seeking to adopt in the new department, I am publishing today a discussion document The Government's Strategic Review of Diffuse Water Pollution From Agriculture in England, so that we can start a debate with farmers and other stakeholders about the problems that we face and how we can best solve them. This marks the beginning of a process for working with stakeholders to develop a package of policy measures to reduce pollution.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/8">Part of what we need to achieve is improved control of the application of manures and fertilisers to land. Through the review we are considering the full range of policy mechanisms that could play a part in the future in encouraging and assisting farmers to improve their management of manure and nutrients. But we also have to implement some measures now, to comply with the European Court of Justice judgment that we have failed to meet our obligations under the 1991 Nitrates Directive to tackle agricultural nitrate pollution of waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/9">We published proposals for implementing the directive in December 2001. We have carefully considered the responses to the consultation and are today publishing an analysis of these responses. We have decided to apply the minimum regulation consistent with our obligations under the directive, to avoid closing off other options for tackling the wider problem of diffuse pollution that might be identified through the current review.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/10">We will designate new nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) covering 47 per cent of the land area of England, which will take the total designated area in England to 55 per cent. These are areas draining into rivers, ground water and other waters which are affected by nitrate pollution. In consequence, farmers using manufactured nitrogen fertilisers or organic manures will be required to follow an action programme to reduce pollution.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/11">This action will help to prevent and reverse damaging impacts of eutrophication, and improve the quality of drinking water sources. Better control of manure spreading will also cut microbiological inputs to water, helping to maintain and further increase the quality of bathing waters and shellfish waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/12">The overall extent of the new designations will be less than was originally estimated in the consultation document, as a result of work to define and quantify the NVZ areas more accurately than was possible at the time the consultation document was issued. Some new areas have been added, as was anticipated in the consultation document; but more areas have been removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/13">We are today publishing a revised regulatory impact assessment, which estimates that the compliance costs incurred by farmers will amount to about &pound;20 million per year. Costs will vary considerably from farm to farm, but we acknowledge that some farmers, particularly those who need to construct additional slurry storage facilities, will incur substantial costs. To assist those farmers who are most affected, we will extend the existing Farm Waste Grant Scheme to the new NVZ areas to help finance improvements to slurry storage facilities required to implement the action programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/14">Formal designations setting down the precise boundaries of the new zones will follow as soon as possible, and it will become a legal requirement to follow the action programme from <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-19">19 December 2002</phrase>. By the end of July, Defra will make available detailed interactive maps of the new NVZ areas. As soon as these are available, we will write to farmers to explain how to access these maps. We will also send all farmers in affected areas explanatory guidance material, together with sources of further advice on how to comply with the measures and details on the availability of grant under the Farm Waste Grant Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/15">We are also taking action to reduce phosphate and nitrate pollution of waters from other sources and are announcing separately additional designations under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive that will require water companies to reduce phosphate or nitrate discharges from certain sewage treatment works.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/16">We are also committed to improving air quality. Eighty five per cent of the ammonia which enters the atmosphere in the UK comes from fertilisers and manures used in agriculture. We will be publishing a booklet later this summer which will explain the problems caused by ammonia emissions to initiate debate on how to tackle this related problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/17">This all adds up to a substantial agenda for change. I recognise that we must secure these changes in ways which maximise the beneficial impact on the environment while minimising the regulatory burden on farmers. As we said in Working Together, we need to explore joined-up ways of working; to develop whole farm approaches; and to identify smarter ways of regulating. For example, several of the measures I have mentioned could affect the ways farmers handle manures and fertilisers, pointing to the benefits of more integrated approaches.</p>
