Stage one concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase>, with the decision not to involve SAGEM any further forward in the competition. MBDA and Raytheon's bids will now be assessed in more detail during stage two of the process.

	<p pid="a.54.3/1">The cost-effectiveness of the Tomahawk land attack missile (TLAM) capability was initially established when the project was approved in 1995. The missile's utility has since been confirmed during operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan when the availability of the TLAM capability from United Kingdom submarines enabled us to undertake precision attacks, at long range, against selected targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/2">The Block IIIC TLAM missiles, currently in service with the Royal Navy, are launched horizontally from submarine torpedo tubes. The next generation tactical Tomahawk (TACTOM) block IV missiles being produced for the US Navy can currently be fired only vertically and are therefore not suitable for UK submarines. Jointly funded UK-US feasibility studies have, however, identified a solution that would allow TACTOM to be launched horizontally from submarine torpedo tubes. Further development work is planned to start later this year, subject to completion of contractual negotiations. Improvements to arrangements for embarking Tomahawk missiles are not necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/3">Since the original purchase of the block IIIC variation to TLAM, additional remanufactured TLAMs have been procured to replace those used during the Kosovo campaign. A contract for the further purchase of remanufactured TLAMs was also signed in February 2002. No decision has been taken on whether the UK should procure the next generation TACTOM block IV missile or whether the launch capability should be extended to further vessels or other platforms.</p>

The Bill places a new clear duty on local authorities to make and participate in arrangements to provide adoption support services. This new duty will tackle the current inconsistency in the availability of adoption support services across the country. The Bill provides that the local authority's adoption service must be designed to meet the needs of children who may be adopted, their parents and guardians, prospective adopters and adopted people, their adoptive parents, birth parents and former guardians. Local authorities will also be required to carry out an assessment of need for adoption support where such an assessment is requested by a person affected by adoption.</p>

The data are valid for the purpose for which they were collected but they cannot be used to compare the mineral content of fruits and vegetables grown by traditional organic methods and those using artificial fertilisers. Further, for any such comparison to be valid, a number of confounding factors need to be taken into account, as indicated in my reply of <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May</phrase> (col.

	<p pid="a.66.8/1">The President of the Irish Republic has visited Northern Ireland on 62 occasions since 1998. Apart from the usual security requirements, any costs were borne by the organisations visited. The visits were classified as working or private visits or a combination of both and, as such, did not attract the full protocol afforded to state or guest of government visits.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">Successive administrations have regarded the ability of Ministers to meet and discuss policy issues in private to be essential for effective decision-making. This is reflected in Exemption 2 of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information which states that disclosure of the proceedings of Cabinet or Cabinet committees would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion, as I stated in my previous Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-21">21 May</phrase>.</p>
