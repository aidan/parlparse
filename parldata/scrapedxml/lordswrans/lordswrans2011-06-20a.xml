	<p pid="a.226.0/3">(a) Natural England processed 2,448 and 2,584 requests in relation to bat licences in 2009 and 2010 respectively. The time and cost of assessing and supervising proposals varies significantly and is generally dependent on complexity. Applications can range from requests for permission to carry out surveys to complicated proposals involving significant changes to the habitat of bats. Natural England estimates the staff costs associated directly with bat licensing applications, assessment and processing in 2009 and 2010 to be &#163;280,000 and &#163;300,000 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/4">(b) Surveys are necessary to establish whether any protected species are present and, if so, how they are using the habitats and in what numbers. The Government do not collate information on the costs of surveys to inform licence applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/5">(c) The costs of applying for and complying with the requirements of bat licences are highly variable and depend on the complexity of the proposal and the nature of any mitigation or compensation required to meet the directive's requirements. The Government do not collate information on the costs incurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/6">(d) The Government do not record whether construction projects have been delayed by the need to comply with a licence. Natural England does advise those it regulates that planning early for the needs of protected species and designing proposals that meet licensing requirements minimises the risks of delay and associated costs.</p>

Personal independence payment will have a qualifying period of six months and a prospective test of six months. This means that the overall 12 month test will harmonise with the accepted definition of long-term disability used for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.5/1">The Government have not made any formal assessment of the benefits of introducing universal video relay systems (VRS) in the UK. However, we received a substantial number of contributions (including cost-benefit analysis and impact assessments) in response to our recent consultation on implementing the revised EU Electronic Communications Framework, many of those lobbying for the mandating of universal VRS. In particular, the Government and Ofcom have considered figures put to them in their consultation response by the American provider, SorensonsVRS. Whilst these figures have been drawn together with a view to making a case for VRS, we do not doubt that the economic and social situation of many BSL users could be improved if a VRS system were mandated in the UK. These, and many other contributions, have been taken into consideration in our approach to implementation in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.5/2">Separately, and in line with its responsibilities to further the interests of citizens and consumers, Ofcom, the independent telecoms regulator, is currently undertaking a review of relay service provision in the UK. The objectives of this review are to assess whether current arrangements are adequate in delivering equivalence to voice telephony for hearing (including BSL users) and speech impaired end-users. This review will look at, amongst other things, the existing text relay service and additional relay services including video relay and captioned telephony. It will also include a cost-benefit analysis of the different potential options.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.5/3">The Government believe this is an appropriate and sensible way forward. However, under domestic legislation any decision on future arrangements can only be made after a process of review, consultation, cost-benefit analysis and a proportionality test. It would be inappropriate to attempt to anticipate or influence any decision-making process which forms part of Ofcom's current review.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.5/4">In our implementation of the revised framework the Government have affected changes to the Communications Act 2003 which will enable Ofcom, following the outcome of its current review, to place obligations, as appropriate, on suppliers of public electronic communications networks and services that will help ensure equivalence in access and choice for disabled end-users of electronic communications and services.</p>

There was no contribution either from the EU Budget or from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), which is backed by the EU Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/2">The international financial assistance package for Ireland agreed in December 2010 included: a &#8364;22.5 billion loan from the IMF, of which &#8364;7.2 billion has been disbursed; a &#8364;22.5 billion loan from the EFSM, of which &#8364;11.4 billion has been disbursed; a &#8364;17.5 billion loan from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), of which &#8364;3.6 billion has been disbursed; and &#8364;5 billion of bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/3">The international financial assistance package for Portugal agreed in May 2011 included a &#8364;26 billion loan from the EFSM, of which &#8364;6.5 billion has been disbursed; a &#8364;26 billion loan from the IMF, of which &#8364;6.1 billion has been disbursed; and a &#8364;26 billion loan from the EFSF.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/4">Spain and Italy have not received, nor requested, international financial assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/5">The UK's exposures break down as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/6">A bilateral loan of &#163;3.227 billion is available to Ireland. The loan cannot be drawn until after the approval of the third quarterly review of Ireland's Memorandum of Understanding with the IMF and the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/7">The EFSM is financed by the European Commission raising funds on capital markets, guaranteed by the EU Budget. There is no direct impact on the EU Budget from any such borrowing by the Commission. Only in the event that a beneficiary member state defaults on loan repayments would the EU Budget be adversely affected. In those circumstances, member states would be liable for a share based on their contribution to the EU Budget at that time. Contributions to the EU Budget vary over time, mainly driven by the member states' share in the EU's gross national income. For this reason, it is not possible to state exactly the UK liability. As an illustrative example, based on contributions to the 2010 EU Budget, the UK's share would be approximately 14 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/8">It is not possible to provide an estimate of the UK's contribution to specific IMF programmes. The UK contributes funds to the IMF as a whole rather than to any country-specific IMF programme. Our ultimate exposure to any IMF lending programme would be in line with our quota shareholding, ie around 4.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.247.5/1">The Health Service Executive in Ireland began to collect unused stocks of Pandemrix H1N1 vaccine in March 2011. This followed reports, largely in Sweden and Finland, of narcolepsy following vaccination and was initiated because Pandemrix was no longer required due to availability of seasonal influenza vaccines. The signal of narcolepsy is still under investigation as part of a Europe-wide regulatory review. Pandemrix remains licensed for use in Europe and the benefit-risk balance of Pandemrix remains favourable. This issue has no specific relation to the presence of thiomersal in Pandemrix as a preservative. There is no evidence to suggest that exposure to the small levels of thiomersal contained in Pandemrix carries any serious health risks.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.9/1">We are very concerned at the latest reports of violence in South Kordofan, which include continued fighting in Kadugli and aerial bombardments in several locations across the State. Our latest information is that this bombing extends to contested areas at the north of Unity State. We call on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and engage constructively in the African Union-facilitated talks in Addis Ababa.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.3/1">Directive 86/298/EEC of the European Parliament and Council concerns rear-mounted roll-over protection structures (ROPS) for &quot;narrow-track&quot; agricultural and forestry tractors.

	<p pid="a.263.3/2">As an alternative to complying with the directive, it is permissible to comply with an international (OECD) standard. This ensures the directive does not constitute a non-tariff barrier to trade.

	<p pid="a.263.6/1">We are doing many things to support those that are unemployed, including implementing the Work Programme, which has recently gone live and will roll out around the country, including the Isle of Wight, through June.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.6/2">The Work Programme will be the single biggest payment-by-results employment programme the United Kingdom has ever seen, providing personalised support to an expected 2.4 million claimants overt the next five years to help them find and sustain employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.6/3">Work Programme providers will not be required to deliver centrally specified support, which may be inappropriate for many claimants, but instead will be given the freedom to innovate and develop personalised support. In return for this freedom, they will be paid on the basis of the results they achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.6/4">For the Work Programme to be successful we need to tap into the experience, knowledge and specialist skills of local partners in order to deliver the personalised and localised services required in today's labour market. We expect prime providers to engage with local partners and work with a broad range of sub-contractors to deliver the tailored, targeted support that can help individuals from all claimant groups into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.6/5">In addition to this, the support Jobcentre Plus advisers have available to offer is being bolstered with a series of Get Britain Working measures, for which Government are asking for the active engagement of employers, partners and claimants themselves in every community in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.6/6">From April 2011 we have put in place a much more flexible and personalised approach to the way Jobcentre Plus delivers to claimants. Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers will have far more flexibility to judge which interventions will help its claimants, tailored to personal and local labour market needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.6/7">We are also committed to supporting young people into work. In this year's Budget the Chancellor announced funding for up to 100,000 work experience placements over the next two years as part of our support for moving young people into the world of work and providing them with the experience that employers tell us is really important. We are also funding up to 40,000 additional apprenticeship places for young unemployed people over the life of this Parliament and plan to introduce an extension to Work Experience placements where employers want to offer a young person an apprenticeship to help smooth the transition for both the employer and the young person.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.6/8">The Prime Minister recently announced an enhanced &#163;60 million package of support including a &#163;30 million Innovation Fund, provision of early access Work Programme places for vulnerable 18 year-olds, and additional support for 16 and 17 year-old jobseeker's allowance claimants.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.6/9">We have also announced measures to improve and support vocational training including sector-based work academies and access to apprenticeships for vulnerable young people.</p>
