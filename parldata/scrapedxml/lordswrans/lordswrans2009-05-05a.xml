	<p pid="a.88.2/1">Belize's allocation from the European Development Fund (EDF) for 2008-13 includes &euro;10 million for integrated rural development; &euro;1.2 million for technical and material support for the national authorising officer of the Minister of Economic Development; with the remaining &euro;0.6 million allocated to trade related assistance, improvement of public expenditure and financial accountability and technical training on issues such as tax reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">The &euro;48.2 million that Belize, as a sugar protocol country, receives is allocated on an annual basis as follows (2006: &euro;3 million, 2007: &euro;6 million, 2008: &euro;9 million, 2009: &euro;13.l million, 2010: &euro;17.1 million).

	<p pid="a.88.2/3">Overall, activities aim to improve the efficiency of sugar cane production, processing and economic diversification, with a strong emphasis on developing rural infrastructure in sugar producing areas e.g. roads and bridges. The European Commission (EC) disburses, manages and monitors this funding. Monitoring takes place through regular visits from the supervising EC delegation based in Jamaica and regular reviews.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.5/1">The Medical Research Council (MRC) primarily supports research based within the UK. However, a large proportion of the scientists supported by the MRC have extensive national and international collaborations. In stem cell research there are examples of major international joint funding initiatives such as the new partnership between the MRC and the Californian Institute of Regenerative Medicine which aims to support collaboration between scientists in the UK and California. This high level of collaboration results in the production of many research papers worldwide based directly or indirectly on MRC support.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/2">There is frequently a significant time lag between the provision of funding to projects and research publications arising from those projects. The consistent classification of research papers with a primary or significant focus on embryonic, as opposed to other stem cell approaches, requires a careful analysis of the contents of the papers in question. Management information held by the MRC, and extensive datasets such as PubMed, BiomedExpert.com, Faculty of 1000, and Thompson ISI, cannot therefore reliably identify all papers with this research focus without trained scrutiny of the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/3">A simple counting of research papers is not a reliable measure of output without information about the quality of these publications. Analysis of the citation rate of research papers, normalised by research field, is an established approach to measuring the impact of publications. This analysis relies on data about citations having accumulated over several years.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/4">At present the MRC supports almost 200 programmes relating to stem cell research. Therefore currently such information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">The MRC does make use of the US digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature, PubMed Central (PMC), which is an open and comprehensive database of bibliographic information about scientific articles. Prior to 2008, however, there was no systematic way of identifying publications attributed specifically to MRC funded work using this dataset.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">Robust attribution of outputs to funding source is a significant challenge to all research funding bodies. In 2008 the MRC, the Wellcome Trust and others funded the US National Library of Medicine to extract data routinely from the acknowledgement field, where available in scientific papers, and flag this information in the PubMed dataset. This has improved information on papers acknowledged as arising from MRC funded work, but is still incomplete. There were over 2,000 MRC attributed papers flagged in PubMed in 2008, which is approximately 60 per cent of the output reported directly to the MRC by researchers. The MRC is working with publishers and researchers to achieve consistent acknowledgement of Government support in all research publications.</p>

The MRC, in partnership with the other research councils, the UK's three national libraries and four national higher education funding bodies, also supports the Research Information Network which issued guidelines in 2008 for the standardised acknowledgement of funding source.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.5/1">The comment made in February 2007 by the MRC's then chief executive relating to somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), expressed his view that at that time the efficiency of the process was very low. The primary aim of the MRC's award to the University of Newcastle, made later that year, was to incorporate technological advances to improve the efficiency of SCNT in human oocytes and develop a reproducible method of generating human embryonic stem cells following the transfer of the nucleus of an adult somatic cell into an oocyte. The project, which is due to end towards the end of 2009, will not derive stem cells for use in treatments.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/2">The project was subject to the MRC's rigorous peer review process and was considered to be internationally competitive. The exceptional nature of the award was due to the need to consider carefully the ethics of sourcing eggs for the project from an egg sharing programme. The MRC's council made the award after careful consideration of advice from the MRC's Ethics Policy Advisory Committee, which advised that the sourcing of eggs through this route would, in this case, be ethically acceptable and that the funding would not encourage the donating women to take risks that they would otherwise not take.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.3/1">The Government's strategy to promote improvements in energy efficiency consists of a broad range of measures&mdash;a series of carrots and sticks, regulations and support&mdash;designed to overcome the individual barriers within each sector of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/2">Direct rewards for action on energy efficiency currently do not play a part. However, significant incentives in the form of grant and subsidy are made available to households through the Government's Warm Front scheme and the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT). Under Warm Front, the Government are set to provide some &pound;959 million in grant to fuel poor households within the current 2008-11 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) period for the provision of efficient heating systems and insulation measures. CERT, which is a market mechanism, will see the six major energy suppliers invest over &pound;3 billion in household energy efficiency over the same period. The Government have also introduced fiscal incentives such as a reduced rate of VAT on energy saving materials, enhanced capital allowances and the landlord's energy saving allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/3">Our energy efficiency strategy, the latest summary of which is set out in the 2007 energy efficiency action plan, is currently being reviewed as part of the heat and energy saving strategy consultation now underway.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.6/1">The existing Waste Framework Directive (WFD) (2006112/EC) does not require waste plants to be energy efficient. The revised WFD (2008/98/EC) requires a high level of energy efficiency for incineration and co-incineration plants. When the revised WFD is transposed in England, it will rest with the Environment Agency to determine what constitutes a high level of energy efficiency for each particular plant. The transposition of the revised WFD in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is a matter for the respective devolved Administrations.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.0/1">As set out in the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills' Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-04">4 March 2009</phrase>, following the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) assessment of colleges seeking approval in principle or detail, it was confirmed that the council had already given 79 colleges the first stage of approval in principle. Government funding of nearly &pound;2.7 billion would be needed for them to proceed. A further 65 colleges have submitted bids to the national LSC for approval in principle with an assumed funding contribution from Government of a further &pound;3 billion. As a consequence, there are many more schemes currently in preparation than can be funded in this spending round.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/2">Sir Andrew Foster's report into how this situation arose and the lessons to be learnt for the future was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase>. In line with the recommendation from Sir Andrew to develop a &quot;needs-based&quot; approach LSC is now consulting with the sector on the approach that should be used to prioritise schemes and has established a reference panel of college principals convened by the Association of Colleges.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/3">Budget 2009 on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-22">22 April</phrase> announced additional funding of more than &pound;300 million in this spending round (2009-10 and 2010-11) to support FE capital projects. In addition we are planning a continuing FE capital investment programme in future years, with a planning assumption of &pound;300 million a year from 2011-12 to 2013-14 to be confirmed at the next spending review. This provides a provisional &pound;1.2 billion in total to 2013-14 which should allow us to develop around &pound;750 million of new schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/4">We fully understand the need for certainty not just for colleges but also the construction firms that will have been involved in the development of these projects. John Denham wrote to all Members of Parliament following the budget setting out the position and the acting chief executive of the LSC also wrote to all college principals setting out the work that was ongoing and the timetable for agreeing when the available funds would be allocated.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.2/1">During the first three months of Operation TELIC (January-March 2003), nerve agent pre-treatment sets (NAPS) tablets were issued to Armed Forces personnel in single strips of 21 tablets. The recommended dosage rate is one pyridostigmine bromide (30mg) tablet every eight hours i.e. three per day. Thus, a single strip contains a week's supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/2">A total of 7,266,504 tablets were supplied to Operation TELIC, in the form of 346,024 strips of 21. These were issued to approximately 32,000 personnel, over a three month period as follows:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.103.2/5"> <td>Month</td> <td>Strips supplied</td> <td>Total tablets</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.103.2/12">NAPS tablets were issued to personnel by their commanders, and self-administered on command. Operational commanders were given the authority to decide when troops should start and stop taking NAPS in order that the use of the countermeasure could be adapted to meet the threat situation at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/13">Due to the policy of self-administration of NAPS tablets, as opposed to administration by a medical officer, no records of their administration are kept. All service personnel receive training on the importance of taking NAPS in theatre and instructions for the use of NAPS are well publicised to command and medical staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/14">The use of NAPS on Operation TELIC ceased in April 2003. The effects of the medication have been assessed through routine epidemiology and theatre reporting systems. In addition, MoD sponsored a research programme into the possible health effects of the combination of vaccines and tablets which were given to troops at the time of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict to protect them against the threat of biological and chemical warfare. The overwhelming evidence from the programme is that the NAPS that were offered to UK forces at the time of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict would not have had adverse health effects. The tablets issued on Op TELIC were the same as those used in the Gulf in 1990-91.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/15">The MoD also funds the Kings Centre for Military Health Research which looks at the health issues for service people and veterans including those that have served in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/2"><I>Letter from Karen Dunnell, National Statistician, to Lord </I><I>Kilclooney</I><I>, dated April 2009</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what are the percentage unemployment rates in (a) the United States, (b) Germany, (c) France, (d) Spain, (e) the Republic of Ireland, (t) the European Union as a whole, and (g) the United Kingdom. [HL3018]</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/4">Comparable unemployment rates for EU member states are estimated and published by Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Communities, using data derived from the Labour Force Survey in each country. The Eurostat definition of unemployed persons covers those aged 15 to 74. Estimates for 15 year-olds are not available for Spain, therefore the figures published are for people aged 16 to 74 instead. The unemployment rate for the United Kingdom and the United States is based on those aged 16 and over.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/5">The latest estimates for each country are provided in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/6">This information is updated monthly as part of the Labour Market Statistics First Release and can be found on the National Statistics website at the following address: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/OnlineProducts/LMS_FR_HS.asp">www.statistics.gov.uk/OnlineProducts/LMS_FR_HS.asp</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.0/1">Of the 635 treaties, conventions and related instruments for which the United Nations (and its predecessor the League of Nations) is depositary, there are currently 153 by which the UK has not consented to be bound, either through ratification or its equivalent. The UK has signed, but not ratified, 26 of these. I have placed a list in the House of Lords Library containing details of these treaties and conventions.</p>
