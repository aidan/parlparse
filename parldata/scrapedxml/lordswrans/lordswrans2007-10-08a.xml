At this time the cable was not being used as the mains supply was intact. Before the cable could be repaired the contractor damaged the main supply cable. The damage cut all power to Old Palace Yard. This cable was repaired later that same evening by EDF Energy (the main electricity supplier). The back-up cable was replaced during the first weekend of September.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">The cost of repairs to the back-up cable was approximately &pound;7,000 plus VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">The Palace of Westminster visitor ticket office lost approximately &pound;2,000 in revenue during the period of the power cut due to the inability to process credit card payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">This was the only instance of loss of power supply during the Summer Recess up to <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-10">10 September</phrase>. Should there be a further loss of power during the coming month I will provide additional information.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.5/1">We are concerned by the findings of the Ghana Ministry of Manpower, Youth and Employment's pilot labour survey in cocoa production and are committed to tackling the problem of child labour in the developing world. We have raised the issue with the Ghanaian Government, most recently in May and through workshops in social protection in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/2">The Government of Ghana passed the Children's Act 1988, which prohibits child labour, especially the engagement of children in hazardous and exploitative work. They are working with the International Labour Organisation on a programme for the elimination of child labour since 2000. The pilot labour survey demonstrates the Government's willingness to constantly monitor and review the situation. Additionally, the Ghanaian Government have encouraged more children into school by making education free. The Government are contributing &pound;100 million over 10 years towards the education sector in Ghana.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/3">The Government are also supporting the Government of Ghana to put in place a new social security system, which will target the poorest households&mdash;those where children are being forced to work. If these households are guaranteed a minimum level of income, children should no longer need to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/4">The Government and the Government of Ghana have both been in dialogue with chocolate manufacturers to encourage these companies to help Ghana tackle the issue of child labour through collaborative efforts. There is an official agreement, between governments of countries involved in cocoa production and companies producing chocolate, known as the Harkin-Engel Protocol (2001). This protocol commits all parties to addressing the worst forms of child labour and forced adult labour in the supply chain of the cocoa industry. As a result, the major international chocolate companies have been supporting some of the Government of Ghana's child labour eradication programmes&mdash;including part funding the pilot labour survey, encouraging school attendance and setting up more schools near cocoa plants.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">It is normal government policy to neither confirm nor deny whether an extradition request has been, or is in the process of being, made in relation to any particular individual. Although the subject of this particular question is the number of requests, and not whether a request has been made in relation to a specific individual, the terms of the question are sufficiently narrow that an answer could lead to the possibility of an inference being made in respect of specific individuals. The Government therefore consider that to respond to the question would breach the spirit of the policy and that the disclosure of this information would therefore be likely to prejudice the administration of justice.</p>

	United Nations: Responsibility to Protect

	<p pid="a.6.3/1">We continue to uphold strongly the value of the concept of the responsibility to protect, to which all UN member states committed themselves during the world summit of 2005. Here, for the first time, world leaders agreed that Governments have the responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity within states. The UK believes it to be a powerful tool in reminding Governments and the international community of their protection responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/2">The responsibility to protect is relevant to the entire international community, as all UN member states have signed up to it. In particular, the UK secured specific reference to the concept in Security Council resolutions (SCRs) relating to the situation in Sudan (SCR 1706 and SCR 1755), and in SCR 1674 on the protection of civilians in armed conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/3">The UK will continue to encourage and help states to build capacity to exercise their responsibility to protect; to assist states which are under stress before crises and conflicts break out; and to ensure that the responsibility to protect commitment is translated into a willingness to act, speedily and appropriately, in specific cases.</p>
