	<p pid="b.89.5/1">Countries from the Great Lakes and the Horn of Africa regions expressed support for a treaty in the June 2005 Nairobi declaration. In October 2005, EU Foreign Ministers added the EU's voice to support for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms, and called for the start of a formal negotiation process at the UN at the earliest opportunity. Commonwealth heads of government, meeting in Malta in 2005, also formally stated their support for work on such a treaty to commence at the UN. Numerous other countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Benin, Cambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guinea, Holy See, Iceland, Mali, Norway, Senegal, Switzerland and Turkey have also expressed support. We will continue to work with international partners to generate support for a process to build momentum towards our objective of initial discussions in the UN later in 2006.</p>

We believe that all conventional arms need to be included in the treaty to make it a fully effective tool against the irresponsible trade in arms.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.5/1">The UK and US Consul-Generals issued a joint letter to President Abbas on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March 2006</phrase>, which noted that if the Palestinian Authority (PA) did not come into full compliance with the Ramallah agreement and make substantive improvements to the security of the monitors or come to a new agreement with the government of Israel, we would have to withdraw our monitors with immediate effect. In accordance with our obligations under the Ramallah agreement, our ambassador in Tel Aviv informed the Israeli authorities that we were delivering a letter in these terms on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.5/2">On 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>, our ambassador in Tel Aviv informed the Israeli authorities that we might have to withdraw from the mission due to security concerns. This information was also communicated to the PA initially on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase> and on at least five separate occasions after this point. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-10">10 March</phrase> our ambassador in Tel Aviv contacted the Israeli authorities to urge that Israel exercise caution if the monitors had to withdraw.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.5/3">It was considered too dangerous for our monitors to inform either Israel or the PA of the actual date of withdrawal.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.0/1">It is a longstanding principle that, where it is cost effective to do so, recovery is sought of all overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/2">The Department for Work and Pensions seeks to recover social security overpayments where customers innocently or otherwise provide incorrect information in relation to their claim or fail to notify a change of circumstances. In addition, the department seeks to recover overpayments that are not recoverable under social security legislation&mdash;for example, paid twice for the same period. This is on the basis that customers have no right to retain money that they should not have received. The department's policy is to seek recovery in the cases where it is reasonable to expect the customer to have been aware of the overpayment.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/3">Rates of recovery are set to avoid undue hardship and take account of the financial and personal circumstances of the customer. In exceptional circumstances the Secretary of State can exercise his discretion to waive recovery of an overpayment to avoid severe hardship or where the recovery would be against the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/4">With regard to housing and council tax benefits, the local authority must decide whether an overpayment is legally recoverable and, if it is, whether it should actually recover it. This decision, as well as the method and rate of recovery, is the responsibility of the local authority. The authority must have regard to the customer's financial circumstances and avoid causing hardship to either customers or any of their dependants.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/5">The policy of HM Revenue and Customs on recovery of tax credit overpayments is set out in its Code of Practice 26, <i>What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?</i> The criteria used to determine whether overpayments of tax credits should be remitted are contained in Code of Practice 26.</p>
