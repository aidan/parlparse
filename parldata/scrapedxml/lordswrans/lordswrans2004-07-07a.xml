	<p pid="a.81.9/1">The Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 (FETO) prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. Fair employment legislation in Northern Ireland, since its inception in 1976, has not applied to the employment of teachers in schools. This was in recognition of the denominationally based nature of education in Northern Ireland and took account of the views of the Churches that children should be educated in a school which paid full regard to the child's religion and the attitude of parents that their children should be educated in an environment which had full regard for the religion of the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.9/2">The proposed EC Directive 2000/78/EC would have meant that the exemption in FETO would have had to be removed without having regard to the issues and sensitivities of the local community in relation to the education of their children and the complexion of their schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.9/3">The exemption in FETO for the employment of teachers was much wider than that permitted under the religion or belief aspects of the directive but following negotiations with the European Commission special provision was made for Northern Ireland in relation to teachers. The directive provides that the exemption should relate only to the recruitment of teachers, rather than their terms of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.9/4">The Fair Employment and Treatment Order (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003, which came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-10">10 December 2003</phrase>, removed the blanket exemption for the employment of schoolteachers and restricted the exemption to the recruitment of teachers in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.9/5">The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland in response to the OFMDFM consultation on <i>Implementing EU Equality Obligations in Northern Ireland</i> in April 2003 noted the draft regulations to amend FETO. The commission also stated it was of the view that the teachers' exemption should be removed in its entirety.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.9/6">Under Article 71(2) of FETO the commission is required to keep under review the exemption in relation to employment as a teacher in a school. In discharging this duty the commission is permitted under Article 71(3) of FETO to conduct investigations. Such an investigation was launched in October 2003 and it is anticipated that an investigation report will be published in the autumn 2004</p>
	<p pid="a.81.9/7">Whether or not there should continue to be an exemption in relation to the recruitment of teachers is a matter which will be considered in the context of the single equality Bill, taking into account advice from the Equality Commission and other interested parties.</p>

However, the great majority of such machines in use within the National Health Service today are relatively new and do not carry DU as manufacturers have moved to the use of alternative high-density metals. Accordingly registration of these machines is not applicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/3">In addition to linear accelerators described above, a small number of cobalt 60 units remain in NHS hospitals. These require registration in respect of both the renewable cobalt 60 radioactive source used and any DU present.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/4">Taken together the NHS in recent times has about 12 machines to which RSA registration is applicable. Of these about half are in day-to-day use and the remainder are awaiting removal or are retained as part of contingency plans to ensure continued availability of treatment capacity. Several of these are scheduled for replacement under the current central procurement scheme, which is intended to modernise and expand the asset base in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/5">All of the major teletherapy equipment suppliers are clearly aware of the need to assist the NHS by providing appropriate information on the use of DU and audit trails are in place. Each NHS trust has a local duty to register sources with the Environment Agency (England and Wales) and this work is carried out under the supervision of radiation protection advisers appointed under the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.2/2">The medical and dental guidance notes &quot;<i>A good practice guide on all aspects of ionising radiation protection in the clinical environment</i>&quot; specifically asks that the presence of depleted uranium (DU) in a teletherapy machine be noted in the radiation safety local rules. These rules will also be reflected in maintenance protocols and documentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/3">The DU components themselves are stamped with an identification code in order to facilitate the individual tracking of items or components in the event that they are removed for service reasons. These stamps are also essential in audit trails, which are used to maintain records of the use and location of the material throughout its life. Internal radioactive materials labelling, within the head of the apparatus, is used where the manufacturer, service organisation or local radiation protection adviser considers that a hazard might arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) updated its advice on use of thiomersal in vaccines in March 2004. It continues to advise that development of vaccines without thiomersal, or with the lowest possible levels of thiomersal and other mercury-containing preservatives, should continue to be promoted. However, it also acknowledges that during some manufacturing processes the use of organic mercury compounds is necessary and, in such cases, residual levels might be present in the final product. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation endorse the EMEA position. In line with this recommendation, a number of UK-licensed vaccines have recently had levels of thiomersal reduced or removed completely from the manufacture of the component antigens or from the final vaccine. The CSM continues to advise that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, if any, of exposure to thiomersal-containing vaccines.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.5/1">We have already made clear to the Commission our concerns regarding the inclusion of eggs and egg products on the list of goods from which tariffs will be removed in the EU's market access offer to Mercosur.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.5/2">The EU's offer, which has now been submitted, is an ambitious one, covering a wide range of products. However it is conditional and the Commission has suggested that it could be scaled back if we do not get a satisfactory response from Mercosur. In such circumstances there may be an opportunity to take account of these concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.5/3">I have asked my officials to keep the British Egg Industry Council posted on developments.</p>
