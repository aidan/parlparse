	<p pid="a.140.3/2">Extensive training and equipping is taking place to ensure the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) is able to deal effectively with public disorder in the region under UK area of responsibility. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/3" class="indent">4,519 Iraqi police have attended the transitional integration programme (TIP) which includes civil defence training.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/4" class="indent">60 specially selected IPS trainers have been trained by a senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer in public order tactics. Tactics taught include containment, dispersal, tactics against firearms, blast bombs and petrol bombs.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/5" class="indent">The course also taught peaceful crowd control.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/6" class="indent">300 members of the Basra tactical support unit have now been trained by the Iraqi trainers, validated by the UK police officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/7" class="indent">Baton guns are on order to provide a non-lethal method of crowd control. These tactics will be taught to enable the IPS to avoid indiscriminate use of firearms as a method of crowd control.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/8" class="indent">1,000 sets of riot control clothing and equipment will shortly be issued to the IPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/9" class="italic">Minimum use of Force</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/10">The norm of minimum use of force has run through all training being delivered in the region. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/11" class="indent">Prior to January 2004 UK military provided training in arrest and search techniques based on minimum force.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/12" class="indent">Since then 4,519 Iraqi police have attended the transitional integration programme course&mdash;the use of force is covered during the course as well as other human rights training.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/13" class="italic">Firearms</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/14">Extensive firearms training, and weapons handling has been taught by the UK military and police. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/15" class="indent">Prior to January 2004 military training was provided for firearms and weapons handling.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/16" class="indent">Since January 2004 4,519 Iraqi police have attended the transitional integration programme which incorporates 40 hours of firearms training carried out by the UK civilian police. More recently the Czech military have continued to provide firearms training independent of TIP.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/17">Coalition forces have also coached, mentored and more recently shadowed IPS at public disorder incidents, firearms incidents and arrests to continue to ensure minimum use of force is a norm of IPS operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/18">On the basic recruit course in Jordan and Baghdad delivered over an eight-week period, the training incorporates the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/19" class="indent">40 hours' hands-on firearms training including live fire and classroom work.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/20" class="indent">Eight hours' civil disorder training.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/21" class="indent">40 hours' use of force training.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/22">In addition, training for the national Civil Intervention Force is about to start in Baghdad and Egypt.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.3/23">Specific needs regarding public order training are currently being assessed in order to tailor a five-week UK-based training package due to start in summer 2004. This will build on the basic training delivered to date.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.0/1">There is legislation in place to restrict the use of loudhailers in public. Section 62 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 governs the use of loudhailers in the streets, and prohibits their use between 9.00 pm and 8.00 am.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/2">There is also a City of Westminster by-law, which makes it an offence to cause or permit to be made any loud or continuous noise by operating an amplifier or similar instrument, after being warned to desist by a constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/3">The Government believe that this legislation is compliant with the right to freedom of expression and assembly under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The right to freedom of expression is not absolute and the rights of others not to be subjected to noisy protests must be taken into account. The legislation finds an appropriate balance between these conflicting rights.</p>

These personnel are offered a test for total uranium in the urine followed by a test for uranium isotopes in the urine if the test for total uranium gives anomalous results. The isotope test determines whether the uranium is depleted. The isotope test is offered straight away if personnel are known to have been exposed to DU or there is a high probability that they have been exposed. So far just under 300 personnel have taken up this offer and have been tested. Of those, only a small number have been found to be excreting DU in their urine.

Carriageways are being resurfaced with quieter materials as maintenance becomes due to keep them in a safe and serviceable (available for use) condition. However, where concrete carriageways will not require maintenance by April 2011, their resurfacing is being prioritised to address those locations where the most homes are affected by traffic noise first. In addition, quieter surfaces will be used in all new major junction improvements, bypasses and road widenings. On the basis of current maintenance expectations for the strategic road network, nearly all dual carriageway sections should be resurfaced by around 2015.</p>

Scaling the carbon dioxide emissions by the proportion of finance guaranteed by ECGD would give a figure of less than 20 million tonnes per year of carbon dioxide that is directly attributable to ECGD's participation.</p>
