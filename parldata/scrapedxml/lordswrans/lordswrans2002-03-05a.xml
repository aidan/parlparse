<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-03-05a.5.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="5"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020305/text/20305w01.htm#20305w01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.5.8/1">The special voucher scheme was introduced in 1968 in recognition of the specific hardship being suffered at that time by British overseas citizen (BOC) passport holders and their dependants who were under political pressure to leave their countries of residence in East Africa but who held no other citizenship and had nowhere else to go. Several thousand BOCs and other United Kingdom passport holders took advantage of the scheme and settled in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.8/2">However, the world political situation has now changed and BOCs are no longer under threat of expulsion. They have over the intervening years either settled with their families in the new independent East African countries or, alternatively, some have moved with their families to India. Their families have now grown up and have families of their own.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.8/3">There are relatively few applications for special vouchers these days and those who do apply are not being pressured to leave the country in which they reside. The scheme no longer serves the purpose for which it was set up. The Government have therefore decided that the time has come to abolish the scheme, with immediate effect. No new applications for special vouchers will be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/1">EU-wide controls on feeding mammalian protein (including mammalian meat and bone meal) to ruminants were introduced in June 1994.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">However, inspection visits by the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) have repeatedly reported on inadequate implementation of the feed ban. Even in its inspections between 1998 and 2000, the FVO found that there was a significant risk of contamination of ruminant feed by mammalian meat and bone meal in nine member states: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal (up to July 1999) and Finland.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>, due to concerns about cross-contamination and an increase in BSE cases across the Community, additional EU-wide measures were introduced banning the use of a wide range of processed animal proteins in feed for all farm animals. These stronger measures offer a more effective approach to stop the spread of the disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.5/1">Many animals hunted and traded as bushmeat are listed in the appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

	<p pid="a.6.5/2">Other animals which may be defined as so called bushmeat, such as small game animals, may be traded legally under Community rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/3">Since April 2001, we have been advised of 1,142 seizures of illegally imported animal products. There is no clear definition of bushmeat. It is therefore difficult to provide an accurate figure on how many of these seizures were bushmeat.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.5/1">I have agreed with the Home Secretary that the Crown Prosecution Service and police should pilot the proposals over a period of six months in five different areas: in Bath, the Medway area, Essex, the Wrexham area and in Halifax. The objective of the pilot is to identify the practical implications of implementing Sir Robin's recommendation that the Crown Prosecution Service should determine the charge in all but minor, routine offences or where, because of the circumstances, there is a need for a holding charge before seeking the advice of the Service. Where there may be practical difficulties, the pilot will seek to identify how these can best be overcome. The Crown Prosecution Service and ACPO have been working closely together to set up the pilot, which commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-18">18 February 2002</phrase>.

Within the framework provided by the relevant management plan, the Government are embarking on an ambitious programme to remove the roads and associated noise and pollution from the immediate vicinity of the stones; reunite the stones with the surrounding monuments; and allow visitors to move freely about the wider landscape and thereby better understand the context of Stonehenge within the world heritage site.</p>
