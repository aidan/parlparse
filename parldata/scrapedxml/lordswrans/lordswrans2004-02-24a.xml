The Court did not find any legislation or guidance to be in breach of the Convention. However, the judgment did raise a number of issues for the Department for Education and Skills to consider. The department has continued to keep these issues in mind as it reviews and develops its guidance to local authorities. This is an ongoing process.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/2">The department has now begun an extensive programme of consultation on the draft regulations and guidance that will implement the Adoption and Children Act 2002 provisions. In November 2003 it issued the first of five consultation packages which sets out the draft regulations and guidance governing the arrangement of adoptions, and which addresses some of the issues highlighted for further consideration as a result of the judgment. For example, the consultation includes the draft regulations that place a requirement on agencies to explain to a birth parent the consequences of adoption and how the parent may apply for a contact order at the time of the adoption hearing. Furthermore, the draft guidance sets out the procedure for counselling a birth parent about contact and how the arrangements for contact may change through the adoption process. This consultation exercise will run until <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/18">(2) In October 2000 there was a change in contractor operating the Crystal Palace Sports Centre on behalf of Sport England. The current contractor operates the centre on a full repairing lease contract. The previous contractor operated the centre on a part repairing lease. The difference betweeen the contracts, together with a different treatment of income under the contracts, makes it difficult to compare results between 1996&ndash;97 to October 2000 and the period after October 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/19">(3) The capital works programme at Crystal Palace is largely undertaken by the new contractor with Sport England only responsible for a minor amount of the capital works undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.6/1">Under the current licensing regime, where the police seek the revocation of a licence or oppose renewal of a licence, it is a matter for the chief officer of police to ensure that the police are able to substantiate any allegation which they intend to make in the course of presenting or amplifying their objection or case. It is therefore a matter for the police to ensure that witnesses attend relevant hearings and the Government have no power to enforce attendance. The Government have recognised that the current arrangements are very restrictive and have therefore taken action by introducing new review arrangements in the Licensing Act 2003. The new provisions recognise the reluctance of some members of the public to attend hearings for a variety of reasons. When fully implemented, the 2003 Act will allow interested parties, for example a local resident, or responsible authorities, for example the police, to apply for a review of a premises licence or club premises certificate to the relevant licensing authority, and to make relevant representations to the authority about the grounds for a review. There will be no requirement for the police to support their application. During the consideration of the grounds for a review at a hearing under the 2003 Act the authority will consider those grounds and any of the relevant representations made. Attendance by individuals, who have experienced or witnessed crime and disorder, at such hearings will not be compulsory as the authority will consider written representations.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">No. Competition in the rolling stock leasing market was considered by the Rail Regulator in 1998. The Government accepted his conclusion that potential problems could be remedied by means of voluntary codes of practice backed up by the Competition Act. The codes were published by the rolling stock leasing companies (ROSCOs) in February 2000. The Rail Regulator continues to keep under review both the codes and ROSCOs' adherence to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">The customs duties charged in the European Community have evolved over time through various rounds of multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, now superseded by the World Trade Organisation. The information technology agreement (ITA) also represents what was negotiable within this complex multilateral framework. The ITA is promulgated in the common customs tariff of the European Communities (CCT).</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">When differing interpretations of the CCT arise, the European Commission takes steps to provide clarification to ensure uniform application across the Community. The European Commission is to publish a decision of the Customs Code Committee (Nomenclature Section), which advises it on these matters, in the form of a regulation on the classification of plasma monitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">This proposal does not in fact reclassify computer monitors. It clarifies the distinction between them and other types of monitor, such as video monitors, which, within the terms of the ITA and the CCT, are classified separately from computer monitors and attract a higher rate of duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">HM Customs and Excise together with the Department of Trade and Industry are satisfied that the proposed regulation provides a correct interpretation of the ITA and CCT. This clarification is intended to assist importers to clear their goods through Customs.</p>
