This is due to begin in February and should be completed in April. It is not possible to give a firm implementation date at this stage but it is hoped that the system will be in place by the summer of 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.6/1">Her Majesty's Government considers that the submission by Dr Fitzgerald to the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice (Cm 2263, July 1993, Research Study No. 20) did not consider the evidence for or against institutional racism in the administration of justice in England and Wales at that time. Dr Fitzgerald did not use that term in her submission, although she pointed out that there was scope for discrimination in the exercise of discretion by criminal justice agencies and in the legal and non-legal criteria which influence decisions during the criminal justice process.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.6/2">As would be expected of any analysis produced over six years ago, Dr Fitzgerald's account needs to be considered in the light of subsequent research and events. Any update would need to take into account the new definition of institutional racism proposed in the Macpherson report on the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the work being done throughout the criminal justice system to respond to its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.6/3">One of the recommendations is the extension of the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill, which is currently passing through Parliament. It will make both direct and indirect racial discrimination unlawful in respect of public functions not previously covered by the Race Relations Act 1976, including law enforcement functions. It will also place a positive statutory duty on public authorities, not just local authorities as now, to promote race equality. How the duty will operate in practice and be enforced will be the subject of consultation. Amendments on indirect discrimination and the duty to promote race equality will be brought forward when the Bill reaches Committee stage in the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.5/1">; This information is not routinely collected and would only be available through clinical trials. The content of the vaccine changes from year to year to reflect the strains of influenza virus that global surveillance predicts will be circulating. Its effectiveness therefore depends on how well the vaccine strains match those that cause disease each winter. This season there was a good match against the influenza viruses prevalent in the United Kingdom. The effectiveness of the vaccine also varies with age and with the strain of influenza. Overall, the vaccine is estimated to be around 70-80 per cent effective. Other respiratory viruses co-circulate with influenza, causing clinically similar illness and these are not prevented by influenza immunisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister made clear in his speech at the Mansion House on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-22">22 November</phrase> that the international community needs an agreed framework on when and how it is appropriate to intervene in the face of massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.

	<p pid="a.51.2/2">We believe that the development of a set of pragmatic understandings on action in response to humanitarian crises would help the Security Council--acting on behalf of the Members of the United Nations--to reach consensus when such crises occur, thus ensuring effective and timely action by the international community. In this context, we have put to the UN Secretary-General and to key international partners a set of ideas, of which the key elements are:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3" class="indent">first, any intervention is by definition a failure of prevention. Force should always be the last resort;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/4" class="indent">second, the immediate responsibility for halting violence rests with the state in which it occurs;</p>

	<p pid="a.52.3/1">The Government have no general policy on the provision of fine art in budgeting for and constructing public buildings. The Government encourages the involvement of artists throughout the design and construction process, but it is for individual client departments to decide whether they wish works of art to be included, and to budget for them accordingly. The Government Art Collection displays works of art by British artists in major government buildings, and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport provides core funding to the Royal Society of Arts for its Art for Architecture scheme.</p>

Ministers hope to make an announcement on this in the near future. In these meetings they have not discussed the tourism industry specifically. However, Ministers are aware of the importance of tourism to the economy of this country and the variety of employment opportunities available within the industry for disabled people, given the right level of training and support. Since the pilots began in autumn 1998, disabled people have found jobs in a wide range of industries, including tourism and other service industries.</p>
