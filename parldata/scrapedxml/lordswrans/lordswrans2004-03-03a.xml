	<p pid="a.102.3/1">Resolution of the conflict in northern Uganda is a priority for the UK and this is an issue in which the Prime Minister is taking a close interest. The conflict was discussed in detail during the meeting between the Prime Minister and President Museveni, when the president visited London at the end of January.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.3/2">The DfID office and British High Commission (BHC) in Uganda are in regular contact with representatives of the Acholi community, including religious, traditional and political leaders to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Immediately following the massacre in Lango region on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-21">21 February</phrase>, DfID was in contact with the leaders of the Acholi community and provided support for discussions between them and community leaders in other parts of northern Uganda focused on easing tribal tensions. It has not yet been possible for BHC and DfID to meet with President Museveni following the recent atrocities.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.3/3">The UK recognise that although there has to be a security response against the brutalities of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a sustainable peace is not possible through military means alone. For this reason, the UK together with the international community are supporting alternative conflict resolution strategies to the use of force. We are, for example, encouraging President Museveni to strengthen his Presidential Peace Team. We are also supporting amnesty activities and the Amnesty Commission, which encourages LRA combatants to give up their arms. We are exploring a number of avenues for improving local dialogue about peace, including through local FM radio. Between 2001 and 2003 DfID spent &pound;0.9 million in support of conflict reduction and peace programmes. We anticipate spending a further &pound;1.6 million between now and March 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.5/1">The Government announced in the Pre-Budget Report that they intend to introduce tax stamps for early 2006 as part of a reinforced strategy to tackle alcohol fraud. Tax stamps would apply only to spirits, as that is the sector in which fraud is estimated to be particularly high. The Government have also invited the industry to put forward alternative proposals which would be equally effective in tackling fraud. Both the practicalities of tax stamps and possible alternative proposals are being considered now in detailed discussions with the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/2">The costs of compliance for different sectors of the industry would depend on the measures taken to implement tax stamps, and on any measures the Government might introduce to offset that impact. The Government have said that they would consider how the current deferment arrangement for spirits duty could be extended as far as practical in recognition of the cash flow effects of purchasing tax stamps, and freezing spirits duty for the remainder of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/3">A full regulatory impact assessment will be produced if the Government proceed with this measure. This would make clear which business sectors would incur compliance costs, and what the nature and scale of those costs (one-off, annual, cashflow) would be.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/23">The table above relates to investment in establishments on offending behaviour programmes since 1999&ndash;2000. This includes generic &quot;cognitive skills&quot; programmes and specialist programmes for violent and sex offenders [but not drug programmes].</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/24">In addition to this specific investment there is an element of baseline funding which can not accurately be disaggregated from establishment budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/25">Comparison of Reconviction Rates</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/26">The international &quot;What Works&quot; evidence base indicates that &quot;cognitive skills programmes&quot; can be effective in reducing reconviction by up to 10 percentage points. Three evaluations of the Prison Service cognitive skills programmes comparing offenders who undertook the programme with an appropriate comparison group have been published. The first evaluation of pre-accredited prison based cognitive skills programmes (Research Findings 161, Friendship et al, 2002) in England and Wales with adult men found participation produced a significant reduction in reconviction of up to 14 percentage points. The second evaluation of accredited programmes run with adult male prisoners (Research Findings 206, Falshaw et al, 2003) found no impact of participation on reconviction. The most recent evaluation (Research Findings 161, Cann et al, November 2003) found that the one-year reconviction rate for both adult men and young offender programme completers (ie dropouts removed from analysis) was significantly lower than for comparison groups. This difference was not maintained at two years and there was no impact when all programme starters were considered (ie including programme dropouts in analysis).</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/27">An evaluation of the STOP, a cognitive skills programme which ran in Mid-Glamorgan between 1991&ndash;92 (Raynor and Vanstone 2001) found a reduction of five percentage points in reconviction rate for treated offenders compared with an untreated group at twelve months, but no difference in reconviction rates between two groups at 24 months. The research also found a reduction in the seriousness of reconviction for each of the follow-up periods for those who completed treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/28">Independent research has been commissioned by Home Office RDSD on behalf of the National Probation Service to evaluate the accredited programmes which only became widely available in 2001 in probation areas. This will be published later in 2004. This research will compare the reconviction rate of offenders attending the programme with a suitably matched comparison group.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">Same-sex couples, some of whom bring up children together, currently have no opportunity to obtain a legal status for their relationship. The civil partnership proposals would give them this opportunity. The Government agree that stable families provide the best environment for children, and the associated rights and responsibilities of civil partnership would help same-sex couples to provide and care for their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/2">The Government recognise that marriage is the best foundation for opposite-sex couples raising children and remains the choice of the majority of people in Britain. Opposite-sex couples who wish to obtain legal recognition for their relationships already have the choice of marriage. There are no plans to allow opposite-sex couples to register a civil partnership.</p>
