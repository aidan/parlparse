	<p pid="a.143.2/1">The role of the FV430/Bulldog is to provide protected transport for up to 10 soldiers, with weapons and equipment in battlefield conditions. Vehicles have also been adapted to provide engineer support, communications, recovery and repair and ambulances. The FV430 is being phased out to meet automotive legislation and a proportion of the fleet is being converted into Bulldog. The intention is to convert 900 FV430 into Bulldog. To date we have completed 744 conversions.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/2">Bulldog is an important part of the vehicle inventory. Without it all Mechanised Brigades would be ineffective, and all Armoured Brigades would be without combat support.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">Bulldog is not currently deployed in Afghanistan, but it performed well in Iraq. Land operations in Afghanistan mainly require light role forces, hence the temporary re-roling of four infantry battalions from the mechanised and armoured roles. Bulldog's utility on operations is continually considered but it is currently not the best solution for the specific protection and mobility requirements of operations in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.5/1">Workers in the care sector, as elsewhere, benefit from a legal framework of minimum workplace protections including the right to the national minimum wage, the right not to have to work more than an average of 48 hours each week, and health and safety safeguards. Employment agencies also have to comply with employment agency regulations, which are enforced by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills' (BIS's) Employment Agency Standards (EAS) Inspectorate. The EAS responds to all complaints, and carries out targeted, risk-based inspections. It has powers to prosecute in the civil courts, and the power to prohibit people from running employment agencies for up to 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/2">Last year, the Government launched a &#163;6 million, three-year information campaign to make sure that vulnerable workers are aware of their rights and of how to report abuses. As part of this work, BIS recently launched the Pay and Work Rights helpline on 0800 917 2368. It combines the functions of five previous helplines, making it easier for vulnerable workers to report bad treatment at work, and for government to respond. Where there is evidence of care workers suffering abuse, it should be reported to the new helpline.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.5/1">We share the growing concern over ocean acidification, caused by the ocean's uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by human activities, and the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to these changes. Ocean acidification provides yet further impetus to the case for urgent action on tackling and adapting to climate change because of the rapid rate of change already being measured. These issues are key to the delivery of a broad range of Defra's objectives in the marine and adaption to climate change programmes, and we have been pleased to see it coming up the IPCC's agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/2">The wider impacts of ocean acidification are not well understood at present. The recently announced UK Ocean Acidification Programme where Defra has joined together with the Natural Environment Research Council and the Department of Energy and Climate Change aims to drive forward this area of research. This &#163;12 million, five year research programme will address the policy and societal need for a greater understanding of the implications of ocean acidification and its risks to marine biogeochemistry and biodiversity and impact on the whole earth system. Ocean acidification is also an issue highlighted in the latest Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP) report launched last April (see <a href="http://www.mccip.org.uk/elr/default.htm">www.mccip.org.uk/elr/default.htm</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.146.2/1">The change in the threat level to substantial, meaning an attack is a strong possibility, does not mean the overall threat has gone away-there remains a real and serious threat against the United Kingdom and we would ask that the public remain vigilant. Substantial continues to indicate a high level of threat and that an attack might well occur without further warning.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/2">The decision to change the threat level is taken by JTAC independently of Ministers and is based on the very latest intelligence, considering factors such as current capability, intent and timescale.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/3">As substantial continues to represent a high level of threat there have been no significant change to policing arrangements, and security procedures at airports and other public places remain in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/4">The threat level is kept under constant review and can change-up or down-at any time in the future. Short-term changes in the threat level are therefore not a sound basis for making long-term strategic decisions about resourcing.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.2/1">The detailed evidence collected from Birmingham City Council will not be made available in the Library of the House as responses by local authorities contain information which might lead to individual children being identified if the data released were combined with other data that are publicly available, or which could be obtained by other means, including Freedom of Information Act requests. We are also concerned that release of the questionnaire could make local authorities reluctant to co-operate with departmental surveys in the future. In the context of the review of elective home education the department takes the view that release of such information could lead to harassment and vilification of individuals in the authority who were known to, or suspected to, have contributed to completion of the questionnaire.</p>

Similarly, data collected under the Flycapture scheme from local authorities on the number of fly tips cleared by the local authority show no increase in the amount of such waste being fly tipped between 2007 and 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.6/1">We would rather not detain families with children and would prefer that they left the UK voluntarily where the courts have upheld a decision of the UK Border Agency that they must leave the country. However, where they fail to leave after being given every opportunity and incentive to do so, the agency has no other option, other than to separate the family, but to detain in order to enforce their departure. Where detention is prolonged, it is normally because the family has made a last minute application to the court to frustrate the removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.6/2">However, we are investigating approaches which would reduce the need to use detention to enforce removal for families with children. We promote the assisted voluntary return scheme with the International Organization for Migration throughout the asylum process to provide assisted voluntary returns which cater for families' needs and allow a return that is dignified and sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.6/3">The agency is working in partnership with Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government to pilot an initiative in Glasgow to offer temporary housing and a package of support to a selection of families whom the UK Border Agency and the courts agree do not require international protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.6/4">Unaccompanied children are, exceptionally, detained in very limited circumstances. These are primarily for their safety and only overnight while alternative arrangements with the local children's services are made for their care.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">Detention is an essential component in maintaining an effective immigration control. It is usually appropriate in the following circumstances: initially, while a person's identity or basis of claim is being established; where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person will fail to comply with the conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release; as part of a fast-track asylum process; or to effect removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">The decision to detain, or to maintain detention, including those of Eritrean nationals, is made on a case by case basis taking account of the individual circumstances in each case. Imminence of removal and risk of harm to the public are among the factors considered in reaching a decision. There is no policy precluding the return of Eritrean nationals either to third countries or to Eritrea. Nor are there any plans to move away from a case by case approach to Eritreans who are held in immigration detention centres, whether or not they have claimed asylum.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/3">Detention is kept to the minimum period necessary for the purpose for which it was authorised and is not unduly prolonged. Individuals may prolong their own detention by, for example, refusing to co-operate with the redocumentation process or by frustrating lawful attempts at removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/4">Detention in each individual case is subject to review at increasingly senior levels within the UK Border Agency to ensure that it lasts only as long as it continues to be justified and necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/5">We believe that the current policies support a requirement to enforce our immigration laws and we therefore have no intention of changing them at this time.</p>
