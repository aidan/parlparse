	<p pid="b.69.2/1">This Government believe that transport infrastructure is essential for development. It is an engine for economic growth in developing countries. Safe, reliable transport is also crucial if poor people are to get to markets, health clinics and schools. The Department for International Development (DfID) provided over &pound;120 million for transportation and communication in Africa between 2001-02 and 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.2/2">In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), DfID has provided &pound;9 million to improve transport to and from isolated communities and help delivery of humanitarian aid. DfID is also developing a &pound;36 million five-year road rehabilitation and maintenance programme. This will open 1,300 kilometres of principal road links, re-establishing access for the population and supporting reintegration of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.2/3">In southern Sudan DfID has provided &pound;10 million to the World Food Programme's road rehabilitation programme. This will rehabilitate key sections of the road network to create better links between regions, and with northern Sudan and neighbouring countries. This will improve access to markets and services for the war-affected population.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.2/4">Transportation is also a priority for the recently established Infrastructure Consortium for Africa, a G8 Gleneagles commitment to facilitate infrastructure investment in Africa, particularly cross-border infrastructure. DfID has committed &pound;12 million to support its work.</p>

	<p pid="b.69.5/2">The level of copyright protection granted in the United Kingdom to works originating in other countries is dependent on the treaties and conventions to which the country of origin is a party. The United Kingdom does not provide protection beyond that which it is obliged to give under the EC Treaty and the various intellectual property treaties. However, the United Kingdom does grant reciprocal protection to the works of a particular country, where it is not a party to a particular convention, in cases where that country provides or will provide reciprocal protection to British works. Section 159(3) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 prohibits greater protection being granted to works of other countries on any other basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.70.4/2" qnum="HL5703">What recent consideration they have given to the use of hydrogen as an alternative form of energy.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-05-19b.70.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="70"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060519/text/60519w01.htm#60519w01_spmin3">
	<p pid="b.70.5/1">Hydrogen is an &quot;energy carrier&quot; rather than a fuel source, as, like electricity, it can only be produced using energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.5/2">Hydrogen can be used in a fuel cell, where it produces zero emissions at the point of use, and in normal combustion&mdash;for example, in an internal combustion engine.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.5/3">In 2004, the Department of Trade and Industry, commissioned analysis from the energy consultants E4Tech, Element Energy, and Eoin Lees Energy. That analysis indicates that, for the UK, the use of hydrogen as a transport fuel offers significant opportunities for cost-competitive CO2 reduction by 2030. Six different types of transport energy chain have this potential and offer increased energy security. None is readily available today and each would require significant changes to the energy system. However, they are sufficiently promising to be worth pursuing as energy options for the UK. This analysis was published on the department's website and can be found at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sources/sustainable/hydrogen/page26734.html">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sources/sustainable/hydrogen/page26734.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, the Government responded to this analysis and published <i>A Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy Activity in the UK</i>, which included a funding package from the DTI of &pound;15 million over four years for a UK-wide hydrogen and fuel cell demonstration programme. The demonstration scheme is in preparation, and will require EC state aid approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.5/5">Currently, the Department of Trade and Industry supports industrial collaborative research and development for fuel cell and hydrogen technologies through the technology programme. Bids specifically for hydrogen technologies have been invited since April 2005. The programme seeks to advance these technologies for both stationary power generation and transport applications, with a view to achieving the cost reductions and performance levels necessary for commercial deployment. This support currently amounts to approximately &pound;2 million to &pound;3 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.5/6">The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), including through the Supergen initiative, supports basic research in universities on both fuel cells and hydrogen. Supergen supports the UK Sustainable Hydrogen Energy Consortium (UK SHEC), which has received funding of &pound;2.5 million. This programme is supporting projects on hydrogen generation, hydrogen storage and socio-economic implications for a hydrogen economy. In addition to Supergen, EPSRC has awarded &pound;1 million to investigate the potential role of formic acid as a chemical method for the storage of hydrogen. Funding of &pound;500,000 has been granted to three projects on fundamental science and engineering relevant to the hydrogen economy. EPSRC also contributes to projects through the DTI's technology programme. More widely, the research councils EPSRC, ESRC and NERC have recently established the UK Energy Research Centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.5/7">The Government have also provided funding of over &pound;450,000 for the trial of three hydrogen-powered fuel cell buses in London as part of the EU CUTE (clean urban transport in Europe) project. Funding of &pound;7.5 million has been provided for the fuel cell and low-carbon vehicle technology centre of excellence (CENEX) based in Loughborough.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.5/8">The Department for Transport announced in January, as part of its Horizons innovative research programme, a competition for projects to investigate the options for the further steps required to move to the adoption of a hydrogen transport infrastructure. It is hoped to support between two and four projects examining the practicality and timing of the introduction of the required infrastructure to support hydrogen-fuelled vehicles at a cost of up to &pound;500,000.</p>
