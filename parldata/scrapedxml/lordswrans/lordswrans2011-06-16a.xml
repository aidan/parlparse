	<p pid="a.202.2/1">EU law provides a specific exemption from VAT for the supply of certain equipment and services used for sea rescue.

There are a number of special VAT reliefs for charities that provide rescue or first aid services, from which the air ambulance rescue teams benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/2">These charities are able to purchase free of VAT: medicines, medical equipment (including first-aid kits and stretchers), and to purchase/lease free of VAT the air ambulance itself. All of these reliefs are derogations from the normal EU VAT rules and are not enjoyed by charities in other member states. EU VAT agreements, entered into by successive Governments, do not allow the UK, or any other member state, to extend unilaterally the scope of existing zero rates or to introduce new ones.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.5/1">In 2009 the department completed a Strategic Investment Review of voluntary sector funding. As a result of this, the Section 64 general scheme of grants, which provided core funding to organisations, was replaced by the Innovation, Excellence and Service Development Fund. The purpose of the change was to make funding to the voluntary sector fairer and more transparent. It also means that organisations become more independent and less reliant upon statutory funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">Data on the numbers of asylum applications since 1997 that have been accepted or been otherwise permitted to remain are not available, in particular due to a change in the database used to record asylum applications in 2000.

	<p pid="a.203.2/3">The UK Border Agency (UKBA) remains committed to providing a safe haven for refugees and operates a firm but fair asylum system that is delivering faster decisions to identify those who genuinely need our protection as well as those who do not. All asylum and human rights claims are carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights against the background of the latest available information on asylum seekers' countries of origin.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/4">However, where it is found by the UK Border Agency and the courts that an asylum seeker does not require international protection and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to return, we expect that person to return to their country of origin voluntarily. UKBA only returns those who both the agency and the courts are satisfied do not need our protection and refuse to leave voluntarily. We are determined to remove those with no right to be in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.2/1">The Government have made clear their willingness to provide practical assistance to Greece on asylum and migration matters and in the past six months have sent a number of asylum experts to Greece as part of EU teams co-ordinated by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). Three further UK experts from EASO's Asylum Intervention Pool are due to be deployed to Greece in the next few months to support implementation of the Greek Government's National Action Plan for Managed Migration and Asylum Reform (Greek Action Plan). Separately the UK has given &#163;238,500 to UNHCR for projects related to asylum reform in Greece.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/2">As a result of the judgment in MSS v Belgium and Greece, the European Commission, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other EU member states have placed increased pressure on Greece to reform its asylum system so that they meet their obligations under EU law. The Government note that reform of the asylum system, including improving conditions for asylum seekers, is high on the Greek political agenda and there is some evidence that progress is being made. But we will continue to monitor the implementation of the Greek Action Plan closely to ensure effective improvements are carried out.</p>

The department recommends that the intake of non-milk extrinsic sugars-ie, those added to food-should not exceed 60g/day or 11 per cent of food energy, which is based on expert advice from the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food Policy. Government advice discourages giving babies sugary drinks and food, and older children and families are encouraged to substitute sugary drinks with water, milk (ideally semi-skimmed), sugar-free drinks, sugar-free squash, or unsweetened fruit juice.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">The department is not aware of any evidence of a direct, long-term link between children's caffeine consumption and altered behaviour. For children who might substitute high caffeine soft drinks for other soft drinks, consumption might represent an increase in daily caffeine exposure compared with their previous intake. The Food Standards Agency advises that children and other people who are sensitive to caffeine should consume these and other food products with significant amounts of caffeine (such as coffee) only in moderation.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.6/1">Further to the Written Answer by Lord McNally on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-26">26 October 2010</phrase> (<I>WA 274-75</I>), 39 of the 64 providers in breach of the fixed fee margin key performance indicator (KPI) for their asylum work in 2009-10 were awarded asylum contracts in the 2010 civil bid round and were awarded 7,863 asylum matter starts in total. In terms of immigration cases, owing to a corruption of the data set a duplicate record has been produced which now indicates 53 immigration providers were in breach, and not 54 as previously stated. Of those 53 providers in breach of the fixed fee margin KPI for their immigration work in 2009-10, 33 were awarded immigration contracts in the 2010 civil bid round and were awarded 7,678 immigration matter starts in total.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.6/2">Under the previous unified contract, key performance indicators were performance measures only and were not criteria for the award of contracts in the 2010 bid round. However, they are now requirements of the 2010 standard civil contract.</p>
