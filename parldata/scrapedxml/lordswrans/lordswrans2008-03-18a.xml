	<p pid="a.25.2/1">In 2006-07, the Department for Transport spent &pound;0.4 million for business case development and challenge of appraisal of improvements to the rail network. The largest portion of this was on appraising the modernisation of the west coast main line.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/2">Franchise replacements include a significant amount of appraisal as part of the invitation to tenders against which bidders submit their bids. During 2006-07, there were five franchise replacements and some appraisal work to support developments to existing franchises. It is difficult to isolate the appraisal element from work on timetabling, performance and consultation and other aspects, but an indicative figure for the 2006-07 year might be &pound;0.5 million to &pound;0.75 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/3">The department does not centrally collate individual local authorities' expenditures for submitting proposals. However, in 2006-07, the department provided authorities involved in the Congestion Transport Innovation Fund with &pound;5 million for the development of schemes. This met more than two-thirds of the costs of the submissions, with the local authorities meeting the other part of the costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/4">In the Highways Agency, the costs related to preparing appraisal submissions are part of the total costs of major projects approved by Ministers. The specific financial information related to appraisal work cannot easily be separated out from overall scheme costs as it is an integral element of scheme preparation.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/5">The department assesses the value for money of proposals, using the evidence provided by the appraisals and this is estimated to cost about &pound;0.3 million, including the fees of consultants brought in to assist for complex proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.2/1">The previous Answer (<I>WA 185</I>) provided numbers of secondary teachers leaving the maintained sector by total length of service in each year from 1997-98 to 2005-06, irrespective of when they qualified.

	<p pid="a.36.2/20">The latest available data can only be used to track three cohorts of qualifiers from 1997 onwards for six years after entering service. Of the 9,300 secondary teachers who qualified in 1997, around 3,000 had left service six years later; in 1998, the corresponding figures were 8,700 and 2,700, respectively; and in 1999, the corresponding figures were 8,800 and 2,700, respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.2/22">It can be seen from the table that wastage rates have remained largely constant over this period with decreases evident in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.2/23">Many teachers return to service after a break. In 2005-06, the latest year for which figures are available, around 10,000 qualified teachers returned to service in the maintained sector (all school types) after a break of at least one year.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/1">The World Health Organisation International Programme on Chemical Safety has recently reviewed the data on the toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls in its Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents series.

	<p pid="a.38.5/2">Human studies have identified associations between exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl mixtures and adverse reproductive effects, effects on sperm motility, foetal growth rate and development and neurological function in the offspring, and cancer. However, the human studies are restricted by limited exposure data, inconsistency among some results, and the presence of confounding factors; these make it impossible to use them as a basis for risk estimations and thus cannot be assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/3">Data from animal and related experiments indicate that polychlorinated biphenyls do not have any significant mutagenic or genotoxic properties but they are carcinogenic.

	<p pid="a.39.0/1">The new requirement relates to an agreed UN-ECE regulation (not a European directive). The UK is already a signatory and no further processes are required.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/2">From 2011-12 new types of vehicle will have to be fitted with dedicated low-wattage daylight running lights (DRLs) which automatically activate when the engine is started. This applies only to new types of vehicle, not to new vehicles built under existing type approvals. There is no requirement for existing vehicles to use dipped-beam headlamps during the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/3">Research has estimated that, while mandatory dedicated DRLs may provide a net accident reduction of between 3.9 to 5.9 per cent, they may also increase fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by about 0.5 per cent. Fuel prices vary and we do not have calculations of the costs requested, but for an average petrol-engine car we estimate that this will result in a decrease from 32 miles per gallon (mpg) to 31.94 mpg and for an average diesel heavy goods vehicle from 7.8 mpg to 7.76 mpg.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/4">Although dedicated DRLs are low-wattage it is possible that they might in some circumstances mask motorcyclists, but there is no definitive evidence of this. However, motorcycles have been omitted from the DRL requirements so that riders will, as now, remain free to use dipped headlamps during the daytime on a voluntary basis. This has been welcomed by motorcycle user groups.</p>
