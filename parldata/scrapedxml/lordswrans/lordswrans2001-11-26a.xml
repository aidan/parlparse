	<p pid="a.5.2/1">I understand from the Chief Constable of the Thames Valley Police, who is responsible for administering the firearm and shot gun certification process within his area, that in the financial year 2000&ndash;01 the revenue accrued from gun licensing was &pound;326,184. These funds were credited to the Thames Valley Police revenue budget. The overall expenditure of the firearms department for this period was &pound;431,224. In the current financial year the revenue accrued from gun licensing to date (i.e. week 31) is &pound;251,694. It is forecast that the overall cost of the firearms department will be &pound;446,940.</p>

Extra capacity is urgently needed and the Prison Service has decided that the best way of providing this is a further change of function of male accommodation. Buckley Hall prison near Rochdale has been selected as the most suitable option in terms of suitable accommodation, geographical location, staffing arrangements and other related factors. The prison is expected to be ready to accept female prisoners from early next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/1">The categories of off-road vehicles entitled to use red diesel are set out in Schedule 1 to the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act (HODA) 1979. Customs has made no assessment of the quantities of red diesel used by different categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">In deciding eligibility to the rebated rate of duty, the user (the individual or company buying rebated oil) must be satisfied that the end use to which the rebated fuel is put is an eligible one, based on the definitions set out in HODA (and explained in Customs and Excise Notice 75 (Fuel for diesel vehicles)). For the majority of users, this decision is clear cut and is based on the type of vehicle the fuel will be used in and where it will be used (HODA Sections 11-12 and Schedule 1). Where there is any doubt, they should consult their supplier for advice and contact the Customs National Advice Service if unsure.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">Customs' road fuel testing units provide checks, targeted to particular risks, which aim to detect and discourage misuse of these fuels as road fuels. In doing so, they will seek evidence in support of the user's judgment of eligibility.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">The Government have decided that the publication scheme provisions of the Act will be implemented for central government in November 2002 at the start of a rolling programme of implementation across the public sector. The individual right of access to information will be implemented for all public authorities at the end of this process in January 2005. This is the Government's preferred approach because it allows time for the required training to be undertaken and appropriate procedures to be put in place to ensure a workable Freedom of Information Act is implemented in a changed culture. It also aligns the implementation of the right of access provisions with the Government's target for the electronic records management project. This initiative will enable the fast retrieval and accurate creation and storage records that will be necessary to meet the demands of the Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.5/2">We believe that before considering long-term structural changes to the housing benefit system, it is right to focus on improving benefit administration and, where possible, simplifying the scheme.

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-11-26a.11.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="11"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo011126/text/11126w03.htm#11126w03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.11.0/1">Following extensive consultations last year, we announced our plans to make the rents charged by councils and housing associations fairer and to improve tenants' choice in our housing policy statement Quality and Choice: A decent home for all&mdash;the way forward for housing last December. Starting in April 2002, we will begin a series of gradual changes that will result in rents being linked to the value and size of a property and manual earnings in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">Moving to a fairer system will have real benefits: social rents will remain affordable and generally well below market levels; there will be no large rent increases; we have set a limit of RPI + 0.5 per cent + &pound;2 on the annual increase in any individual rent; and average rents will increase more slowly than in the past; in particular council rents will increase at only half the rate over the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">I can today announce a further safeguard. Concerns have been expressed about the effect of the rent restructuring formula on a small proportion of properties in high value areas&mdash;around - per cent of the total social housing stock. To meet these concerns we have decided that the reforms should not lead to rents exceeding a maximum &pound;100 a week in 2002&ndash;03 for any council or housing association home. Lower figures will apply for smaller properties. The maximum will rise by RPI + 1 per cent a year. Some social housing rents are already above these levels and they will be frozen or reduce over time. Average council rents will remain around half the maximum figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4">Housing associations are free to decide how quickly they move their rents to the levels required by rent restructuring although they should aim to complete the process as far as possible in the next 10 years. We have advised the chairman of the Housing Corporation that, where housing associations do not need to put their rents up in order to remain financially sound, they should not be pressed to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/5">I understand that the computer systems used by some local authorities limit their ability to apply different rent changes to different properties next April. I am advising those authorities that for 2002&ndash;03 they should apply the average percentage rent change suggested in our restructuring proposals for their stock to all of their rents except where this might involve breaches of the RPI + 0.5 per cent + &pound;2 limit, or the maximum rents announced today. The subsidy system will not penalise authorities for not implementing the reforms at an individual property level.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/6">We will consult further with local authorities and tenant groups about the movement from averaged rent increases to the rents which we expect to be charged for individual properties by the end of the 10-year transitional period.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/7">Progress on rent restructuring will be kept under constant review. We will monitor the impact closely each year and will conduct further research on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/8">The Government have already doubled the resources allocated to local authorities for investment in housing and are committed to increasing them further. In particular, we have committed ourselves to ensuring that all social housing meets the decent homes standard by 2010. This will involve eliminating the &pound;19 billion council housing investment backlog we inherited.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/9">Accordingly, my department is today issuing consultation drafts of the housing revenue account subsidy and Item 8 determinations for 2002&ndash;03 which set out proposed subsidy allocations for individual authorities. These are being issued following consultation with authorities and others in which there was general support for the objectives of the proposed changes but concerns were expressed about aspects of the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/10">In response to these concerns I should like to make it clear that there is no intention that the technical changes designed to bring the assumptions within the subsidy system back into line with actual costs and revenues should be used either to reduce or increase the aggregate level of resources available to councils nationally. Indeed, the starting assumption in the forthcoming spending review will be that these changes should be resource neutral overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/11">Some redistribution of resources between authorities is inevitable if we are to move to a fairer system for distributing resources. However, in view of the concerns expressed, we will review the formulae used in determining subsidy with local authorities to ensure that they reflect as accurately as possible the relative costs faced by different authorities. The HRA subsidy system for 2003&ndash;04 will be adjusted as necessary to reflect those consultations and the outcome of the spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/12">The proposal to abolish Xmitigation&quot;&mdash;the mechanism used to ensure that councils with a higher proportion of tenants in receipt of housing benefit are not heavily penalised by the rent rebate subsidy system&mdash;will not be implemented at this stage. We will consult further on this and a decision on the future of mitigation will be taken in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/13">All the other changes proposed for 2002&ndash;03 will be implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/14">Copies of the draft determinations and supporting material are being placed in the Library of the House and will be available on my department's website. These allocations are based on information available to us from authorities as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-29">29 October 2001</phrase> and may change as that information is refined. Authorities have until <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase> to comment on the draft determinations.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is expected to make formal recommendations on what may be contained in a bill of rights early in 2002. When those recommendations have been received, the Government will consider them and will consult with any interested parties, including the Irish Government at that stage. However, the Belfast Agreement does not specifically require the Irish Government to incorporate any bill of rights for Northern Ireland into the Irish constitution.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.5/3">There is nothing in the Northern Ireland Act to preclude the devolved administration from holding events with a human rights theme. Indeed, the Northern Ireland departments are public authorities for the purposes of the Human Rights Act and under Section 24 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 are obliged to ensure that they do not act in any way that is incompatible with the convention rights. Similarly, any appointments made by the Northern Ireland Executive are a matter for them.</p>
