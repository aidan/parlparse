	<p pid="a.175.5/3">The Competition Commission is the UK's independent competition authority and is therefore carrying out this investigation independent of government, industry or other parties. The role of the Department for Transport in this investigation is, like other parties, to respond to requests for evidence. It has no role in determining the Competition Commission's final views but will of course have a keen interest in those findings and the extent to which they may have implications for the delivery of the air transport White Paper policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.6/1">The Government are considering the committee's recommendations and will submit their formal response to the committee within the next two months. However, I would like to reassure my noble friend that the MoD takes its duty of care to service personnel and veterans seriously and already has measures in place for personnel leaving the services with long-term mental illnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/2">Medical discharge from the Armed Forces due to psychological illness is low; around 150 personnel (less than 0.1 per cent) are discharged annually for mental health reasons, whatever the cause. Once a decision has been taken to medically discharge an individual with mental health problems, the Defence Medical Services mental health team that has been caring for that individual will begin a liaison with appropriate civilian healthcare providers (e.g. the general practitioner (GP) and civilian mental health team) to ensure that transfer of care and patient history takes place. In addition, we have mental health social workers who manage the individual's wider resettlement issues, liaising with relevant civil agencies such as local housing authorities, financial authorities, service welfare and charitable organisations, with the aim of ensuring that the individual's transfer into the civilian environment is as smooth and as seamless as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/3">It is also recognised that, in some cases, it may be many years after discharge before a veteran begins to display mental health symptoms arising from their service. With this in mind, the department announced in a Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-12">12 June 2007</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-06-12.40"><I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/6/07; col. 40WS</phrase>) an extension of the medical assessment programme (MAP), based at St Thomas's Hospital, London, to include all veterans who have served on operations since 1982, including the Falklands conflict. The MAP offers assessment by an expert in the mental health problems arising from military service and will include, where appropriate, a recommendation to the individual and their GP for treatment. Veterans who have concerns about their mental health can seek a referral to the MAP by their doctor; the cost of the assessment is borne by the MoD.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/4">In conjunction with the Department of Health, we also launched in November of last year the first of a number of community mental health pilots. Each site will have a trained community veterans' mental health therapist, and veterans will be able to access this service directly or through their GP, ex-service organisations, the Veterans' Welfare Service or social service departments. Four pilots are now operational (at South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Camden and Islington, Bishop Auckland and Cardiff), with one in Cornwall due to follow shortly. A similar pilot scheme in Scotland, based in the Lothian region, was announced recently by the Scottish Executive. If the pilots prove successful, the model will be rolled out more widely across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/5">In addition, the MoD provides assessment and treatment for demobilised reservists with operational service since 2003. MoD is also the major donor to the charity Combat Stress, which offers care to ex-service personnel suffering from service-related post-traumatic stress disorder. The MoD has increased the fees that we pay to 45 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.0/1">The central-local concordat, agreed between the Government and the Local Government Association (LGA) on behalf of local authorities in England, was signed in December last year. It commits both parties to a framework of principles to secure a new relationship between central government and local government. Discharging the rights and responsibilities of central government and local government set out in the concordat will require major changes in the behaviour and practice of both parties. The operation of this agreement will be monitored on a continuing basis, through renewed central-local partnership arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">We are discussing with the LGA how we take forward the concordat, focusing on its guiding principles and specific commitments. These include encouraging councils to make effective use of their power to promote the well-being of their area; enabling local government to conduct a growing share of the business of government; central government consulting and collaborating with councils in setting national policies and proposing legislation; reducing the burden of appraisal and approval regimes and the volume of guidance issued by central government to local authorities; supporting and encouraging strong leadership and effective partnership working at local level; and increasing local democratic accountability of key public services, in particular the police and health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/3">A single set of 198 national indicators for local authorities and local authority partnerships was announced as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007, and consultation on detailed definitions of the set concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-21">21 December 2007</phrase>, with the aim of announcing final decisions in February.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/4">Local authorities across England are engaged in discussions with government offices on behalf of all government departments on the content of new-style local area agreements, which will have effect from 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/5">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has responsibilities in relation to a number of local government services including, waste, street cleanliness, flood management and protection of the natural environment. The department has worked with local government to develop a streamlined set of 13 indicators for these services and for new areas such as climate change, as part of the new national indicator set.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/6">The department welcomes and is fully engaged through its officials in government offices in the negotiation of the new-style LAAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/7">The department retains very few &quot;ring-fenced&quot; funding arrangements, and these usually exist where it is agreed with local government that the arrangement is the most appropriate solution to targeting support for small projects dealing with, for example, contaminated land.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.5/2">The reduced rate of inspection is determined by the European Commission in consultation with the member states according to a fixed formula. This takes account of the volume of that particular trade from the country in question over a three-year period and the history and seriousness of interceptions of quarantine pests associated with that trade. The safer a trade proves to be, coupled with the volume of trade in the particular product from that country, the lower will be the reduced inspection rate which may be applied. Therefore, the reduced inspection rate may vary for the same material depending on its origin. Where a trade already subject to a reduced frequency of inspection proves to be less safe than previously, the reduced frequency percentage may be increased according to a fixed formula back up to the maximum of 100 per cent inspections.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.0/1">The rights of way legislation in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 provides only for the recording, on the definitive map and statement, of public rights of way that already exist and that consequently the public may already use. Therefore, when making a decision under this Act, a local highway authority, or the Secretary of State, would be beyond their jurisdiction to consider anything other than the existence of the public right of way in law. There are provisions in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 that enable local authorities to manage any impact from a public right of way through a site of special scientific interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.3/1">Over the years, telephone and other utility service providers have applied a price differential between customers who pay their accounts by direct debit and those who pay by other means. This reflects the increased processing and debt-management costs associated with payments not made by direct debit. Such differentials are common practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/2">The independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-06">6 June 2007</phrase> that it would carry out a full review of communications providers' additional charges. Ofcom expects to announce the conclusions of its review soon, and progress may be monitored on its website <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>. Whilst gas and electricity suppliers also have differentials between various payment methods, they do not impose additional monthly charges for customers who do not pay by direct debit.</p>
