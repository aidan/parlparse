	<p pid="a.57.5/1">Due to technical difficulties with the availability of appropriate ground elevation models, there has been a delay in the catchment flood management plan (CFMP) programme. So far only one of the five pilots has published a plan (for the River Parrett in Somerset) and Defra officials have been discussing with the Environment Agency the extent to which this meets the agreed guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.5/2">At least one further CFMP pilot is nearing completion and we hope that a further draft plan will be published before the end of the year.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-08a.58.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="58"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031008/text/31008w01.htm#31008w01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.58.0/1">The enclosed table shows the number of animals claimed in 2001 under the Beef Special Premium Scheme (BSPS), the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) and the Slaughter Premium Scheme/Veal Calf Slaughter Premium Scheme (SPS/VCSPS) and the number of claims submitted under the Extensification Payment Scheme (EPS).</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/2">All animal and claim details were cross-checked against the cattle tracing system in accordance with the European regulations that govern these schemes. The table shows the initial number of discrepancies identified between the information declared by producers on their subsidy claim forms and the data held on the cattle tracing system. All discrepancies were examined by RPA and where necessary by the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS). Where the discrepancy could not be resolved and the data held on the cattle tracing system meant that the animal claimed was ineligible under the rules governing the subsidy schemes the animal was removed from the claim with penalties. The table shows the penalties applied under each of the schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/3">Many of the errors that could be put right did relate to discrepancies between what the cattle tracing system and the information given to other parts of the department had been told about animals by keepers. The most common errors were differences in animals' eartag numbers between notifications, the failure to report the movement of cattle or the reporting of incomplete or conflicting information. Some 91 per cent of all the discrepancies found were able to be resolved and all queries cleared. The remaining 9 per cent could not be cleared because of the severity in the nature of the error.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/4">A number of measures have taken place to try to minimise the number of discrepancies between the data declared on subsidy claims and the cattle tracing system for future scheme years, including the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/5" class="indent">We have worked closely with industry representatives to ensure producers understand that their claims will be cross-checked and to promote the need to keep CTS up to date and regularly check their records held on the database.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/6" class="indent">RPA has also issued further guidance in the cattle schemes explanatory booklet, which is mailed to all bovine subsidy claimants.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/7" class="indent">The format of claim forms has been changed and since the 2002 schemes producers have been asked to submit movement cards (torn from the CTS-issued cattle passports) in support of their</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/8" class="indent">SCPS and SPS/VCSPS claims (cattle passport documents themselves have always been required with BSPS claims). The movement cards allow RPA to scan in the identifying number of the animal using a pre-printed barcode. This ensures a direct match with the animal record held on CTS and prevents problems with transposition errors and formatting differences.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/9" class="indent">BCMS has stationed experienced staff at RPA claim processing sites and now provides regular training updates on the use of the CTS database.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/10" class="indent">The introduction of statements containing a record of all transactions reported will aid the process of continuous improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/11" class="indent">The management structure of the existing crosschecks team at BCMS has been strengthened and additional staff have been recruited. An enhanced training programme has been successfully carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/12" class="indent">BCMS provides keepers with access to printed and electronic information on their holdings records so that problems may be identified and corrected in advance of subsidy deadlines. BCMS also actively promotes electronic notifications to the database through the CTS website at <a href="http://www.bcms.gov.uk">www.bcms.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/13" class="indent">The BCMS has also now supplied all cattle keepers with envelopes to return batches of movement cards in to reduce the number that are lost in the post. They have also introduced an additional counting and reconciliation step in their handling of these movement cards to ensure that all cards received at the site are scanned into the system and their contents recorded.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">There is no definition of the term &quot;vermin&quot; in UK law. In such a situation the Oxford Dictionary definition should be applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/2">The Oxford Dictionary defines &quot;vermin&quot; as &quot;Animals of a noxious or objectionable kind. Originally applied to reptiles, stealthy, or slinky animals, and various wild beasts; now, excluding in US and Australia, almost entirely restricted to those animals or birds which prey upon preserved game . . .&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/3">The Small Ground Vermin Traps Order 1958 and the various Spring Traps Approval Orders, refer to &quot;small ground vermin&quot;. Neither the orders nor the Pests Act 1954, under which they are made, define this term or provide an exclusive list of species. However, the following animals are listed under various orders: moles, grey squirrels, rabbits, mink, stoats, weasels, rabbits, rats, and mice.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/4">Traps approved under the Spring Traps Approval Order 1995 do not apply to small ground vermin listed in Schedules 5 and 6 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This means that red squirrels, dormice, water voles, shrews, hedgehogs, polecats and a number of other species are excluded.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.0/1">At present, there are no commercially viable technologies for producing bioethanol from woody material. Significant advances are currently being made in developing ways to use this feedstock. The technologies can be broadly characterised as: ligno-cellulosic technologies&mdash;the enzyme-based hydrolysis of cellulose-rich biomass; dilute acid hydrolysis&mdash;the use of acids to break down cellulose into fermentable sugars; and gasification and reformation&mdash;the application of heat and pressure to break down biomass into syn-gas which is then reformed into ethanol, or other road fuels.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/2">Large scale commercialisation of these technologies is unlikely for some years and firm costs are not yet available. Current research gives estimated production costs of 50 to 56 pence per litre from ligno-cellulosic enzyme hydrolysis and 30 to 40 pence per litre from gasification.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.8/1">The safety of blood and blood products used in the National Health Service is of paramount importance. Although most United Kingdom sourced fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not virally inactivated, high levels of safety are achieved by using single unit, as opposed to pooled plasma, by screening out potential high-risk donors and by testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C before it is released to hospitals. In addition, the National Blood Authority (NBA) is conducting an options appraisal of means to minimise the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury from FFP.</p>

The NBA is involved in arranging for supplies of FFP for this group of patients.

Fifty five per cent of the population were born before 1971 and the uptake of vaccine in the immediate years preceding this stoppage was 35 to 40 per cent. The estimate for the proportion of the current United Kingdom population now who have ever been vaccinated is about a third.
