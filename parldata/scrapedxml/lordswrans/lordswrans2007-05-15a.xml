	<p pid="a.20.2/1">The department has made over 750 general and local statutory instruments since 2001. However, the department does not have a central database of revoked regulations or which identifies those that are updated regulations, and collation of the data requested would involve disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">The department views the revocation, modernisation and rationalisation of its regulations as an essential part of its approach to regulating better. For example, the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2005, which govern the statutory controls on veterinary medicines, provided much-needed clarity and improved comprehension by replacing part of the Medicines Act 1968 and 49 separate statutory instruments. To keep these regulations up to date and to maintain their ease of use they havebeen replaced by the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2006 as part of an annual exercise to revoke and remake them.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/3">The Veterinary Medicines Regulations are one of a number of simplification measures the department is taking forward. The department's 2006 simplification plan, <I>Maximising Outcomes, Minimising Burdens</I>, identifies a reduction in the administrative burden Defra imposes on business of &pound;159 million, more than 30 per cent of the department's total administrative burden. Copies of the simplification plan are available from the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">Defra is committed to a comprehensive programme of regulating better. Our December 2006 simplification plan, <I>Maximising Outcomes, Minimising Burdens</I>, explains the action that is being takenacross Defra and its agencies to reduce administrative burdens and to improve regulations. That includes removing redundant legislation without compromising environmental standards, seeking alternatives to traditional regulation and taking a risk-based approach to enforcement and inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">The simplification plan, which is available from the Library of the House, identifies over 130 separate initiatives that will contribute to meeting our target of reducing the administrative burden we impose on business by 25 per cent by 2010.

They include:</p>

	<p pid="a.22.3/1">The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) was the competent control authority (CCA) in England for groundwater (SMR 2), sewage sludge (SMR 3) and nitrate vulnerable zones (SMR 4) for the 2005 and 2006 single payment scheme (SPS) years. However, it delegated checking these SMRs to the Environment Agency (EA).</p>

It is therefore now responsible for selecting 1 per cent of all SPS claimants for an on-the-spot check using a risk analysis appropriate to the SMRs for which it is responsible for enforcing. The RPA, as the paying agency, is still required to pass SPS claimant data to the EA. This was provided to the EA in December 2006, which should allow it sufficient time to select the inspections for 2007 and complete them by the end of the calendar year.</p>

At its meeting in March 2007, the NSC considered further work undertaken by the AAA screening working group. More detailed work will now be undertaken on the practical issues that would be involved in implementation.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">There is now a coalition of 150 organisations working together and using social marketing techniques to develop a deep understanding of the drivers of families' food and physical activity habits. This has informed twomain areas of work enhancing the programmes to tackle obesity: first, improving the effectiveness of initiatives through understanding and supporting families in overcoming the barriers that prevent them leading healthier lifestyles; secondly, tackling obesity requires a societal response with a broad range of organisations working collaboratively to influence the problem. The Government are providing directionfor this work and facilitating these working partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/2">These two work areas have also helped in the development of a number of new campaigns, rolling out from spring 2007. The first of these campaigns, a 5 A DAY campaign branded as Top Tips for Top Mums is an initiative to tackle the key barriers to children eating fruit and vegetables.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">We fully accept that an effective civil justice system delivers a collective benefit to society as well as helping those people specifically involved in individual cases. But it does not follow that taxpayers should subsidise the level of court fees generally. Rather, help should be directed at those least able to pay court fees. Litigants that can afford to pay the full cost should do so. To set fees at a lower level, or remove them altogether, would allow corporations and other wealthy litigants to benefit from taxpayer contributions. Further, the, reduction in income would increase pressure on other budgets such as legal aid.</p>
