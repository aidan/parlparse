	<p pid="a.162.3/1">Today we are announcing the distribution of the remaining &pound;175 million of unallocated Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) resources for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/2">The NRF was launched in 2001&ndash;02, providing &pound;900 million over three years as a time-limited component of the Government's long-term strategy for tackling deprivation in our poorest neighbourhoods. For over two years NRF has been assisting the 88 recipient local authorities and their fellow local strategic partnership (LSP) members in establishing inclusive and effective partnership structures and strategic approaches to addressing the particular deprivation problems of each local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/3">The spending review 2002 settlement provided for further support for the NRF's challenging remit, continuing to give a targeted boost to ongoing increases in mainstream public service investment in deprived areas. SR2002 allocated to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister an additional &pound;975 million of NRF resources&mdash;&pound;450 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;525 million in 2005&ndash;06. We announced the allocation of &pound;800 million of these resources in April this year, confirming that the existing 88 eligible areas shall receive a further &pound;400 million in total in each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/4">Over the past few months we have given detailed consideration to the best way in which to distribute the residual &pound;175 million of NRF resources for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. After examining a range of options we have concluded that we should focus resources in those areas which have great need in terms of health, education, crime and other aspects measured by the Government's floor target indicators. These floor targets are designed to ensure that the poorest areas do not get left behind and see significant improvements in outcomes on health, education and other measures. That is why we are announcing today that 26 local authority areas that are currently eligible for NRF are also eligible for a share of the residual &pound;175 million. These 26 areas have been selected because they are ranked in the lowest 10 areas against two or more indicators used to measure progress towards the national floor targets, ie they have the furthest distance to travel in order to meet these floor targets. Tabled below is a list of the eligible areas and their allocations in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/5">There are several reasons why we are taking this approach. First is the fact that the achievement of the floor targets is one of our top priorities. Delivering improvements for our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods is fundamental to the objectives we have set ourselves in the Communities Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/6">We also recognise the importance of NRF in helping local service providers to work collectively through local strategic partnerships to address local priorities, and to meet national floor targets at the local level. We are pleased with and greatly encouraged by the good progress already being made by the 88 NRF local authorities and their LSP colleagues. However, some areas have a greater task than others to deliver the improvements needed in areas such as the health of local people, educational achievement and preventing crime. Joan</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/7">The &pound;175 million of residual NRF resources will provide these 26 areas with additional financial support to meet this challenge.</p>

This stage will be used to increase the maturity of the carrier design, and will pave the way for placing contracts for the demonstration and manufacture (D&amp;M) phase in spring 2004. The work will be managed by a single, integrated team staffed by BAeS and Thales UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.8/2">Since the end of January, progress has been maintained in developing the design of the warship. In parallel, positive discussions have been conducted with BAe SYSTEMS and Thales UK on how to take forward the alliance approach to the programme set out by the Secretary of State in January. Discussions will continue between all three parties to refine the precise terms of the alliance and the D&amp;M contract, and will complete early next year. These discussions will be conducted concurrently with the stage 3 design work, and will place the department in a strong position to proceed quickly to place the D&amp;M contract expected in spring 2004.

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-09-16a.166.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="166"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030916/text/30916w02.htm#30916w02_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.166.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has completed its reviews of the current Armed Forces pension and compensation arrangements. We have taken account of views expressed during the public consultation in 2001, and in particular those serving in the Armed Forces, those representing the ex-service community, and the recommendations made by the House of Commons Defence Committee in March <sup>1</sup> 2002. In reaching our decisions we have also taken account of the changes in policy likely to emerge from the Inland Revenue paper on tax simplification <sup>2</sup> . Our proposals are also consistent with the policies recently published by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. <sup>3</sup> The new schemes are designed to be fairer, to reflect modern practice and to meet the needs of the Armed Forces in the 21st century, and offer a high level of assurance for service personnel. The Government intend to introduce the primary and secondary legislation required to implement these new schemes as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/2" class="indent">(1) HCDC Third Report: The MoD Reviews of Armed Forces Pension and Compensation Arrangements (HC 666) - <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-09">9 May 2002</phrase>. HCDC Fifth Special Report: The MoD Reviews of Armed Forces Pension and Compensation Arrangements: Government's Response (HC 1115)</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/3" class="indent">(2) Simplifying the taxation of pensions: increasing choice for all (December 2002)</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/4" class="indent">(3) Simplicity, Security and Choice: working and saving for retirement&mdash;Action on occupational pensions. (June 2003)</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/5">A new Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) will be introduced for new entrants on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> and we will give current members of the Armed Forces the opportunity to transfer to the new scheme as soon as possible but no later than <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2007</phrase>. This decision to transfer will be entirely voluntary for each individual member. The new AFPS will remain a defined benefit scheme but will be based on final pensionable pay and will provide the same benefits for officers and other ranks. There are substantial new arrangements for dependants: a death-in-service benefit of four times pensionable pay (increased from up to one and a half times pensionable pay previously); an increase of 25% in widow(er)'s pension compared to the current scheme; and an extension of dependants' benefits to unmarried partners where there is a substantial relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/6">These changes reflect key concerns raised during consultation and address the need to make proper provision for those who are left behind when personnel are killed in service.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/7">The scheme has retained its normal retirement age of 55, but preserved pensions will be paid at age 65. The current early immediate pension provision has been replaced with an early departure scheme which is expected to ensure compliance with expected revisions to Inland Revenue policy with respect to the earliest date at which normal pension benefits can be paid. The early departure scheme will offer a similar structure of benefits to the immediate pension, but with changes which help to fund some improvements in pension benefits and the cost of pensioners living longer. Overall, the changes will be broadly cost-neutral, taking account of the steps taken to cover increasing longevity costs. ra</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/8">The new compensation scheme will be introduced in April 2005 and will replace provisions under the War Pensions Scheme and attributable benefits under the current AFPS for incidents arising from that date. The new scheme reflects modern practice. It is fair, transparent, simple to understand and offers consistent outcomes, with more focus on the more severely disabled. It is a no-fault scheme. It provides a lump-sum payment for pain and suffering which is a new benefit not available under current arrangements. In addition, a guaranteed income stream (GIS) will be awarded alongside higher level tariff awards for those who suffer significant loss of earnings capacity. Unlike the current arrangements, there will be in-service lump-sum awards for pain and suffering, including for injuries resulting from warlike activities. Benefits will be provided for dependants where deaths result from service but will be extended to include unmarried partners, where there is a substantial relationship. There will be a time limit to claim of five years, with exceptions for late-onset conditions. Claims will be assessed using the &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; standard of proof, in line with civil law and common practice elsewhere. There will be an independent appeals tribunal system, compliant with European Convention on Human Rights, available for claimants who consider that their claim has not been handled fairly by the MoD.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/9">The Ministry of Defence will also be extending the provisions introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-20">20 March 2003</phrase> which provided benefits to unmarried partners for attributable deaths related to conflict. The current AFPS will provide attributable benefits to unmarried partners where there is a substantial relationship for all attributable deaths with an effective date of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-15">15 September 2003</phrase>. The current AFPS does not provide unmarried partner benefits for non-attributable deaths, but this benefit will be available under the new AFPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/10">We are making available more detailed information from the consultation process and further detailed explanation of the schemes at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/pensions">www.mod.uk/issues/pensions</a>. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House. lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.170.6/1">An increasing number of schools and local authorities have, with the support of school travel advisers, introduced measures to tackle rising car use on the school run, including providing safe routes to school, adjusting the time of the school day and promoting greater use of buses. We want to encourage every school and local authority to act on this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.6/2">My right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Education and Skills and for Transport are today publishing jointly an action plan and good practice guide outlining how schools and local authorities can increase the number of children travelling to school on foot, by bicycle or on public transport. I am placing a copy of the action plan and best practice guide in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.2/1">Changes in the way healthcare is delivered by the National Health Service now means that this measure of NHS efficiency is no longer reliable. For example, this efficiency measure fails to count an increasingly large amount of activity&mdash;such as procedures undertaken in primary care&mdash;or nurse-led outpatient admissions; records improvements that result in reducing the number of steps in a patient journey as a fall in efficiency; may perversely record real efficiency improvements as reductions in efficiency&mdash;for example when activity is shifted from inpatient to outpatient settings; and fails to pick up any improvements in quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.2/2">The Department of Health is therefore developing a new efficiency measure that will take account of the quality, casemix and diverse way in which NHS outputs are delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.5/1">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) safety requirements for seat spacing are designed to ensure that passengers can evacuate quickly and safely in the event of an emergency.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/2">Recent research carried out by the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) has confirmed that the population body size is increasing and that the introduction of pan-European seat-spacing regulations may be appropriate. The JAA Cabin Safety Steering Group is considering the research data and is being encouraged by the CAA to reach an early decision on the introduction of a common European standard for seat spacing.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/3">The CAA is not aware of any studies relating to the effect that ageing of the general population may have on an emergency evacuation. When new aircraft types are approved, the aircraft manufacturer is required to demonstrate that an emergency evacuation can be performed successfully.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/4">As from <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-28">28 September 2003</phrase>, the European Safety Agency (EASA) will assume responsibility for setting design standards for all aircraft registered within the European Union. These design standards will include emergency evacuation. With effect from this date the CAA will have no power to implement seat-spacing standards which differ from those set by the agency. The output of the JAA Cabin Safety Steering Group will be transmitted to the agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the acting Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Mr Stephen Hickey, to Lord Jopling, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-16">16 September 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/3">I have been asked by the Lord Davies of Oldham to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the number of weeks over the last five years that the M1 motorway has been coned off between junctions 23A and 25.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/4">The information requested over five years will take some time to collect but this work has been put in hand. I will write to you again as soon as this is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/5">There has recently been a considerable programme of works on this section of M1 between junctions 23A and 25. The pressures on this length of motorway are considerable; over 100,000 vehicles per day use it. As a result, roadworks are phased to limit the length of motorway restricted at any one time. Normal policy is that roadworks should not exceed a maximum length of 4 km and be a minimum distance between separate works of 10 km.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/6">The Highways Agency already uses consultant engineers for designing and managing maintenance works. The contracts include a requirement to minimise roadworks on a particular length of road. By careful planning the agency aims to ensure the maximum amount of work is undertaken during any one contract and the disruption is kept to a minimum. On this section of M1 most work is carried out overnight with three lanes remaining open during the daytime and, wherever possible, all work is suspended at peak holiday times. All contractors employed by the agency are required to complete roadworks as quickly as possible and are offered incentives in their contracts to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/7">As explained, I will write to you again as soon as we have collected the information you have requested.</p>
