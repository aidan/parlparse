	<p pid="a.52.6/1">The Government are meeting their promise to cancel 100 per cent of the debts of countries as they go through the heavily indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC). Once countries reach their decision point under the HIPC initiative they can immediately stop making payments on all their debts outstanding to the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.6/2">So far nine countries have reached their decision point, of which eight owed money to the UK. For these countries all payments to the UK Government have already ceased. In total the debt relief to these countries afforded by the HIPC initiative and the Government's 100 per cent debt relief policy will total &pound;241 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.6/3">At Okinawa the G7 expressed their hope that a further 100 countries would reach decision point by the end of 2000. If they did, the total amount that the UK Government would be writing off for these 20 countries would be &pound;659 million. The key aim is to release resources for poverty reduction. The 100 per cent policy and the HIPC process are designed so that the links between debt reduction and how these resources can be used as part of a comprehensive, country owned poverty reduction strategy is clearly established.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">There are already specific categories in the Immigration Rules designed specially for entrepreneurs. These ensure that those who wish to make significant personal investments in creating employment can enter to engage in business. There are also clear routes for corporations wishing to establish branches and subsidiaries here. But the Government's competitiveness White Paper signalled the economic importance of a dynamic approach to building a knowledge-driven economy and the need to attract people with scarce skills and those willing to set up businesses which create jobs. That paper included a specific commitment to examine the scope for further encouraging certain entrepreneurs to consider migrating to the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">In the light of that commitment we have assessed the current Immigration Rules for business and entrepreneurs and have concluded they may not always fit well with a knowledge-driven economy since they require minimum levels of investment and do not focus on innovation. Moreover, the current routes for entrepreneurs do not enable us to focus on those applications with the greatest potential of economic benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">We have therefore decided to introduce a scheme (which will be piloted as a concessionary arrangement outside the Immigration Rules in the first instance) aimed at attracting entrepreneurial innovators to the United Kingdom. This pilot scheme will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-04">4 September</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/4">The key features of the innovators entry route are these: it is intended to attract and select outstanding entrepreneurs whose business proposals will result in exceptional economic benefits for the United Kingdom. Selection will take place on a rigorous and demanding basis but one that is designed to be flexible to accommodate a wide variety of applications with different strengths and weaknesses. No minimum investment is required. There is no requirement for personal funds to be invested but third party funding will be permitted. Applicants will need to submit a business plan and a curriculum vitae with supporting documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/5">My honourable friend the Minister of State for the Home Office (Mrs Roche) is today placing copies of the draft guidance for applicants who wish to apply under this pilot scheme in the Library. Information about the scheme will also be placed on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate website.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/2">The Forensic Science Service (FSS) met and exceeded its financial target to achieve a 3 per cent return on capital employed and maintained accreditation through external bodies. However, it did fail to achieve the stretching efficiency gain target and service delivery targets. This was a challenging year for the FSS--further expanding its workforce, absorbing the associated recruitment and training costs and devoting large human resources to the DNA expansion project. It was also the organisation's first year as a trading fund. The targets and plans agreed for 1999-2000 were ambitious, and while the FSS failed to achieve targets in two key areas it demonstrated a significant improvement in both turnaround times and delivery dates met.</p>

The study was conducted between January and April 1998 by officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Home Office, Cabinet Office and Treasury. Its conclusions led to the establishment of the new Joint Entry Clearance Unit (JECU) as part of the Government's wider commitment to providing a &quot;fairer, faster and firmer&quot; entry clearance process. The study report may be of interest to noble Lords in the context of the memorandum of understanding agreed between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office, which was placed in the Libraries on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-07">7 June</phrase>.</p>

We are consulting on a proposal to change the wording of the code of practice on the identification and assessment of special educational needs and the Education (Special Educational Needs) Regulations 1994 to simplify the language used. Under our proposals it would still be appropriate for local education authorities to set out provision in quantified terms in cases where it is necessary, but not so in others.

	<p pid="a.61.5/1">As a result of existing levels of emissions, all countries will need to adapt to the effects of climate change. The UK is playing an active part in discussions about adaptation under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. At present, the priority for most countries is to assess their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and to begin preparing for adaptation. Funding is available for these purposes through the Global Environment Facility. Further funds for adaptation will become available from the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol. The Government are also encouraging developing countries to take into account climate change impacts when considering their future development needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">The Government believe that developed countries should take the lead in taking action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Programmes are likely to provide for more sustainable use of energy resources, research and investment into low carbon technologies, development of renewable sources of energy and the introduction of fiscal incentives that encourage people and organisations to be more energy efficient. Policies like these will have a significant role to play in any long-term response to climate change and were included in the UK's draft climate change programme which was published in March 2000. The final programme will be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.6/1">New sound systems have been, or will be, installed in several Lords' committee rooms as part of the 10-year rolling programme of works. Microphones were installed in the Moses Room in 1993, and other improvements, such as quietening the ventilation system and installing additional loudspeakers, were made last year. Voice-activated microphones will be installed in Committee Room 4 in the coming Summer Recess as part of a refurbishment process that will also include the installation of air-conditioning. Committee Rooms 1, 2 and 3 will be similarly upgraded in the 2001 Summer Recess. There are no plans to upgrade Committee Rooms 3A, 4B and G, although microphones can be set up in Rooms 3A and 4B at the request of a committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.5/1">We have been engaged in a comprehensive review of the enforcement of civil court judgments since 1998 and the first phase ended in June 2000. In that phase we have examined the present methods available for enforcement of county court and High Court judgments; assessed their effectiveness; and identified what changes would be necessary to enhance the effectiveness of the current methods of enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/2">Copies of the paper on this work have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It outlines the conclusions reached to date. Many of the proposals have already been exposed in consultation. This paper provides information on the current state of play of the enforcement review. The proposals remain subject to refinement, particularly as we examine in more detail the issues arising from the second phase of the review. Its terms of reference are to implement costed recommendations (including the production of a unified set of rules of court for enforcement); and to identify in the light of the amended procedures and revised powers of bailiffs the type of agent(s) or form of agency which should be responsible for carrying out those enforcement procedures; and to make costed recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/3">I am also pleased to announce that Professor Beatson has now submitted to me his Independent Review of Bailiff Law: Report, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. This report will inform the work of the second phase of the review.</p>
