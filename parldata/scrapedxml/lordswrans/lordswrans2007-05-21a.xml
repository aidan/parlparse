The project is to establish proof of concept for birds and mammals and three main species are being used to test the technique: wild boar, grey squirrel and ring-necked parakeet. This project is costing &pound;993,000. Additionally, the Forestry Commission is providing &pound;40,000 for work on grey squirrel. To date, immunocontraceptive vaccines have been tested only on wild boar and only by injection. This project is due to end on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>. It had been intended to test vaccines on grey squirrels but the development of oral baiting systems has not progressed sufficiently and therefore preliminary trials on another type of fertility control agent have been initiated. The work on this project is still at a relatively early stage and further research is likely to be required to fully evaluate fertility control as a viable management technique.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.2/1">Implementation of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan continues and red squirrels are also benefiting from 20 local biodiversity action plans. Work is under way to conserve red squirrels through identification of priority woodlands and implementation of best management practice, improving grey squirrel control, and conducting research into how red squirrels can be protected from squirrel pox virus. Despite these efforts, the red squirrel continues to decline across the UK because the threats cannot be easily reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">A conservation strategy, known as Red Alert North England, has been developed by a broad partnership of organisations with the aim of ensuring the long-term survival of red squirrel. Based on research evidence, this partnership has identified16 red squirrel reserves where they believe the red squirrel has the best chance of long-term survival. These have management plans to help guide landowners and managers in conserving the red squirrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">There are no specific obligations regarding expenditure, but financial resources for conservation measures are provided through a number of means. Of the many projects under way, the most notable is the Save our Squirrels project which is the largest single-species conservation project in the UK. It has a budget of over &pound;1.2 million over three years and receives support from a range of bodies including Natural England, Forestry Commission, three National Parks, and the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.5/17">Supply chain spend is driven by a number of contractual obligations including a requirementto compete work in line with European Union procurement rules including advertising in the <I>Official Journal of the European Union</I> (OJEU). This has led to a significant increase in the level of work awarded competitively. In addition, each SLC is required to prepare and publish annual site procurement plans which inform potential bidders of opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/18">The NDA has appointed a head of supply chain development to support the development of supply chains so that it can meet NDA current and long-term needs, and the NDA has launched a number of initiatives, supported by benchmarking, to help judge the effectiveness of current policies and procedures. In addition, it continues to fund and participate in a wide range of events to promote supply chain development at SLC, regional, national and international levels. These, along with private bilateral market discussions, provide NDA with critical market feedback.</p>

The approach taken by the FSA does not rely on an assessment of the wealth of the investor but on an assessment of the investor's ability to understandthe risks involved. Retail marketing of hedge fund investments is prohibited. The FSA is satisfied that these rules continue to provide an appropriate level of protection.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.2/18">Further data are not available for non-household waste, which includes commercial, industrial, construction and demolition wastes. Defra does not publish figures of non-household waste recycling rates by local authority or region. The figures are heavily dependent on factors such as the type of wastes collected, and the amount of rubble an area has to deal with. Furthermore, as these wastes are not, for the most part, the responsibility of local authorities, data which would answer this question directly are not collected by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/19">No estimates have been made on the percentage of non-household waste likely to be recycled in 2006-07 and 2007-08. For household waste, the Government have set statutory performance standards for recycling and composting in 2007-08 for all local authorities (including those in London), equal to the level of their targets in 2005-06 with the exception that the &quot;floor level&quot; of recycling performance is increased from 18 to 20 per cent for 2007-08.
