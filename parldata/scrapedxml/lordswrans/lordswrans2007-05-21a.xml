	<p pid="a.68.3/3">My department is funding a three-year project to examine the effectiveness and potential side effectsof fertility control as a means of managing over-abundant wildlife populations. The project is to establish proof of concept for birds and mammals and three main species are being used to test the technique: wild boar, grey squirrel and ring-necked parakeet. This project is costing &pound;993,000. Additionally, the Forestry Commission is providing &pound;40,000 for work on grey squirrel. To date, immunocontraceptive vaccines have been tested only on wild boar and only by injection. This project is due to end on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>. It had been intended to test vaccines on grey squirrels but the development of oral baiting systems has not progressed sufficiently and therefore preliminary trials on another type of fertility control agent have been initiated. The work on this project is still at a relatively early stage and further research is likely to be required to fully evaluate fertility control as a viable management technique.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.2/1">Implementation of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan continues and red squirrels are also benefiting from 20 local biodiversity action plans. Work is under way to conserve red squirrels through identification of priority woodlands and implementation of best management practice, improving grey squirrel control, and conducting research into how red squirrels can be protected from squirrel pox virus. Despite these efforts, the red squirrel continues to decline across the UK because the threats cannot be easily reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">A conservation strategy, known as Red Alert North England, has been developed by a broad partnership of organisations with the aim of ensuring the long-term survival of red squirrel. Based on research evidence, this partnership has identified16 red squirrel reserves where they believe the red squirrel has the best chance of long-term survival. These have management plans to help guide landowners and managers in conserving the red squirrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">There are no specific obligations regarding expenditure, but financial resources for conservation measures are provided through a number of means. Of the many projects under way, the most notable is the Save our Squirrels project which is the largest single-species conservation project in the UK. It has a budget of over &pound;1.2 million over three years and receives support from a range of bodies including Natural England, Forestry Commission, three National Parks, and the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.5/1">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is determined to promote and encourage supply chain development (consistent with public procurement rules) and in executing its nuclear decommissioning and clean-up programmes relies on a series of complex and interrelated supply chains. In the financial year 2006-07, more than &pound;1.2 billion of the NDA's total programme budget was spent by site licence companies (SLC) in the supply chain. Details are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.71.5/17">Supply chain spend is driven by a number of contractual obligations including a requirementto compete work in line with European Union procurement rules including advertising in the <I>Official Journal of the European Union</I> (OJEU). This has led to a significant increase in the level of work awarded competitively. In addition, each SLC is required to prepare and publish annual site procurement plans which inform potential bidders of opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/18">The NDA has appointed a head of supply chain development to support the development of supply chains so that it can meet NDA current and long-term needs, and the NDA has launched a number of initiatives, supported by benchmarking, to help judge the effectiveness of current policies and procedures. In addition, it continues to fund and participate in a wide range of events to promote supply chain development at SLC, regional, national and international levels. These, along with private bilateral market discussions, provide NDA with critical market feedback.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/2" qnum="HL3817">What assessment they have made of the extent to which a liberalised energy market is more likely to deliver the structural changes needed to achieve a low-carbon and renewable energy based economy than an energy market that incorporates fixed remuneration for renewable energy feed-in.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-05-21a.72.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100788" speakername="Lord Truscott" colon=":" colnum="72"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70521w0001.htm#0705226000089">
	<p pid="a.72.2/1">The objective being pursued through energy market liberalisation is to spur productivity, drive down prices to consumers and to give consumers more choice in terms of price and quality. International comparisons show that the UK has done well against these criteria (see for example the Ernst &amp; Young study, &quot;The Case for Liberalisation&quot; <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/markets/liberalisation/page28403.html">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/markets/liberalisation/page28403.html</a>.)</p>
	<p pid="a.72.2/2">The achievement of low-carbon and renewable energy generation needs to be seen in the wider context of energy policy. The renewables obligation (RO) is one policy approach towards meeting the objective of low-carbon energy generation; feed-in tariffs are another. The RO follows market principles and so fits well with our liberalised energy market. Under the RO, generation of renewable electricity has undergone a step change with renewable electricity generation more than doubling since its introduction in 2002.</p>

That study found that 19 of the 27 European countries studied had feed-in tariff schemes, five had some form of green certificate system (including the UK), two used tendering, and two used tax incentives as their primary mechanism. Many of the countries use combinations of mechanisms or supplement their primary mechanisms with tax incentives and other direct or indirect subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/2">The Commission's report also notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/3" class="indent">&quot;In assessing effectiveness, the effects of more recent systems are difficult to judge. In particular, the experience with green certificates is more limited than with feed in tariffs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/4">The UK Government support this caveat as atsuch an early stage in its introduction it is difficult to assess certificate mechanisms such as the renewables obligation (RO) against more established systems. The RO has, however, been successful in stimulating investment in renewable energy projects and we are looking at ways of strengthening and modifying it to further increase deployment. Any proposed changes to the RO will be announced in the forthcoming energy White Paper.</p>

Under the terms of the directive, many of the rules governing the marketing and promotion of UCITS funds are not harmonised and remain the responsibility of national Governments and regulators. In the UK, the Financial Services Authority enforces a rigorous regulatory regime governing financial promotions and disclosure to ensure that consumers receive clear and appropriate information on charges, risks and expected performance of all financial products. More stringent rules apply to products like UCITS III funds which carry the potential for higher volatility.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.5/1">The figure for the number of raves which have taken place in England and Wales during 2006 and 2007 is not collected or held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/2">Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allows police in certain situations to direct rave-goers to leave an event. If they refuse, police are provided with a power of arrest. They also have powers to seize sound equipment in certain circumstances. The Public Order Act 1986 also provides police with powers of arrest to deal with individuals who are behaving in a disorderly way and causing harassment to others.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/3">Following reports of problems with raves in buildings, the Government used the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 to amend the legislation to deal with raves. The police now have powers to direct participants at indoor raves to leave buildings where trespass is involved. Events where 20 or more people are present are covered. The Government have also made it a criminal offence, with a power of arrest, for a person on whom a direction under Section 63 has been served to attend any other outdoor or indoor trespassory rave within 24 hours of the direction being given. These new powers came into force in January 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.9/1">No such estimate has been made.

The Greater London Authority keeps a record of numbers and locations of civic amenity sites in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.9/2">Local authorities are collectively working towards reducing landfilling through waste minimisation, recycling and composting (via kerbside collection schemes and facilities at civic amenity sites), aswell as other waste treatment methods.

	<p pid="a.86.2/18">Further data are not available for non-household waste, which includes commercial, industrial, construction and demolition wastes. Defra does not publish figures of non-household waste recycling rates by local authority or region. The figures are heavily dependent on factors such as the type of wastes collected, and the amount of rubble an area has to deal with. Furthermore, as these wastes are not, for the most part, the responsibility of local authorities, data which would answer this question directly are not collected by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/19">No estimates have been made on the percentage of non-household waste likely to be recycled in 2006-07 and 2007-08. For household waste, the Government have set statutory performance standards for recycling and composting in 2007-08 for all local authorities (including those in London), equal to the level of their targets in 2005-06 with the exception that the &quot;floor level&quot; of recycling performance is increased from 18 to 20 per cent for 2007-08. This will help to narrow the gap between the best and the worst authorities and ensure a more even level of service across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.5/46">As the table shows, many of the London authorities have achieved recycling and composting rates which exceed or are equal to their 2007-08 targets. The Government and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) are targeting engagement and support in order to improve the recycling rates of the poorest performing local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">The EU called for the vote against the nomination of Francis Nhema as chairman of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development and the UK, with 20 other EU and like-minded states, voted against his candidacy. On behalf of all EU member states, the EU presidency made a statement following the vote which expressed deep concern that a representative from Zimbabwe should become chair as this will have a negative impact on the commission's work and on the commission's credibility. Both I and my honourable friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, Ian Pearson, on behalf of the Government, have since publicly condemned the decision to appoint a Zimbabwean Minister to this position. Zimbabwe's catastrophic economic decline is in large part due to disastrous agricultural and energy policies, environmental degradation and unsustainable rural development. The impact on the human rights of those, particularly ordinary Zimbabwean farm workers, who have either been dispossessed or directly targeted as a consequence of Mugabe's policies towards agriculture is well known.</p>
