	<p pid="a.202.5/1">The Government are firmly committed to maintaining effective immigration controls and ensuring that genuine passengers are able to pass through our ports with the least possible delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.5/2">For some years the number of Jamaican passengers being refused entry on arrival in the United Kingdom has been increasing&mdash;nearly 3,500, or 6 per cent, of arrivals last year. The number of Jamaicans who abscond having been given temporary admission is also unacceptably high&mdash;more than 150 a month during the first half of this year. These problems create enormous pressures for the Immigration Service but also lead to unacceptable delays and inconvenience for the great majority of genuine travellers from Jamaica. The situation can best be demonstrated by looking at the period leading up to Christmas. During the six weeks to <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December 2002</phrase>, 1,233 Jamaican nationals were refused entry at the UK's 12 busiest ports. This represented nearly 20 per cent of all refusals at those ports during that period. The only effective way of easing these problems is to ensure that Jamaican passengers have demonstrated that they qualify to enter the United Kingdom before they embark for this country. In the circumstances we have decided to impose a visa regime on all Jamaican nationals wishing to visit the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.5/3">We would want to provide reassurance that the presence of a visa regime should not be a bar to those Jamaican nationals who genuinely wish to visit the United Kingdom. The rules under which decisions are made are the same whether that decision is made on arrival or before. This visa regime simply allows officials to consider the application before the passenger embarks for the United Kingdom. Providing greater certainty that a person has satisfied the Immigration Rules will also smooth the passage of genuine visitors through the immigration controls, giving advantage to all concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.2/1">A business process review of the six principal service personnel museums is to be carried out by the Ministry of Defence. These organisations have non-departmental public bodies designation and receive grants in aid from the MoD. They are the Royal Naval Museum, the Royal Navy Submarine Museum, the Fleet Air Arm Museum, the Royal Marines Museum, the National Army Museum and the Royal Air Force Museum. The previous review, termed a quinquennial review, was completed in March 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/2">Preliminary work has defined the scope of the study. The second phase will begin shortly and is expected to be completed within six months. The aim of the review is to examine the function, role, operation, funding and organisation of the museums, to seek to identify key objectives and performance and to determine whether their current status is most appropriate to future needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.2/3">The review team will consult with a range of stakeholders during the course of the review, including the museum directors, staff and trustees, MoD and single service sponsors, TUs, local government, other government departments and other museums. The Ministry of Defence is interested also to hear the views of other organisations or individuals who would like to make a contribution to the review.

	<p pid="a.205.2/1">We are pleased to inform the House that the contract for the Meteor air-to-air missile for the RAF's Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft was placed with MBDA on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-23">23 December 2002</phrase>. This followed the signature of the Meteor MOU by Germany, the last of the six partner nations (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the UK) to sign, which permitted the UK, as lead nation, to sign the contract with MBDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">Meteor is a key element of the Government's commitment to provide the best possible equipment for the Armed Forces. It will ensure Typhoon has the capability to combat predicted air-to-air threats thereby meeting our requirement to maintain air superiority well into the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/3">This is extremely good news for British and European industry, sustaining high quality jobs in new technology and in system and software design. Furthermore, it puts MBDA at the forefront of a strengthened European missile defence industry and enhances export prospects for Typhoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/4">When my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary (Mr Hoon) announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-16">16 May 2000</phrase>, (Official Report, cols 149&ndash;51) in another place, the decision to select Meteor as the beyond visual range air-to-air missile to arm Typhoon, we agreed to publish the details of the breakpoints and determination of when these assessments will be made once the memorandum of understanding was established. Now that this has been achieved, we can confirm that the contract includes four breakpoints as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/5" class="indent">Demonstration of Ramjet propulsion system (Boost to sustain motor transition and sustain motor operation)&mdash;at month 40 of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/6" class="indent">Demonstration of guidance and control of the asymmetric airframe&mdash;at month 45 of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/7" class="indent">Demonstration of the effectiveness of aircraft to missile transfer alignment process via data links&mdash;at month 45 of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/8" class="indent">Demonstration of electronic protection measures&mdash;at month 51 of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/9">The process for the independent assessment of the achievement of the milestones, and for securing partner nation agreement that they have been either achieved or failed, is set out in the MOU, copies of which will shortly be placed in the Library of the House. If MBDA fails to achieve any of the milestones, partner nations will be able to terminate the contract and recover all moneys paid. maria</p>

Parents are given advice after the birth of the baby mainly through health visitors, who visit in the first six weeks after the birth of the child to provide guidance and support on the physical as well as the emotional needs of young children. The Birth to Five book is available free to all first-time mothers&mdash;usually handed out by the health visitor on the first visit after the mother has returned home with her baby rather than at the antenatal clinic. This is a complete guide to parenthood and covers the first five years of the child's life and includes caring for its emotional needs. peter</p>

	<p pid="a.206.26/1">We are announcing capital allocations for the National Health Service for the next three years today. This is consistent with the revenue budget allocations which were issued late last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.26/2">Capital allocations are made to the NHS in two parts. Operational capital is for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing existing capital stock and is made direct to NHS trusts and primary care trusts. Strategic capital, which is allocated direct to all strategic health authorities (StHAs), is for distribution at their own discretion for larger scale investments.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.26/3">Total operational capital is increasing by 10 per cent in each of the three years 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06. The growth in strategic capital in the StHAs is 13 per cent, 11 per cent, 14 per cent for each of the three years. The residue of the capital is being held centrally&mdash;the largest being for information technology where &pound;400 million is being held for 2003&ndash;04, &pound;700 million for 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;1.2 billion for 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.26/4">This is the first time that day-to-day operational capital has been allocated directly to NHS StHAs, trusts and primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.26/5">This is the first time that capital allocations have been made for three years rather than one year, allowing the local NHS to plan with confidence and certainty for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.26/6">In addition, allocations have been informed by a new funding formula for both operational and strategic capital to give a nationally consistent and fairer basis for the distribution of funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.26/7">Of the money allocated to StHAs, &pound;100 million is for the establishment of a local access incentive fund. The purpose is to reward NHS trusts and primary care trusts which make rapid progress in improving access to NHS treatment. Clearly this could include any of the NHS plan targets for access, both in hospital and primary care. Initially, however, we expect the main focus to be on:</p>

	<p pid="a.206.29/1">The present price of an annual licence to kill game is &pound;6. A period licence to kill game and a gamekeeper's licence each cost &pound;4. A 14-day licence to kill game costs &pound;2. A game dealer's licence costs &pound;4. Those licences may be obtained through any post office. The price of a game licence was last changed in 1968 by a Treasury order which increased the fees set in the Game Licences Act 1860 by 100 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.29/3">In addition to the licences referred to above, district councils and London borough councils issue licences to deal in game. No figures are collected centrally for the numbers of licences issued by councils. We understand that arrangements and charges vary.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.29/4">Central government do not benefit from the revenue from game licences. The income is received by district councils and London borough councils, in which the duty to issue licences is vested. We acknowledge that the game licensing system is complex and derives from 19th century legislation. The Government are aware of concerns over the operation of the game licensing regime.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.35/1">The usual routes for disposal of fallen stock are by rendering, incineration or taking to an approved knacker or hunt kennel. These will continue to be permitted when the new EU legislation, the Animal By-Products Regulation, applies in member states from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-30">30 April 2003</phrase>. The regulation will ban the on-farm burial or burning of animal carcasses. The only exceptions from the ban would be for remote areas (parts of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland) and during outbreaks of notifiable disease if there were a lack of capacity at rendering plants and incinerators or if transport of the carcasses would spread disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.35/2">Under the TSE (England) Regulations 2002 there is a legal obligation to notify the competent authority or their agents of the discovery of all fallen bovines aged over 24 months other than those killed for welfare reasons. The agents in this case are Animal Handling Facilities Ltd (AHF). Once they have been notified of the fallen animal they will arrange for the animal to be collected, sampled and the carcass destroyed free of charge.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.41/1">Table 4.1 of 2002 Spending Review&mdash;Departmental Investment Strategies: A Summary (Cm 5674) records the total value of fixed assets owned by each government department as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>. These figures reflect those given in each department's published resource accounts for 2000&ndash;01. A figure of &pound;62,996 million is given for the former Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). This included some &pound;23 million of intangible assets, &pound;61,084 million of tangible assets and &pound;1,890 million of investments.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.41/2">The tangible assets included &pound;59,773 million as the net book value of the trunk road network. In general terms, roads that are &quot;open for traffic&quot; are valued on the basis of their estimated depreciated replacement cost. Roads (or parts of roads such as additional lanes) that are still under construction are valued on the basis of the capital expenditure incurred to date on their construction. The last full revaluation of the trunk road network was carried out by professional surveyors, as at <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-31">31 March 2000</phrase>. This valuation was carried out mainly using internal unit costing and physical asset records provided by the Highways Agency. Certain large structures, for example the QEII Bridge, and roadside communications were valued at historic cost, appropriately indexed. For other large structures, insurance valuations were used as the best approximation to the replacement cost. The valuations were indexed to <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> to reflect changes in the Road Construction Tender Price Index.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.41/3">Since privatisation, the main railways assets&mdash;the infrastructure and rolling stock&mdash; have been held in the private sector and therefore did not appear in the figures for tangible assets held by DETR. However, the figure for total investments included a National Loans Fund loan to the British Railways Board of some &pound;481 million. Various minor shareholdings in the form of special shares in rail-related companies are not valued but are noted in view of the insignificant amounts involved. These holdings are listed in Note 12 of the DETR Resource Accounts 2000&ndash;01</p>
