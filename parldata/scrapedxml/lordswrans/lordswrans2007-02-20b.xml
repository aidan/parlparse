	<p pid="b.211.2/1">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, Ministers and officials regularly discuss African issues with the Chinese Government. We seek to increase co-operation with China within multilateral fora and initiatives relevant to Africa in areas such as transparency, aid and debt principles and arms transfers. All Africa's partners, including China, need to work in ways that reinforce Africa's own agenda of poverty reduction and sustainable development. The Department for International Development has already established regular high-level talks with China on international development issues, focusing on Africa, and China and the EU agreed at their September 2006 summit to establish a structured dialogue on Africa. The German presidency hopes to begin this dialogue soon and we look forward to contributing actively. We welcome the commitment in China's first White Paper on Africa, published in January last year, to &quot;step up co-operation with other countries and international organisations&quot; in support of the millennium development goals in Africa.</p>

However, the rules in the EU Animal By-Products Regulation 1774/2002/EC which ban on-farm burial of fallen stock were made on a precautionary basis influenced by the evidence provided in a number of scientific opinions from the EU's scientific steering committee (SSC). The evidence relating to those opinions was last considered at an SSC meeting on 16 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-17">17 January 2003</phrase>.

These are areas where the livestock population is so small, and where disposal facilities are so far away, that the arrangements for collection and transport would be unacceptably onerous compared to local disposal. The only areas fitting these criteria in the UK are parts of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, the Scilly Isles and Lundy Island in England, and Bardsey Island and Caldy Island in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.20/1">As indicated in the Prime Minister's letter, the primary reason for the ban on the trade on the importation of wild birds is concern about the potential it has to spread avian flu and other diseases. The trade can, if managed unsustainably, also damage wild populations. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, to which the UK and EU member states are parties, has arrangements that aim to regulate trade in some endangered wild birds so as not to be detrimental to their survival in the wild. Before agreeing to any ban on conservation grounds we would need to first consider the effectiveness of those controls. We could not press for a ban on welfare grounds, as this would not comply with World Trade Organisation agreements.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.35/1">The principle of better regulation is to legislate only where necessary. It is not clear that contaminants are present in the cabin environment in a quantity harmful to crew and passengers. That is why we asked the independent Committee on Toxicity (COT) to undertake a comprehensive review of all the evidence, and we will, of course, be guided by the COT's conclusions and recommendations.</p>

The House of Commons Transport Committee reported in 2006 saying &quot;the basic principle of the existing model, in which the CAA recovers its costs from those it regulates, is fair, and we are reassured to note that other European states are moving towards this model&quot;. The committee did, however, recommend reviewing the level of the CAA's required rate of return on capital employed. The Government will respond to the committee's report shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.41/1">The UK has had a civil aviation mandatory occurrence reporting scheme for over 30 years. It is established under the Air Navigation Order and administered by the Civil Aviation Authority. Information and guidance on the mandatory occurrence reporting scheme is contained in Civil Aviation Publication 382. Both the order and CAP 382 have been amended to implement the directive. However, the requirements of Directive 2003/42 are virtually identical to the existing requirements of the UK occurrence reporting scheme. Implementation of the directive had a negligible effect on the UK scheme and so did not raise any compliance issues for pilots.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.41/2">Airlines are required to included guidance and instructions to pilots on occurrence reporting in their operations manuals. However, airlines are not required to provide pilots with specific training on occurrence reporting.</p>

Figures for the previous five years are given in the chart below. This sustained increase in funding demonstrates a strong record of investment in BBCWS. This has helped BBCWS meet the challenges posed by new technology, in particular allowing for the development of new media services and, from later in 2007, the launch of vernacular TV. Grant-in-aid funding for BBCWS forms part of the overall settlement allocated to the FCO by HM Treasury. Future funding will be reviewed this year in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.71/1">The PRECIS model is now used in numerous government and academic institutions around the world. The period 2004-05 saw a focus on collaboration among countries in neighbouring regions of the world. Such collaborations now exist in South America and south Asia and scientists are working towards a similar collaboration in central Asia.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.71/2">Since 2003, PRECIS workshops have been held in the UK, Cuba, Bhutan, Brazil, India, Turkey, Argentina, Belize, Ghana and Malaysia. Over 220 researchers from over 50 countries have been trained through PRECIS workshops.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.71/3">There is ongoing support for this process. Defra funds the development of the Hadley Centre's regional climate model and the Department for International Development funds the personal computer version of the Hadley Centre's regional climate model. Additionally, the United Nations development programme funds support for training materials relevant to PRECIS, for experts in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.77/2">The data on emissions from fuel combustion include forestry operations and food production. Emissions from energy use by the food and drink industry (for example, emissions from the processing of raw ingredients into packaged, canned or frozen products), and emissions from the manufacture of fertilizer, are included in the inventory with industrial emissions, but these are not separately identified.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.80/1">Natural processes on the land surface&mdash;that is, respiration by plants, soil microbes, animals, and fire&mdash;release approximately 440 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. However, this is more than compensated for by an even larger uptake of carbon by photosynthesis, which is enhanced at elevated carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. When this is taken into account, these processes give rise to a net sink of approximately 9.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year. This acts to slow the rate of rise of atmospheric CO2 caused by emissions from fossil fuel combustion and changes in land use by humans, mainly deforestation.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.80/2">If this sink&mdash;and a similar sink in the oceans&mdash;did not exist, the CO2 rise would be approximately twice as fast as currently observed. Identifying uncultivated land, swamps and bogs within this total is very uncertain but these land areas are probably responsible for most of the net sink. Natural wetlands are also a source of methane emissions amounting to some 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.110/1">The UK has supported a number of interventions to tackle AIDS in Angola over the past three years, through the bilateral programme managed by the Department for International Development. This has included support for the establishment of voluntary counselling and testing centres, raising awareness through radio programmes, social marketing of condoms, study tours and institutional strengthening of the National AIDS Commission Secretariat.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.110/2">The UK's bilateral contribution to programmes directly focused on AIDS in Angola has steadily grown, from &pound;200,000 in the financial year 2003-04, to &pound;422,970 in 2004-05, to &pound;1,363,232 in 2005-06. In 2006-07, we expect to have given a further &pound;1.1 million out of an overall bilateral programme of &pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.110/3">We have also contributed &pound;18 million from bilateral funds for a UNICEF Southern Africa programme to protect orphans and vulnerable children from AIDS. In the first year of the programme (2006-07) US$1.4 million was allocated to Angola.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.110/4">The UK is also a major global contributor to the principle multilateral organisations that are supporting Angola's response to AIDS: the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), the World Bank and the European Commission (EC). GFATM has a US$27.7 million programme on AIDS in Angola, of which US$12.4 million has been allocated since October 2005. The UK is a major supporter of GFATM, with commitments of &pound;100 million in each of 2006 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.110/5">The World Bank is supporting a joint donor-government programme to address AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis programme in Angola, for which it has made available a grant of US$21 million. The UK contributed 13.2 per cent of funds to IDA (International Development Association&mdash;the World Bank's concessional lending Arm, which gives loans and grants to the world's poorest Countries).</p>
	<p pid="b.211.110/6">In Angola, the EC is supporting the health sector as a whole, including &euro;2.9 million for improving the use and management of blood in public health centres. The EC has also approved two new contracts with NGOs to minimise HIV transmission and the impact of AIDS in rural provinces of Angola, worth some &euro;4.85 million. The UK's imputed share of EC funding is 17.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.113/1">The UK no longer has a bilateral programme in Botswana. The Government's policy on middle-income countries prioritises 10 per cent of our bilateral aid to large middle-income countries with a high proportion of poor people; highly indebted middle-income countries; and middle-income countries that are vulnerable to falling back to low-income status. Botswana currently falls into none of these categories and as such no longer benefits from a bilateral aid programme with DfID.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.113/2">Botswana does, however, benefit from UK assistance through both regional and multilateral channels. We have committed &pound;18 million from bilateral funds managed by DfID for a UNICEF southern Africa programme to protect orphans and vulnerable children from AIDS. In the first year of the programme (2006-07) US$1.3 million was allocated to Botswana.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.113/3">We also provide &pound;4 million support to the innovative multi-media Soul City edutainment regional programme in southern Africa. This 2003-07 programme reaches eight countries, including Botswana.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.113/4">From 2002-06, we supported a &pound;7.65 million regional programme implemented by the Southern African Development Community (SADC). This had components in Botswana, where the programme supported social marketing of condoms, strengthening the National AIDS Commission and work to prevent HIV transmission at cross-border sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.113/5">The UK is also a major global contributor to the principle multilateral organisations that are supporting Botswana's response to AIDS: the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria (GFATM), the World Bank and the European Commission (EC). GFATM has a programme of over US $18.5 million on AIDS in Botswana, of which over US $9 million has been allocated since October 2005. The UK is a major supporter of GFATM, with commitments of &pound;100 million in each of 2006 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.113/6">The EC contributes to Botswana's response to AIDS with &euro;50.26 million towards the Education Sector Budget Support Programme (2006-09) which includes a focus on HIV prevention in schools. In addition, the EC supports regional programmes which underpin Botswana's response. These include &euro;3.1 million for ongoing regional support to SADC's AIDS work, and &euro;4.5 million towards the &quot;Circles of Support&quot; regional programme supporting orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS. The UK's imputed share of EC funding is 17.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.128/1">A precise average cost to the taxpayer for Court of Appeal work relating to asylum and immigration could be provided only at a disproportionate cost by scrutinising individual case files. Similarly, an assessment of the variance in cost between effective and abortive cases is unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.128/2">Estimates from the Court of Appeal indicate an average cost per case of &pound;6,000. Taking representation into account, and on the basis of estimates from the Legal Services Commission and Treasury Solicitors, this could rise to approximately &pound;12,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.206/1">The Government published estimates alongside the 2006 Pre-Budget Report, showing that levels of attempted MTIC fraud in the UK grew significantly during 2005-06, to between &pound;3.5 billion and &pound;4.75 billion, with a consequent impact on the in-year VAT receipts of between &pound;2 billion and &pound;3 billion. In response to this increase, HMRC has strengthened its operational strategy, increasing the level of criminal investigations with international partners in Europe and beyond and re-deploying over 700 extra compliance resources in order to check a greater number of suspect VAT repayment claims submitted by those operating in supply chains known to be associated with MTIC fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.206/2">Operational indicators in the current financial year suggest that HMRC's response has led to a dramatic reduction in MTIC activity. The latest monthly balance of payments statistics published by the Office for National Statistics, using trade data supplied by HMRC show that trade in MTIC-related goods has fallen by over 90 per cent since April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.212/1">The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly in December 2006. It opened for signature and subsequent ratification on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.212/2">The convention will be an important tool in preventing enforced disappearance in the future. The UK was active throughout the negotiations to draft the convention, and we supported its adoption last year at both the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.212/3">The Government now need to conduct a detailed analysis of the provisions of the treaty and their implications for implementation in order to determine the UK's position towards ratification, including whether we would need to make any reservations. The UK did not sign the convention at the ceremony in Paris on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February</phrase> because the UK does not sign international treaties unless it has a firm intention to ratify within a reasonable time-frame. We understand that 57 states (including 10 member states of the European Union) have so far signed the convention. The convention requires 20 states to ratify in order to enter into force.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.212/4">At the adoption of the convention at both the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, the UK made an interpretative statement clarifying our understanding of certain provisions, including what constitutes an enforced disappearance, the application of obligations under international humanitarian law and the procedures applicable to the adoption and placement of children found to have resulted from an enforced disappearance. This statement can be found at: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/ukmisgeneva">www.fco.gov.uk/ukmisgeneva</a>.</p>
