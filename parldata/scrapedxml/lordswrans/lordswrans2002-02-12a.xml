There were a number of disturbing and sometimes disgraceful incidents in Africa during the 1960s and 70s. These gave rise to justifiable indignation and a strong wish to curb this unsavoury business.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/3">The situation has changed since the 1970s. Africa's problems are different and so also is the nature of outside intervention. In some cases at least it is companies more than individuals who have been at issue there recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/4">The term &quot;private military companies&quot; covers many different sorts of organisation. Some are respectable and well established names; some are transient and not always reputable companies. Public attention has focused most sharply on companies which have provided soldiers ready to take part in combat. There are many different opinions&mdash;some of them strongly held about such activities, an issue which is explored in the paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/5">These sort of activities attract attention and controversy but they are neither the most numerous, nor necessarily the most important part of the private military sector. A growing number of companies which would not take part directly in combat nevertheless provide important military services such as training, planning, logistics, weapons procurement and intelligence. In today's world such services can be significant force multipliers and may have a considerable impact on fighting capability. It is timely that we should consider this growing industry and look at the question of whether some form of regulation would be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/6">Mercenary activity is an old phenomenon but a corporate sector providing military services is relatively new. Given the professionalism and the high reputation of Britain's armed services it is not surprising that this is an area in which British companies are active. The idea of regulating this sector is also relatively new. It raises many difficult legal and practical issues. There are many different interests and points of view of which we should take account. We therefore wish to embark on a wide process of consultation before formulating a policy. Against this background the paper outlines the issues, the recent history and the current debate, and finally sets out some of the options for regulation&mdash;but does not make any specific proposals. Before doing that we would like to hear the views of those directly concerned and indeed of all interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/7">This is a serious subject which merits careful examination. The private military sector is a growing phenomenon which could develop in a helpful or an unhelpful way. We shall be surprised if we emerge from the debate with the conclusion that the best solution is to do nothing at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">The Government will continue to require all departments to consider the costs of holding assets and the benefits to their objectives. One of the main advantages of resource accounting and budgeting is that it makes these costs and benefits more transparent. Government finance rules acknowledge the special significance of a wide range of heritage assets, many of which are not valued so that departments do not incur a charge for holding them.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/2">In other cases, the cultural significance of assets is among the benefits which need to be taken into account. The Government are introducing new guidance to ensure that this is done effectively through consultation with the Cultural Property Unit of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. That guidance will take account of lessons learned from the offer for sale of the Treasury's silver items formerly associated with the Privy Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/3">As I explained to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase> (Official Report, col. 1173), the Government concluded in the light of representations that open-market sale was not appropriate in that case.

None of the nine United Kingdom plants in question was responsible for the importation into the UK of meat containing SRM, and the question of their rectifying their controls does not therefore arise. Each plant remains free to import meat from other EU member states or from third countries. However, each of the nine plants remains under official supervision (by the Meat Hygiene Service in Great Britain and by the Veterinary Service of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland); and all consignments of imported carcass beef arriving at licensed premises in the UK remain subject to checks by the relevant authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.3/1">The Government are aware of a number of research studies published in the scientific literature which investigate health outcomes in people living near landfill sites. These, including Dr Vrijheid's recently published study, have been considered by the Department of Health, which has sought advice from the independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT). They felt that it was not possible to draw firm conclusions from these studies and that further research was warranted.

Additionally, in respect of non-clinical litigation, figures are available for &quot;liability to third party (LTPS)&quot; and &quot;property expenditure (PES)&quot; claims.

	<p pid="a.143.2/1">Pupils in England are taught about Europe and the European Union at secondary school. Since the start of the school year 2000 they are taught about the history of Britain in its European and wider context within national curriculum history. From 2002 through national curriculum citizenship, pupils will be taught about the world as a global community, the role of the European Union and the UK's relations in Europe, including the European Union, the Commonwealth and the United Nations. The citizenship framework allows teachers and pupils to explore and debate issues that affect the UK's relations with Europe.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-02-12a.144.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="144"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020212/text/20212w03.htm#20212w03_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.144.2/1">The EC Regulation 2037/2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer covers a wide range of measures including controls on production, supply, imports, exports and uses of these substances. The regulation is directly applicable in UK law and therefore obligations fall directly on the industry sectors concerned. My department, together with the Department of Trade and Industry, has widely publicised the control measures and obligations that have been introduced through publications and regular contacts with the industries involved. We will shortly be introducing secondary legislation covering offences and penalties.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/2">With regard to fridges in particular, there are a number options for dealing with waste fridges including reuse, export to other member states for treatment, disposal in the UK via high temperature incineration and storage pending treatment in the UK. Investors are in the process of providing a network of new recycling facilities in the United Kingdom. I understand that the first new facilities are likely to be operational in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/3">Prior to December 2001, my department held a number of stakeholder meetings to facilitate the provision of disposal routes for waste fridges and freezers. Work to produce guidance on standards for the extraction of ODS from fridges was undertaken to enable the necessary investment decisions to be made. Guidance on the storage of fridges was developed and issued and an information leaflet advising householders how to dispose safely of fridges was distributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/4">In order to enable the regulation to be correctly implemented, between February 1999 and mid 2001 UK officials repeatedly asked the Commission for formal clarification of the position of ODS in the insulating foam of refrigeration equipment. The occasions on which this was raised by the UK and other member states, either directly or implicitly during discussion of items for clarification, are as follows:</p>
