	<p pid="a.81.5/1">Although employment has been declining and there have been significant structural and technological changes in agriculture in recent years, the industry's health and safety performance has been and continues to be poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/2">Fatal injury statistics are the most reliable and robust key health and safety performance indicator. Currently whilst it represents approximately 1.4 per cent of the workforce, agriculture accounts for 15-20 per cent of all reported work related fatalities in Great Britain each year. The fatal injury incidence rate is the highest of the main industrial sectors including construction and exceptionally includes a high proportion of older workers and members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/3">Given gross under-reporting, the figures for non-fatal injuries are less reliable and robust and should be treated with caution. Only about 25 per cent of accidents to employees and 5 per cent involving the self-employed are reported under the Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR); making accurate calculation of incidence rates and comparisons with other industries difficult. The best estimate is that published annually by HSE and the Office for National Statistics which suggest that in 2008-09 and 2009-10 (the last year for which data have been published) the rate of reportable injury in agriculture was higher than that for any other industry and higher than the average for all industries. The latest report for 2008-09 is available at: <a href="http://www.hse">http://www.hse</a>. gov.uk/statistics/index.htm.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/4">The main causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries have remained consistent over the period 1999-00-2009-10 and include workplace transport, falls from height, struck by moving or falling objects, asphyxiation/drowning, livestock handling, machinery and trapped by collapsing materials; the relative ranking varying from year-to-year. Detailed analyses of fatal injuries in farming, forestry and horticulture including case summaries are published annually. The reports from 2002 onwards are available on HSE's website at: <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/agriculture/resources/fatal.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/agriculture/resources/fatal.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/5">The industry's occupational health record is also poor and obscured by under-reporting. As with other sectors, the statistical base is weak and provides limited intelligence and the most reliable data is that published annually by HSE and the Office for National Statistics. The statistics for 2007-08 and for 2008-09 (the last year for which data have been published), suggest that the incidence of work related illness in agriculture is of a similar order to that for all industries. Again, the report for 2008-09 is available at: <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/index.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.5/6">Research commissioned from the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) into ill health in the industry, reported in 2005 and available at: <a href="http://www.hse">http://www.hse</a>. gov.uk/research/rrhtm/rr370.htm concluded there was very little information on the prevalence or incidence of occupational ill health in the industry.</p>

There are two categories of severity for members of the public: fatal injuries and non-fatal injuries that cause a person to be taken from the site of the accident to hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.8/1">Implementation of the online copyright infringement measures in the Digital Economy Act remains, in our view, the most proportionate and practical way to tackle widespread infringement of copyright online. The judgment from the recent judicial review, which agreed that the Government's approach was a more efficient, focused and fair system than the current arrangements, will require changes to our original proposal on how costs are shared and we are currently considering the changes which will need to be made to the cost-sharing statutory instrument in light of this. Once we are clear on what changes need to be made both the statutory instrument and the draft code will need to be notified to the European Commission under the Technical Standards Directive. Separately, the Government commissioned a report by Ofcom into the workability of Sections 17 and 18 of the Act. That report is due to be delivered shortly. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport will set out what action we plan to take as soon as we have had an opportunity to consider the report and all other relevant factors.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.6/1">As part of the Government's measures to address climate change, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) ensures a growing proportion of UK road transport fuels is from sustainable renewable sources. The RTFO includes a certificate trading mechanism to increase the efficiency of compliance. The value of individual certificates is determined by the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.6/2">The value of renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) was close to zero during the first year of the RTFO. There is evidence that the value of certificates was affected by a discrepancy in the Renewable Transport Fuel Order which caused a reduction in demand and price of RTFCs. The 2009 amendment to the order corrected this discrepancy. Since 2009 RTFCs have traded at a price.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.6/3">Throughout year two certificates traded at between 6 and 12 pence per certificate. Data available for the third obligation period indicates that certificates have traded at between 15 and 24 pence per certificate to date. Certificates trading for year three may continue until September 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.6/4">The Department for Transport therefore considers that awarding two RTFCs per litre of biofuels from waste, residues and lignocellulosic material will provide incentives for investment, whilst allowing obligated businesses the flexibility to choose the most cost effective route to compliance.</p>

The level and flexibility afforded by each of these tools varies from country to country. The UK gas market is well served by all of them.

	<p pid="a.106.5/1">It is estimated that around 100,000 women who were aged 60 or over in Great Britain at the end of 2008-09, the latest year for which data are available, did not qualify for home responsibilities protection that could improve their own basic state pension entitlement for one or more years solely because they had ceased earning above the lower earnings limit for national insurance contributions and their elections to pay national insurance contributions at the married woman's and widow's reduced rate had not yet terminated. In total there were 7,360,000 women aged 60 and over at the end of 2008-09 in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/2">Source: Lifetime Labour Market Database 2, 2008/09 and 2008-based national population projections, Office for National Statistics</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/3">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/4">1. The estimate from the Lifetime Labour Market database has been rounded to the nearest 10,000 women and is for Great Britain cases only.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/5">2. The estimate excludes those women who would still fail the first and/or second contribution conditions if the Home Responsibilities protection had been able to count towards their Category A entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/6">3. Only women over State Pension age are included as we are unable to assess whether the Home Responsibilities Protection would improve basic State Pension entitlement until an individual has completed their working life.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/7">4. Women have not been able to make the reduced rate election since <phrase class="date" code="1977-05-12">12 May 1977</phrase>. However, women who were already paying the reduced rate at this point were allowed to continue their election and pay reduced rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/8">5. The election would lapse:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/9">if, since <phrase class="date" code="1978-04-06">6 April 1978</phrase>, there were two consecutive years during which no Class 1 contributions were paid (or treated as paid), and the woman was not self-employed</p>

	<p pid="a.106.5/12">if the woman chose to cancel it.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/13">6. Home Responsibilities Protection (HAP) was available in respect of the tax years 1978/79 to 2009/10 if insufficient National Insurance contributions had been paid or credited to make the year a qualifying year for basic pension purposes, where the person:</p>

	<p pid="a.106.5/18">6. For people reaching pension age before <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase> HRP was not a National Insurance credit, it operated by reducing the number of years of National Insurance contributions or credits required for entitlement to a Category A basic pension to a minimum of 20. Women who elected to pay National Insurance contributions at the reduced rate will also have entitlement to a Category B basic pension based on their husbands contributions. In the generality of cases HAP will only have created a financial advantage if it resulted in their Category A entitlement exceeding their Category B entitlement or if the woman reached pension age before her husband and therefore did not qualify for a Category B pension until he reached pension age.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/19">7. For people reaching pension age from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase> onwards years of HAP were converted into years of National Insurance credits and from April 2010 it was replaced by weekly National Insurance credits for people who are:</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">It is estimated that 970 housing benefit claimants in Tower Hamlets will experience a loss as a result of the caps applied to local housing allowance and the removal of the five bedroom rate. Most existing claimants are expected to remain entitled to housing benefit as they become affected by the local housing allowance changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/2">However, in cases where the housing benefit award does not currently cover the full rent due to income or other deductions, some customers may lose their whole award.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/3">We are unable to estimate how many people will flow off housing benefit as a result of the caps, partly because the caps are a part of a package of reforms, but also because this will depend on the precise earnings of housing benefit claimants at the time of transition.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">In March, the Department for Communities and Local Government announced our intention to make public and to review the statutory duties placed on local authorities by central government.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">At no point in recent history has there been a comprehensive list of the legal duties placed on councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/3">To remedy this, the Government agreed with the Local Government Association that we should compile such a list. Our aims in doing so were first, to provide clarity about what those duties are, and second, to assess which duties do not serve the public interest, and which may be creating unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy for local authorities, without improving the services provided to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/4">We published a draft list in March. It contained over 1,200 duties stemming from primary legislation for which departments across Whitehall are responsible. We invited local authorities and the general public to respond, identifying any existing duties that had not been identified and so needed to be added to the list, and asking for comments on whether any particular duties were no longer relevant.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/5">From the outset, we have been clear this is an exercise in getting together a comprehensive list and obtaining any feedback from councils on duties that are not relevant. We said unequivocally that the Government would not remove any statutory duties that protect vital front line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/6">However, since the publication of the draft list there unfortunately has been wilful misrepresentation suggesting that important duties that protect vital frontline services will be removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/7">I feel it important to clarify to the House that the Government have no intention to remove statutory protection where this will have a negative impact on the services provided to the public. Such protections that will rightly remain include, for example, services for vulnerable children such as those who are looked after or with special educational needs or disabilities, allotments, and libraries. These examples should not in any way be interpreted as an exclusive list-but rather these are areas which have been falsely suggested as having been considered for removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/8">The invitation to respond has now closed, following the receipt of over 6,000 responses.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/9">The next step will be for the department to analyse and review the representations. Any future work on whether to remove duties or associated guidance that only serve to create overly bureaucratic burdens on councils will be a separate process, and we will consult further where necessary. For the avoidance of doubt, the list of statutory duties is intended to be a comprehensive list of duties on local councils and so the inclusion of a particular duty is not an indication that the Government are considering that duty for removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/10">Our aim is, and will continue to be, to allow for the provision of better services to the public. I hope we can build a broad consensus for decentralisation in local government by removing unnecessary Whitehall burdens, while retaining important and useful requirements, thereby allowing councils to provide better value for money and higher quality local services to their residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/11">I will keep the House informed of progress.</p>

The recent consultation, <I>Office of the Public Guardian: Fees 2011/2012 (CP16/10)</I><I>,</I> sought views on a number of proposed changes to the current regime to ensure fees charged are fair and equitable and continue to meet the OPG's costs going forward.</p>

The Government are currently considering the responses received and will issue a formal consultation response once this process is complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/3">The consultation proposed making a number of changes to the current fee regime, including the removal or reduction of some fees and increases to some others. More fundamentally, it proposed restructuring the fees charged for the supervision of court-appointed deputies. It envisaged moving from the current tiered-fee scheme, to a new approach to charge a flat fee for the large majority of cases and introducing a basic administration fee for the lowest category of supervision. It also proposed raising the income threshold progressively over the next four years to reduce the number paying the standard fee.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/4">The net effect of the proposed changes would range from a maximum increase in fees charged of 83 per cent to a reduction of 80 per cent in fees charged, dependent on category.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.5/1">As part of a review of certain aspects of the building regulations, the Department for Communities and Local Government is carrying out work to consider whether there is a role for Government action to ensure an increased provision of Changing Places toilets. The department is working closely with the Local Government Association, the Changing Places Consortium and a number of industry bodies, to understand what prevents voluntary provision of these facilities and how to encourage provision of these facilities by existing providers, including local authorities, particularly in buildings such as large shopping centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/2">The latest figures provided by the Changing Places Consortium indicate that there are 183 Changing Places toilets in England and 12 in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/3">In March 2008 the previous administration published guidance in <I>Improving Public Access to Better Quality Toilets</I> that sought to encourage better public access to toilets in our cities, towns, and other public places. It also highlighted the importance of Changing Places toilets for people with profound and multiple disabilities as well as providing information on the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/4">We believe that decentralisation is the way to ensure that public services and amenities better reflect local needs. Private sector provision in shopping and tourist areas, and approaches such as Community Toilet Schemes, where councils pay local shops and businesses a small fee to allow free public access to their toilets, can be a useful way to supplement public toilets managed by local authorities.</p>
