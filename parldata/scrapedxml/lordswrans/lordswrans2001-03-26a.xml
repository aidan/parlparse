My officials are currently working with the Legal Services Commission in order to pilot proposals to tie these services more closely together in Family Advice and Information Networks which will be able to provide a range of information and help to those experiencing family problems, either directly or by referring them to other local support and information agencies. These proposals will build on research evidence in order to enable us to provide the information and help that people want at the time that they need it. We expect piloting to begin by October 2001.</p>

Under this initiative, government departments and agencies make these commitments on the resolution of disputes involving them:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2" class="indent">1. Alternative Dispute Resolution will be considered and used in all suitable cases wherever the other party accepts it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3" class="indent">2. In future, departments will provide appropriate clauses in their standard procurement contracts on the use of ADR techniques to settle their disputes. The precise method of settlement would be tailored to the details of individual cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/4" class="indent">3. Central government will produce procurement guidance on the different options available for ADR in government disputes and how they might be best deployed in different circumstances. This will spread best practice and ensure consistency across government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/5" class="indent">4. Departments will improve flexibility in reaching agreement on financial compensation, including using an independent assessment of a possible settlement figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/6">There may be cases that are not suitable for settlement through ADR--for example, cases involving intentional wrongdoing, abuse of power, public law, human rights and vexatious litigants. There will also be disputes where, for example, a legal precedent is needed to clarify the law, or where it would be contrary to the public interest to settle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/7">Government departments will put in place performance measures to monitor the effectiveness of this undertaking.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.2/1">The DFID Annual Report of 2001 is published today. It looks back at a year in which considerable progress was made in strengthening international efforts to reduce poverty: twenty-two countries have now qualified for HIPC debt relief; increasing numbers of poor countries are producing comprehensive poverty reduction strategies; and the European Union has agreed to duty-free access for all imports except arms from least developed countries. As this report shows, the Department for International Development is a driving force behind these and many other efforts to reduce global poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">This year's report provides a more detailed assessment of progress against the International Development Targets broken down by region. The report also shows progress at meeting the objectives set in our 1998 Public Service Agreement which are based on the performance of our top 30 partners in achieving the International Development Targets. The 2000 Spending Round agreed substantial additional resources to enhance our existing efforts. Our plans for allocation of these resources are set out in the report.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.0/1">We actively encourage people to claim social security benefits to which they are entitled. Approximately &pound;9 million has been spent on a variety of initiatives to encourage pensioners to take up the Minimum Income Guarantee. Also, as part of the campaign a teleclaims centre has been established, as a permanent feature, to offer a modern alternative to the claims process.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/2">A New Contract for Welfare: Safeguarding Social Security (CM 4276), published on <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-23">23 March 1999</phrase>, set out the department's strategy for tackling fraud and error. The overall aim of the strategy is to have a benefit system which is secure from first claim to final payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/3">An anti-fraud focus is consequently an integral feature of the implementation of this strategy and the work of the department, as is dealing with the wider agenda of error and incorrectness in benefit payments. It is therefore not possible to account for the cost of anti-fraud work separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.0/4">We have made no estimate of the amounts by which, given maximum success, take-up of benefits by entitled applicants could increase and Social Security fraud decrease by the end of the next three-year-period. However, demanding targets have been set to reduce fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance by 25 per cent by March 2004, rising to 50 per cent by March 2006. The department has already made a 6.7 per cent reduction in the level of fraud and error in these benefits, the first significant reduction, and is on course to meet its first milestone of a 10 per cent reduction by 2002.</p>

The Public Places Charter Group will conduct a survey of hospitality industry companies this summer to identify levels of take-up. Responsibility for monitoring take-up of the charter is a matter for the members of the Public Places Charter Group, but the Department of Health remains in close touch with progress and assists the development of the charter where possible. The department has no reason to doubt that the Charter Group will achieve its targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.5/1">The Government are taking robust action on all these issues. Green Technology and Natural Resources</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/2">The recent White Paper, Opportunity for all in a world of change, takes forward the new green industrial agenda. It is based on radically improving resource productivity by harnessing innovation, green technologies and the market. The Government are leading on a number of initiatives to persuade sectors to increase use of green technology, which include the Sustainable Technologies Initiative and a proposal to consult on setting up a Green Technology Challenge (GTC). Work is also taking place to establish and run a Climate Change Projects Office. Programmes such as Envirowise and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) also help to improve efficiency in the use of natural resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/3">A total of over &pound;250 million over the next three years will be invested in renewable energy and renewables R&amp;D, and Climate Change Levy exemptions are available to businesses on renewable electricity from quality assured combined heat and power plants.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/4">As far as the public sector is concerned, the Green Ministers Committee (which is made up of Ministers from each Department) works collectively to promote the integration of sustainable development across government and the wider public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/5">OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/6">The Government are actively promoting and implementing the OECD guidelines through the National Contact Point (NCP) housed in the Department of Trade and Industry. Activities include the establishment and maintenance of a website; discussions with industry, trade union and other non-governmental organisation representatives; participation in the Confederation of British Industry Annual Conference; and a soon-to-be-published booklet to raise awareness of the guidelines and highlight the role of the NCP.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/7">Social and Environmental Performance Reporting</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/8">The need for wider reporting of non-financial information by companies is being considered as part of a review of company law being undertaken by an independent steering group. The steering group has proposed that economically important companies should be required to publish, as part of their annual report, a new operating and financial review (OFR). This would require the company's directors to report on the performance and future plans and prospects of the company, including policies and performance on social and environmental issues where they are material to an understanding of the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/9">The steering group is expected to publish its final recommendations in May this year. The Government will then set out their response and proposed way forward in the light of the review's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/10">In addition, in his recent report on corporate social responsibility, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Competition and Consumer Affairs underlined the importance the Government attach to corporate social responsibility, including reporting on performance. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) also supported the Business Impact Task Force (which last year gave guidance and showed the importance to business of reporting on their impact on society) and a number of projects which encouraged environmental and sustainability good practice, including reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/11">The Prime Minister has challenged the top 350 FTSE companies to report on their environmental performance by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/12">Government departments' progress in reducing their environmental impacts is already made public in the annual &quot;green Ministers&quot; report. These reports also cover their progress in taking account of environmental and sustainable development issues in their policy making. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is also encouraging businesses to measure, manage and report publicly on their major environmental impacts and has published a series of guidelines for company reporting in Greenhouse Gases, Waste and Water.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.0/1">The EU beef labelling rules and the cattle tracing system on which they are dependent arose directly from concerns over the public health implications of BSE. No similar concerns have arisen in respect of sheepmeat or pigmeat, and thus no parallel rules have been promulgated for labelling and tracing in those sectors. False or misleading labelling of any product is an offence under food law and consumer protection legislation. The Government have issued advice to enforcement authorities and industry, making it clear that origin claims must be clearly worded so that they do not mislead, particularly as to the origin of ingredients.</p>
