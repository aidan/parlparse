The EC attaches strict conditionality to the budgetary assistance it provides to the Palestinian Authority (PA). The conditions mainly reinforce the need for transparency of the PA's public finances, strengthening the prudent management of the budget and encouraging progress on overall financial and administrative reform. We are satisfied that the EC, with the assistance of the IMF, is ensuring these conditions are met.</p>

She was warmly received and had some open and constructive discussions with the Government of Tanzania about their impressive progress on social and economic reform, as well as about the Government's response to the International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) report on the air traffic control system. Given that the contract with BAE Systems is legally binding, President Mkapa is inviting ICAO and BAE Systems to visit Tanzania to help advise his Government on the best and most effective way of using the system. President Mkapa also made clear that there would be no second phase of the project. The President and Finance Minister outlined measures the Government has put in place to ensure proper scrutiny and transparency of contracts to avoid any similar problems in the future. Improved systems and legislation, which DfID has helped to support, are now in place for public expenditure management and procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.8/2">In view of these assurances and the measures taken by the Government of Tanzania, and given the impressive achievements Tanzania has made in economic growth and social reform, my right honourable friend ageed to establish a six-year partnership based on mutual commitments to drive forward Tanzania's poverty reduction and economic reform efforts. The memorandum of understanding will provide a commitment to at least &pound;45 millon per annum of support to the Tanzanian budget, the first year of which will be disbursed between <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.91.5/1">Development of sterile seed technology (known colloquially as terminator technology) is continuing in the USA. It is highly unlikely that any applications to release such genetically modified plants in Europe will be submitted within the next few years. The UK would take a very cautious position should such an application involving this technology ever be submitted, in line with our strict, case-by-case, precautionary approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">The Government are firmly committed to their Modern Apprenticeship (MA) programme across all sectors, including manufacturing in England. We have demonstrated that by first commissioning and then, jointly with the Learning and Skills Council, accepting the recommendations of the Modern Apprenticeship Advisory Committee chaired by Sir John Cassels, which reported last September. In doing so we will be able to both raise quality and expand the number of opportunities available.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2">In particular, we have agreed a target of having over a quarter of 16-21 year olds following the MA route by 2004. In addition, that year we will fulfil our manifesto commitment to an entitlement to an MA place for 16-17 year olds with certain minimum qualifications. To ensure that we have sufficient places available to meet the expected demand we have also announced a major three year marketing campaign aimed at young people, employers and others. The next phase of the campaign begins on <phrase class="date" code="">5 August</phrase>. In order to fulfill our commitments both to expand MA and improve quality we have allocated an additional &pound;180 million over the three financial years from 2001&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/3">The Learning and Skills Council in England determines the allocation of MA places for each sector based on local labour market needs. Manufacturing MAs continue to be one of the most popular options for young people. Indeed in terms of the numbers of young people pursuing them, the three largest Advanced Modern Apprenticeship programmes are in manufacturing.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.0/1">The Government's total expenditure on cancer research in 2000&ndash;01 is estimated to be &pound;190 million. This figure includes expenditure by the Department of Health, its equivalents in the devolved administrations, the Medical Research Council, the other research councils and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The charities are thought to have invested about &pound;180 million&mdash;or roughly the same amount&mdash;in that year. No estimates of total expenditure have been made for the previous or following years. The pharmaceutical industry is estimated to spend around &pound;500 million a year on cancer research.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/2">But getting valid and accurate figures on cancer research is difficult. It is often impossible to distinguish between basic or biological research that is relevant to cancer from that relevant to other disease processes. It can also be difficult to differentiate between costs attributable to research and those attributable to services. And research on cancers in general will often contribute to both breast and prostate cancer advances.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/3">In the NHS Cancer Plan of September 2000, the Government confirmed their commitment to increasing their funding for cancer research. In 2000&ndash;01, the Department of Health spent &pound;83.8 million. This includes &pound;73.2 million on NHS support for projects funded by the research councils and charities. By 2003&ndash;04, the Department of Health is committed to investing an additional &pound;20 million each year in the infrastructure for cancer research and an extra &pound;4 million on prostate cancer research. These had been identified as priorities. The increase in investment in the infrastructure for cancer research is proceeding exactly according to plan. In 2001&ndash;02, the department invested an additional &pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/4">In April 2001, the Government set up the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) in partnership with the charities and the pharmaceutical industry. The NCRI is providing strategic oversight of cancer research across the United Kingdom. This will help to ensure that the nation's total investment in cancer research is directed to best effect. The NCRI is developing a database of research funded by its members, and this will include expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.2/1">Successive administrations have regarded the ability of Ministers to meet and discuss policy issues in private to be essential for effective decision-making. The number and duration of meetings is no measure of the success of a government. Besides, Cabinet government consists of more than meetings of the Cabinet. In addition to Cabinet itself, there are 52 Cabinet Committees and many ad hoc meetings of Ministers, together with a large volume of correspondence, all of which contribute to the smooth and cohesive running of the Government.</p>
