	<p pid="b.179.59/2">The temporary international mechanism is already paying for the supply of some utilities for the Occupied Territories. The UK has supported the work of the European Commission to prepare to pay allowances to health workers by seconding individuals to the Commission's team and making the use of an armoured car available. The European Commission is still working to make the first payments to medical workers in July, but the security situation is slowing progress. The mechanism will ensure that healthcare continues to be provided in the Occupied Territories. It will also work to help to provide the poorest segments of Palestinian society with basic needs allowances and to ensure the uninterrupted supply of utilities, including fuel. The mechanism will be run by both the World Bank and the European Commission.</p>

We welcome the Israeli Government's commitment to dismantling outposts and hope that they will act as soon as possible.

	<p pid="b.179.86/1">Responsibility for dealing with any trafficking offences in relation to the World Cup was rightly a matter for the German authorities. The UK stated that it would support all efforts made by the German authorities during this period to prevent the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation, should such a request be received. In connection with this, a 500-word article raising awareness of the possibility of trafficked women being forced to work in brothels was placed in the England football supporters fanzine that was distributed to travelling supporters to coincide with the first World Cup game against Paraguay. I am pleased to say that monitoring of the movement of people from eastern Europe to Germany has not revealed an increase in human trafficking for sexual exploitation during the World Cup.</p>

The particular areas of concern relate to issues surrounding the provision of recovery and reflection periods (Article 13) and residence permits (Article 14). The mandatory nature of these provisions, when coupled with the scope of the convention, has led to concerns that the provisions will act as an immigration pull factor, encourage spurious claims and be used by those who have no right to remain in an effort to frustrate removal. Abuse of the provisions would ultimately impact on those in genuine need of assistance. The Government are examining how the convention's approach could best be harmonised with effective immigration controls.</p>
