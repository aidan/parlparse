	<p pid="a.80.8/1">Local authority circular 1/95 Guidance of Decriminalised Parking Enforcement outside London gives detailed guidance to authorities on all aspects of taking on parking enforcement powers. Chapter 7 covers the role of parking attendants. Among the recommendations it notes the need for attendants to present a professional image, with qualities of firmness and sensitivity coupled with common sense and patience. It also emphasises the need for adequate training for parking attendants, their supervisors and managers so that they provide accurate, fair and consistent enforcement. This requirement applies whether parking attendants are employed by a local authority or by a contractor carrying out enforcement on their behalf.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.2/1">The Children's National Service Framework (NSF) will set standards for children's and young people's services. The standards will outline what support should be available to children and their parents in managing a wide range of conditions and problems. This will emphasise the promotion of evidence-based clinical guidelines and will provide examples of good practice. In addition, the NSF will include a small number of exemplars, which use particular problems to illustrate what the standards mean for children and their families. These will include asthma, autism, chronic fatigue syndrome, and epilepsy in pregnancy; these have been selected on the basis that they affect large numbers of families and involve a wide range of services. Other exemplars may also be produced as part of the ongoing work on the NSF.</p>
