	<p pid="a.192.5/1">Our understanding of a broadband service is one which provides the capacity for multiple users to transmit and receive simultaneously. The broader the band, the greater the number of users and data capacity which individuals can use. Using that definition, it is possible to say that 40 per cent of police force or divisional headquarters in England and Wales currently have access to broadband data transmission services through the Criminal Justice Extranet (CJX). The plans are to extend the service to 100 per cent of forces in England and Wales by March 2002. None of the Scottish forces has CJX access yet but they plan to take the service when their funding is in place. The staff who access CJX services are or will be trained and computer literate.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/2">The CJX broadband service provides the potential to access the Internet. Forces will decide themselves whether to take this facility and whether to extend the facility to police stations or to individual police officers. The degree of access will also depend on the capability of their own force systems and networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/3">The Airwave project is currently piloting a digital radio network service which will be capable of handling data transmissions within the next three months. Airwave will make data accessible by individual police officers through their radio handsets or vehicle terminals, as well as through control rooms. Officers will be fully trained in the use of Airwave.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">Immigration Service staff will take into account a combination of different indicators in identifying relevant ethnic or national groups for the purpose of operating the immigration control in accordance with the authorisation announced on <phrase class="date" code="">1 May</phrase>. These will include language or dialect spoken, geographical origin, pattern of travel and, where relevant, the passenger's apparent lineage. In some cases, the passenger's ethnic or national origin will be known from intelligence received or from statements made by the passenger. In other cases it may become apparent from answers to routine questions posed at the control or on the landing card. The authorisation will be used by officials responsibly and with due care. The authorisation applies to passengers of Tamil ethnic or national origin, irrespective of their nationality, because of the wide range of national travel documents used in attempted illegal entry by some members of this group and because of the attempted abuse of asylum provisions by those persons purporting to be fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka who are in fact nationals of other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">The particular adverse consequences for passengers in the groups covered by the authorisation are that they may be delayed at the immigration control longer than other persons in the same circumstances and may have conditions attached to their leave to enter or temporary admission. Where a passenger in one of the groups concerned meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules, this delay might only be a matter of minutes or there may be no delay at all if the immigration officer does not consider that a closer examination is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">The authorisation provides that an immigration officer may, in respect of the groups covered by the authorisation, by reason of a passenger's ethnic or national origin subject them to a more rigorous examination than other person in the same circumstances. The officer may exercise powers under Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, namely: requiring someone to submit to further examination; requiring them to furnish information and documents; examining and detaining their documents; searching them; detaining them pending further examination; and granting temporary admission.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/4">The officer may impose a condition or restriction on someone's leave to enter or their temporary admission. They may also decline to give someone notice of grant or refusal of leave to enter in a form permitted by Part III of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/5">In assessing the risk to the control posed by the groups listed in the authorisation, my honourable friend the Home Office Minister of State (Mrs Roche) has taken into account statistical evidence and other intelligence material. Statistical data are not held on Tamils as an ethnic group, but Sri Lankans of non-Tamil ethnic origin do not constitute a significant threat to the immigration control. In 2000, there were 3,592 inadequately documented arrivals by Sri Lankans in the United Kingdom: 91 of these cases involved false passports, 44 cases involved false or no visa and 39 cases involved impersonation. In 2000, there were 1,733 and 3,086 inadequately documented arrivals from Iraq and Turkey respectively. Asylum statistics confirm that Kurds comprise the vast majority of irregular migrants arriving in the United Kingdom from those countries. In 2000, the Immigration Service encountered 204 cases of Greek passport abuse, many involving nationals of the Former Soviet Union. In 2000, the Immigration Service detected 223 attempts to enter the United Kingdom using forged or counterfeit passports by nationals of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. Asylum statistics confirm that Roma comprise the vast majority of irregular migrants arriving in the United Kingdom from those countries. In 2000, there were 1,099 inadequately documented arrivals from Somalia and 2,654 the previous year. In 1999, there were 1,993 inadequately documented Albanian arrivals, although the figure declined in 2000. In 2000, the Immigration Service detected 92 cases involving abuse of Japanese travel documents and 84 cases involving abuse of Malaysian travel documents in total. Chinese nationals seeking to circumvent the immigration control have been most commonly identified using these and, to a lesser degree, other documents.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">The Government believe that the authorisation is entirely compatible with the United Kingdom's obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights. The authorisation relates to the translation of the explanatory notes accompanying the asylum Statement of Evidence Form (SEF) into over 30 languages currently used by the majority of asylum applicants. We are confident that most applicants will have knowledge of one of the languages in which the document is being made available. If the linguistic profile of languages used by asylum applicants changes, the need for additional translations will be of course considered. It would be impractical and prohibitively expensive to provide translations in every dialect and language which might be encountered.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">The Government do not believe that this authorisation is contrary to Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Decisions on a passenger's entitlement to enter or remain in the United Kingdom will continue to be taken on the merits of each individual case in accordance with the Immigration Rules. Therefore, any discrimination will be in the procedure by which the decision is taken. Like Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 26 must be read as prohibiting discrimination in circumstances where this is not justified. Procedural discrimination in the operation of the immigration control is fully justifiable in the circumstances covered by the authorisation, and does not breach Article 26.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/2">Sole reliance on the nationality authorisation in respect of the examination of passengers would result in additional unnecessary delay for passengers in other groups not covered by the authorisation, reducing the speed and efficiency of the on-entry control.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.0/1">In speaking to the House of Commons Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee, on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-28">28 November 2000</phrase>, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury confirmed the rises in landfill tax announced in Budget 1998. That is, the standard rate of Landfill Tax increased from &pound;7 per tonne to &pound;10 per tonne from <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase>. It then rose by a further &pound;1 per tonne in April 2000 and April 2001, and these annual &pound;1 increases will continue until at least 2004. These rises are designed to make waste producers take account of the environmental costs they impose on society, encouraging efforts to minimise the amount of waste generated and to develop more sustainable forms of waste management such as recycling, composting and recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/2">The Government are committed to meeting the challenging targets for waste recycling set out in Waste Strategy 2000. In the Pre-Budget Report 2000, we announced that we would explore how resources going through the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme could be better used to increase recycling rates. We have issued a challenge to the waste industry to meet demanding targets to allocate a greater proportion of tax credits towards sustainable waste management, and particularly recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/3">Spending Review 2000, which set the framework for government support to local government, provided an increase of &pound;1.1 billion by 2003-04 in the revenue support to local authorities for environmental, protective and cultural services, including their waste management function. Local authorities will set their own priorities for the use of these resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/4">Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 provides the Environmental Agency, and local authorities in their role as waste collection authorities, with powers to secure the removal of fly-tipped waste, and to recover their costs from those responsible. Owners or occupiers of land cannot be required to remove fly-tipped waste unless they deposited it themselves or knowingly caused or permitted its deposit.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/2">Letter to Lord Lea of Crondall from the National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales, Office for National Statistics, Mr Len Cook, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-09">9 May 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question on sub-regional and local area estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (HL2050).</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/4">GDP is a workplace-based concept, measuring the economic activity occurring within an area, regardless of whether the persons engaged in the activity actually live within the area. This is as required by the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95) regulation and conforms to the methods set out by Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the European Commission).</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/5">GDP per head figures are then calculated by dividing the total GDP for an area by the resident population of that area. This is the indicator that has been used historically as a measure of the well-being of an area, in the absence of an alternative that is available for all member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/6">Ideally, the economic activity of an area should be described by relating GDP to a measure of the volume of work (hours worked or full-time equivalent employment) in that area, which would provide a productivity measure. Alongside this, the well-being of those living in an area should be measured by household disposable income per head. However, such measures of sub-regional productivity or incomes per head are not yet available for all the member states of the EU. In the absence of such harmonised estimates, the Commission uses the available consistent data.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/7">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) currently has no plans to publish sub-regional and local area estimates of GDP on a residence basis. ONS is, however, planning to publish sub-regional and local area residence based estimates of total and disposable household income towards the end of 2001. ONS is also developing sub-national productivity estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/8">The European Commission and Eurostat are aware of the implications of using GDP estimates divided by resident population as a measure of regional incomes. These issues are being addressed through Eurostat's Regional Accounts Working Party, with ONS playing an active part.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.3/1">We have long recognised the adverse impact that Korean unfair competition has had upon the world shipbuilding market. The European Union (EU) is pursuing, with our firm support, a bilateral/trade remedy to this issue. The EU has been trying to secure a bilateral solution over the last year but, to our great disappointment, this has stalled. In view of this, the industry launched last November a Trade Barriers Regulation (TBR) case against Korea. In the absence of a bilateral solution, the EU will need to take a decision, on the basis of the recommendations of the European Commission's TBR investigation report, on taking action in the World Trade Organisation. If the Commission's examination does confirm the case against Korea and does recommend action in the WTO, we would be minded to support such action, subject to completing our review of the Commission's report.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.5/1">The Government's view that carcasses do not pose a major risk of spreading foot and mouth disease is based on advice from the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease at Pirbright and the Environment Agency. The Government are also advised on disease control strategies by their Chief Veterinary Officer and their expert scientific group. Experimental studies have shown that the release of the foot and mouth disease virus from infected animals is greatly reduced after death. This is why it is so important to identify and slaughter infected animals as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.5/2">The risk from carcasses is greatly reduced as a result of the procedures followed after slaughter. Carcasses are sprayed with an approved disinfectant which has been shown to be highly effective in destroying any virus on the outside of the animal. Approximately 24 hours after slaughter, rigor mortis sets in, whereby lactic acid accumulates and inactivates virus in the muscles. Virus in other internal organs will be inactivated by the processes of decomposition and is, in any case, situated internally. Before burning, the operations team is instructed to spray the pyre with additional disinfectant to reduce any risk of infection spreading at this stage. The virus is then inactivated at temperatures above 50 degrees centigrade. There may be a small thermo-resistant element of the virus which is also destroyed at 70 degrees, but expert opinion is that this is likely to be insignificant in the possible spread of infection from pyres.</p>

In early March the French authorities blood-tested 31 of the animals for foot and mouth disease before slaughtering them and seven samples gave positive results. The French authorities have now confirmed that the samples that initially showed positive results have been subject to further testing with negative results. They have concluded that the earlier test results were false positives.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.8/2">This explanation from the French authorities supports our view that, contrary to media reports, foot and mouth disease did not go undetected in sheep in Great Britain for up to two months prior to the disease being confirmed.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.3/1">The new EU-funded general hospital in Gaza is not yet fully staffed. The hospital now has between 550-600 of the 800 staff needed. All of the hospital departments are now open, and approximately 160 of the 238 available beds are occupied.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.3/2">The hospital, in common with other medical establishments across the Occupied Territories, has an acute shortage of nurses and junior staff. A training college has been established at the hospital to try to remedy the situation. The continuing violence and sustained closures in the Occupied Territories have been serious obstacles to recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.3/3">The hospital's international management team are working hard to remedy the situation, including considering the possibility of part-time working and allocating the more routine tasks to assistants/auxiliaries to free the qualified nursing staff for more critical duties.</p>
