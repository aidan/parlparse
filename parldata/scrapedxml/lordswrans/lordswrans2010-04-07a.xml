	<p pid="a.428.5/1">I visited the east of the country where operation Amani Leo is being carried out when I was in DRC in February. I met people who are living their daily lives amidst the conflict and heard first hand about the dangers they face. When I spoke to MONUC and FARDC commanders who are planning operation Amani Leo I reiterated that human rights abuses will not be tolerated and that conditionality must be applied by MONUC in cases where they are committed. This means that MONUC support will be removed from FARDC battalions that are involved in human rights abuses. I was assured that this message is being delivered to the troops in the field. We remain extremely concerned at the effect this conflict is taking on innocent people. We are monitoring developments and will continue pushing for human rights abuses to be investigated as well as conditionality to be applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/2">The FDLR continue to kidnap, kill and rape-particularly in South Kivu which is why the military operations to remove them as a source of instability are necessary. With closer MONUC involvement and a more organised FARDC, Amani Leo is better planned than its predecessor, Kimia II. However, people are still being displaced as a result of military operations. Congolese army troops (FARDC) continue to commit human rights violations. I told President Kabila that the issue of impunity must be addressed and perpetrators of human rights abuses held to account when I met him in February. FARDC has made efforts to implement President Kabila's &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy, by bringing some offenders to justice. MONUC is demanding that human rights violators are removed from military units that they are supporting. FARDC is being more transparent and is now reporting to MONUC cases of human rights abuse as they occur. We understand FARDC has provided figures to MONUC detailing the number of personnel tried in military courts between February 09 and February 10 for human rights crimes including rape, murder and armed robbery. Reporting from our post in DRC and MONUC sources suggests that the situation has improved over the last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/3">MONUC also carries out disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration (DDRRR) work with foreign armed groups, principally the FDLR and Lord's Resistance Army. In 2009 the combination of enhanced DDRRR work and military operations resulted in a threefold increase over 2008 in successful repatriations of FDLR fighters back to Rwanda. The UK continues to fund DDRRR work and I visited one of the UK-funded radio transmitters used for DDRRR communications when I was in DRC seeing how UK money is being put to good use.</p>

	<p pid="a.429.5/1">The security situation across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains a serious concern for the UK and we continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.5/2">(a) I visited the Kivu's where Operation Amani Leo is currently under way when I was in DRC at the end of February. In Bunyakari I spoke to UN peacekeeping mission to DRC (MONUC) troops and the Congolese army (FARDC) 8th brigade who told me that while operations had opened up the main road and improved trade and communications insecurity was still high with FDLR attacks including rape, looting, house burning a daily occurrence. My meetings with local people confirmed the dangers and difficulties they face. I reiterated to MONUC and FARDC commanders that there must not be a repeat of the human rights abuses of Kimia II and that conditionality, whereby support offered by MONUC to FARDC battalions will be withdrawn where human rights abuses are committed, must be applied and acted upon where warranted. They assured me that this message is being delivered to troops and battalions in the field.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.5/3">In the North of North Kivu the main threats come from kidnappings by the Allied Democratic Forces/National Liberation Army for the Liberation of Uganda (ADF/NALU) and banditry committed by the PNC (Congolese Police Force), elements of FARDC, and the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) being pushed north by the military operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.5/4">(b) The FDLR has a presence in the north of Katanga, with some moving south as they are pushed out of their bases in the Kivus. Exploitation of minerals remains a source of insecurity as various armed actors and criminal elements seek to profit from mines.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.5/5">(c) There are border issues with Angola in Bas Congo, and the Angolans are also in dispute with DRC over access to oil in the ocean.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.5/6">The Government clampdown of the Bundia Dia Kongo group in 2008 has left a lingering tension in Bas Congo. The activities of Bundia Dia Kongo and the DRC Government remain concerning. Underlying tensions do not seem to have been resolved, though there have been no recent signs of violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.5/7">(d) The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is present and terrorising the local population in Dungu. Human Rights Watch released a report recently which says that 321 civilians were killed by the LRA during a four day rampage in the Makombo district in December 2009. Fear of LRA attacks is preventing the local population from leaving the relative security of the towns and villages meaning fields are left uncultivated. Roads in the region are in a poor state and there are no mobile phone networks outside of Dungu; early warnings and a rapid response to attacks are nearly impossible. As I stated on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-30">30 March</phrase> &quot;The LRA continues to pose a serious threat to civilians. They also put at risk both the conduct of humanitarian operations and the stability of the region&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.431.0/2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) January 2010 report highlighted the natural resource sector as a particular area where armed groups use forced labour. I spoke to Prime Minister Muzito when I was in DRC about the importance for the country of mineral sector reform. We are working with the International Community to help the Government of DRC reform their natural resource sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.0/3">I also spoke to President Kabila about ending impunity for all human rights abuses including the use of child soldiers. We support the work of UN peacekeeping mission to DRC (MONUC) in reintegrating militia groups which has led to children being released into the care of child protection organisations. Through the EU advisory and assistance mission for security reform in the Democratic Republic of Congo (EUSEC) we are funding a biometric census project which provides accurate personnel figures for FARDC regiments and allows child soldiers to be successfully identified and removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.0/4">Alongside abduction one of the major factors that persuades children to join militia groups is the lack of access to education.

	<p pid="a.434.0/1">There are a number of different approaches to deriving stem cell lines that can be used in the study of disease in laboratory-based research, these include somatic cell nuclear transfer and the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) lines from patients. It is known that cells derived using different approaches have different features, for instance iPS cells divide more slowly than embryonic stem cells. There are many groups working to identify these differences and to develop iPS cells that are more like embryonic stem cells. However, both of the approaches cited by the noble Lord continue to be valuable in research studies of disease phenotype.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/2">The Medical Research Council (MRC) has not made any detailed assessment of the work described in the published papers cited, however these papers indicate the continued rapid development of the iPS field and its continued promise following the development of disease-specific and patient-specific cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/3">However, it is not evident at present which area of stem cell research may deliver the most effective treatments for particular conditions and more research is needed on all types of stem cells to determine which routes should be pursued in the development of cell-based therapies. The MRC therefore supports research into all approaches to harness the potential of stem cells to understand human disease and develop effective treatments.</p>

	<p pid="a.436.3/1">The study is not investigating anecdotal complaints relating to aspartame, but is aiming to collect validated information from individuals who believe aspartame adversely affects them. This information has not previously been systematically collected under trial conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.3/2">The basis for funding this study was the need to gather information on the adverse effects individuals relate to the consumption of aspartame in a safe and controlled environment. This will enable a robust analysis of this evidence, which is not possible to do with the unverified case report data available at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.3/3">To date, 48 individuals who believe that they are sensitive to aspartame have volunteered to participate in the Food Standards Agency-funded study. An age and sex matched control is recruited for each aspartame-sensitive volunteer who takes part in the study.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.3/4">The aspartame study is due to report early in 2011. This is reliant upon the volunteers attending the clinic and participating in the study. If those who have already volunteered do so it should be feasible to recruit the remaining participants and compete within this timeframe.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.3/5">There will be no interim report of findings from this study. Due the nature of the study, a double blind placebo controlled study, it is not possible to review the study outcomes until the target number of volunteers have participated in the trial, as this would result in the research team being aware of which product the participants are consuming (placebo or control) and may influence how they treat them.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.3/6">As an evidence-based organisation we hope to increase our knowledge in this area and be in a better position to advise consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.437.2/3">As Director General of the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking why there was a downwards revision of &#163;4.3 billion in public sector net borrowing for January as published in the Office for National Statistics' February revision of central government current expenditure; which departments reduced their expenditure or increased their income (or both); and by how much each department reduced its expenditure or increased its income (or both).

	<p pid="a.437.2/5">The single biggest contributor to the revision of the January 2010 data, accounting for &#163;3.2 billion of the total, was central government current expenditure. There were a number of factors contributing to this, including the availability of better estimates from government departments. Earlier months in the current financial year were also revised, leaving the year to date total broadly unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/6">There was also an upward revision of &#163;1.4 billion to government tax revenues with firmer data replacing figures that were partially estimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/7">A breakdown of revisions by government department is not available. A significant part of the revision is due to technical changes, which are not subdivided by department, to some of the components that make up central government current expenditure.</p>

The key aim of the new C. difficile objective, starting in April 2011, will be to address this variation by driving the performance of all organisations towards the level of the best by setting a performance level for each NHS organisation (acute trusts and primary care organisations) based on its historical performance. The largest challenge will be for those organisations that have not contributed as significantly as they could have done to the progress made so far. The 55 per cent national reduction referred to is a consequence of successfully delivering the key aim of the objective.</p>

Our High Commission in Abuja remains in regular contact with the Nigerian Government at state and federal level on this issue.

	<p pid="a.440.0/2">The Department for International Development (DfID)'s representatives in Nigeria began discussions with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on assistance to victims of conflict in Jos in mid-March 2010. Previously, DfID had provided &#163;200,000 to ICRC for its overall work in Nigeria, which has helped to meet immediate needs. Decisions on any additional funding will be made on the basis of a needs assessment currently being carried out by the ICRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.0/3">More broadly, our High Commission in Abuja and DfID will continue its programme of outreach and interfaith activity to promote dialogue between different communities to foster reconciliation and tolerance. We will also continue to press the Government of Nigeria on the importance of ensuring security for its citizens and protecting freedom of religion as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We encourage all Commonwealth states to uphold the values of the Commonwealth, as reiterated at the last Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 2009, with the issuing of the Trinidad and Tobago Affirmation on Commonwealth Values and Principles. We also maintain a close dialogue with Nigeria through the Commonwealth forum. For example during last year's CHOGM I had productive discussions with Foreign Minister Maduekwe .</p>

The UK remains fully supportive of these talks and continues to encourage both Macedonia and Greece to engage flexibly in the negotiations in the hope that they will be able to find an early solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.0/1">The Government are not directly involved in individual decisions on making changes to local school provision, including promoting the establishment of new maintained schools and the closure of existing schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/2">We acknowledge the long-standing tradition of church schools in this country and the significant contribution that they continue to make to our education system. We remain committed to supporting church schools where local consultation has shown that this is what parents and the local community want. We have regular contact with faith group national bodies, including the Education Division of the Archbishops' Council of the Church of England which is invited to termly stakeholder meetings at the Department for Children, Schools and Families. They then feed back any required information to their dioceses.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/3">The role of diocesan boards of education is secured in law by the Diocesan Boards of Education Measure 1991. This requires every diocese to have a Diocesan Board of Education and that its functions are to include, among other things, promoting education that is consistent with the faith and practice of the Church of England, promoting religious education and worship in schools in the diocese and promoting church schools in the diocese.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/4">Where changes to local school provision are proposed a statutory process must be followed, that includes consultation with all those likely to be affected by the proposals. The process is decided at a local level under established decision-making arrangements, normally by the local authority. There are rights of appeal to the independent schools adjudicator in certain cases. In recognition of the importance of their schools to the education system, both the Church of England and Roman Catholic diocese have a right of appeal in the majority of cases, even where church schools are not directly involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/5">Our records show that St Margaret of Antioch Church of England Primary School has been approved under local decision-making arrangements for closure from <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-30">30 August 2010</phrase>, and the displaced pupils will be accommodated at a local community primary school. We are not aware of any current consultations on potential school closures in the Liverpool area. However, under the statutory process any consultation would be a matter for either the local authority or the school concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.443.2/1">The UK Government are extremely concerned about the situation in the Jebel Mara region of Darfur. However we cannot confirm whether the estimates made by Medecins du Monde (MDM) are accurate. The Government of Sudan, the Sudanese Liberation Army rebel movement and the insecurity in the region have prevented humanitarian agencies from undertaking assessments in the areas where most civilians are thought to have fled.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.2/2">The UK Government have called upon all parties to cease hostilities immediately and allow humanitarian agencies access to all areas in order to assess the needs of the affected civilian population and provide humanitarian assistance. We are encouraging and supporting the African Union/United Nations Hybrid peacekeeping operation in Darfur (UNAMID) to focus on its primary roles of improving civilian protection and security. The UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator, Georg Charpentier, is currently in Darfur. We are awaiting his report and will continue to use all opportunities and channels available to us to press all sides to allow humanitarian access.</p>
