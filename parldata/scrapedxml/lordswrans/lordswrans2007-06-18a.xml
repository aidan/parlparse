	<p pid="a.2.8/2">These figures do not indicate a decline in the standard of applications for higher-level stewardship; rather, they illustrate the competitive nature of the scheme and the fact that submitting an application does not guarantee an offer of an agreement. Because funds for HLS are limited, Natural England has been obliged to target agreements where they are likely to achieve the most environmental benefit for the countryside. Unfortunately, while some applications have scored highly, they have fallen short of the current thresholds established within Natural England's regions.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibilities of the Office of Communications (Ofcom), and I have received the following information from Ed Richards, the chief executive:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/2">Ofcom has a dedicated staff of 70 field officers who investigate and take illegal broadcasters off the air. In 2006, Ofcom undertook 1,085 separate operations against illegal broadcasters. This included seizing transmitters, disconnecting transmitters and aerials, and raids on illegal broadcasters' studios.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/3">Enforcement is also targeted against owners of premises, advertisers, nightclub events and suppliers of equipment or other services to the illegal station. Ofcom uses specialist solicitors and barristers to secure court convictions against illegal broadcasters. Almost all prosecution cases have resulted in a court appearance for the offenders. In 2006, some 63 people were convicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/4">Ofcom's work in tackling the problem of illegal broadcasting is carried out in partnership with other organisations, notably local authorities and the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/5">Due to the potential threat of violence from illegal broadcasters, Ofcom's field officers seek support from local police officers while conducting work in the field. Where illegal broadcasters are found on site, they are arrested and taken to the local police station for interview. In the majority of cases, this results in the broadcaster being summoned to court to face charges regarding their criminal activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/6">In July 2005, Ofcom staff were contacted by the National Air Traffic Service (NATS), which was experiencing extreme interference to aircraft frequencies, in use, on approach to London. A second complaint received from Air Traffic Control (ATC) at London City Airport, highlighted its difficulties further, when it suggested that it would have to close the airport if the interference became more severe. Passion FM, an illegal broadcaster based in east London, was found to be causing the problem and was removed from the airwaves by Ofcom's investigation staff later the same day.</p>

This is one of the reasons that the UK Government are a strong supporter of CAP reform.

	<p pid="a.8.0/1">Since 2004 the Home Office has provided more than &pound;1 million funding to the Action Against Business Crime Group (AABC) to set up 120 new business crime reduction partnerships in towns and cities across England and Wales. It has also, in partnership with stakeholders, produced a booklet to enable businesses to undertake a crime prevention survey of their premises. More than 125,000 copies of the booklet have so far been printed and distributed. Top-tips postcards have also been produced, giving more general advice to retailers and other businesses on how to reduce the risk of being a victim of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/2">A new strand of the forthcoming crime reduction strategy will include a renewed focus on working with business to see what more can be done to tackle crime problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/3">Measures will be taken to raise the profile of business crime among crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs) by highlighting the need to tackle it in the public service agreement delivery plan. The Home Office will also seek to raise the profile of crime against businesses, to ensure that CDRPs consult and engage with the business community as part of their wider community consultation to identify local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/4">It will be a key part of the Home Office's new business crime strategy to encourage business to work closely in partnership with the police and local authorities through CDRPs to inform local crime reduction strategies. Where a partnership has a significant business crime problem, it would be expected to ensure that an appropriate target for this is included in the local area agreement. The Home Office will support this by improving the quality of information available on business crime, through regular criminal victimisation surveys and better crime recording categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/5">Neighbourhood policing has been introduced across England and Wales to deal with low-level crime and anti-social behaviour, and in some communities this will include, for example, police community support officers working in partnership with local businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.0/1">The terms nucleus, pronucleus and genetic structure are not defined in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. With respect to nucleus and pronucleus, the appeals committee that considered the application that resulted in awarding licence R0153 was satisfied that the pronucleus is not the same as the nucleus. Having reached agreement on this distinction, the committee considered that the prohibition contained in Section 3(3)(d) of the Act did not extend to the proposed research involving the pronuclei.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/2">The draft Human Tissues and Embryo Bill defines &quot;nucleus&quot; as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/3" class="indent">&quot;'Nucleus', in relation to an embryo, includes pronucleus and, accordingly, 'nuclear DNA', in relation to an embryo, includes DNA in the pronucleus of an embryo&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/4">Genetic structure is not defined in the 1990 Act and is not mentioned in the draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill. When considering this, the appeals committee took &quot;genetic structure&quot; to have a narrow meaning centring on the expression of nuclear genes that result in heritable characteristics. Following on from that, altering the genetic structure would involve alteration to the genes or the genome and the resulting heritable characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/5">No Members of Parliament were involved in reaching this decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.3/1">Schedule 2 to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 sets out the activities for which licences may be granted. Licences for the purpose of a project of research involving human embryos cannot authorise any activity unless it appears to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to be necessary or desirable for one or more of the purposes specified. Furthermore, the law makes clear that no licence shall be granted unless the authority is satisfied that any proposed use of embryos is necessary for the purposes of the particular research project.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/2">Research into implantation per se does not exclusively require human embryos, therefore embryos from other species can be, and are, used for research.

	<p pid="a.12.0/2">The functions of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights which are regulatory within the meaning of the consultation document <I>A Code of Practice for Regulators</I> include: its powers to provide information and advice under Section 13 of the Equality Act 2006; to issue codes of practice under Sections 14 and 15; to conduct inquiries under Section 16; and enforcement powers under Sections 20 to 23 (investigations, unlawful act notices, action plans and agreements) and Sections 31 and 32 (public-sector duties: assessment and compliance notices). These functions include securing compliance with the law in some respects; for example, the power to issue unlawful act notices and compliance notices under Sections 21 and 32. They do not include giving assistance to litigants, because that constitutes a function of conducting civil proceedings, which is specifically excluded from the definition of a regulatory function for the purposes of the consultation document.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.2/1">SSSI units are assessed once every six years using common standards as part of a continuing rolling programme. A change in the condition of a unit can reflect either a change in its physical condition or a reassessment of the impact of activities on the unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/2">The main causes of the decline in condition of SSSI land between 2006 and 2007 in the east of England related to water abstraction and water quality issues and unsustainable fishing practices. In the south-west, the main causes were fires, under-grazing, low summer water levels and inappropriate woodland management. In the West Midlands, the main causes related to water quality, invasive freshwater species, under-grazing, inappropriate woodland management and deer grazing.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/3">For all these different reasons, a variety of remedial mechanisms has been identified in order to resolve the problems by 2010. This involves work by Natural England, the Environment Agency, internal drainage boards, water companies, the Forestry Commission, national park authorities and others. Land managers will be supported to deliver the right management through environmental stewardship and the English Woodland Grant Scheme.</p>
