	<p pid="b.53.2/1">Bethlehem is of unique religious and cultural significance to Christians. We remain concerned about the current route of the barrier and settlement building around Bethlehem, and other parts of the West Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.2/2">Settlements are illegal under international law and settlement construction is an obstacle to peace. The road map is clear that Israel should freeze all settlement construction including the &quot;natural growth&quot; of existing settlements, and dismantle all outposts built since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.2/3">We also fully recognise Israel's right to self-defence. A barrier is a reasonable way to achieve this. But the barrier's route should be on or behind the green line, and not on occupied territory. Construction of the barrier on Palestinian land is illegal. The route is particularly damaging around East Jerusalem, as it risks cutting the city off from the West Bank and dividing the West Bank in two.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-02">2 March</phrase>, our ambassador in Tel Aviv discussed settlements, the barrier, and Israeli Acting Prime Minister Olmert's future plans for the West Bank with the Israeli Prime Minister's special adviser.</p>

	<p pid="b.53.4/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.53.4/2" qnum="HL4610">Further to the Written Answer by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr Ben Bradshaw, on 9 February (<i>Official Report</i>, House of Commons, col. 1348W), what monitoring takes place to ensure that the tuberculin skin test for bovine tuberculosis continues to be effective; how the accuracy of the test is measured; what percentage accuracy is required for the test to be declared effective; and what percentage of test results are confirmed at slaughter.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-22b.53.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060322/text/60322w01.htm#60322w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.53.5/1">The single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, commonly known as the tuberculin skin test, is a well established screening test for TB in cattle. It is approved and recognised by the EU Commission and the International Animal Health Organisation (OIE) as a primary, effective tool for the diagnosis of TB in cattle and other species, by virtue of its overall accuracy, robustness and relative simplicity (as demonstrated in several field evaluations conducted throughout the world).</p>
	<p pid="b.53.5/2">The accuracy of any test is measured in terms of its specificity (proportion of uninfected animals identified as negative) and its sensitivity (proportion of infected animals detected as positive). The specificity for a correctly performed SICCT is above 99 per cent. Its sensitivity is between 77 per cent and 95 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.5/3">The effectiveness of the tuberculin test depends on a host of controllable and uncontrollable variables such as the quality of the test reagent (tuberculins) employed, the operator performing the test, the animal/herd being tested, criteria for interpretation and the epidemiological situation. All batches of tuberculin undergo quality assurance testing at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency before release and their performance in the field is also monitored by epidemiological analyses. The quality of tuberculin testing work by approved local veterinary inspectors (LVIs) is assured by annual veterinary practice audits conducted by the State Veterinary Service (SVS), which ensure that LVIs are working to the most up to date operating procedures. The test certificates submitted by LVIs to the SVS are also audited for consistency with professional expectations. All concerns raised by farmers regarding the administration of the test are investigated by the SVS. A number of key TB epidemiological parameters (eg rate of reactors per 10,000 tests, disease confirmation rate in individual reactors, slaughterhouse case numbers, etc) are also centrally monitored as indirect indicators of the effectiveness of the tuberculin testing programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.5/4">Provisional statistics indicate that 33.6 per cent <sup>1</sup> of all skin test reactors slaughtered in 2005 had demonstrable signs of TB (visible lesions on post mortem examination or a positive culture result for <i>mycobacterium bovis</i>). The purpose of post mortem examination and bacteriological culture of tuberculin test reactors is not so much the validation of skin test results on individual animals, but rather to determine for epidemiological purposes, (a) the severity of disease in infected animals and (b) the strain of <i>mycobacterium bovis</i> organism involved. Failure to find evidence of the disease by these means in a test reactor does not mean that the animal was not infected. In the early stages of infection, it is not always possible to see TB lesions with the naked eye, and, due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture it from samples in every case.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.6/1">Israel has the right to defend itself, but any actions it takes must be in accordance with international law and should be proportionate. We have repeatedly expressed our concern about Israel's policy on targeted killings, particularly our concerns about the number of civilian casualties. It is essential that Israel conducts itself in accordance with international law. International law requires that lethal force be used only where absolutely necessary in self-defence. We believe, however, that in many cases Israel's use of lethal force was not necessary. We have been particularly concerned that, in the course of Israel Defence Force operations, too little effort was made to avoid civilian casualties. We call on Israel to act with restraint and end its policy of targeted killings. Our ambassador in Tel Aviv last raised the deaths of Palestinian individuals as a result of Israeli Defence Force activities in the Occupied Territories with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase> and our Defence Attach&eacute; raised this with the Israel Defence Force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.5/1">The A419 Blunsdon Bypass is 3.5 kilometres (2 miles) in length. The estimated cost of the scheme in 2002 was &pound;28.8 million. The latest approved scheme budget is &pound;65.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.5/2">There are two main reasons for the increased forecast costs. First, the Highways Agency has improved the way that it develops TPI scheme budgets, based on Treasury guidance. This accounts for &pound;11 million of the scheme cost increase. Since 2003, additional allowances have been included for assessed project risk, projected inflation at 2.5 per cent, and the recognised tendency in construction projects for budgets to be set too optimistically (&quot;optimism bias&quot;). That means that there are now better forecasts of the likely final costs of schemes. It also means that scheme costs pre-April 2003 are not directly comparable with costs post-April 2003, as they comprise different calculations of scheme cost. This new approach means that there is a better grip on likely final costs and the agency can act now to tackle potential cost increases rather than react afterwards when we get bigger bills.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.5/3">The targeted programme of improvements is subject to external cost pressures, including rising energy prices, that have driven cost inflation above the retail prices index in the construction industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.5/4">The remainder of the increase (&pound;26 million) can be attributed to increases in the cost of construction and design fees, with the most significant element (&pound;20 million) due to increased lands cost estimate.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.5/5">The Highways Agency is taking urgent measures to drive down costs and improve estimating and budgeting, including working closely with the supply chain. It is also taking a more realistic view of the final costs of projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.5/6">The scheme benefits include a reduction in congestion, long delays and accidents. There will also be environmental improvements for people living near the trunk road due to a reduction in the volume of traffic.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.5/7">The improvements will also make it easier for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians to cross the road at Blunsdon. The benefit:cost ratio for the scheme is 4:2, which is categorised as high.</p>

Passive surveillance is where animals are reported to the State Veterinary Service (SVS) with clinical signs of disease, and the case is investigated. In 2002 the European Union launched a Europe-wide active TSE surveillance programme to establish the prevalence of TSEs in small ruminants. This has required the testing of sheep slaughtered for human consumption and fallen sheep over 18 months of age.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.2/106">The above totals relate to BBSRC spend on TSE research which in the main, directly relates to TSE research in sheep, cattle and goats. However, a small proportion of BBSRC funded research relates to underpinning research on yeast prions in addition to research on Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans. This research has none the less been included in the totals as it is considered that such research may further underpin our understanding of TSEs in sheep, cattle and goats.</p>
