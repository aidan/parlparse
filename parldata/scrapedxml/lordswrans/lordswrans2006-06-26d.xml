	<p pid="d.121.2/1">Local authorities are placed under a duty, by Section 22 of the Children Act 1989, to safeguard and promote the welfare of looked-after children. Local authorities have a duty to consult children, among others, before a decision is taken that affects them. The review of children's cases procedure, derived from Section 26 of the 1989 Act, places a duty on local authorities to have a plan for the future care of looked-after children and to appoint an independent reviewing officer (IRO) to conduct the periodic statutory reviews of their cases. There is statutory guidance covering the IRO role. It is expected that children should be actively consulted about any proposal to change their placement arrangement and that views expressed by the child (and others) should be accorded appropriate weight.</p>
	<p pid="d.121.2/2">These duties extend to any decision that the local authorities may take to cease to look after a child. Where children are looked after because they are the subjects of care orders imposed by the court, they can only cease to be looked after where the court has approved an application for the order's revocation.</p>
	<p pid="d.121.2/3">The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 is based on this care planning framework. However, at the age of 18, a young person is legally adult and, therefore, can no longer be a looked-after child. The Act, its regulations and guidance require local authorities to assess and plan for meeting the needs of care leavers, including ensuring that they are provided with accommodation suitable to their needs. This might, in relevant cases, be the placement in which they were living prior to their 18th birthday, which could be a residential or foster care placement.</p>

	<p pid="d.121.5/1">The Government have established the legal framework to enable local authorities with responsibilities for care leavers to make available appropriate accommodation. The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, which commenced in October 2001, requires that all local authorities must provide a pathway plan and personal adviser for each care leaver for whom they have a responsibility. The pathway plan must include details of the accommodation that the young person is to occupy. As with any other services set out in pathway plans, the provision of accommodation for care leavers should be based on an assessment of individual need.</p>
	<p pid="d.121.5/2">The requirements set out Section 10 of the Children Act 2004 provide the opportunity to enable improved joint planning to better meet the housing needs of children and vulnerable groups of young people, including, for example, young people who have left local authority care. The section requires each children's services authority to put in place arrangements to promote co-operation among those who engage in activities in relation to children and young people, and gives key strategic partners, including housing authorities, a duty to take part.</p>

	<p pid="d.123.3/1">As explained in the Government's response to the Deepcut review, armed guarding by soldiers and trainees under the age of 18 is restricted by reference to age, qualification in weapons handling, supervision and stage of training. No phase 1 trainees undertake armed guarding and no under-18s may undertake armed guarding alone, even if they are fully trained and qualified in weapons handling.</p>
	<p pid="d.123.3/2">We recognise that Mr Blake indicated in his report that 18 is the appropriate minimum age for armed guard duty, but we would not want to rule out the possibility of two, appropriately trained and qualified, 17 year-olds undertaking armed guard duty together, as may be the case on occasion under current policy, as (particularly for the Army) weapon handling and guard duty are an important aspect of service life.</p>
	<p pid="d.123.3/3">We fully recognise, as Mr Blake pointed out in his report, the special responsibilities that come with arming under-18s and we therefore aim to take appropriate precautions relating to their safety and well-being. These include: tighter procedures to identify those at risk of self-harm and to deny them access to means; the need for weapons training and assessment before an individual is qualified to be armed; the responsibility of the chain of command to know each individual and to be confident that they are sufficiently mature and sensible to carry a weapon; and the requirement for each guard to be under the command of a guard commander.</p>

In addition, Section 19 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 provides for the closure of premises selling alcohol for consumption on the premises in breach of the conditions of a premises licence. Sections 40 and 41 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 make provision for closing licensed premises on grounds of public nuisance resulting from noise emanating from the premises.

	<p pid="d.131.8/1">I have provided regular updates to the House on all aspects of the recent events concerning the department's handling of the deportation of foreign national prisoners who were released without consideration. In particular, I refer the noble Lord to the most recent Written Ministerial Statement, of <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May 2006</phrase> (<i>WS 41</i>), in which we set out the department's organisational failings in this area and explained the eight priority areas set out for management action to rectify these. In this Statement, we also confirmed that further updates would depend on the outcome of a thorough rechecking of all the information that we hold in this area. We shall update the House with those results as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="d.133.2/1">The Environment Agency does not charge an applicant for placing adverts for permissions to abstract or impound water on its website. All adverts are placed on the website for a period of 28 days. In comparison, the <i>London Gazette</i> charges &pound;117.50 per advert per day (this includes uploading on to its website).</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/2">Before the Water Resources (Abstraction and Impounding) Regulations 2006 came into force, an applicant would have had to pay for advertising twice in a local paper and once in the <i>London Gazette</i>. Now applicants need only pay for advertising once in a local paper, with a one-off charge of a &pound;100 advertising administration fee to the Environment Agency.

With our support, the EU has joined the UN in condemning the demolitions and, through our embassy in Harare, we continue to raise our concerns about the impact of this policy. We have received occasional assurances that they have stopped, but we continue to see reports that some evictions are still taking place.</p>
