	<p pid="a.179.2/1">In the past two years the Department for International Development (DfID) has provided &pound;5.8 million directly to international research centres working on dry land and semi-arid agriculture. In addition, over the same period, a proportion of DfID's overall contribution of &pound;40 million to 15 international agriculture research centres has been spent on research into the development of new varieties of drought-tolerant crops and the development of improved farming practices to overcome the worst effects of drought.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">New varieties of crops, more productive and better able to withstand drought, have increased the yields of staple crops grown in arid and semi-arid areas, For example, drought-tolerant varieties of maize, developed with DfID support, increase farmers' yields by 25-30 per cent and are being grown on more than 1 million hectares in Africa. Sorghum varieties have been developed and released which increase farmers' yields by over 50 per cent. In total over 400 new varieties of drought-tolerant and more productive crops have been developed and released in Africa by international agriculture research centres.</p>

The Government may also from time to time consult on an ad hoc basis interested parties or experts on specific topics; with the exception of counsel providing legal advice who are paid accordingly, these advisers are not remunerated, do not hold a formal position, and do not provide published advice.

	<p pid="a.180.6/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) has two ongoing programmes that directly address rural poverty among Dalits (scheduled castes) and scheduled tribes in Orissa.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/2">The western Orissa rural livelihoods project, with a budget of &pound;32.75 million, focuses on improving opportunities for very poor people to earn a decent living. The project aims to benefit 400,000 poor people from four districts including 140,000 people from scheduled tribes and 60,000 from scheduled castes. The project commenced in 2000 and will run over a period of 10 years. A recent review found that good progress was being made, with income levels in the target communities rising steadily.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/3">The Orissa tribal empowerment and livelihoods programme is jointly supported by DfID, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Government of Orissa and the programme beneficiaries. DfID's contribution is &pound;9.76 million over six years, from 2004 to 2010, and is intended to improve incomes, water and sanitation and reduce malnutrition in very poor tribal areas. The programme aims to benefit poor people from eight districts with a total population of 1.7 million people. 75,000 households are being directly targeted, including 315,000 people from scheduled tribes and 37,500 from scheduled castes.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.6/4">In addition to these two programmes, DfID supports a number of Government of India schemes which cover the entire country and are therefore active in Orissa. These address the need for better health, education and other services for the poorest, with a focus on marginalised groups such as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.2/12">Changes to transport arrangements in 2007-08 have generated overall savings even after allowing for the increase in taxi costs. Further taxi fares were claimed by employees as reimbursable expenses but due to the processes involved in making these payments, costs can only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

Departmental guidance requires all staff to use the most efficient means of transport taking account of travel costs, time and incidental expenses, for example, the cost of car parking. The use of taxis, when compared to all the alternatives including public transport, is at times the most cost-efficient means of travel for the purpose of official business. The policy applies to all grades of staff.</p>
