Section 125 of this Act regulates the activities of Ministers in the 28 days before polling day. It is proposed that a referendum on the European Union Constitution would be held under the terms of PPERA, including Section 125. The same rules will apply to other future referendums held under PPERA.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.3/1">It is the view of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that where Section 125 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 applies to a referendum, as in the north-east, the restrictions on publications in the final 28 days do not prevent Ministers speaking and taking part in referendum campaigning where they do so in a personal or political capacity. In addition, by virtue of the Bill of Rights, Section 125 does not restrict Ministers as to what they can say during proceedings in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister issued guidance to all Ministers. The guidance has been made available in the Library of the House. In accordance with this guidance, Ministers made their role clear when acting or speaking in a personal or political capacity.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.6/1">The regulations introduce requirements on electrical safety in dwellings as Part P of the building regulations. They will require that from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> electrical installations should meet the standards in BS7671. Meeting these standards will help reduce the number of deaths, injuries and fires caused by defective installations. Almost all those in the electrical engineering contracting industry already work to the standards in BS7671.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.6/2">The regulations allow private householders to continue to undertake their own work. Where they do so they will need to notify the local authority of work they plan to undertake; the local authority will then be responsible for inspecting and testing the work to ensure that it is safe. It will not be necessary for private householders to notify some minor less risky types of work.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.8/1">The Department of Health fully supports the open source software initiative, and the National Programme for Information Technology has evaluated the suitability of a number of particular solutions for deployment in the National Health Service in England. However, these solutions were not considered sufficiently robust for front-line working across the NHS. An additional powerful consideration in favour of the Microsoft deal is that there is already an installed base of around 600,000 Microsoft-based computers in use in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.0/1">Responsibility for combating binge drinking has not been given to an alcohol industry lobby group. As tasked by the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England the Government are working with the drinks industry at a national level. The voluntary social responsibility scheme for drinks producers will strongly encourage drinks companies to: pledge not to manufacture products irresponsibly; ensure that advertising does not promote or condone irresponsible or excessive drinking; put the sensible drinking message clearly on bottles alongside information about unit content; move to packaging products in safer materials; and make a financial contribution to an independent fund that pays for new schemes to address alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/2">At a local level, there will be new voluntary code of good practice scheme for retailers, pubs and clubs and off licences. This will be run in partnership with industry, police, and licensing panels, and led by the local authority. It will ensure that industry works alongside local communities on issues such as under-age drinking and making town centres safer and more welcoming at night.</p>
