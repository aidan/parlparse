	<p pid="a.43.2/1">It has been the longstanding policy of successive governments not to disclose internal policy advice, including legal advice (exempt under Part 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, &quot;information whose disclosure would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion&quot;). As we have repeatedly made clear, no decision to launch military action had been taken and military action is not inevitable. The Government's view of the legal position was recently set out to the Foreign Affairs Committee and can be found in the FAC's <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-20">20 June 2002</phrase> report on the Foreign Policy Aspects of the War Against Terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.5/1">Peace and security is an essential prerequisite for development in Africa and consequently it has a high place on the agenda of the G8 Africa Action Plan. The plan included a commitment to provide additional support to African efforts to resolve the principal armed conflicts on the continent, including the long-running conflict in Sudan. In support of this commitment, we are working with the US, Norway and Italy in support of the Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD) efforts to broker a peace agreement and a comprehensive ceasefire between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. We are also working with the UN, the World Bank and others, including the EU, on plans for post-conflict reconstruction, dealing with Sudan's debt, and developing a poverty reduction strategy.</p>

The Code for Fiscal Stability requires the government to publish illustrative long-term fiscal projections at least once a year. The latest projections, in Annex A of the 2002 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, show that current public consumption can grow slightly faster than GDP while remaining consistent with the fiscal rules over the entire projection period of 30 years.</p>
