There has been a decrease in the number of proposals for new legislation, from around 60 in 1990 to around 40 in 1998. The number of proposals extant has also fallen, from almost 800 in 1990 to about 500 in 1998. There remains scope for improvement, and the Government will continue to take a leading role in pursuing more effective and proportionate legislation.</p>

The measures on Austria were a signal of our concern over the inclusion of a far-Right party in the government of an EU member state. We consider that the best way of influencing Russia towards more acceptable policies, including in Chechnya, is by developing a dialogue which allows us to be critical when we disagree. The EU has also signalled its concerns over Chechnya by limiting the TACIS aid programme for 2000 for Russia to promoting democracy and strengthening civil society and by co-sponsoring a critical resolution on Chechnya at the UN Commission on Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.0/1">AFSSA's recommendation that the practice of pithing should be banned in French abattoirs was based on its assessment that pithing presents a risk of contamination of the carcass by both nervous tissue, which AFSSA considered a risk factor for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and microbiological organisms. It is for the French Government to consider that recommendation and to take such action as they consider necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/2">On the BSE risk in the United Kingdom, the Government have accepted the advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) that there is no reason to change UK practices of stunning and pithing during slaughter of cattle. In giving that advice, SEAC took into account the measures in place in the UK to protect public health from BSE, notably the prohibition on the sale for human consumption of meat from animals aged over 30 months, as a result of which the number of infected animals at the late stage of the incubation period entering the food chain is now estimated to be very low. There is no rule equivalent to the over-30 month rule in France and it would be quite understandable if a risk assessment carried out in a country without such a rule resulted in different advice. The risk of the introduction of microbiological contamination by pithing rods is small as long as good hygienic practices are followed.</p>

From April 2000 the ratio of discretionary points available for each eligible consultant has been increased to enable more consultants to benefit from the scheme and three extra points have been added to the existing scale, along with the introduction of two new service-oriented criteria, which should allow greater recognition of local service achievement.

	<p pid="a.209.5/2">In February 2000 SEAC considered preliminary evidence suggesting infectivity could be demonstrated in the blood plasma of mice experimentally infected with a mouse adapted BSE agent. The committee noted that the pathogenesis of the disease caused by BSE in mice was different to the pathogenesis of BSE in cattle but more similar to that of TSEs in sheep and humans. Given the difference in the pathogenesis of the disease in cattle and this mouse model, and taking account of the results of bioassays of cattle tissues in both mice and cattle, the committee concluded that there were no implications for the safety of the food chain from these findings. SEAC will continue to review these areas in the light of new scientific evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">A Joint Funders Workshop on TSE Research in the UK was held in Keele (4-<phrase class="date" code="2000-04-06">6 April 2000</phrase>). This comprised a meeting of funded scientists working in the field of TSEs, department/research council officials and five members of SEAC (Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee). Meetings of this type have been held annually by the BBSRC (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council) for a number of years. The first joint meeting with the participation of other funders was held in 1998. The purpose of these meetings is to inform the funding bodies of the progress being made in the work they are supporting, to share results and encourage collaboration and networking between the scientists. The researchers present were funded by one or more of the following funding bodies: BBSRC, Department of Health, Medical Research Council and MAFF. Two international guest speakers were also invited. This was a closed meeting as interim results were presented, and most of the research work discussed was pre-publication. For this reason, a confidentiality agreement was signed by conference delegates. Written reports covering all sessions of the workshop will be circulated to the funders. However, the proceedings will not be published.</p>
