	<p pid="a.51.2/1">There are currently 49 children of both military and civilian staff on the books of the Acorn Nursery in the Ministry of Defence Main Building; there is a limit of 38 full-time equivalent places, but the use of the facility is optimised through part-time arrangements. The facility is delivered through the Main Building redevelopment and office services private finance initiative (PFI) contract with Modus Services Limited at an annual cost of &#163;327,000; annual income is &#163;198,000 and is comprised of parental fees and the nursery education fund grant from the local authority. The current partial subsidy of the parental fees is being looked at as part of a wider review of this facility that will address the requirement for the service and the most effective means for its delivery. The nursery facility was created as part of the overall refurbishment of Main Building completed in 2004; it would not be possible to make a meaningful approximation of the capital costs specific to this area without disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">The Government were very disappointed that the reference to sexual orientation was removed from the UN General Assembly resolution on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions. Prior to the vote on this amendment, we made a statement objecting to the deletion of this reference: &quot;To accept this amendment would be to accept that this particularly vulnerable group of people do not deserve specific mention, perhaps even to suggest that they do not warrant the same protection from killings. To us this suggestion is an affront to equality and respect for human dignity&quot;. We voted against the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/2">We are currently discussing the outcome of the resolution with like-minded partners. While we remain disappointed that the explicit mention of sexual orientation has been removed from language on &quot;killings committed for any discriminatory reason&quot;, we interpret the broad language that replaced it to include these types of killings and will support the text as a whole in the plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/3">The Government continue to oppose violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in all circumstances. We will continue to work bilaterally and through international organisations, including the UN, to promote and protect the rights of LGBT people.</p>

We have already outlined a number of measures to reduce the bureaucratic burden, including removing the time-consuming self-evaluation form (SEF), streamlining the inspection framework and scrapping the complex financial management standard in schools (FMSiS). These changes are just the start of a continuing programme of work to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy so that schools can concentrate on their core purpose of raising standards for all children and young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.5/1">The various definitions of collusion used by the independent figures carrying out reviews and inquiries are already in the public domain-for example, the four Cory reports that are available in the House Library. As I set out in my Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-23">23 November</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-11-23.298"><I>Official Report</I>, col. WA 298</phrase>), it is not for the Government to provide a single definition of the term &quot;collusion&quot;. In relation to the Claudy atrocity, both the Secretary of State and the Deputy Prime Minister issued full apologies that Father Chesney was not properly investigated for his suspected involvement in this hideous crime. Beyond this apology, it is not appropriate for the Government to interpret the ombudsman's report further. I have however placed a copy of the ombudsman's report in the Library of the House. In particular, I refer the noble Lord to paragraph 6.23 of this report, which details the ombudsman's findings about the Government's role.</p>
