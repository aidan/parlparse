	<p pid="a.58.2/1">My right honourable friend the Defence Secretary (Mr Hoon) informed the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December 2002</phrase> (Official Report cols. 45&ndash;7WS) in another place of the receipt of a request from the United States Government to upgrade the early warning radar at Fylingdales for missile defence purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">The Government have encouraged parliamentary and public discussion of the issues involved. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-17">17 October</phrase>, we informed the House of current work in the US on missile defence and on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">9 December</phrase> published a discussion paper inviting interested parties to contribute their views. We have received a large number of responses both from individuals and organisations, and we have considered all contributions carefully. My right honourable friend the Defence Secretary visited North Yorkshire to explain what the upgrade would involve and to hear at first hand the views of local people. We have engaged in initial discusions with the planning authorities. In a Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-15">15 January</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 696&ndash;99) my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary informed the House in another place of the Government's preliminary conclusion that it was in the UK's interest to agree to the US request. He gave evidence to the Defence Select Committee on the same day and addressed points raised by honourable Members in the defence debate on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-22">22 January</phrase> in another place. We welcome the Select Committee's conclusion in its report published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-29">29 January</phrase> that the UK should agree to the upgrade.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/3">In the course of these discussions we have been able to clarify that the upgrade essentially comprises computer hardware and software modification and involves no new development or change to the external appearance or power output of the radar; the radar will continue to fulfil its long-established ballistic missile early warning system (BMEWS) role; it will continue to be operated and staffed by the Royal Air Force, and we will continue to enjoy full access to its data; and the upgrade does not of itself commit the UK Government to any greater participation in the US missile defence programme. It does, however, keep open the prospect of acquiring missile defence capabilities for the UK should we desire such protection at some point in the future. We will continue discussions with the local planning authorities on the detail of the upgrade work.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/4">We are now satisfied that we have been able to take fully into account the views of all interested parties in coming to a decision. We are therefore today replying to the United States Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, conveying the Government's agreement to the US request. We are separately negotiating a technical memorandum of understanding to give British industry the best possible opportunities to win work on the US programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">On the basis of internationally agreed scientific principles, the same toolbox of methods is used worldwide to manage the level of exploitation of fish stocks. For example, limiting the catch, or the number and size of vessels and their fishing days, or mesh sizes, minimum sizes and various other gear restrictions. Closed seasons and areas may also help, but this depends on the biology of the fish. The EU management and stock recovery proposals for the North Sea all belong to this family of measures and are similar in concept to those that are applied in many other parts of the world. Successfully managing the international fisheries of the North Sea is particularly difficult, however, because of the numerous fishing nations and methods and the common occcurrence of migratory species of different sizes on the same grounds. Also, some key North Sea stocks have declined to such a low level that despite experiences elsewhere, there is no scientific precedent for reliably predicting how quickly and effectively they can recover, hence the harsh nature of the current scientific advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/1">The Government are committed to their public service agreement target of bringing 95 per cent of sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) in England into favourable condition by 2010. Some public bodies, as major landowners of SSSIs, are important partners in achieving this target. Public bodies have a duty under Section 28G of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. This requires them to &quot;take reasonable steps, consistent with the proper exercise of the authority's functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of the features by reason of which the site is of special scientific interest&quot;. By the end of March 2003, the condition of all SSSI land in England, including that owned by the Crown, will have been assessed by English Nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/2">English Nature is directly responsible for 62,000 ha of SSSIs, as owners and managers of a large proportion of national nature reserves (NNRs). Seventy per cent of this area is currently on target. By March 2004, English Nature is committed to increasing this percentage to 80 per cent, and 90 per cent by 2006. Within the NNR management budget, money is specifically targeted at recovery projects to achieve improved condition in NNRs currently failing the PSA target. Through this, for example, fen restoration work has been funded this financial year at Bure Marshes NNR in Norfolk, and next year peat bog restoration work will be funded at Roudsea Woods and Mosses NNR in Cumbria. In 2003&ndash;04 over &pound;- million will be spent on recovery projects in NNRs.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/3">The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is committed to protecting and enhancing SSSIs under its control and is currently working closely with English Nature to review factors affecting MoD SSSIs and to develop an action plan for consideration by the Minister's Environment and Conservation Advisory Group (MECAG) to meet the PSA target. This approach is supported by the joint declaration of intent between the MoD and English Nature signed in July 2002. Action has already taken place to address unfavourable condition on many sites. In the last year, for example, the MoD has been a proactive partner in the EU Life partnership on Salisbury Plain, improving the condition of chalk grasslands, and the Heritage Lottery's Fund Tomorrow's Heathland Heritage, which has enabled improvements to be made to many heathland MoD SSSIs in Hampshire, Dorset and Berkshire. Locally, the MoD has over 120 conservation groups covering the defence estate where statutory bodies such as English Nature, and non governmental organisations such as the RSPB and Wildlife Trusts are standing members. Many projects to improve the condition of SSSIs are carried out under the direction of these groups with funding from the establishment budgets or from the rural elements of the estate strategy (REES) project.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/4">Defra and English Nature will continue to work closely with the wide range of organisations that can contribute to achieving the PSA target over the period from now to 2010 and beyond.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.2/1">The grey squirrel is a long-established invasive non-native species which has impacted significantly on native wildlife and also causes significant economic damage. Article 8(h) of the Convention on Biological Diversity places obligations on contracting parties to take action in respect of invasive non-native species.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/2">Research was undertaken into the feasibility of using contraception to control the impact of grey squirrels, with input from the Forestry Commission and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, but this was discontinued in 2002 when the results failed to give the partners any promise of a practical application in a reasonable time-frame. Although laboratory trials of the technique had proved encouraging, enclosure and field trials were inconclusive and highlighted the enormous difficulties of putting such a method into practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/3">Further research on contraceptive vaccines is likely to be extremely costly and the Government have no plans to continue it at present. Nevertheless, we retain a strong interest in non-lethal and humane measures for controlling populations of wild animals that cause problems. Government scientists will keep a technology watch on developments that might offer innovative techniques of wildlife management.

	<p pid="a.65.3/1">Yes. As the noble Baroness knows, the Deputy Prime Minister announced last July that we would be making an additional &pound;350 million available to local authorities over the period 2003&ndash;06 to improve the delivery of planning services. We have now decided the basis on which we will distribute this new Planning Delivery Grant in 2003&ndash;04 and will be informing recipients of their allocations.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/2">The grant is being paid out of additional resources from Spending Review 2002. The aim of the grant is to improve the planning system to ensure the effective delivery of our objectives for sustainable communities which we set out in the document Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future. It is specifically targeted towards meeting the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Public Service Agreements 5 and 6. PSA 5 aims to achieve a better balance between housing availability and demand. PSA 6 requires all authorities to have local development frameworks in place (in accordance with agreed local development schemes) and to meet the best value development control targets by the end of 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/3">The amount of grant distributed in 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;50 million. It will be paid to local planning authorities, regional planning bodies and the Greater London Authority. The grant is a performance reward grant and rewards local authorities both for improvements towards and achievement of best value development control targets in the period June 2001 to June 2002. Those meeting the development control handling targets both at the start and the end of the year are rewarded separately for consistently high performance. No authority will receive an allocation of less than &pound;75,000 in 2003&ndash;04 so that every authority has additional resources to help drive improvement in performance towards the targets. The grant allocations are enhanced for those local authorities within the high housing demand and growth areas identified in the document Sustainable Communities: Building for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/4">Regional planning bodies were notified in December of their share of the &pound;6 million of existing funding which will, from 2003&ndash;04, be paid directly to them. They will also receive a share of the new planning delivery grant for their work on new regional spatial strategies (due to replace regional planning guidance under the Bill) and their review of existing regional planning guidance to take account of the growth area proposals. The Greater London Authority receives grant to assist its related review of elements of the London Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/5">County councils will not receive direct resources from the grant. The counties' planning functions are being changed under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill currently before Parliament. Subject to Royal Assent, county councils will cease to have a duty to prepare structure plans but their resources will not be reduced accordingly. Therefore, while in some cases counties may need to continue with structure plan preparation over the next year and possibly beyond, given the transitional period set out in the Bill, as this function winds down they will be able to take advantage of freed up resources. It will be important that these freed up resources and the expertise available in county councils are retained and used to deliver other county planning responsibilities and to undertake their function as statutory consultees in the preparation of regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks. Counties can be engaged to conduct work related to regional spatial strategies on an agency basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/6">The criteria for grant allocations have been designed to drive up performance in the delivery of planning functions, both in respect of development control and plan making. Authorities should be aware that they will need to continue to secure improvements in performance in order to receive money in further years. Grant allocations are not ring-fenced and authorities have complete discretion in the way they spend this money. Areas that authorities may consider concentrating on include: contribution to the preparation of regional planning guidance and the future regional spatial strategies; completing current reviews of existing development plans and preparing for the new system of local development frameworks; better resourcing of IT systems; assistance from consultants; outsourcing of certain planning services; increasing staffing levels; training for staff and councillors; supporting mediation services; encouraging a more diverse planning workforce; bursaries for employees to gain planning qualifications and more use of technical staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/7">The amounts payable are shown in the tables below.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/8">Letters to all leaders of local and county planning authorities, chief executives of the regional planning bodies and the Mayor of London have been laid in the Libraries of the House. They set out the details of each recipient's grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/9">We will be laying a special grant report before the other place shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.2/1">As this Question covers the work of all three criminal justice departments, I am answering on behalf of my department, the Home Office, and the Law Officers' Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/2">Following extensive consultation with those connected with the criminal justice system and members of the public, in July 2002 the Government published their response to the Auld and Halliday reports in the White Paper, Justice for All, accompanied by an annex, Justice for All&mdash;Responses to the Auld and Halliday Reports. The position set out there remains the Government's position for modernising the criminal justice system over the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/3">The Government's immediate programme for reform is clearly reflected in the Criminal Justice Bill and the Courts Bill, both currently going through Parliament. In parallel, we are implementing a number of administrative programmes across the three criminal justice departments. The main parts of the programme are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/4">Implementation of many of the 55 recommendations in the Halliday Report for review of the sentencing framework for England and Wales: most require legislation and are being taken forward in the Criminal Justice Bill. They include a new sentencing framework, a single generic community sentence, heavier sentences for persistent offending, reforming short custodial sentences, changes to the calculation of remand time, sentencers giving reasons for passing a sentence, licence conditions lasting until the endpoint of sentence, administrative recall to prison, creation of the sentencing guidelines council, and many more.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/5">Activity relating to a handful of other Halliday recommendations which do not require legislation, including: ongoing research into the effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of community and custodial sentences; looking into how best to increase public knowledge about sentencing; an accommodation strategy review being undertaken by the National Probation Service (work has begun on two pilots for intermittent custody); improving pre-sentence reports by introducing a research based offender assessment system (OASys); and the setting up of a Home Office implementation team for the new sentencing framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/6">Reform of criminal evidence and procedures, reflecting the main recommendations of the Auld report: most of these are included in the Criminal Justice Bill and the Courts Bill. The Criminal Justice Bill includes reforms in eligibility for jury service, trial by judge alone, changes in appeal procedures, giving the police some responsibility for charging, changes in the rules for bail, changes in rules of evidence, and many more.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/7">The establishment of a National Criminal Justice Board, administratively, to replace all the existing national planning and operational bodies, reflecting other Auld recommendations. We have already simplified and strengthened the present machinery. The Prime Minister established a Criminal Justice System Cabinet Committee to oversee delivery of the Government's policies for the management and reform of the criminal justice system. This is supported by the National Criminal Justice Board, which includes representatives of all the criminal justice agencies, the police, judiciary and CJS Ministers. Local criminal justice boards are up and running in shadow form and are on target to go live in April 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/8">Legislation to give effect to the Auld recommendations for unified administration of the courts and for court security is being taken forward in the Courts Bill. A programme to create the new agency has been established. Implementation is not expected before April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/9">While the Government have not pursued the Auld recommendations for a unified criminal court, we are effecting closer integration between magistrates' courts and the Crown Court through a package of measures in the Courts Bill. These will bring about the same benefits identified by the relevant Auld recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/10">Creation of a Criminal Procedure Rule Committee, taking forward the Auld recommendations, is included in the Courts Bill and administrative arrangements to set up a full time secretariat are in hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/11">The trilateral case preparation project to tackle the effectiveness of preparation and progression of cases in all criminal courts from charge to disposal. Many of the proposals reflect Sir Robin Auld's recommendations and are being taken forward administratively. Pilots are to be launched in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/12">Judicial personnel issues reflected in the Auld recommendations are being mainly taken forward administratively. They include a national recruitment strategy for lay magistrates to make the Bench more representative of the community it serves (a project board is being set up to take this forward and the strategy will be published shortly); plans to give the Judicial Studies Board a stronger role in magistrates' training (the Courts Bill will result in responsibility for their training reverting to the Lord Chancellor); and setting up judicial appraisal schemes in addition to those in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/13">We have not taken up Sir Robin Auld's proposal that we build a new integrated IT system but are pursuing an alternative approach that reflects the same objectives and advantages of integration. We are implementing over the next three years a major IT and business change programme for which &pound;834 million new money has been provided in our SR2002 settlement. Our approach will join together the existing and developing IT systems in a staged development, using an information walkway to link individual systems. This alternative is consistent with our approach to large IT programmes, as set out in the Cabinet Office report Successful IT&mdash;Modernising Government in Action. This report strongly recommends a modular and evolutionary rather than a big bang approach to IT systems development and integration. Our approach will make sure that money already invested in IT systems will not go to waste and offers the best balance of benefit, cost and risk avoidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.2/1">If the noble Lord is referring to admission to the Bar, then this process is already managed excellently by the profession itself. Governmental involvement would not only be inappropriate, as with entry to any independent profession, but would provide no added benefit to consumers. My role in the appointment of Queen's Counsel, however, is justified because it helps consumers make the best use of the advocacy services available to them. It provides a quality mark which distinguishes those barristers or solicitor advocates who possess outstanding advocacy, legal and professional skills and are specialists in their chosen field.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/2">If the noble Lord is instead referring to the appointment of junior counsel to act on behalf of the Government, then such a system already exists.

	<p pid="a.77.5/1">The new chapter to the Strategic Defence Review set out the potential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) significantly to improve operational effectiveness. UAVs will be a key contributor to network enabled capability and their ability to provide persistent surveillance of the battlefield or theatre of operations, without putting aircrew lives at risk has been demonstrated recently by the US in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/2">The central element of the UK's current plans for acquiring UAVs is the Watchkeeper programme, which will provide UK commanders with accurate, timely and high quality imagery. Watchkeeper will be an advanced system integrating air vehicles, sensor payloads and ground control facilities. It will be joined to the wider command and control network through communication systems such as Bowman, allowing information to be passed quickly, providing commanders with an improved understanding of the battle space and ensuring that military effect can more rapidly be brought to bear.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/3">Four companies were invited to undertake the first stage of the assessment phase and to propose tenders for the second stage. All four submitted strong bids that demonstrated a good understanding of the programme requirements, the technical complexities and the project management requirements. Following detailed consideration of the proposals, on the basis of value for money and demonstration of the potential to deliver the best capability, we have today selected Northrop Grumman ISS International and Thales UK to take forward the remainder of the assessment phase. The Northrup Grumman team includes BAE Systems, Detica Limited, General Dynamics UK Limited, STAYSYS Limited and Ultra Electronics Limited. Thales (UK)'s team includes Aerosystems International, Elbit Systems Limited and QinetiQ.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/4">Both selected bidders have indicated that they intend to complete the bulk of work in the UK, although it is too early at this stage to be precise regarding the full extent of the industrial benefits to the UK. These will be explored further in the remainder of the assessment phase, which will culminate by mid-2004 in the selection of a single successful contractor for the demonstration and manufacture phase. As stated in the SDR New Chapter, we remain committed to accelerating the Watchkeeper programe and an initial capability is planned for early 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/5">The Watchkeeper programme will be complemented by our plans to establish in 2003 a joint service UAV experimentation programme (JUEP). The JUEP will examine the potential of UAVs beyond the bounds of the Watchkeeper programme by enabling personnel of all three services to gain experience of exploiting different UAV systems with different payloads and configurations in a range of conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Mr Ingram) announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-17">17 October 2002</phrase> (Official Report, col. 571) in another place that we had commissioned an appraisal of the initial training of recruits across the armed services and we undertook to publish findings. This appraisal was conducted by two senior officers from outside the personnel area and reported to Ministers. The leader of the study was given a wide-ranging remit and freedom to pursue the study.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">Overall, the appraisal concluded that the department can have considerable confidence in the initial training system. It is administered and staffed by professional men and women with a strong sense of duty and purpose who have proved consistently successful in providing highly effective training for 23,000 recruits a year. Two areas were judged to need addressing. First, the department as a responsible employer needs to continue to ensure that its young people are managed proficiently, treated fairly and given appropriate levels of professional and personal support. Second, the department requires more rigorous assurance mechanisms to provide regular monitoring, to expose risk and to promote best practice. The appraisal concluded that an assurance authority should be established outside the single-service chains of command. Some of these proposals will require extra investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">We are today placing in the Library of the House a copy of the appraisal, together with a departmental action plan responding to all of the recommendations and, where action is not already in hand or planned, assigning responsibility for examining the recommendation and taking it forward. The report is also available on the website: <a href="http://www.mod.uk">www.mod.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">The proposal to establish a new visitor centre is under discussion by domestic committees of both Houses, although I can answer only for the House of Lords. The proposal was considered by the Information Commitee on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-08">8 January</phrase> and by the Administration and Works Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-21">21 January</phrase>. Both committees felt strongly that visitor facilities should be located within the Palace and that a location contiguous to Westminster Hall would be the best option. However, the committees were fully aware of the consequences of losing the W Rooms and of the potential impact on the CPA and IPU. The Administration and Works Committee therefore recommended that the House of Lords should give its backing to the scheme &quot;only on condition that satisfactory alternative accommodation was found within the Palace, and that the Committee and those concerned were given an opportunity to examine the alternative before giving final agreement&quot;. It is for the authorities of the House of Commons to find such alternative accommodation,and we await the results of their deliberations.

	<p pid="a.80.3/1">In July 2000 we announced that we would not be recording postal claims for asylum from persons living in any of the London boroughs and that they would be required to attend for screening before their claim was recorded and processed. Postal applications have also not been accepted in other parts of the country and alternative screening arrangements have been established. Postal claims have, however, continued to be made from some parts of the country: in 2001&ndash;02 they accounted for 7 per cent of all asylum claims, and so far in 2002&ndash;03 they have accounted for 8.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.3/2">As from <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-08">8 February</phrase>, anyone wishing to make an asylum claim will need to do so in person, and postal applications for asylum will no longer be accepted. We expect individuals to make their claim at a port of entry, where they will be screened and any request for support will be considered. Where a person in-country writes in by post, their purported claim will not be recorded. They will instead be advised to apply in person at Croydon or Liverpool. In the very exceptional case where a person is genuinely unable to attend one of these sites, alternative arrangements will be made to ensure that person can be screened and their claim processed.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.2/2">Intelligence has shown that an increasing number of people who have been accepted as refugees elsewhere in the world are coming to the United Kingdom and making asylum applications in false identities. This undermines the integrity of the asylum process, places an unacceptable burden on the system and diverts valuable resources from those in genuine need. This abuse of the system is made easier as under the provisions of the Council of Europe Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees the holders of refugee travel documents issued by some 21 countries may travel to the United Kingdom without a visa. We have therefore decided to suspend the operation of that agreement. This will mean that from 00.01 hours on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-11">Tuesday 11 February</phrase> all holders of refugee travel documents will require a visa before coming to the United Kingdom.</p>

This change will not prevent refugees who are settled in other countries and who genuinely wish to visit the United Kingdom from doing so. They will simply be required to obtain a visa before coming here. What it will do is act as a deterrent to those whose sole purpose in coming to the United Kingdom is to abuse our asylum system.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.3/2" class="indent">1. Limerick Harbour</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/3" class="indent">The main components of the scheme to extend the Shannon Navigation into Limerick City were a 260m long weir, the restoration of the lock gates at Sarsfield Lock and the provision of three sets of floating moorings at George's Quay, Custom House Quay and Arthur's Quay. The effect of the scheme is greatly to increase navigational access and, for the first time, to allow mooring in the heart of the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/4" class="indent">Limerick City Council acted as agents for Waterways Ireland, which had no direct involvement in the running of the scheme. The main contractor was Uniform Construction, and Waterways Ireland's contribution was Stg &pound;1.85 million. The scheme officially opened on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-20">20 July 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/5" class="indent">2. Boyle Harbour</p>

This allows boat traffic to come within easy reach of the town via a new 1250m canal coming off the Boyle river, passing under the recently opened Curlews by-pass road and terminating at a harbour with accommodation for 27 vessels and complete with fully equipped service block, car park and refuse disposal facility. The scheme was mainly carried out by Waterways Ireland's own direct labour force, with specialist contractors being engaged for certain aspects as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/7" class="indent">The installation of a slurry wall was contracted to Pearse-Bachy, the building of the harbour walls to Coffey Construction and the building of a service block to T.H. Construction. The total cost of the scheme was Stg &pound;2.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/8" class="indent">3. Ballinasloe</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/9" class="indent">The Ballinasloe, Co. Galway, scheme, which terminates at a harbour close to the town, facilitates navigation along the Suck river for 16km from the main river Shannon. The work included the dredging of 5km of channel, the provision of a lock at Pollboy, the rehabilitation of a fishery and the excavation of a site for the harbour. The harbour, consisting of floating moorings, caters for 24 vessels and is fully equipped with a service block, water and lighting. The scheme was completed mainly using Waterways Ireland's own direct labour workforce, with the floating moorings supplied by Bancon Marina Systems Ltd. It was opened to boat traffic on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-25">25 May</phrase>, 2001 and cost Stg &pound;1.75 million.</p>

The previous Minister and departmental officials have met with the group to discuss this issue and explain the department's position.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/2">Holywood falls within the remit of the Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan. As part of the plan preparation process, the department has appointed consultants to advise on those locations within the Down Metropolitan Area, including Holywood, which merit special planning protection by reason of their quality and character of the built environment. The draft plan, which is programmed to be published in September 2003, will present the department's proposals. The plan process cannot designate conservation areas as designation is a separate statutory process. However, it will identify areas of townscape character (ATC). Such ATCs can be subsequently considered for designation as conservation areas under the separate statutory process provided by Article 50 of the Planning (NI) Order 1991 where they are of sufficient quality to merit conservation area status.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/3">Downpatrick Divisional Planning Office undertook to carry out preparatory work to shorten the timescale of conservation area designation if this is to be adopted as an appropriate way forward for Holywood.

	<p pid="a.100.1/2" qnum="HL1211">What steps they have taken to protect unlisted buildings in Northern Ireland which are valued by residents as contributing to the character of an area; whether consideration has been given to the removal of VAT on building renovation in contrast to new building work; and whether the increased demands on concentrated development within settlements will result in a change in the criteria for listed buildings.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-02-10a.100.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100688" speakername="Lord Williams of Mostyn" colon=":" colnum="100"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030210/text/30210w09.htm#30210w09_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.100.2/1">The Government are aware of recent public disquiet over the loss or threatened loss by demolition of a number of buildings in Northern Ireland which, while not statutorily listed, were or are valued by local residents because of their age and character and sometimes their associations with noted public figures from Northern Ireland. While such buildings situated outside conservation areas, where control of demolition exists, may not necessarily merit listing, their potential loss often causes great concern to residents. The draft Planning (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, currently before Parliament, which contains provisions to extend control over the demolition of buildings to areas of townscape character, will go some way to allay these concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/2">The order has other provisions in relation to the protection of the historic environment, including higher penalties, possibly involving custodial sentences, for unauthorised demolition of listed buildings and the introduction to Northern Ireland of building preservation notices (i.e. spot listing) to enable the department to respond quickly to protect buildings at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/3">Strengthened enforcement powers proposed in the order will also apply to listed buildings and buildings in conservation areas and will enable the department to take speedier and more effective action against unauthorised works to the historic environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/4">Development plans, formulated as part of the current development plan programme, may contain proposals for new or extended conservation areas or further areas of townscape character.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/5">As regards the removal of VAT on building renovation, the UK maintains its zero rates under long-standing formal agreements with our European partners. Under these agreements, we cannot extend our existing zero rates or introduce any new ones. It is therefore not possible to introduce a zero rate for building renovations.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/6">The department has authority to list buildings of special architectural or historic interest under the Planning (NI) Order 1991 and the criteria for such listing are contained in Annex C (the Selection of Listed Buildings) of Planning Policy Statement 6, Planning, Archaeology and the Built Heritage. The criteria for listing buildings in Northern Ireland are comparable with those used across the UK. The department does not envisage a change in these criteria as a result of increased demands on concentrated development within settlements.</p>
