	<p pid="a.265.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not monitor the location or health of Abdel Baset Ali Al Megrahi. East Renfrewshire was designated as the local authority responsible for monitoring Al Megrahi's health and location because his family lived in Newton Mearns during his imprisonment in Greenock prison. The Scottish Government have informed us that East Renfrewshire Council, as the supervising local authority, is maintaining regular contact with Al Megrahi as required by the conditions of his release licence. It would not be appropriate for the FCO to ask the council for this confidential information.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/2">Should Al Megrahi wish to return to the UK then he would be subject to UK immigration law and therefore be required to apply for an entry visa. Any such application for a visa from Al Megrahi would be considered in the appropriate way including consideration of the seriousness of the offence for which he was convicted.</p>

A first report has found that definitive conclusions cannot be drawn in the face of uncertainty about the alternatives to the cheque that may emerge. A second report has provided an analysis of each of the users who will be affected, proposed a model of the costs and benefits and identified what information is available and the gaps that need to be filled.

	<p pid="a.268.2/1">The Payments Council will reach a decision at the end of 2011 on what additional new cheque alternatives need to be developed. No decision will be made on whether to phase out cheques until these alternatives are in place and are being used by consumers and businesses. The Treasury is monitoring progress.</p>

They may need to be adapted or made more widely available. Emerging solutions include mobile payments, prepaid cards and new forms of online payments. The Payments Council is consulting cheque users to identify where their needs cannot be met by the existing or emerging alternatives.

Until this is demonstrated, there is not a credible and coherent case for abolishing cheques. The Government are keenly monitoring the progress of the cheque replacement programme and are considering whether they may need to intervene to protect vulnerable individual and businesses if there is any threat that cheques may be withdrawn without suitable alternatives being put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.8/1">The Payments Council has announced that a decision on the future of the cheque will be taken in 2016, when a full cost benefit analysis has been completed. The principal criteria for a decision to go ahead are that adequate alternatives should be in place that are available, acceptable and widely adopted. These will be assessed against the availability, acceptance and adoption of alternative payment instruments by users who do not have any other suitable alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.8/2">The Government are clear that any alternative system will need to replicate the flexibility and ease of use of cheques, while improving processing times, and be cost effective. An alternative will need to have been tested in practice and be widely available, widely acceptable and widely adopted by users who do not currently have a suitable alternative. Until this is demonstrated, there is not a credible and coherent case for abolishing cheques. The Government are keenly monitoring the progress of the cheque replacement programme and are considering whether they may need to intervene to protect vulnerable individual and businesses if there is any threat that cheques may be withdrawn without suitable alternatives being put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.5/1">The Court of Protection is part of Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service and deals with applications relating to people who lack capacity, such as appointing a deputy. The Court Funds Office (CFO) is a separate organisation to the Court of Protection. The CFO provides investment and banking administration services for clients whose money is held under the control of the civil courts of England and Wales, including the Court of Protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.5/2">Interest rates are set and regularly reviewed by the Lord Chancellor with the concurrence of the Treasury. In reviewing the rates paid, the Lord Chancellor takes into account a number of factors including-the amount of interest received on funds against the amount of interest paid to clients, the level and mix of funds held by the CFO and administration costs. Taking into account all of these factors, the Lord Chancellor decides on the appropriate level of interest to be paid on funds held in court.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.5/3">The CFO operates in a different way from high street banks and building societies. Commercial banks and building societies currently offer a variety of savings rates and they have many other and different factors to consider when setting these rates compared to CFO. For example, lending to clients (mortgages or personal loans) or investing in a number of different situations (for example, world wide stock markets).</p>
	<p pid="a.273.5/4">Some of these investments generate higher profits enabling the banks to pay higher rates of interest on some products. CFO invests in a different way.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.5/5">Money deposited in court through the CFO is transferred to the Court Funds Investment Account (CFIA). The interest paid to clients is met from interest generated by the money within the CFIA, which is not through loans or other investments. Because of this CFO is not able to pay the higher rates of interest that are available on some high street products.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.5/6">All interest rates carry a trade-off between risk and potential benefits. The CFIA was established to hold and to protect funds awarded by the court, not to be an investment fund that uses the market to try and increase the value of the sum held in court. The special account rate reflects the zero risk of a 100 per cent government backed guarantee on the level of funds. To offer a slightly higher interest rate that competes with the higher interest paying accounts on the high streets would mean making our clients' money more vulnerable to market forces. High street banks can often offset risk against other assets, whereas the CFO cannot ask taxpayers to underwrite investing in financial markets to try and increase the value of the fund held in court. High street banks cannot guarantee they will always be able to offset risk, whereas the CFIA does.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.5/7">The majority of Court of Protection clients are able to remove funds from court. Most deputies will have an order from the Court of Protection allowing them to remove money at any time if they believe it is in the interests of the person who lacks capacity to do so. Other deputies may not have such an order or may have an order that places restrictions on the amount of money they are allowed to remove from the special account. Deputies in this position will need to return to the court to seek authorisation to remove funds from court if this is what they feel is in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity.</p>

The Lord Chancellor will be keeping the rates paid on the basic and special account under review and will make a direction to change the rate when necessary with the agreement of the Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.5/1">The research and evidence division of the Department for International Development (DfID) is responsible for systematically collecting and synthesising evidence and data on international development. This is produced as a global public good available for all users including our own country offices and policy division, to ensure our aid programmes are based on evidence of what works. A number of research projects have been initiated (63), terminated (4), and amended (3) by the division in the past 12 months, though the majority of our research and data collection (over 100 projects) have not been amended that period. A list of the 63 centrally funded research projects that have been initiated by DfID in the past 12 months is available in the Library of the House. Research and data collection is also funded by the regional divisions in DfID to inform their own operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.6/1">In his report, Lord Browne noted that the postgraduate system worked well and did not recommend any changes. However, he also noted the possibility that in future, when graduates are contributing more to the costs of their higher education at undergraduate level, they may be less likely to participate in postgraduate study and so recommended that trends in participation should be monitored carefully. It will be some time before any trends emerge but we agree that it is important to monitor this. We will ask HEFCE to review participation in postgraduate study as part of a longer term assessment and evaluation of the impact of the funding changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.6/2">Currently, there are very little data available about who undertakes postgraduate study and as part of its review we will invite HEFCE to consider what additional data should be collected about postgraduates. We will then revisit the issue of postgraduate funding as we learn more about how the system and students respond to our reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.6/3">The Government value postgraduate study, and are committed to Britain being a leading place to do research. This is why, despite enormous pressure on public spending, the overall level of funding for research has been protected in cash terms in a ring-fenced budget. This will mean continued support for postgraduate research.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.6/4">Research Councils have published their delivery plans setting out how they will deliver their priorities, including funding for postgraduate training. HEFCE is maintaining in cash terms its research degree programme supervision funding, which will support the next generation of researchers at &#163;205 million for 2011-12. HEFCE is consulting on its proposals for reforming the allocation method for postgraduate research funding from 2012-13.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.2/3">Crown Prosecution Service guidance also advises prosecutors on the steps to be taken when prosecuting those who may be trafficked victims. Where evidence obtained supports the fact that the suspect has been trafficked and committed criminal offences while they were under the control of their traffickers or others, the case should be discontinued on evidential grounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.6/1">The Government have no plans to include teaching of the principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the national curriculum. The non-statutory programmes of study for personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education currently provide a context for schools to teach pupils how to recognise and follow health and safety procedures, including ways of reducing risk and minimising harm in risky situations, how to find sources of emergency help and how to use basic and emergency first aid. Pupils learn to develop the skills to cope with emergency situations that require basic first aid procedures, including, at key stage 4 (ages 15-16), resuscitation techniques. Schools often ask external expert organisations such as the Red Cross and St John Ambulance for support in teaching about what to do in emergency situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.6/2">The internal PSHE review, announced in the schools White Paper, will identify the core body of knowledge and awareness that pupils need and how to ensure high quality teaching while giving teachers the flexibility to deliver PSHE in a way that meets the needs of their pupils. Further details will be announced shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.2/1">Under UN Security Council Resolution 1590, United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) is mandated to provide support to the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement. Its mandate authorises it, under chapter VII of the UN Charter, to protect civilians under the imminent threat of physical violence. UNMIS is providing protection for civilians camped near its base in Kadugli. However, the chief responsibility for protecting civilians within Sudan lies with the Government of that country. UNMIS is acting, to the extent possible and practical, to contribute to such protection. It is doing so consistent with its mandate and with wider UN principles.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.8/1">Violence has been carried out by both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The reports of attacks on civilians and aerial bombardments in the Nuba mountains, and in Southern Kordofan more widely, are shocking. The Foreign Secretary publicly condemned all such actions in his Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-15">15 June</phrase>. We are very concerned about unconfirmed reports of the killings of people for their ethnicity, and call on all parties to halt this violence immediately. The latest unconfirmed reports from the UN that we have received indicate that about 60,000 people have fled fighting in Kadugli. Some of these displaced people have turned to United Nations Missions in Sudan for refuge, and are now camping by their gates, we understand others have fled to other areas, including El Obeid. We are working closely with the UN and other agencies to facilitate humanitarian assistance for those affected by the violence.</p>
