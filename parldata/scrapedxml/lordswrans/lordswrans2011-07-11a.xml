	<p pid="a.120.2/1">As part of the Joint Medical Command (JMC), the Defence Dental Service (DDS) is responsible for the provision of dental support to the Royal Air Force (RAF). Stations with a resident population in excess of 500 personnel have a dedicated team of RAF dental branch professionals who deliver a comprehensive service to meet the needs of the RAF. Where there are insufficient personnel to justify a resident team, arrangements are made to provide a visiting service or to access dental treatment from a DDS centre nearby. On occasion this may be sourced from DDS assets within Royal Navy or Army establishments. In all cases provision is made to ensure prompt access to emergency dental care. In common with the dental support provided to the other services, the performance indicators (PI) against which RAF dental services are measured are contained within the Defence Medical Service (DMS) strategic plan. Currently the services provided for RAF stations meet all relevant PIs.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/2">The DDS operates a quality management system for clinicians and dental centres. This process requires that all clinicians are subject to periodic clinical quality assessment by an appointed clinician. All dental centres are subject to annual health care governance assessments using a Care Quality Commission accredited assessment process. This quality management process is managed by clinicians at regional headquarters, monitored by DDS HQ and assured by the inspector general on behalf of the surgeon general.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/3">The healthcare governance assessment results are collated by DDS HQ to identify trends that highlight both best practice and areas for improvement, which can be subject to quality improvement initiatives. DDS HQ also submits to the JMC HQ an annual healthcare governance statement of internal control, identifying on a pan-DDS basis areas of good practice and areas for improvement. In a broader DMS context, DDS results are aggregated with other medical treatment facility results from across the DMS and reported to relevant DMS senior management boards and, if appropriate to do so, to the Defence Audit Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/4">Although DDS healthcare governance assessment results are currently not published in the public domain in the format requested, the Healthcare Commission undertook an assessment of the DMS, including the DDS, in 2009 with the resulting report being placed in the public domain.</p>

Such a survey was conducted in 2008 under the guidance of the chair of the non-executive directors' committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/2">In relation to the banking crisis, the executive and non-executive members of the Court contributed to the analysis of the lessons from the financial crisis, both for the regulators and for central banks. This was reflected in Bank officials' speeches and public evidence to parliamentary committees from the start of the crisis. It also contributed to the previous Government's review during 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/3">The Bank highlighted, in particular, the need for a resolution regime for banks, better regulation of bank liquidity and revised liquidity insurance arrangements that could be drawn without risk of stigmatising the beneficiaries. The 2009 Banking Act gave the Bank responsibility for bank resolution. Temporary arrangements for liquidity insurance, introduced in 2008, were replaced by a permanent liquidity insurance facility in the Bank's 2010 sterling market framework (the Red Book).</p>

	<p pid="a.124.6/1">Until recently EU Regulation No. 259/2008 required each member state to publish common agricultural policy (CAP) payment information relating to all recipients, i.e. to both legal persons (e.g. companies) and natural persons (e.g. individual beneficiaries). However, in November 2010 the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that the publication of data on natural persons in the form required by the regulation should cease. In order to give immediate effect to the judgment, and as a temporary measure, the European Commission amended the regulation (by Regulation 410/2011) such that each member state is now required to publish only the information relating to legal persons.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.6/2">In the coming weeks Defra will publish information about UK CAP payments made to legal persons between <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-16">16 October 2008</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-15">15 October 2010</phrase> under all CAP schemes: i.e. market schemes, the single payment and other direct aid schemes and rural development schemes. CAP payment information relating to natural persons will not be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.6/3">The European Commission now intends to review the legislation with the aim of restoring the former level of transparency about all recipients of CAP scheme funding, while still taking account of the CJEU judgment. The UK will continue to press the Commission to bring forward new legislation that will maximise transparency and openness in the use of EU funds. The UK has consistently supported the provision of information relating to payments under the CAP.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.6/4">The UK CAP payments website, where this data will be published as soon as the data on natural persons has been separated out, can be found at: <a href="http://cap-payments.defra.dov.uk/">http://cap-payments.defra.dov.uk/</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-27">27 June</phrase>, the specific duties regulations were laid before Parliament and most of the information requested is in the regulatory impact assessment published alongside the regulations. On the specific questions, we estimate that the implementation of the new equality duty resulted in a one-off transitional cost to the public sector of around &#163;2.7 million. The new duty is expected to result in a net benefit thereafter to the public sector of between &#163;14 million and &#163;25 million (mid-point estimate &#163;19 million) each year compared to the cost of complying with the previous race, disability and gender equality duties, which had recurring costs of &#163;39 million to &#163;45 million each year. The benefit is a result of reduced bureaucracy-the removal of requirements to publish equality schemes, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/2">We also estimate that around 1,100 full-time equivalent staff were required per annum across the public sector to implement the previous duties. The implementation of the new equality duty will require approximately 500 fewer full-time equivalent staff per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/3">To encourage public bodies to be transparent, the new draft specific duties regulations would require public bodies with 150 or more staff to publish workforce information demonstrating their compliance with the equality duty. However, the draft regulations do not prescribe any particular data to be published and it will be for each public body to decide exactly what information it publishes. We expect all large public bodies to have workforce monitoring processes in place. We therefore estimate that there will be no additional costs to public bodies from this requirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">The government art collection (GAC) has no current market valuation or estimated valuation. An accurate current monetary value of a work of art can be accurately assessed only at the time of purchase or sale, or by professional valuation. The collection is not actively traded, and it would not be a justifiable expenditure of public funds to have the whole collection valued professionally. The GAC contains 13,619 works.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/2">There are 15 permanent staff posts, including 14 full- time staff and two job shares. All but one of these posts is specialist in nature. The GAC's programme budget for the current financial year, 2011-12, is &#163;347,000. This has been reduced from &#163;540,000 (which included &#163;194,000 capital) for 2010-11 and covers transport and installation, conservation, framing, photography, copyright and website costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/3">The GAC's prime and specific remit is to promote British art, history and culture through the display of works of art in the representational areas of over 400 UK government buildings in this country and all over the world. Some two-thirds of the collection's holdings are out on display at any one time. Each year these works of art are seen by many thousands of visitors to these buildings. Because of this unique role, it is not possible to provide a meaningful average annual figure for the number of works that are accessible by the general public.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/4">The GAC runs at least three tours of its premises per month for up 20 members of the general public each time, and take part in the annual museums at night weekend in May and open house weekend in September. These tours take the form of an introduction to the history and role of the GAC and a tour round its premises and a sample of the works of art that are on the premises at that point, which are changing on a constant basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/5">The GAC is currently holding the first in a series of five consecutive exhibition displays at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, to September 2012. These five displays will then tour as a single unit to Birmingham and Belfast in 2012-2013. Since the first display opened in early June 2011, at least 17,000 visitors have seen it. This current display contains 25 works of art, and future displays will feature a further 130-150. The GAC also lends works of art to public exhibitions organised by other bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/6">The GAC has just published the first book about the collection's role, <I>Art</I><I>,</I><I> Power</I><I>,</I><I> Diplomacy: The Untold Story of the Government Art Collection</I>. This illustrates some 125 individual works of art in the collection, plus many contextual photographs. Almost the entire collection is accessible by the worldwide public on a constant basis through the GAC's website, which gives general information about the GAC as well as features on specific aspects of its role (<a href="http://www.gac.culture.gov.uk">www.gac.culture.gov.uk</a>). Additionally, the collection's entire holding of paintings is accessible in the BBC &quot;Your Paintings&quot; website (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings">www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings</a>) operated via the Public Catalogue Foundation (PCF). The PCF published a hard copy volume on the GAC's holdings of paintings in January 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.5/1">Information is not held on which companies supply surgical instruments to which National Health Service organisations. However, a list of companies currently contracted to supply surgical instruments by NHS Supply Chain is provided in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.5/2">NHS Supply Chain contract at a national level on behalf of the NHS, although NHS trusts are not bound to procure goods through NHS Supply Chain. It is estimated that NHS Supply Chain accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of all surgical instruments supplied into the NHS by value. The remaining proportion will be supplied directly through a variety of different procurement models established by NHS organisations and served by many of the same suppliers as supply through NHS Supply Chain. The suppliers under contract to NHS Supply Chain will, though, account for a significant proportion of sales of surgical instruments to the NHS overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.5/3">The principal responsibility for ensuring that regulatory standards are met rests with the supplier. Manufacturers of surgical instruments must ensure that their devices meet the relevant safety, quality and performance requirements laid down in the EU medical devices directive before they are placed on the United Kingdom market.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.5/4">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has a post-market surveillance and enforcement role in the regulation of devices placed on the market in the UK and will assess all allegations of non-compliance brought to its attention. An extensive and well-known system for the user reporting and the assessment of incidents of device failures exists, and if there is evidence that devices placed on the market are not compliant with the requirements of the directive, the MHRA has a range of powers and sanctions available under the Consumer Protection Act to deal with the problem.</p>

Twelve organisations are leading delivery consortia to provide National Citizen Service opportunities for approximately 10,000 young people this year. The Government intend to expand the programme to reach 30,000 young people in summer 2012, the second year of the pilot phase, and have commissioned an independent evaluation to assess the success of the programme and to inform decisions about the further extension of the National Citizen Service. During the pilot phase, the Government are testing the approach in urban, suburban and rural locations, and at different scales to assess the effectiveness of different delivery approaches. The locations of the scheme in 2012 will be subject to the outcomes of a commissioning process for National Citizen Service delivery provision. Funding for the two-year pilot phase has been allocated to the Cabinet Office (Office for Civil Society).

	<p pid="a.144.5/1">The Government take the issue of modern slavery very seriously. The Home Office will shortly be publishing the Government's strategy on human trafficking. It will set out the Government's plan for combating human trafficking, which is a modern form of slavery. This will fulfil a commitment in the coalition programme for government to tackle human trafficking as a priority. The strategy will have four key aims: improved identification and care for the victims of trafficking, international action to stop trafficking happening in the first place, a stronger border at home to stop victims being brought in to the UK, and tougher law enforcement action to tackle the criminal gangs that orchestrate the crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/2">The Government are applying to the European Commission to opt into the EU directive on human trafficking, which will improve co-ordination of our activity in this area on the European level.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/3">While the issue of human trafficking is a Home Office lead, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) supports the UK Border Agency, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and other law enforcement agencies in their work to tackle organised immigration crime, including the trafficking of people. Our migration delivery officers based in a number of posts overseas gather information and report trends. We also manage a cross-government fund that has financed projects to build the capacity of Governments in source and transit countries to identify and prevent human trafficking, to protect victims and to prosecute perpetrators.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/4">The Government are also a strong supporter of the work of the UN Special Rapporteur for Contemporary Forms of Slavery, Ms Gulnara Shahinian. The UK led the UN Human Rights Council resolution to renew the mandate of the special rapporteur in 2010 for a further three-year term. My honourable friend the Minister of State, Jeremy Browne, met Ms Shahinian in December 2010, and the FCO has made contributions of &#163;20,000 in 2010 and &#163;25,000 in 2011 towards her mandate.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">The additional funding for social care has been allocated in two distinct ways, through formula grant to local authorities and from the National Health Service to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">In 2011-12, an additional &#163;530 million was allocated to local government in addition to existing departmental grants for social care. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding was allocated to local authorities through the local government formula grant. Formula grant is not hypothecated for different services and it is therefore not possible to determine how much of the additional funding through local government has been allocated for social care. However, we do receive local authorities' budgeted spend on adult social care through the revenue account data returns in June of each year. These data are publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/3">In addition to funding through formula grant, the Government provided a specific allocation of &#163;648 million to primary care trusts (PCTs) for 2011-12 for measures that support social care, which also benefit health. As part of our planning and assurance processes for 2011-12, we are holding strategic health authorities (SHAs) to account for ensuring that arrangements are in place between local authorities and PCTs for the funding to be transferred and objectives for the investment agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/4">Local authorities and the NHS have been working together to agree how this funding should be best used to support social care services. NHS planning assurance showed that all SHAs had confirmed there were local plans in place to agree the transfer. We will continue to get information on the progress of the money as the NHS financial reporting year progresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/5">In addition to this funding, the Government allocated &#163;150 million to PCTs in 2011-12 to develop local reablement services in the context of the post-discharge support plans submitted to SHAs this December. It is for PCTs and local authorities locally to agree the plans for this funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/6">In 2010-11, by making efficiency savings to central programmes, the department made available an extra &#163;162 million to local health and care services to spend in 2010-11 on front-line services. In addition, &#163;70 million was made available for reablement services in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/7">A copy of the breakdown of the &#163;162 million 2010-11 and &#163;648 million 2011-12 allocations to PCTs for social care has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.2/1">We regularly discuss Zimbabwe with the South African Government and fully support ongoing efforts by President Zuma and SADC to broker agreement on further reform in Zimbabwe and to assist the development of a roadmap to free and fair elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/2">We are aware of South African plans to offer permits to certain groups of Zimbabwe citizens currently resident in South Africa, and to take action to deport illegal immigrants. We have not engaged directly with the South African Government on this issue. We do, however, provide support to civil society groups working on issues of concern to migrants from Zimbabwe in South Africa.</p>
