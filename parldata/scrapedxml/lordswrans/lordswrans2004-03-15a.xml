	<p pid="a.9.2/1">We are concerned by reports that China is not fully implementing its obligations under the UN convention on refugees, by forcibly returning North Koreans without proper consideration of their asylum claims. The UK supports requests by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for access to refugees to confirm that China is keeping to international obligations and regularly calls on China to co-operate with the UNHCR.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/2">The 1951 convention and its protocol of 1967, to which China has acceded, define refugees. The UNHCR determines which populations it considers are of concern. This assessment is carried out independently of resolutions by the UN General Assembly or other bodies. We would not wish to constrain the UNHCR's mandate by using UN resolutions to define populations of concern. However, we remain in close contact with the UNHCR about all aspects of its work.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The Government continue to work, through the Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet, with law enforcement, industry and children's organisations on considering what action can be taken in respect of restricting access to child abuse images.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/2">The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) provides a focal point for reporting material which appears to be illegal. They assess the material and refer any they agree appears illegal to the police for investigation. Where an illegal image is on a website hosted by a UK Internet service provider and they are notified of this fact, they have an excellent record in removing the offending material. Less than 1 per cent of child abuse content reported to the IWF is hosted in the UK. Where the material is produced or hosted outside the UK, arrangements exist for notifying the relevant law enforcement agency and Internet service providers concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/3">While the Internet has increased the transmission and exchange of images of child abuse, it has also provided a valuable opportunity to identify, prosecute, and treat a significant group of child abusers who might never otherwise have come to our attention. This has resulted in a generally increasing numbers of investigations and prosecutions for the making and possession of indecent images of children in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/4">In respect of Operation Ore, I understand that of approximately 6,000 suspects being investigated, to date there have been 1,202 individuals charged and 655 convictions. It is not possible to predict how many more individuals will be prosecuted in the next 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.3/1">Individuals using pharmaceutical products outside the specifications within the market authorisation are not obliged to inform the licence holder of such use.

In preparation for the conflict in Iraq in 2003, the DH understands that personnel deploying to the Gulf region were offered anthrax vaccine in accordance with MoD policy. Variations in use, from the summary of product characteristics, when these occur, are dictated by military-specific risk assessments and are based on the best available medical advice from the Advisory Group on Medical Countermeasures (AGMC). The AGMC is an independent civilian body specifically set up to advise on these matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.0/1">At the end of February 2004, 2,475 sports clubs had applied to the Inland Revenue for registration as community amateur sports clubs (CASCs), 702 of which had been registered. A list of registered clubs is published on the Inland Revenue website, and is updated on a monthly basis. Precise figures for the total number of sports clubs in the UK are not available, although there are over 110,000 but not all will be eligible for CASC status.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/2">The Inland Revenue, in partnership with the Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR), Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite, Deloitte &amp; Touche and others, has held a series of regional seminars to promote the CASC scheme. The Inland Revenue continues to work closely with representative bodies to encourage awareness of the scheme among their members.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has written to local authorities informing them of forthcoming changes to the rating system resulting from the Local Government Act 2003, which include the introduction of mandatory 80 per cent rates relief for CASCs. Local authorities have been asked to reinforce to sports clubs that registered CASCs in England and Wales will receive mandatory rates relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/4">In addition, the ODPM is issuing publicity leaflets through local authorities about the changes to their business rates bills in April 2005 following the Revaluation and Local Government Act 2003. These leaflets include information on CASC eligibility and registration and are being issued to business ratepayers with their 2004&ndash;05 bills.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.0/2">Lottery funding is currently being provided through the World Class Performance Programme (WCPP) to support those winter sports with athletes with genuine medal potential. Currently UK Sport is making lottery funds available to alpine skiing, speed skating, bob skeleton and snowboarding of approximately &pound;490,000. In addition, UK Sport is also providing total Exchequer funding of approximately &pound;580,000 to seven winter sports to support their national governing body (NGB) broader work and associated programmes, as well as modernisation funding for broader NGB development.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/3">It is not appropriate to guarantee levels of lottery funding in support of world class winter sport athletes as this is reviewed annually and future funding is dependent upon performances and the athletes maintaining their position as genuine medal prospects for Turin. Lottery funding could actually increase if winter sport athletes currently not in receipt of funding improve significantly and demonstrate that they can clearly bridge the performance gap to podium in Turin.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/4">In addition, UK Sport will be carrying out a winter sport mid-Olympic cycle review in the summer of 2004 of those winter sports supported by their WCPP, before agreeing levels of lottery and Exchequer investment for the second half of the four-year period through from October 2004 to September 2006. Alongside this review will be a reassessment of continued Exchequer funding of all those winter sports NGB's currently supported by UK Sport.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.5/1">No specific advice is given to beekeepers on the handling of pesticides including those containing imidacloprid, but advice is available to pesticide users via the pesticide label, the code of practice for the safe use of pesticides on farms and holdings, and the spray liaison officer from the British Beekeeping Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/2">All pesticides containing imidacloprid approved in the UK are required to state on the label that the product is harmful to bees and must not be used on crops in flower (where they are pesticides approved for agricultural use) or when bees are present (amateur uses).</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/3">The code of practice advises pesticide users to check for bees foraging or visiting plants before using the product, to follow the pesticide instructions carefully, and to avoid spray drift into foraging areas. It also advises users to spray in the evening, on a cloudy day, or in the early morning so that use avoids those periods when bees are most active.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/4">Provided these products are used in accordance with their statutory conditions of approval, and in line with the code of practice, they should pose no risk to non-target species or the wider environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">On the basis of traffic data collected in 2002, the last year for which figures are readily available, the most heavily trafficked and congested section of the A34 is the section from Didcot, round Oxford, and up to the M40. The highest flow for lorries was between 1300 and 1400 hours on the link approaching M40 (junction 9) where there were 750 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) in total, two-way. Over the whole section, the range of lorry flows for the most congested hour was between 600 and 750 (HGVs), two-way, representing around 13 per cent of total traffic.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/2">Traffic flows for HGVs over a 24-hour period are recorded in a category covering all vehicles over 5.2 metres in length, the majority being HGVs. The average figure for this category on the most congested section of the A34 given above was 520 vehicles per hour. This represent around 19 per cent of total traffic for that 24-hour period.</p>
