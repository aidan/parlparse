	<p pid="a.374.5/1">The UK maintains a constructive and balanced relationship with Uzbekistan. That relationship also takes account of the EU sanctions regime imposed after the tragic events in Andijan (eastern Uzbekistan) in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.5/2">Our main priorities are to support good governance, democracy and human rights. We raise our concerns in a critical but constructive dialogue with the Uzbek authorities in Tashkent and in discussions with the Uzbek embassy in London. In addition, the EU has a comprehensive and results-oriented annual human rights dialogue with Uzbekistan, which includes a focus on the need for further progress in Uzbek promotion and protection of human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.374.5/3">Regional security is also a priority given the potential for instability in the Ferghana Valley (straddling the Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Tajik borders). There are several factors that may contribute to unrest there: growing poverty, a fall-off in remittances, and the relocation of extremists from Pakistan/Afghanistan into central Asia. We believe that Uzbekistan could have an important and positive influence in Afghanistan and more broadly.</p>

	<p pid="a.375.6/1">Our priority is to support Turkmenistan in becoming a stable and prosperous partner for the UK and EU. We are pleased that UK companies are expressing interest and seeking to develop business links in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan can play a key role in the development of a southern corridor bringing gas from the Caspian region to the EU, and help diversification of supply routes to ensure energy security. To that end, we and our EU partners supported Turkmenistan's initiative last year for a UN resolution on the secure transit of energy supplies.</p>

	<p pid="a.376.2/2">The Caspian basin is a region of growing importance for world energy markets. Kazakhstan is set to become one of the world's top 10 oil producers. The UK will potentially be a major importer of central Asian gas. The diversification of supplies to ensure energy security, for example, by the development of a southern corridor bringing gas from the Caspian region via Turkey to the EU, is a key priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.2/3">We remain concerned about human rights and shortcomings in democratic values and the rule of law in many parts of the region. We regularly raise these concerns in our dialogue with central Asian governments and continue to work with EU, Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other international partners to support real reform in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.2/4">Central Asia is important to our efforts in Afghanistan as well as to combating drugs, the spread of religious extremism and international terrorism. With EU and other partners, we are monitoring the risk posed to regional stability by water management issues because of competing demands between upstream and downstream states.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.2/5">We fully support the EU's Strategy for Central Asia. This aims to support the development and consolidation in central Asia of stable, just and open societies that adhere to international norms.

	<p pid="a.377.3/1">If the local authority has concerns about a child&#146;s welfare, it cannot take any action to remove a child from the care of his or her parents or other adults with parental responsibility without first obtaining a court order. The Children Act 1989 sets out the extent of the local authority's powers and the limitations on them in these circumstances. Where there is risk to a child&#146;s life or a likelihood of serious immediate harm, under Section 44 of the Act the local authority may apply to the family court for an emergency protection order (EPO). This would be to ensure that either the child remains in a safe place or is removed to a safe place. The order will be time limited&#151;the EPO may last for up to eight days, providing time for the local authority to investigate the child&#146;s welfare and obtain the evidence it needs to decide whether further protective action is needed, if any. In addition, under Section 31 of the Children Act 1989 the local authority can apply to the court for a care order. As it may take some time for the proceedings to be concluded, the court has power to make an interim care order whenever the proceedings are adjourned. Before making an interim order the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the child&#146;s circumstances fulfil the criteria for a care order i.e. that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm due to inadequate parenting or the child is beyond parental control. In any court proceedings of this type, the court&#146;s decisions must be made in accordance with Section 1 of the Act&#151;popularly known as the welfare checklist.

	<p pid="a.383.3/2">&#147;I am saddened and troubled to learn of the kidnapping and murder of Russian human rights defender, Natalia Estemirova. I share the indignation expressed by the European Union, President Medvedev and human rights advocates at this shocking crime. I extend my deepest sympathies to her family and colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/3">Natalia Estemirova's work in the field of human rights was internationally renowned. We welcome the announcement that a criminal investigation will be led by the Russian Prosecutor-General. We stress the need for a full and thorough investigation, and hope that it will bring to justice those responsible for her murder&#148;.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/4">Our ambassador in Moscow conveyed personal condolences to the head of the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Memorial, Natalia Estemirova's employer. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will make representations to the Government of the Russian Federation about Natalia Estemirova's murder. We will press the Russian Government for a full, transparent investigation, which should be conducted at the highest level. We will also continue to press the Russian Government to ensure a safe working environment for NGOs in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/5">We continue to raise concerns about the safety of human rights defenders and journalists in Russia at every opportunity, including at the bilateral human rights consultations which were held in Moscow on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-16">16 January 2009</phrase>, and at the EU-Russia human rights consultations on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-26">26 May 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/6">The EU presidency issued a statement on the murder of Natalia Estemirova on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-16">16 July 2009</phrase>, which also urged the Russian authorities to investigate the murders of human rights defenders promptly and impartially, and to bring all perpetrators to justice. We will press for the presidency to raise Natalia Estemirova's case during the next EU-Russia human rights dialogue.</p>

Seed of such varieties may be produced and marketed only within their prescribed regions of origin. In most cases, the region of origin will be the UK although regions may be drawn more tightly&#151;for example, England and Wales&#151;to maintain genetic integrity. Seed of conservation varieties listed elsewhere in the EU or in third countries would not be eligible for sale in the UK since this would be outside the regions of origin determined under the Seeds (National List of Varieties) (Amendment) Regulations (SI 2009/1273).</p>

	<p pid="a.388.2/1">The MoD places a very high priority on the welfare of its service personnel and their families. To that end, the MoD has robust procedures in place to support immediate family members of service personnel who are killed while on operations. These procedures are under constant review to ensure that the support provided meets the needs of the recipients and reflect current MoD policy. Families are assigned a visiting officer who acts as the link between the family and the services, assisting with such matters as repatriation, funeral arrangements and expenses, and help with necessary paperwork to procure pensions etc. The visiting officers will also direct the family to the most appropriate internal and external welfare agencies for specific areas of support.</p>

All personnel who qualify for the Deployment Welfare Package have a weekly allowance of 30 minutes&#146; free telephone calls to anywhere in the world throughout the year. Over the Christmas period this allowance is doubled to 60 minutes and over the past two years, the allowance has been further supplemented by an additional 30 minutes donated by the telephone provider, Paradigm, for those on operations. With regard to mail, the Enduring Families Free Mail Service enables friends and families to send packages of up to 2kg in weight out to operational theatres throughout the year. The British Forces Post Office also runs a free package service out to other remote BFPO addresses for the month running up to Christmas. Additionally most deployed personnel are able to access both the internet and the e-Bluey electronic mail system.</p>

There is a balance to be struck in the conduct of operations between the needs of the mission and the need for appropriate periods of leave. Longer tours allow for greater continuity which has many operational advantages but such tours may place greater stresses on deployed personnel. The current tour length of about six months for those fighting on the front line, which is usually broken by a period of approximately 10 days Rest and Recreation, is believed to achieve the correct balance.</p>

	<p pid="a.390.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has a duty to ensure that common law compensation claims are paid at the correct level where there is a legal liability to do so. In exceptional circumstances surveillance might be undertaken to observe the true extent of a claimant's alleged injuries in cases where there is a reasonable suspicion about the veracity of a claim or where medical evidence suggests that the claimant's disability is wholly inconsistent with the type of injury. Claims that are found to be grossly exaggerated are either repudiated or settled at a greatly reduced level of damages in line with the injury suffered and true levels of loss incurred by the claimant. Surveillance should be of no concern to claimants with a legitimate claim and where the alleged injury has not been grossly exaggerated in an attempt to extract higher levels of compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.2/2">About 54,000 claims for compensation have been made against the Ministry of Defence since 2000 from which 284 cases have been subject to surveillance. Such surveillance is not restricted to service personnel, but may be used in any case brought against the Ministry of Defence. In the vast majority of these cases, surveillance proved that the claim was grossly exaggerated resulting in very considerable savings to the defence budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.2/3">No formal consultation was undertaken with ex-service personnel organisations, but lawyers representing claimants bringing cases against the Ministry of Defence are fully aware of the department's policy on surveillance. The average cost of surveillance is about &#163;1,500 per case. The largest amount saved on an individual case that proved to be grossly exaggerated was about &#163;1 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.2/4">This policy relates only to common law compensation claims where the claimant is suing the department, not to the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.406.2/1">The department last directly commissioned research on this topic from Ofsted in April 2005. Ofsted conducted a survey involving 13 local authorities and found that most were aware of a small number of unofficial exclusions, and had mechanisms in place to detect these.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.2/2">However, we also funded TreeHouse, a non-maintained special school in North London, for children with autism, to work with 10 local parent support groups to campaign constructively for better autism services. One of the groups was particularly interested in informal exclusions and TreeHouse decided to survey the parents in all 10 projects. This reported that 55 per cent of parents reported that their child had been illegally excluded at some time.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.2/3">It is difficult to measure the prevalence of informal exclusions due to their unlawful nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.2/4">The department recognises the importance of tackling informal/unofficial exclusions, since they can have serious impact on children's education, particularly if they are used repeatedly or result in the child being removed from education for a long period of time. For these reasons, the department&#146;s guidance on exclusions, to which head teachers and local authorities must have regard, gives an unequivocal message that unofficial exclusions are illegal and should not take place. Additional guidance is available from the department setting out effective practice for local authorities and schools in managing and eliminating incidents of unofficial exclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.408.5/1">Government are taking action to tackle inequality and promoting a fair and equal society and thereby improving the quality of life for disadvantaged groups. Government achievements since 1997 include: significantly improving the employment rate of disabled people, reducing the proportion of disabled people without a qualification, reducing the gap in employment rates for minority ethnic groups from almost 17 percentage points in 2003 to 12.5 percentage points, and lifting 900,000 pensioners out of relative poverty since 1998-99. The Government are building on these achievements through a challenging set of Public Service Agreements.</p>

In addition, the ODA publishes the monitored data for noise and dust each month on the London 2012 website.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.2/3">The ODA does, however, have an extensive monitoring network around the Olympic Park site, but this is focused on construction activity and not road deliveries to the site. However, as the Olympic Park site is within the London low emission zone, all site delivery vehicles must comply with Euro III emission standards. The ODA also encourages its contractors&#146; delivery vehicles to comply with Euro IV standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.2/4">Furthermore, the ODA has committed to ensuring that 50 per cent of materials by weight will be delivered by either rail or waterways, significantly reducing the number of construction-related vehicles from the road network.</p>

	<p pid="a.414.2/1">The Olympic Park has an energy centre which, during Games time, will produce its energy from the combustion of both natural mains gas and biomass with the majority of energy being produced through the combustion of natural gas. There are also separate wood burning boilers which will produce entirely renewable energy and current plans are that these will use wood pellet rather than wood waste.</p>

First, the Olympic and Paralympic Games will provide the opportunity to showcase the shooting events in an iconic London location and raise the profile of the sport. Secondly, there is the reuse of sports equipment and shooting ranges following the Games. British Shooting has recently provided a much welcomed commitment to work with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) to help define and secure the best possible legacy from the Games. The engagement with British Shooting will consider every opportunity, including those that may exist beyond the reuse of equipment.</p>

	<p pid="a.424.2/1">A smart grid is an electricity network that can intelligently integrate the actions of all users connected to it in order to maximise efficiency in delivery of sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. The potential benefits of a smart grid are set out in more detail in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-13">13 July</phrase>. The use of smart meters gives consumers better information and control on energy usage, helping people to manage their energy demand and bills. The rollout of smart meters will be an important step towards development of a smart grid.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/2">The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) published a consultation document on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-11">11 May</phrase> covering a range of issues to be addressed in deciding how smart meters should be rolled out, including the minimum functionality which should be required of smart meters and possible delivery models.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/3">The Government estimate that the additional impact in 2020 of policies in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan<sup>1</sup> (p.96), relative to today, is &#163;76, which is equivalent to approximately a 6 per cent increase to current average household energy bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/4">The transition plan estimates that the additional impact in 2020 of all climate change policies, relative to today, is &#163;92 which is equivalent to approximately 8 per cent of current average household energy bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/5">Bill impacts are dealt with in more detail in the analytical annexe to the transition plan (<a href="http://">http://</a> decc.gov. uk/en/content/cms/publications/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans plan.aspx).</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/6">These estimates of the effects on bills are in 2009 prices, therefore all the increases are in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/7">DECC publishes crude oil, wholesale gas and coal price assumptions for the period till 2030, which are used in the department's analytical work, where relevant. The updated set of future wholesale price assumptions published in May 2009 can be found at <a href="http://www.berr">http://www.berr</a>. gov.uk/energy/environment/projections/recent/page26391.html</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/8">The bill effect figures are based on the scenario 2 oil price assumptions, namely $80/barrel of oil in 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/9">The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan and UK Low Carbon Industrial Strategy<sup>2</sup> (published in parallel) outline a commitment to invest up to &#163;60 million in UK marine energy infrastructure and technology demonstration. We expect that a variety of devices will be tested using the new infrastructure, and that a number of companies will benefit from the proving fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.0/3">The majority of Armed Forces personnel who are injured on operations subsequently recover and return to full fitness. In some cases that can take many weeks or months and because of our successes in treatment and rehabilitation, even in serious cases, it is not always possible to determine in advance whether their injuries will make them permanently unable to deploy.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/4">Even if designated &#147;not fully fit&#148;, many remain fit enough to work in some military capacity and therefore continue to make a contribution to operational effectiveness, often within theatres of operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/5">Wounded service personnel whose injuries affect their ability to perform their duties will generally be referred to a medical board for a medical examination and a review of their medical grading. In clear-cut cases where the individual's fitness falls below the service employment and retention standards, the board will recommend a medical discharge without further delay. In many cases, however, the patient will first be downgraded, to allow for treatment, recovery and rehabilitation. For personnel who do not make a full recovery, the board may recommend the patient is retained as permanently downgraded with limited duties or they may recommend a medical discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/6">Although medical boards recommend medical discharges, they do not attribute the principal disability leading to the board either to service or to previous deployment. A medical board could take place months or even years after an event or injury and it is not clinically possible in some cases to link an earlier injury to a later problem which might lead to discharge.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.3/1">The Central Advisory Committee (CAC) on Pensions and Compensation underwent a review in 2008. As a result of the review the CAC was re-focused to deal with occupational service pensions as well as compensation policy issues, and developed to provide a credible and visible consultative mechanism. The CAC stopped dealing with issues of wider concern to veterans and ceased routine involvement in issues of scheme operation and delivery, where more appropriate mechanisms are in place. The membership of the CAC reflects the role of the committee and is representative of those affected by pension and compensation scheme issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.6/1">This Government continue to act to ensure that viable small businesses are able to access the finance they need to assist them during the current economic downturn and to invest in the future. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.434.6/2">the Chancellor's Lending Panel of the major banks and Ministers monitors the flow of lending and recommends action to increase lending where necessary; we have secured binding agreements to expand availability of credit with Lloyds Banking Group (&#163;11 billion in net business lending) and Royal Bank of Scotland (&#163;16 billion in net business lending) both over the 12 months from March 2009. In total, UK banks have made public lending commitments to increase lending by an additional &#163;50 billion;we have brought together the banks and small business representative bodies at the Small Business Finance Forum chaired by Peter Mandelson. The forum, which meets regularly, monitors the overall availability, sector impact and price of lending. We have found this to be a very useful real-time feedback mechanism;we also launched the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) in January this year. Designed to lend to viable businesses at the margins of commercial lending, EFG continues to facilitate lending that would otherwise not be available. Latest figures show that over &#163;706 million of eligible applications from 6,217 firms have been granted, or are being processed or assessed.</p>

These figures may include occasional minor spend through COI by NHS organisations, to supplement national campaigns in their area. While this expenditure has been excluded as far as possible so that this chart reflects central departmental spend, it would incur disproportionate cost to validate that every item of NHS expenditure has been removed.</p>

In Afghanistan, we deploy uniformed mental health nurses to provide in-theatre care and treatment for our personnel. If personnel need to leave the operational environment, then their care continues either on an out-patient or in-patient basis in the UK.</p>

The DCMH mental health teams comprise psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available (including psychological therapies, environmental adjustment and medication) where appropriate. The Ministry of Defence mental health services have particular expertise in treatments for psychological injury.</p>

The MoD intranet web portal contains information on health promotion and includes specific advice to employees on how to reduce stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.5/5">Responsibility for identification of the factors leading to stress rests with business areas, and line managers are required to adapt the culture of their business to reduce stress levels. This includes maintaining a zero-tolerance approach to bullying and harassment.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.5/6">We provide guidance and training for managers and supervisory staff in good management practices, as well as specific training on managing stress and recognising stress in others, some of which is delivered by our own business training organisation.</p>

The NHS met this target on time and since then has continued to reduce levels of MRSA bloodstream infections. The latest quarterly figures (Q4, 2008-09) show that there has been a 64 per cent reduction in MRSA bloodstreams infections compared with the 2003-04 quarterly average.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/4">The 50 per cent target was set nationally, not at trust level, as the number of MRSA bloodstream infections in individual hospitals can be very small, even zero. In such cases, it would not be realistic to expect trusts to achieve a 50 per cent reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/5">The 2009-10 operating framework recognised that some variation in performance on MRSA bloodstream infections exists across the NHS, and required those trusts with continuing high levels of preventable MRSA bloodstream infections to address this.

	<p pid="a.459.0/1">EU air quality limits are already met across 99 per cent of the UK (land area). For the very small parts of the UK where limit values are not yet met, roadside locations in our most densely populated urban areas, including London, present the greatest challenge. Right across the EU, new vehicle engine standards have not delivered improvements as quickly as was anticipated. Furthermore, our understanding of the way in which emissions relate to measured concentrations of air pollutants has developed, showing that earlier projections for improvement were over estimated. For these, and other possible reasons which are currently being investigated, ambient air quality concentrations have not fallen in line with emission reductions.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.0/2">Therefore, the UK, like most other member states, is using the provisions under Directive 2008/50/EC on Ambient Air Quality and Cleaner Air for Europe to secure from the European Commission the additional time available to meet the limit values for particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The additional time will enable current and planned measures to take effect. Subject to agreement by the European Commission, the directive permits an extension for PM10 to 2011, and for NO2 postponement of the attainment date to 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.3/1">Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where a local authority considers that one or more of the air quality objectives, as prescribed in regulations, is unlikely to be met by the required date, it must declare an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) covering the area where the problem is expected. It must then draw up an action plan setting out the measures it intends to take in pursuit of the air quality objectives in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.3/2">A list of those Greater London boroughs that have declared an AQMA, including details of the pollutants concerned, is shown below. A full list of UK AQMAs is available from the UK Air Quality Archive at <a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk">www.airquality.co.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.472.1/1">Indeterminate imprisonment or detention sentences for public protection (IPP) were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

	<p pid="a.472.4/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-09">9 September 2009</phrase>, 162 prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence for public protection were recorded as having a tariff of two years or less. This figure excludes those who have been released and who were subsequently recalled following the revocation of their licences. The average amount of time this group has been held in prison beyond the expiry of their tariff is 244 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.4/2">The Ministry of Justice publishes projections of the future prison population. IPPs are modelled as part of the latest projections (published on the Ministry of Justice website, copies are in the House Libraries). The population of prisoners serving IPPs who are past their tariff is not separately modelled as part of the published prison population projections.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.4/3">It is difficult to model the IPP population with great accuracy because of the recent changes made to the sentence in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. The population is estimated to rise to around 5,400 by around 2011 and to stay more or less level after that. However, small changes to the rates of receptions for such long sentences as IPPs have large impacts on the prison population, although the impacts will not be felt for many years.</p>

	<p pid="a.475.2/1">The Government accept that it is important for all prisoners to have parole hearings at an acceptable time and as such is working with the Parole Board to increase the resources available to them. The board&#146;s budget has been increased by 18 per cent for 2009-10, and a recently concluded recruitment campaign has seen 35 new members appointed to the board. A new parole process was set up on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase>, which includes robust performance monitoring for all agencies contributing to the parole process; each agency involved in the process is committed to making the process work more effectively and to using appropriate levers to improve performance. The Parole Board rules have also been amended to allow the board greater flexibility in its use of its membership resources to deliver hearings, and the chair of the board is working with the management team to identify ways in which procedures can be made more efficient and hearing times more productive. The additional net cost of these measures is estimated at &#163;2.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.0/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-08">8 September 2009</phrase>, there were 1957 prisoners serving indeterminate sentences of imprisonment for public protection recorded as being beyond the expiry of their tariff.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/2">The most recent calculation of the average cost per year of prison places was in respect of the year 2007-08 and was &#163;39,000 per prisoner per annum. However, the actual cost of each prisoner will vary considerably. To give an accurate estimate of the cost of detaining this specific group of prisoners post-tariff would require a manual examination of each case and as such, would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/3">Data on the number of prisoners held in prison beyond the expiry of their tariff is held on the Public Protection Unit Database (PPUD) within the National Offender Management Service. As with any large scale recording system, it is subject to possible errors arising from either data entry or processing.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/4">The tariff is the minimum period specified by the court to be served by the prisoner for the purposes of punishment and deterrence. Whether a prisoner serving an IPP sentence is suitable for release once his tariff has expired will depend on whether the independent Parole Board judges that the risk of harm which he presents may be safely managed in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/5">In 2007/08, 2008/09 and 2009/10, the National Offender Management Service allocated an additional &#163;3 million to improve the completion of assessments and access to interventions for IPP prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.3/1">Funding for rehabilitative work is part of establishment baselines and cannot be readily disaggregated. Estimates of additional costs and resources could therefore currently only be obtained at disproportionate cost by analysing the files of all prisoners serving indeterminate sentences, assessing and then costing what rehabilitative work was already in place and what further provision if any may be required. Similarly the costs in preparing for parole hearings and any administration cost for courses are included within prison baseline budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/2">An additional &#163;3 million allocation was made in 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 to establishments to support work with this group of prisoners, with a view to ensuring that assessments are made on time and to improving access to interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/3">A new streamlined process for assessing and managing Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection prisoners (IPPs) through the implementation of offender management for IPPs has been introduced, along with revised categorisation and allocation procedures for adult male IPPs. This has facilitated quicker progression to the training estate as well as access to the range of interventions available in training establishments. Action has also been taken to prioritise indeterminate sentence prisoners particularly those with short tariffs. Moving these offenders away from the previous lifer processes has also led to improvements in sentence planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/4">Improved arrangements for the management of offenders generally have also been introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>. The responsibility for the commissioning of services including offending behaviour programmes now rests with directors of offender management in each region. It is for them to commission services that meet the needs of offenders and the requirements of sentencers in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/5">An extensive programme of further work is underway within the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) to support the commissioning of services to better meet the needs of offenders and maximise resources including:</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/6">an assessment of the needs of indeterminate sentence prisoners;a specifications, benchmarking and costings exercise which will provide information on the cost of interventions delivered and help to utilise resources more effectively;a review of programmes delivered across prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/7">NOMS has put systems and procedures in place to facilitate indeterminate sentence for public protection prisoners appropriate progression through the prison system, and will continue to monitor outcomes to ensure further improvements in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/8">The benefits of moving prisoners through the system are fully recognised.</p>

	<p pid="a.486.5/1">The June 2009 consultations by the Department for Transport on the High Speed 1 charging framework and by HS1 Ltd on the High Speed 1 network statement and related arrangements were the culmination of a series of consultations about the High Speed 1 access and charging arrangements which began in October 2007. That preliminary consultation and those launched in September and October 2008 offered consultees three months to consider the documentation and to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.5/2">The decision to reduce to one month the period for responding to the June 2009 consultations was taken in the light of those earlier consultations. It was designed to provide for the early execution of the access contracts being sought by the passenger train operating companies using the railway.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.5/3">There are several systems in place to aid compliance with the Code of Practice on Consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.5/4">Consultation co-ordinators in departments work with policy officials to help them run consultations that are in line with the code. Officials in the Better Regulation Executive in BIS also work with departments on the development of many policies and are therefore often sighted on draft consultation documents where any potential deviances from the code might be spotted.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.5/5">Transparency also plays a significant role in aiding compliance. In accordance with the code (criterion 6.6), consultation documents cite the criteria of the code and give the contact details of the departmental consultation co-ordinator so that he or she can be contacted by anyone who feels that the exercise is not in line with the code. Moreover, departments are required, in the better regulation chapter of their annual reports, to describe their consultation activity over the year and the compliance of their consultation activities with the code.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.3/1">When the work capability assessment was brought in to replace the personal capability assessment in October 2008, the mental health component was redesigned to ensure that it is up-to-date and evidence-based and deals effectively with the problems and needs of those with mental health problems. The new assessment ensures that people with mental health conditions are better identified and that their problems and needs and the support they require are correctly assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/2">Specifically, the work capability assessment includes a more extensive assessment of mental function, assessing the effects of a range of conditions such as learning disabilities or mental illness. To do this, a claimant is judged against a series of activities which correspond to mental functions which may be necessary to any workplace, such as execution of tasks or coping with change. The extent to which a claimant can complete any of these activities is measured against a series of graded descriptors. The same scoring system is applied to mental function and physical function, to ensure that the assessment is balanced across the two sections.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.2/1">Training related to human rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child&#151;UNCRC&#151;is available for a wide range of professionals working with children. The Children's Workforce Development Council&#151;CWDC&#151;have a remit to ensure that those who work directly with children and young people have the best possible training, qualifications and support, covering about 500,000 workers, including early years and childcare, education welfare and social care for children and young people. The CWDC has adopted the convention in its entirety to underpin its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/2">The UK Border Agency has in place a programme of training for immigration officials. Officials are required to undertake e-learning training module which raises their awareness of child protection and welfare issues and which relates these issues to their work. Immigration, nationality and border control officials who deal with applications involving children receive training which deals in depth with children's safeguarding and welfare. Specialised training is provided for those officials whose work involves activities such as interviewing children, escorting children and immigration law enforcement work with children and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/3">The Government have placed in the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 a requirement for the UK Border Agency to make arrangements to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in carrying out its functions. Where it is necessary, training material and courses are being revised to take account of this new duty which comes into effect later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/4">The Government support initiatives aimed at raising awareness of the UNCRC, such as the development of a curriculum resource for teachers on the UNCRC to be used with key stage 3 pupils. The Right Respecting School Award&#151;RRSA&#151;pilot in some schools aims to provide teachers and children with an understanding of children's rights by aligning the principles of the UNCRC closely to everyday life in the classroom and school.</p>
