	<p pid="a.72.0/1">Under the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999, employers, including those responsible for the safety of civilian workers in the nuclear industry, are required to have arrangements in place to keep radiation exposures to all workers as low as reasonably practicable below the relevant statutory dose limits. These limits, which are based on international standards, are set at levels far below those at which genetic damage might be expected. Hence there is normally no need for genetic damage to be assessed.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.3/1">The Government's methodology for identifying countries as fragile or conflict-affected captures a wide range of political, social, economic and security factors. Our recently published Building Stability Overseas Strategy, laid in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-19">19 July 2011</phrase> and available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>), is the first integrated cross-government strategy to address conflict issues. It sets out our definitions of stability and conflict. In fragile states, mechanisms to channel conflict are weak, illegitimate or dysfunctional, so violence becomes the primary mechanism to resolve conflict. Our new early warning system, also outlined in our strategy, will take a global view of countries in which political, economic and security shocks could trigger violence. This will be underpinned by all-source analysis from across Government and external experts. We will consider whether early warning signals demand a UK response and, if so, set the necessary action in motion.</p>

We are working with partners to build consensus on a way forward that recognises the progress the Palestinians have made on their state-building efforts, that meets Israel's legitimate security concerns, and that avoids confrontation in the UN.

Teams have worked closely to develop guidance for DfID, FCO and UKTI staff to provide information on aid-funded business opportunities and to promote the effective use of business networks in developing countries. In Uganda, joint UKTI and DfID work has led to an oil engagement strategy to ensure the effective, transparent and accountable use of oil resources; and in Vietnam DfID's work on improving the business policy environment has drawn on UKTI experience to facilitate the inflow of foreign direct investment.</p>

Where these crimes may be taking place, it would be for the UK and other members of the international community collectively to decide what form of intervention would be achievable or appropriate.
