	<p pid="a.118.0/1">The CRC energy efficiency scheme is intended as a catalyst for action, and designed to address specific barriers to implementing energy efficiency measures by participants. One of these barriers is the split of responsibilities between landlord and tenant. The CRC addresses this, by making the landlord responsible for the emissions in CRC where the landlord is responsible for the energy supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">If tenants draw their energy direct from a licensed supplier (rather than a landlord), they are assessed for CRC energy efficiency scheme participation directly. If they are supplied with energy by their landlord they count towards the landlord's CRC energy efficiency scheme assessment. The incentives to improve energy efficiency in the CRC are targeted at those paying a licensed supplier for the energy used. This is in line with climate change agreements (CCAs), where those eligible choose to agree an energy efficiency improvement target with Government and subsequently meet that target are eligible for paying a reduced rate of climate change levy. CCAs are a voluntary scheme and Government do not advise individual companies or installations on whether to enter into a CCA, as that is a matter for each organisation to consider.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.5/1">The Minister for the Cabinet Office asked Martha Lane Fox, in her role as Digital Champion, to review the Directgov website to ensure that the Government are making the best use of its online presence. In undertaking this review Martha Lane Fox decided that she could not review Directgov in isolation since it was necessary to look at how the Government can use the internet both to communicate and to interact better with citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/2">The review takes into account significant changes in the internet and the behaviour of users in the last few years. A number of recommendations were made about the role of Directgov and the way that the Government publish on the internet. Many of these recommendations build on and accelerate the existing work to rationalise the number of websites run by Government. The intention remains to reduce the number of websites and wherever possible to place content on Directgov, Businesslink.gov.uk, or NHS Choices. Departments will determine the best website to publish their content and the nature of that content.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/3">There are, however, advantages to be found by rationalising content onto a limited number of websites wherever possible. These include the Government's ability to ensure that all content is accessible and usable across an increasingly wide range of technologies, and assurance of meeting statutory, best practice, or industry standards on accessibility. This can also help in expressing things in plain English that citizens and businesses can understand and in improving online services so that citizens can complete their transaction with ease. It is also easier to manage the syndication of content to relevant third party providers, whilst ensuring standards are adhered to and engendering trust with service users.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/4">Wherever content is published, the content remains the property of the supplying organisation. Since it is their content, these changes will not lead to any censorship, nor have any impact on the independence of the supplying public body.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.2/1">The Minister for the Cabinet Office has invited government departments to consider which of their websites are absolutely essential to be kept open for the purpose of meeting their business goals. Websites that departments no longer need will be closed, thereby reducing the total number of websites owned and operated by Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/2">As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-01">1 December</phrase> there were over 800 central government websites, but more websites are being discovered. This makes it confusing for citizens and businesses to find the services and information they seek. The cost of managing large numbers of websites and maintaining their contracts is too high and the Government are committed to increasing efficiencies wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/3">Departments were asked to respond by the end of December. It is therefore too early to estimate the likely costs of making these changes because the full scope of the changes is not yet known.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/4">However, transfer costs are a small proportion of the overall costs of keeping so many websites open, which are unacceptably high. The Minister for the Cabinet Office said in June that he wanted to see costs cut by up to 50 per cent, and transferring from multiple websites to Directgov, Businesslink.gov.uk, and NHS Choices will help to cut such costs.</p>

No fragile country has yet achieved a single millennium development goal (MDG). Half of children who die before their fifth birthday are in fragile states. We will not meet the MDGs or the needs of the poorest unless we do more to deal with conflict and fragility directly. This means addressing the root causes of conflict and fragility; supporting an inclusive political system that builds a closer society; and strengthening government's ability to deliver security, justice and economic opportunity. This is vital to improving the lives of the poorest.</p>

To date, there have been no self-funded schemes and in all cases direct government investment has been sought. An assessment is made of the costs, benefits and affordability of reopening and a decision is taken by Ministers on whether to fund. There are no current plans to review this process.

	<p pid="a.150.2/1">Though there are many examples of using prices to affect behaviour change-such as lower taxes on unleaded fuel to encourage people to switch away from leaded fuels, or the reduction in smoking due to higher duties-the use of incentives to encourage people to abandon unacceptable behaviours is much more problematic.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/2">The recently published public health White Paper promotes the wider use of behavioural approaches to healthy living, giving local areas more control over budgets to try out different approaches. The use of incentives in health improvement interventions is a newly emerging area with a limited evidence-base and its value is not yet conclusive. In selecting the health improvement initiatives they will implement, local areas will need to consider the range of cost-effective evidence-based interventions available to them and tailor these to the needs of their local populations.</p>
