	<p pid="a.291.2/1">The Government's position is that any changes to local boundaries of responsibility should be focused on local government boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/2">In the case of secondary schools, it would be possible for local education authorities (LEAs) to review catchment areas for which they are the admission authority, but this is not for all schools. Foundation and voluntary aided schools set their own admission arrangements. Where they are the admission authority, LEAs would need to consider a range of issues, such as the number of places in the school, the number of children living in the area, access to other schools, when they set catchment areas. Not all LEAs designate catchment areas for their schools, but use other criteria such as distance from the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/3">The organisation of social work is determined locally. With the advent of children's trusts, with their accent on integration of services to focus on the needs of individual children and families, social workers and child care specialists will be brought together in multi-disciplinary teams. They will work with many other professionals, including those in youth offending teams, and could be based in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/4">Section 39 of the Crime and Disorder Act places a duty on local authorities (in co-operation with chief officers of the police, probation committees or health authorities within their areas) to establish one or more youth offending teams. Demarcation of the catchment areas of youth offending teams (YOTS) and alignment of those areas would therefore be reliant on the independent decision of local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/5">Paragraph 5 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 states that the various areas of the National Probation Service (NPS) should be aligned with the Police Service, in order for it to perform its functions. Therefore police and the NPS are already aligned and are not aligned with the other mentioned bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/6">Paragraph 6 of the Act does allow for the alteration of the division of areas from time to time, by order of the Secretary of State, but this would not mean that the police would change their boundaries. The structure of basic command units within police forces is a matter for the chief constable rather than central government. However, many forces have recognised the benefits of co-terminosity with local authorities. As a result many have now reviewed the boundaries of their basic command units and where possible have sought to align them with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/7">While it might be desirable to try and align boundaries as far as possible, differing service delivery areas and accountability mechanisms can make it difficult to co-ordinate closer alignment in all areas. Improvement in delivery is being undertaken with local partnerships, such as Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) and Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs), which bring together those responsible for delivery of a number of services including family care and crime prevention. We are working with partnerships to bring benefits through the better co-ordination of delivery and the reduction of bureaucracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.2/1">Magilligan Prison in Northern Ireland launched a child-centred visits scheme in partnership with the Probation Board for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders in September 2001. The scheme was recently extended to include &quot;Big Book Share&quot;. Maghaberry Prison plans to operate two child-centred visits pilots later this year for female and life sentence prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/2">Prison Service policy within England and Wales is to encourage establishments to offer extended children's visits, where possible. An increasing number of prisons offer these visits, which assist imprisoned parents in maintaining their parental role, however, provision remains at the discretion of governors and is dependent on operational and resource considerations. Information on the establishments which offer child centred visits is not collated centrally by the Prison Service of England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.2/1">The Metropolitan Police Service has developed Project Sapphire in order to improve rape investigations and enhance the care given to victims of rape across London. The Project Sapphire sexual offences database holds data on allegations of rape and indecent assaults at entertainment venues, including public houses and nightclubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/2">The data shows that over a 21-month period (January 2002 to September 2003), 70 rapes were committed within entertainment venues. This represents two per cent of the total rapes reported during this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/3">The provision of security within entertainment venues should always be of concern to the management of that venue. If licensed premises are currently giving rise to criminal activity of any kind, which a licensee is unable to prevent, it is open to the police or any other person to ask the licensing justices to consider revoking the alcohol licence for the premises. It is therefore in the interests of any licensee to co-operate fully with the police to prevent serious crime of this kind. Under the Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, all holders of premises licences will be under a duty to take steps to prevent crime and disorder and assure the safety of the public on the premises, including compliance with associated conditions. If a premises licence holder fails to do so, it would be open to the police to seek a review of the licence, which can lead to the imposition of new conditions or, in serious cases, to the revocation of the licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/4">The Security Industry Authority (SIA) is to license door supervisors on a rolling geographical programme, starting with a pilot in March 2004. To obtain an SIA licence, door supervisors will be required to meet certain competencies (achieved through training programmes), and pass a criminality check through the Criminal Records Bureau. By raising the professional standards of door supervisors, SIA licensing will contribute to a safer environment for all customers in pubs and clubs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-19a.294.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="294"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119w02.htm#31119w02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.294.6/1">Reliable data on trafficking is extremely scarce, with the result that it is very difficult to make a comparative analysis of either the phenomenon itself or of the various counter-measures that have been introduced against it. The involvement of organised crime organisations complicates matters significantly further from a research perspective. However, the following three initiatives or sets of initiatives may be of relevance:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/2">(1) Reflex</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/3">The most important development in terms of enforcement in the UK was the establishment of Reflex in May 2000. Reflex is a practical multi-agency task force on organised immigration crime, which includes people trafficking. The task force is led by the National Crime Squad (NCS), and brings together all the key agencies involved in combating the problem. This includes the Immigration Service, the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), the security and intelligence agencies and key police forces including the London Metropolitan Police, Kent Police and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/4">In strengthening enforcement, the work of Reflex is aimed at building up the intelligence picture, co-ordinating operations and providing a focal point for the operational response to organised immigration crime. Reflex also provides both the information and the means to disrupt and dismantle the activities of organised crime groups involved in these activities. The task force is based around joint working between police and immigration, as well as between different countries on trafficking routes. The work of Reflex is both national and international. Overall, the Reflex strategy encompasses an end-to-end approach&mdash;it sees the phenomenon of organised immigration crime as one to be tackled in source and transit countries, EU, UK borders, UK-based facilitators, as well as through financial investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/5">An internal review is currently being conducted on the contribution of the core agencies to the Reflex objectives. This review is for internal management purposes only and is not available for wider dissemination.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/6">(2) Nigeria&mdash;Italy</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/7">A programme of action against people trafficking in minors and young women from Nigeria into Italy for the purposes of sexual exploitation is currently being carried out as a joint initiative between UNICRI (United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The project has been funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has been formally approved by the Nigerian Ministry of Justice on behalf of the Nigerian Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/8">The project envisaged four parallel activities to be carried out in both countries:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/9" class="indent">(i) Research&mdash;collection and analysis of information about trafficking practices and existing counter-responses in Nigeria and Italy;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/10" class="indent">(ii) Institutional Capacity Building&mdash;creation of task forces in Italy and Nigeria to formulate guidelines to improve bilateral co-operation and establish mechanisms of information sharing and collaborative learning between the two countries;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/11" class="indent">(iii) Prevention&mdash;design and implementation of awareness-raising campaigns at a local level; and,</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/12" class="indent">(iv) Assistance&mdash;design and implementation of activities to support NGOs, associations and local departments involved in assistance for the victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/13">It is anticipated that the project will be completed March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/14">(3) Drugs</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/15">The market for illicit drugs is structured in much the same way as most other commodity markets. Very roughly there is an import or wholesale level (upper) a distribution level brokering between wholesale and (middle) a consumer supply level (lower). Interventions against traffickers in drugs are aimed very separately at these different levels of the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/16">There is considerable activity aimed at reducing upper level <sup>1</sup> drug trafficking. For example, from April 1998 to the end of March 2003, the National Crime Squad recorded 1,490 operations (most of which involved drug trafficking) resulting in some:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/17">1,300 groups being disrupted or dismantled;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/18" class="indent">4,600 arrests were made, more than two thirds of which (67%) resulted in charges;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/19" class="indent">&pound;140,000,000 criminal assets identified; and</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/20" class="indent">118 tonnes of drugs seized.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/21">Other UK agencies recorded additional outputs (the biggest seizures being made by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise). All UK law enforcement agencies (LEAs) work closely with those of other countries in transit and source zones.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/22">The Home Office is currently in the process of evaluating actions by the Merseyside Middle Market Drugs Unit and the regional task force of Operation Tarian (involving the police forces of Dyfed Powys, Gwent and South Wales) who are developing interventions against middle market drug dealers. Results should be available in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/23">Studies into the actions against the consumer level of the market are comparatively well researched. There is British work by Edmunds et al <sup>2</sup> (1996) and Best et al <sup>3</sup> (2001) for example, while European comparative work on retail/local/city markets has recently been conducted by Paoli et al <sup>4</sup> (2002) and Gruppo Abele/Massard et al <sup>5</sup> (2003).</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/24">The Drug Markets and Supply Section within the Drugs and Alcohol Research Programme continues to expand the evidence base in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.6/25" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> For the purposes of this review, upper level trafficking is taken to include source zone traders' relationships and transactions, including wholesale distribution within the source countries; export, international transit, entry into Europe and the UK; and connections downwards to city level. It excludes typically small-scale peasant cultivation of plants (such as opium poppy and coca bush); and, at the other end of the chain, exclude retail sale and transactions immediately above retail.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.2/1">There are no current plans to hold a public inquiry into the case of John (known as Joe) Scholes. More generally Paul Goggins is considering whether from a future date the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman should provide independent scrutiny of all deaths in prison custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/2">Any death in custody, particularly that of a young person, is a terrible tragedy, which needs to be carefully investigated. As matters stand in the case of Joe Scholes, the coroner's inquest into his death has not yet taken place, having been adjourned with no date yet set.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/3">Both the police and the Prison Service have already investigated the death. In the latter investigation the investigating team included two members from outside the Prison Service (Youth Justice Board and the Director of Public Health) and an advisory panel was also convened to advise the investigation. The panel included representatives from the Prison Service, Youth Justice Board, Prisons and Probation Ombudsman's Office, the local health authority and social services. The resultant investigation report has been disclosed to the coroner in order to inform the inquest, and to the family's legal representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/4">Additionally, Trafford Social Services has carried out a &quot;Part 8&quot; case review pursuant to Part 8 of Working Together to Safeguard Children and that report will be finalised after the inquest.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.6/1">I have today placed in the Library a copy of the Home Secretary's proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales in 2004&ndash;05. We intend to implement the proposals subject to consideration of any representations we receive about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/2">Funding the police properly remains a top priority for this Government. The settlement for 2004&ndash;05 builds on significant extra resources for policing in England and Wales over the last three years. Since 2000&ndash;01 total provision for policing to be supported by grant or spent centrally on services for the police has risen by over &pound;2.3 billion or over 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/3">Total provision for policing to be supported by grant in 2004&ndash;05 will be &pound;10,086 million. This is a cash rise of &pound;403 million or 4.2 per cent over the provision for 2003&ndash;04. This includes principal formula police grant, specific grants, capital related grants, direct Home Office spending and the formula spending on which revenue support grant is based.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/4">We have decided, exceptionally this year, to provide a standard general grant increase of 3.25 per cent for each police authority in England and Wales. We recognise the financial pressures on police authorities and we are concerned to avoid excessive burdens on local taxpayers. Our approach should help ensure that precepts are kept at a sustainable level and that policing services continue to improve. The grant increase is sufficient to cover inflation, in particular the pay increases announced for next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/5">In order to do this, we have added &pound;140 million from wider Home Office resources and we have transferred into general police grant provision amounting to &pound;100 million from existing and planned specific grants and central spending. These transfers will give police authorities greater scope to determine their own spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/6">We launched the National Policing Plan 2004&ndash;07 earlier this month. The overarching aim of the plan is to deliver enhanced police performance and public reassurance. Particular regard is given to the Home Secretary's priorities to provide a citizen-focused service and to tackle the crimes that blight the lives of many. Other key priorities include tackling anti-social behaviour and disorder; continuing to reduce burglary, vehicle crime, robbery, and drug-related crime and combating serious and organised crime. This settlement will support the priorities outlined in the National Policing Plan and continue to support our reform and modernisation process. There is continuation funding for recruits under the Crime Fighting Fund and community support officers who are playing an important role reassuring the public on our streets; more funding from the Street Crime Initiative that has seen street crime reduce by an estimated 7 per cent in England and Wales in April&ndash;June 2003 compared with the same period last year; Basic Command Unit funding to deal with policing problems most effectively at local level; continuation of the Rural Policing Fund to improve policing for communities with the most widespread populations; funding from the DNA Expansion Programme and other schemes to allow forces to make the most of new technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/7">In this statement, we want to outline the wider provision for support for the police service in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/8">The police grant settlement</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/9">We propose to distribute the settlement as follows:</p>

We have increased the formula provision for the MPA national and capital city functions from &pound;202 million to &pound;207 million to keep the formula up to date so that the MPA will receive appropriate benefit in future years. The MPA will receive separately provision for counter-terrorism, continuing funding made available this year. Details will be announced at a later stage. &pound;15 million will also be made available to fund 750 CSOs recruited since 2002. The MPA will be eligible for specific grants from the Crime Fighting Fund, the Basic Command Unit Fund and the Street Crime Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/31">Specific grants for police authorities</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/32">In addition to increased general grant, police authorities will continue to receive extra funding through several specific grants for particular schemes. Targeted grants were introduced as a direct response to what the police service and the public told us they wanted. Specific grants enable us to target funds to the areas where they are particularly needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/33">The measure of the success of specific funding is now clear. We have record police numbers helped by the Crime Fighting Fund; increased support for those living in rural areas; the Street Crime Initiative has helped reduce street crime; recruitment problems in London and the south-east have been tackled through increased or new allowances for officers; the presence on our streets of community support officers is providing the public with reasssurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/34">Provision for specific grants in 2004&ndash;05 will be &pound;657 million, a little lower than in 2003&ndash;04. This has enabled us to maximise general grant which may be spent at the discretion of police authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/35">The main specific grants are:</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/36" class="indent">Crime Fighting Fund: &pound;277 million will be provided to forces in 2004&ndash;05. This fund has been a remarkable success. With the help of this fund the Home Secretary's target of 132,500 officers by March 2004 was exceeded by nearly 4,000 this August. We will continue to pay for the 9,000 police officers recruited between April 2000 and March 2003 through the Crime Fighting Fund. We intend to pay for 60 per cent of the cost of the further 650 officers recruited under the Fund in 2003&ndash;04. The scheme will not be expanded further in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/37" class="indent">Counter Terrorism: As last year, we will continue to provide additional funding to the Police Service to enable it to respond to the increased threat from international terrorism. This funding will be provided to both the Metropolitan Police Service and provincial forces in England and Wales and is in addition to existing funding streams for counter-terrorism and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/38" class="indent">Basic Command Unit (BCU) funds: &pound;50 million will be provided for BCUs. These are at the forefront of local policing. The grant is targeted towards forces with BCUs in high crime areas to help reduce crime in partnership with Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships. The money is directed so that all forces in England and Wales receive a proportion of the pot.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/39" class="indent">Special priority payments: The pay and conditions package agreed by the PNB in May 2002 introduced new elements into police pay such as payments for the most experienced officers who can demonstrate a high level of professional competence and extra rewards for officers in the most difficult and demanding posts. We have split the allocation for 2004&ndash;05. &pound;50 million will be available as a specific grant for special priority payments in 2004&ndash;05. A further &pound;9 million has been rolled back into general grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/40" class="indent">Community support officers (CSOs): &pound;41 million funding will be available to support the costs of CSOs who free up police officer time, play a crucial role in providing reassurance and who have some powers to deal with low level crime and anti-social behaviour. The provision will continue to fund CSOs recruited in 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/41" class="indent">Rural Policing Fund: &pound;30 million is again provided for the particular needs of the 31 forces with the most widespread populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/42" class="indent">Street Crime Initiative: Additional funding of around &pound;25 million is being made available to support continued police operations against street crime. Distribution will be determined in December 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/43">We will, as well, make available funding for the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/44" class="indent">75 per cent of the cost of the London and south-east allowances (&pound;49 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/45" class="indent">Funding support for the cost of free travel for Metropolitan and City of London officers (&pound;3.2 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/46" class="indent">Promotion of volunteering within the Police Service (&pound;7 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/47" class="indent">Workforce Modernisation Implementation Fund: we have allocated &pound;5 million in 2004&ndash;05 to support forces in developing an effective skills mix of police staff and police officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/48" class="indent">The Home Secretary is committed to the DNA Expansion Programme and the benefits that it is delivering. Funding is provided for the continuation programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/49">Police authority capital</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/50">We intend to allocate provision of capital grant for 2004&ndash;05 in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/51">In addition capital grants for the introduction of Airwave will be made available to those authorities taking up the radio communications service in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/52">There will be capital provision for the case and custody project of the criminal justice IT system. This will be supported by resource funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/53">&pound;40 million is being provided for the capital costs of developing the Metropolitan Police Authority's Command Control and Communications Information (C3i) System. In total &pound;140 million is being provided towards this project.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/54">Central spending on policing</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/55">Central spending on policing will total &pound;706 million. The main specific items are the DNA expansion programme, the National Strategy for Police Information Systems and the Airwave contractor's core charges. In addition, provision is made for the costs of organisations supporting policing, mainly the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO), Centrex (the Central Police Training and Development Authority), National Criminal Intelligence Service/National Crime Squad and scientific and technical facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/56">Efficiency</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/57">The settlement continues to take account of our commitment to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the police service. Guidance on efficiency plans for 2004&ndash;05 will be issued shortly. Future police grant allocations will be considered in the light of police authorities meeting the current target for 2 per cent efficiency improvements. The efficiency target will be examined during the spending review 2004. Targets reflecting each authority's circumstances may be more appropriate than a universal one. We shall also be considering the balance between cash releasing efficiencies and those which are the result of service improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/58">Conclusion</p>
	<p pid="a.298.6/59">We are continuing to invest substantially in the police service to ensure delivery of an effective and efficient police service that has the support and confidence of all communities. We have listened carefully to the concerns of police authorities in determining this settlement. We have ensured that all forces will receive an increase of 3.25 per cent in general grant which is well above general inflation of 2.6 per cent. This settlement provides the resources to help the police do their job more effectively, building on a strong platform of record police officer numbers, a growing policing community and reduced levels of crime.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-19a.307.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="307"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119w04.htm#31119w04_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.307.2/1">After the introduction of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) in 1973, the Royal Air Force has, for the purposes of awarding pensions, been reviewing War Pension Scheme decisions on whether injuries, ill-health or deaths were due to service using the normal civil standard of proof (&quot;balance of probabilities&quot;). The War Pension Scheme uses a &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; standard in favour of the claimant for the first seven years after leaving service. This interpretation of AFPS scheme regulations was challenged in a complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman who found in favour of the claimant, Mrs Hulme. The ombudsman's decision was upheld on appeal in the High Court and has today been further upheld in the Court of Appeal on the basis that the relevant regulations required AFPS administrators to accept the decision on attributability taken under the War Pension Scheme. We have decided that the Ministry of Defence will not seek leave to appeal the Court of Appeal judgment further to the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.2/2">Following this decision, the department will now review previous decisions on entitlement to attributable pensions for those conditions that led to invaliding or to death-in-service where AFPS administrators have previously not accepted War Pension Scheme decisions on attributability. Awards will be backdated and the department will consider compensation to reflect the effect of inflation on the value of pensions over the period of non-payment. We expect to make a further announcement on this matter early in the New Year.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.2/3">Initial research indicates that the incorrect interpretation of the regulations is likely to have affected Royal Air Force compensation payments since soon after 1973, and Army and perhaps some Royal Navy claims since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.2/4">We do not know how many pensioners are likely to have been affected or the likely cost. However, a substantial number of pension award decisions will need to be reviewed to ensure that all those at risk are identified. At present, we expect it to take around a year to complete this review. Payments will be made as soon as possible. We will also be using appropriate advertising to publicise to the ex-service community those categories of pensioner who might be affected and how claims can be lodged. We will consider these as quickly as possible. The judgment does not affect the benefits paid under the War Pension Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.2/5">The department will abide fully by the Court of Appeal decision with respect to claims from the past or where a decision is still pending. However, we have decided that, for the future, as soon as the relevant changes can be made to secondary legislation, the department should establish the right of AFPS administrators to take a second decision on attributability, using the balance of probabilities standard of proof. This is the standard of proof used for other public service occupational schemes, as well as for decisions in the civil courts and for the recently proposed new Armed Forces Compensation Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.2/1">The arrangement negotiated with Land Securities Trillium as part of the expanded PRIME contract allows the department a flexible approach to the way it can vacate its surplus property without additional cost. In total 228,000m <sup>2</sup> can be vacated on this basis. This has been profiled in the medium term to reflect the requirements of the department's Estate Strategy and it is not possible therefore to provide an estimate for each year up to 2018.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/2">The Valuation Office was instructed to value the former Employment Services estate on the basis of vacant possession as this is the way in which Land Securities Trillium was asked to price its bid and because the investment value of the department's occupation during the term of the contract is reflected in the unitary charge that DWP will pay Land Securities Trillium for occupying space.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/3">It is not possible to publish information in relation to the value for money calculations, as this remains commercial in confidence at the current time. The National Audit Office is carrying out an independent scrutiny and its report is due to be published in spring 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/4">The department has sought to obtain the best value from the way it received payment for its properties. It was found that a capital receipt of &pound;100 million from Land Securities Trillium, with the balance of the property values used to reduce the ongoing unitary charge payments, provided us with the optimum value for money solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.5/1">The Director General of Telecommunications at Oftel has now written to Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, and I have arranged for his letter to be published in the Official Report with this Answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the Director General of Telecommunications at Oftel, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-12">12 November 2003</phrase>. Mobile Telephone Numbers: Comprehensive Directory</p>
	<p pid="a.310.5/3">You asked a question in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-29">29 October 2003</phrase> on the subject of mobile telephone numbers and their presence in a universal database. Lord Sainsbury has asked me to respond directly to you as your question is in relation to an issue that falls under my responsibilities as Director General of Telecommunications.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.5/4">At present there is one &quot;universal&quot; database of UK telephone numbers. The universal database is maintained by a stand-alone unit of BT and is known as OSIS (the Operator Services Information System). OSIS contains the details of fixed as well as mobile numbers, and is available to directory enquiry service providers on a cost-orientated basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.5/5">Some mobile telephone numbers are currently available via OSIS and there is a manual process to allow those consumers who wish to have a listing to be added. (Consumers can of course choose to be ex-directory, whether they have a mobile or a fixed telephone.)</p>
	<p pid="a.310.5/6">I understand that, at present, BT and the mobile operators are working on the automated process necessary to ensure that mobile telephone numbers can be easily transferred to OSIS. Once these discussions are complete, it is likely that general mobile data will be available in early 2004 although, as I mentioned above, a consumer can have their data inputted on to OSIS at present via a manual system.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.5/7">However, I should stress that, whilst the industry negotiations thus far have proceeded positively, they do involve complex issues, including the consideration of key matters such as cost recovery, therefore there is a possibility of a dispute being brought to my attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.5/8">Under the General Conditions of Entitlement, Communications Providers (including mobile providers) must provide their subscribers directory data on terms that are fair and cost-orientated and in a format agreed between the two parties. If BT and any of the mobile operators fail to reach agreement on, for example, the cost of this data or the format in which it is supplied, then Oftel or (after <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-29">29 December 2003</phrase>) Ofcom will be called on to formally resolve their dispute. As you are aware, Ofcom will take on its responsibilities on <phrase class="date" code="">29 December</phrase> and will aim to resolve any dispute submitted to it within 4 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.5/1">We have today published the major sections of the draft Gambling Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/2">The Bill will make major changes to the way in which gambling is regulated and controlled in Great Britain. It will build on the work undertaken by Sir Alan Budd and the Gambling Review Body that he led.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/3">It is based on the three key principles. First, the principle that the system of gambling law and regulation must keep the gambling industry free of crime. Our industry has a high international reputation for integrity, which must not be put at risk. Secondly, the law must ensure that gambling is conducted fairly, so that players know what to expect. Thirdly, there must be effective protection for children and the vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/4">The current laws on gambling dating back to the 1960s have failed to keep pace with rapid technological change. Attitudes to gambling have changed too. The law needs to be modernised but we must make sure that it is flexible enough to cope with further change.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/5">However, modernisation does not mean a gambling free for all and reform must not be allowed to generate an upsurge in problem gambling. The provisions published today combine a managed relaxation of outdated restrictions with the strongest protections for children and the vulnerable. Following reform, there will be greater choice for adults but there will remain important limitations on what types of gambling are available and where they can be located.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/6">In A Safe Bet for Success (published in March 2002, Cmnd 5397) we accepted the vast majority of the Gambling Review's recommendations. Since then, we have been working closely with the interested industries, representatives of groups encouraging responsible gambling, local authorities, consumer groups, other government departments and the devolved administrations to prepare draft legislation that would give effect to this new system of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/7">The proposals published today build on and subsume the draft clauses published in July 2003. They will simplify regulation by establishing a single regulator for commercial gambling. The Gambling Commission will have wider functions, greater flexibility to act and stronger enforcement powers than the Gaming Board that it will replace. Local authorities will license all types of gambling premises, to ensure that local people have a say in where gambling outlets are sited.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/8">The draft Bill will keep crime out of gambling and protect the industry's reputation for integrity and excellence. The Gambling Commission will be a strong, effective regulator and will root out illegal gambling; its staff will have statutory powers of entry, search and seizure.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/9">The draft Bill also removes unnecessary restrictions on the ability of business to meet consumers' wishes. The rule allowing casinos to be established only in designated parts of the country will be abolished, as will the rule requiring membership of a casino or bingo club at least 24 hours before playing. Remote gambling, for example on the Internet, interactive TV and through mobile telephones, will be licensed and regulated effectively in Great Britain for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/10">The published clauses also strengthen safeguards protecting children and the vulnerable. The current minimum age limits for access to gambling products will be retained and enforced strongly. The draft Bill also includes reserve powers for a statutory levy on gambling operators. These powers will be used if the gambling industry does not keep its promises to contribute to a charitable trust funding research, prevention and treatment programmes for problem gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/11">A Joint Committee of both Houses has been convened to examine the Government's draft proposals. We are confident that what they will scrutinise is a set of mature proposals that will achieve a sensible reform of the law on gambling. Such scrutiny will improve the legislation and build parliamentary understanding and public confidence, enabling us to strike the right balance between deregulation and the protection of young and vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.5/12">We intend to publish the remaining sections of the draft Bill early next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.316.2/1">There are no government plans to reduce the number of sites that can receive hazardous waste. From July 2002, the Landfill Directive required operators to specify whether their sites will be inert, non-hazardous or hazardous waste landfills. In July 2004, when co-disposal of waste ends, those landfill sites classified as hazardous in 2002 can alter their classification to non-hazardous. Following this reclassification exercise, and working from the current information supplied by the waste management industry, we believe that a relatively small number of sites will continue as hazardous waste landfills. However, also from July 2004, the Landfill Directive permits stable non-reactive hazardous waste to be disposed of in a separate cell in non-hazardous landfills.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/2">Analysis conducted by the Hazardous Waste Forum shows that there is likely to be sufficient capacity in non-hazardous and hazardous waste landfill to deal with hazardous waste arisings. It is estimated that approximately 3 million tonnes of hazardous waste will require landfilling each year.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.2/1">The Water Framework Directive defines a river as a &quot;body of inland water flowing for the most part on the surface of the land but which may flow underground for part of its course.&quot; The draft England and Wales regulations contain the same definition. The directive does not set environmental objectives for wetlands as such, and this may be why there is no separate definition of this term.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.2/2">A wetland that is dependent on a groundwater body, that forms part of a surface water body, or that is a protected area, will however benefit from directive obligations to protect and restore the status of water. The draft regulations for England and Wales will provide the framework within which those obligations will be met.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.5/1">The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). It provides that waste means, &quot; . . . any substance or object . . . which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.&quot; Whether or not a substance, such as power station ash or blast furnace slag, is discarded as waste is a matter which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the interpretation of the definition of waste and the meaning of &quot;discard&quot;. ECJ judgments are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.5/2">The Government have not classified either pulverised fuel ash or blast furnace slag as waste. It rests in the first place with the producer of a substance to decide whether it is being discarded as waste. The Environment Agency is designated as a competent authority for the purposes of the directive and is responsible for the application of its controls to substances discarded as waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.5/3">The Government propose, in consultation with the Environment Agency, to review in the light of the ECJ's judgments the guidance on the interpretation of the definition of waste originally provided in DOE Circular 11/94. But it is not feasible for any revised guidance which the Government issue to determine whether any particular substance is in any particular circumstances discarded as waste. It will be feasible only for any revised guidance to advise on the factors which the ECJ has determined should be taken into account in reaching a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.5/4">Power station ash&mdash;including pulverised fuel ash&mdash;and blast furnace slags are two of the waste streams discussed in the Government's Waste Strategy 2000 (paragraphs 8.139&ndash;8.149) (Cm 4693&ndash;2). As the strategy makes clear, delivering sustainable development means not only putting waste to good use through recycling but also choosing products made from recycled waste. This is why the Government set up the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)&mdash;to promote recycling and to create stable and efficient markets for products made from recycled waste. In this context, it is necessary to have regard to the fact that it is only substances which are discarded as waste which are capable of being &quot;recycled&quot; within the meaning of the Waste Framework Directive and related legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.5/5">The Government continue to encourage the recovery of waste by means of recycling, re-use and reclamation. This encouragement includes the use of the Government's discretion under Article 11 of the Waste Framework Directive to provide exemptions from waste management licensing. Licensing exemptions for the recycling of ash discarded as waste are provided in paragraphs 9, 13 and 19 of Schedule 3 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994.</p>

	<p pid="a.319.2/1">The Government have imposed no requirement which makes it necessary to replace pulverised fuel ash (pfa) with new aggregate for purposes such as stabilising old mine workings. The effect of the Waste Framework Directive is to require a permit, such as a waste management licence issued by the Environment Agency, for the disposal or recovery of waste. This requirement applies to the disposal or recovery of pfa discarded as waste. The requirement does not preclude the use of waste pfa for purposes such as stabilising old mine workings. But it is necessary for anyone proposing to use waste pfa for this purpose to apply to the Environment Agency for the necessary licence. It is the applicant's responsibility to do so as part of his project planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/2">The use of waste ash for purposes such as this was the subject of a judgment by the European Court of Justice in Case C-600 on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-27">27 February 2002</phrase> (Abfall). Among other matters, the Court was asked for a ruling on whether the use of waste ash to secure hollow spaces (mine-sealing) is a waste disposal or recovery operation. The Court's judgment was that, &quot;The deposit must be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the operation is a disposal or recovery operation within the meaning of that Directive [the Waste Framework Directive]. Such a deposit constitutes a recovery operation if its principal objective is that the waste serve a useful purpose in replacing other materials which would have had to be used for that purpose&quot;.</p>

The developing countries whose generic drug manufacturing capacity is substantial enough to manufacture their own drugs to treat HIV and AIDS include Mexico, Brazil, China, India and South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.5/2">All of the factors affecting access to medicines are inter-linked and one strategy alone will not have sufficient impact on pricing or access to affordable drugs for the poor. However, the lowest world price for average annual triple therapy drugs has been reduced by approximately 95 per cent over the past three years. At the beginning of 2000 anti-retro viral (ARV) triple combination therapy typically cost over 10,000 US dollars. Since then a combination of price reductions by patent based pharmaceutical companies, schemes such as the Accelerated Access Initiative, increased demand through donor financing and the introduction of generic competition have brought prices down to almost 200 US dollars. It is important to note that these are supply side prices and not the price to the end user. Prices can be inflated through taxes, tariffs and other additional costs on their route to a medical centre or patient. It is also important to note that these prices are not available in all developing countries but represent the best world price available.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.5/3">The factors recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that can improve poor peoples' access to medicines are: affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of existing drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.5/4">The UK Government are pursuing a number of different approaches to make essential drugs&mdash;including those for the treatment of HIV/AIDS&mdash;available in developing countries. These include working with other G8 countries, developing country governments, multi-lateral institutions, the pharmaceutical industry (generic and patent-based), investors and NGOs to encourage companies to reduce their prices in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.5/5">The Prime Minister's high level Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World recommended differential pricing of essential medicines for the developing world. The UK Government are working to secure greater international commitment to affordable pricing.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.2/1">Yes. The Department for International Development has provided technical assistance worth &pound;480,000 for a project entitled Building Police Support for Harm Reduction managed by International Family Health, which runs from August 2001 to December 2003. The project aims to work in partnership with the Russian police as an integral part of strategies, including harm reduction, for combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Russia, and IFH's report is one of its outputs. The report seeks to analyse and raise questions about a range of issues on HIV/AIDS and drugs misuse, and harm reduction programmes in Russia, from the standpoint of the Russian legal system. It seeks to contribute to the debate about the efficacy of harm reduction programmes in preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS.</p>

	<p pid="a.335.5/1">Dietary reference values for nutrients form the basis of nutrient recommendations on dietary intakes and are used for assessing the adequacy of diets. These levels were set taking into account a variety of factors including levels of nutrients in the diet associated with the absence of nutritional disease. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition is currently considering the need for a scientific review of dietary reference values in the context of its deliberations on the committee's forward work programme.</p>
