	<p pid="a.1.2/1">We fully support the UN Fourth World Conference for Women Platform for Action and its reaffirmation that the human rights of women and the girl child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. We are fully committed to the realisation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women and girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">The UK strongly opposes sex-selective abortion. We recognise that there is no easy solution to addressing this practice. However, our work on girls' education, women's empowerment, skills, work and jobs aims to increase the value of girls and women in society and therefore tackle the pressures and incentives that drive preferences for male children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">In India, for example, evidence indicates that son preference is weakening, but at the same time access to technologies such as ultrasound are increasing, potentially off-setting this progress. Through our support to the National Reproductive and Child Health programme we are supporting the Government of India to limit inappropriate use of these technologies without reducing access to safe abortion services.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">National Health Service productivity growth is measured as the ratio of growth in the volume of outputs to growth in the volume of inputs. NHS output includes the sum of all patient treatments carried out each year. Cost weighting patient treatments enables a single output value to be constructed from all healthcare activities carried out each year. Healthcare activities are varied, weighting makes different activities comparable in terms of their value so for example a procedure that costs five times more than another receives five times more weight in the measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">The cost weight for each type of activity is the relative cost of that activity compared to all others. The Office for National Statistics calculates average costs for each Healthcare Resource Group from cost information recorded in the annual reference costs collection by the department.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/3">Multiplying the quantity of each activity type by its cost weight and summing these values generates the cost-weighted output value. The measurement of growth requires comparable data over time periods. To ensure the volume of outputs is comparable over time, the same cost weights are applied to data for year 1 and year 2 such that the effects of price increases are stripped out.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.0/1">Quality adjustments are made to the quantity of output produced by the National Health Service, not the quantity of input used.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/2">NHS productivity growth is measured as the ratio of the growth in the volume of outputs to the growth in the volume of inputs. Where the quality of the output changes (for example improved health outcomes following medical interventions), an adjustment is made to reflect that this is desirable, even if the count of the activity (for example number of hip operations) is unchanged. This approach was adopted following a review undertaken by Sir Tony Atkinson at the request of the National Statistician, which set out a principled framework for measuring government output in the National Accounts within international guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/3">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) adjust output for two dimensions of quality: the extent to which the service succeeds in delivering its intended outcomes; and the extent to which the service is responsive to users' needs. The first of these includes adjustments for survival rates, health gain following treatment in hospital, changes in waiting times and outcomes from intervention in primary care. The second dimension encapsulates changes to patient experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/4">Adjustments to output are made for the fact that there are negative welfare effects of having to wait for hospital treatment. The adjustment is calculated by observing changes in the 80th percentile of waiting time distribution for each category of inpatient activity and assigning a benefit (disbenefit) to a reduction (increase) in the time waited.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/5">An adjustment is then made for any differences in health outcomes. Since changes in health outcomes are not observed directly for every procedure, an indirect method is used. This combines changes in short term (30 day) survival rates following treatment, and a post treatment health gain following survival, based on inferred data from 30 different treatments, all allowing for changes in healthy life expectancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/6">The effects of changes in waiting times and health outcomes are then applied multiplicatively to the change in the quantity of activity undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/7">Separate adjustments are then made for changes in patient experience, which are estimated by observing changes in patient satisfaction expressed by patients in national patient surveys for inpatients and outpatients. A 1 per cent improvement in patient experience would increase the output index by 1 per cent, weighted by the relative costs of the survey settings. The overall effect of this adjustment has been negligible over the past eight years given the very small movements in patient survey responses.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/8">The final adjustment looks at the change in outcomes from primary medical care interventions and measures the quality of general practices by observing the change in the proportion of patients who have achieved a desired clinical target after being diagnosed with hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke or chronic kidney disease. Consultations which give rise to improved condition management are assumed to have 30 per cent more value than those which do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/9">Between 2001 and 2009, quality adjustments added an average of 0.9 percentage points a year to output growth. The effect of the quality adjustments on total output is shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.5/4">Average levels of earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for all employees on adult rates of pay whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence. The ASHE, carried out in April each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom and is based on a one per cent sample of employee jobs taken from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) PAYE records. The ASHE also collects data on occupational pension schemes and pension contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/5">In April 2010, the latest period for which figures are available, the median gross weekly earnings for all employees in the public sector was &#163;446 and for the private sector the comparable estimate was &#163;386. For those employees in the public sector that made pension contributions, the median contribution was 6.4 per cent and for the private sector the comparable estimate was 5.0 per cent. For employers in the public sector that made pension contributions for their employees, the median contribution was 14.9 per cent and for employers in the private sector the comparable estimate was 8.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.3/1">The United Kingdom's development partnership in Uganda is based on an assessment of the Ugandan Government's commitment to the following principles: respecting human rights and other international obligations; improving public financial management; promoting good governance, transparency and fighting corruption; strengthening domestic accountability and ensuring poverty is reduced in a sustainable manner. Where we judge the partner government shares these partnership commitments, the UK may provide budget support-if we consider this to be the best way to achieve results and value for money for the British tax payer and Ugandan people.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.6/1">Her Majesty's Government are aware that in 2010, under the previous Government, the Government of Uganda signed the contracts for the purchase of military equipment. Prior to the last election, in April 2010, the Uganda Joint Budget Support development partners (DPs) wrote to the then Minister of Finance expressing concern about reports in the Ugandan press that the Government had signed a contract for the purchase of six fighter jets. In February 2011, it was confirmed that Uganda had used money from its reserves to upgrade its air force in 2010, which was understood to be for the purchase of 6 Sukhoi 3000 jets.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.0/1">The goal of the Deepening Democracy Programme is to contribute to improved democratic governance in Uganda by increasing informed, active, pluralistic participation of Ugandan citizens in the political process; building the capacity of Ugandan institutions critical to promoting public participation; and holding the state accountable to citizens' needs and concerns. In working towards these goals the programme works with a wide range of civil society organisations, state and non-state institutions, and government. An independent end of programme evaluation will take place in August and September 2011. This will provide an opportunity for all relevant stakeholders to share their views on the programme. To date, however, we are not aware of any concerns having been raised with regard to the programme itself and/or its goals.</p>
