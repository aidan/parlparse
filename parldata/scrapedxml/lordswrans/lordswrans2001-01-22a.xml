	<p pid="a.1.2/1">The Ongoers element of the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme was today opened for applications and will remain open for six months. This announcement completes the delivery of a further component of the Government's Action Plan for Farming. The scheme will make a significant amount of money available to the UK pig industry; a sector that has suffered over the past two years. While market conditions have improved recently, the scale of the debt incurred over those difficult times continues to be a major restraint on the industry's ability to prepare itself for the future. The Government's restructuring scheme will go some way towards remedying that situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">The aim of Ongoers is to help pig producers reduce costs, overcome any competitive disadvantages and restore long-term viability to their businesses. It will achieve this by providing an interest rate rebate on loans linked to an agreed business plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">Phase one of the scheme--Outgoers, was opened on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-04">4 December 2000</phrase> and since then over 1,500 application forms have been sent out in response to telephone and e-mail requests.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.5/1">Her Majesty's Government remains committed to assisting designated foreign countries which request the freezing of illegally obtained assets, but it can only act when it receives a valid request. Such requests, once they have been submitted to the Home Office, are processed expeditiously, and passed to the appropriate authorities for execution. Additionally, the Home Office is working with the Department for International Development to strengthen arrangements to enable overseas governments to pursue claims to evidence and assets more effectively. This was announced in paragraph 67 of the recent White Paper Eliminating World Poverty (Cmnd. 5006).</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">Requests for assistance in criminal matters are confidential communications between two states, and in normal circumstances I would neither confirm nor deny that the Home Office has received any such requests relating to the subjects listed, except in the case of General Abacha. I must emphasise that it is not appropriate to provide a warning of likely asset freezing, since this might enable the assets to be moved. However, in recognition of the public interest in these particular cases, I can, exceptionally, state that no request has been received in respect of the other parties listed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3">There has, however, been widespread press coverage of the request the Home Office has received from Nigeria for freezing of funds in relation to General Abacha. For further information relating to this request, I refer the noble Lord to the reply Lord Bassam gave Lord Moynihan on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-02">2 November 2000</phrase>, Official Report, col. WA 111. I should add that the position remains as it was at the time of that answer, and we are still awaiting clarification of the matters referred to therein.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.2/1">Yes. The Nice European Council endorsed the view that the EU would act where NATO as a whole was not engaged; that NATO remained the basis of the collective defence of its members; and that the development of the Common European Security and Defence Policy would contribute to the vitality of the Transatlantic relationship. The EU proposed a strategic partnership with NATO for crisis management. NATO has welcomed this proposal and agreed to work to finalise permanent EU/NATO arrangements without delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">Peer reviewed scientific data comparing the mortality of UK Gulf veterans to an era group of service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf were published for the first time in the Lancet on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-01">1 July 2000</phrase>. An update to these figures was provided by the Ministry of Defence to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-20">20 July 2000</phrase>. The Ministry of Defence has undertaken to continue to monitor the mortality of both Gulf veterans and the era group and will publish updated figures on a regular basis.

The number of Gulf veterans dying from disease-related causes is rather less than for the control group, whereas the number of Gulf veterans dying of external causes is rather higher than for the control group. The Ministry of Defence will conduct a more detailed analysis of road traffic accident, to establish whether there are any underlying trends that might help explain this excess.</p>
