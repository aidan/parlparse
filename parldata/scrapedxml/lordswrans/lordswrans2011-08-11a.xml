	<p pid="a.357.2/1">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' guidance, <I>The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion</I>, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, recommends that clinicians caring for women requesting abortion should try to identify those who require more support than can be provided in the routine clinic setting (such as those with a psychiatric history, poor social support or evidence of coercion). For the minority of women who require formal therapeutic counselling, services should have formal care pathways in place with access to trained counsellors with appropriate expertise.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/2">We are looking to strengthen these existing arrangements and are drawing up proposals to enable all women who are seeking an abortion to be offered access to independent counselling. We would want the counselling to be provided by appropriately qualified individuals. Detailed proposals are being worked on. We plan to consult widely on those later this year and will finalise our plans in early 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.2/1">We do not believe it is necessary to review the definition of &quot;prospective parent&quot; under Section 2(2) of the Childcare Act 2006. The term &quot;prospective parent&quot; includes the father. Section 2(2) also defines parent as &quot;a parent of a young child, and includes any individual who (a) has parental responsibility for a young child, or (b) has care of a young child&quot;. This will not only include fathers, but stepfathers and stepmothers, grandparents who have grandchildren living with them, foster parents and adoptive parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.376.0/1">The recording of crime by the police is governed by the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) and the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR). These require that a crime is recorded if the circumstances reported by a victim amount to a crime in law and there is no credible evidence to the contrary. The HOCR sets out the classifications under which crimes are to be recorded for statistical purposes and include classifications for burglary. The HOCR also provide considerable guidance, with the use of examples, to aid forces in determining the correct classification under which a report of crime should be recorded. This guidance is kept under review and may be amended when necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.388.2/1">The European Banking Authority (EBA) stress tests served a useful purpose, both assessing the capital adequacy of the European banking sector and increasing transparency on banks' exposures, which will reduce the risk of contagion.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.2/2">Methodologically, the EBA stress tests were more demanding than last year's European Union-wide Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) exercise, with a tougher capital threshold, using a Core Tier 1 (CT1) metric and a more rigorous peer review process.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.2/3">The EBA tests have also provided the markets with significant amounts of additional information on the exposures of Europe's banks, including their sovereign debt holdings. In what was described by the EBA as &quot;an unprecedented level of transparency&quot;, approximately 20 times as much data was released as part of this year's tests as was published under last year's CEBS exercise. As well as reducing uncertainty across the banking sector, this additional information will allow markets to carry out their own stress tests to reflect better the rapidly changing market conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.2/4">Just as importantly, we have also seen a commitment by member states to put in place credible plans to address the vulnerabilities revealed by the stress tests. In respect of the eight banks that failed the test, the EBA report outlines that &quot;national supervisors should ensure that these banks are requested to present within three months to their competent authorities a plan to restore the capital position to a level at least equal to the 5% threshold [and that] the remedial measures agreed will have to be fully implemented by end 2011&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.2/5">In addition, banks that are above but &quot;close to the 5% CT1 threshold and which have sizeable exposures to sovereigns under stress&quot; are required to take specific steps to strengthen their capital position, including, where necessary, restrictions on dividends, deleveraging, issuance of fresh capital or conversion of lower-quality instruments into CT1 capital.</p>

	<p pid="a.389.3/1">We are still considering the most appropriate delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have yet been taken. We envisage that assessments will be delivered by a third party contracted to the department and commercial activity is planned to begin later this year. The department will rigorously evaluate all proposals to ensure both assessment capability and capacity is deliverable.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.3/2">As part of the successful delivery of personal independence payment, we know it will be vital to ensure that appropriate training, guidance and support are provided for assessors and decision-makers. This is relevant not only for autistic spectrum disorders but for other health conditions and impairments, to ensure that the new assessment accurately and consistently enables support to be targeted to those with the greatest need. We are keen to work with disabled people and their organisations to ensure that we get the training and guidance right.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.3/3">Both the Minister for Disabled People and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society, for example, to discuss our reform proposals and to seek its views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. We agree with many of the points raised in the National Autistic Society's report on DLA reform, <I>Who </I><I>B</I><I>enefits?</I>, and we are looking closely at how these recommendations can be incorporated into its design.</p>

That advice includes signposting schools to specialist organisations such as Mencap and the Anti-Bullying Alliance, which can support them in tackling the bullying of children with SEND.</p>

	<p pid="a.398.5/1">Directive 2009/81/EC-the Defence and Security Directive-will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-21">21 August 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.5/2">Article 346 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union allows the UK to withhold information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to the essential interests of UK security. In addition Article 346 allows the UK to take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of UK security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material. The application of Article 346 is limited to exceptional and clearly defined cases and has to be interpreted strictly.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.5/3">It is anticipated that the provisions of Article 346 will be invoked, potentially with the effect of excluding non-UK companies, where the provisions of the directive are unable to adequately protect the security interests of the UK in a particular procurement. These measures may be required where there are particularly demanding security of supply or security of information requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.400.6/1">The multi-agency practice guidelines, <I>Female Genital Mutilation</I> (2011), include a chapter of guidance for social workers. The guidance underlines the importance of applying child safeguarding procedures in order to minimise or prevent harm to the child or children. The guidance advises that when there is a referral to children's social care, a strategy meeting should be convened with relevant agencies, in order to agree a plan to protect the child. It is suggested that information should be provided to the family on the risks associated with female genital mutilation (FGM) and that securing parental consent for any action plan is desirable. If a girl faces the immediate risk of undergoing female genital mutilation then an emergency protection order can be obtained. The guidelines advise that a girl who has already undergone FGM should not be on the child protection register-unless other child protection concerns exist.

The web link is: <a href="http://www">www</a>. education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationdetail/page1/DCSF-00305-2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.6/3">The joined-up approach that this coalition Government have taken to tackle FGM has been successful in drawing together, co-ordinating and driving work from the Home Office, Foreign Office, Department for Education and Department of Health. By looking beyond traditional departmental silos, we have made significant progress in raising awareness of FGM and supporting professionals to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.6/4">We have an ambitious action plan for 2011-12 to prevent and tackle FGM, co-ordinated across all relevant government departments. We have also reached out to work with a range of charities and civil society partners that are active in this area. Their wealth of experience has been crucial in shaping our work.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.6/5">Communications about FGM are key to bringing the issue to more people's attention. More than 40,000 leaflets and 40,000 posters have been circulated to schools, health services, charities and community groups around the country-this is not an end in itself but a crucial foundation on which to build.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.6/6">The new multi-agency practice guidelines launched in February 2011 are a key step in ensuring that professionals are able and confident to intervene to protect girls at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.6/7">There have been some successful initiatives from the police too-the Metropolitan Police's Project Azure's work at Heathrow to speak to families potentially taking the girls overseas for FGM has strengthened our last line of defence for these girls.</p>

The establishment of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as a strong and focused conduct regulator with tailored objectives and targeted powers will allow for a tougher and more proactive approach to conduct regulation, supported by greater transparency and accountability. The proposals build on the evidence of a range of failings in the current regime for conduct regulation of financial services.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/2">The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has a number of statutory responsibilities in relation to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). As the rule-making body for FSCS funding, the FSA has commenced a review of the funding model of the FSCS. It will proceed to a formal public consultation once discussions on European directives affecting compensation arrangements have been concluded. The successor regulatory authorities to the FSA, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the FCA, will take over the FSA's responsibilities with respect to the FSCS.</p>

The three-year project was commissioned in 2009 and had four modules covering research on pests and diseases in support of bee health policy. In 2010 a variation to the project was agreed to include a module on the epidemiology of American foulbrood (AFB), which complements the work that the NBU is doing under the Insect Pollinators Initiative on European foulbrood (EFB). AFB and EFB are two of the most serious diseases that affect honey bees and therefore are subject to statutory control in the UK.

	<p pid="a.412.6/1">The department has carefully considered the position of people with a range of serious and life threatening illnesses-including cancer-in relation to the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.6/2">It is important to treat people as individuals and assess them based on their individual needs rather than labelling them because of their condition. Cancer and its associated treatments will affect different people in different ways, and so it should not automatically be regarded as a barrier to work. While many individuals are unable to work, others can and do want to work, often with the full and engaged support of their employer. Indeed, there is evidence of the therapeutic importance of work for many cancer sufferers.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.6/3">Anyone who has cancer and is terminally ill is automatically placed in the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) support group, as are people with cancer who are receiving certain kinds of chemotherapy treatment. The support group is intended for those people with the most severe disabilities or health conditions, who are the least likely to move into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.6/4">Following an internal review the department has recently made changes to the work capability assessment so that more individuals undergoing certain chemotherapy treatments will automatically be placed in the support group without the need for an assessment. These changes have been in place since March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.6/5">Claimants in the support group are paid a higher rate of benefit, are not subject to work conditionality and will not be affected by our proposal currently before Parliament to introduce a one-year time limit for people claiming contributory ESA and who are placed in the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG).</p>
	<p pid="a.412.6/6">People with cancer who are receiving contributory ESA and have been placed in the WRAG will be subject to time-limiting. However, those with lower incomes may be able to receive income-related ESA after their contributory ESA entitlement ends. Other benefits such as housing benefit and disability living allowance may also be available. There will always be a safety net available for those who are unable to support themselves because of longer-term health conditions such as cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.6/7">Finally, Professor Harrington is also reviewing the full work capability assessment process to see if it can be further improved for cancer patients. We have recently received his recommendations and are in the process of reviewing them. We will come forward with proposals shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.413.2/1">Disability Living Allowance is designed to provide a contribution towards the disability-related costs of severely disabled people with long-term disabilities. The required period conditions in Disability Living Allowance are essential in determining whether the needs arising from disability are likely to be of a long-standing nature and ensure that the benefit goes only to those for whom it is intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.2/2">The special rules provision in Disability Living Allowance enables claims from terminally ill people, including those with cancer, to be dealt with quickly and sensitively. These fast-track arrangements recognise the particular challenges faced by terminally ill people who have a short time to live and ensure that these individuals are automatically awarded the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance without having to serve the usual required period conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.2/3">We intend to maintain the special rules provision in Personal Independence Payment ensuring that terminally ill people continue to receive valuable financial support through automatic and immediate payment of the enhanced rate of the daily living component.</p>

The UK Border Agency (UKBA), UK police and the Garda Siochana in Ireland run intelligence-led operations to reduce threats from within the CTA by conducting checks to establish individuals' entitlement to the provisions of the CTA.</p>

	<p pid="a.418.5/1">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a quota-based institution. The IMF assigns each member country a quota share, based on a formula. A member's quota largely determines its voting power in IMF decisions. The current quota formula is a weighted average of gross domestic product (50 per cent), openness (30 per cent), economic variability (15 per cent) and international reserves (5 per cent). This information and more details on quota shares and voting rights can be found on the IMF website at <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/quotas.htm">http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/quotas.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.5/2">In November 2010, the G20 agreed a package of far-reaching reforms of the fund's quotas and governance. Once the reform package is approved by member countries and is implemented, it will result in a major realignment of quota shares to reflect better the changing relative weights of the IMF's member countries in the global economy. Specifically, the package agreed to shift more than 6 per cent of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and to developing countries and more than 6 per cent from overrepresented to underrepresented member countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.5/3">The G20 has also agreed to complete the next comprehensive review of the current quota formula by January 2013. The aim of this review will be to continue the dynamic process, aimed at enhancing the voice and representation of emerging markets and developing countries by better reflecting their economic weight in the global economy. The UK strongly supports this and, as an influential member of the IMF, will take a leading role in working with other member countries.</p>

Following claims by a number of former members of the Royal Irish Home Service Part-Time that they had been treated less favourably than their full-time counterparts in a number of respects on disbandment, the MoD settled the grievance out of court with no admission of liability. Payments were paid for different reasons and were consequently of a different taxable nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.9/2">As advised in previous responses, these payments were taxed in line with normal employment income tax rules but payments made on the termination of employment are subject to specific rules. A genuine ex gratia redundancy payment is not a reward for an employee's services-it is compensation for the premature loss of his or her job. Nevertheless, any excess of payments above &#163;30,000 are treated as employment income by the law. Further detail is not publicly available on grounds of taxpayer confidentiality.</p>

	<p pid="a.440.5/1">Sport England recognises that national governing bodies (NGBs) are the experts in their sports and that they must take responsibility for growing participation in their sport. Therefore, NGBs like the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) are free to invest Sport England funding in activities or organisations they believe can help them meet their outcomes; this includes investing in local authority sports activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/2">If an NGB is not meeting its contracted outcomes as set out in its whole sport plan funding agreement and not making any attempt to redress performance in a way which is deemed satisfactory, then investment will be decommitted. Sport England will also suspend or decommit funding if an NGB is judged to fall short of certain governance regulations or is not fit to receive public funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/3">NGBs are formally reviewed on a six-monthly basis by Sport England against the terms and conditions of the contracts for which they receive investment. This takes into account only the activities they undertake to deliver on the outcomes set within the contracts. Sport England has not specifically consulted local authorities to outline their levels of satisfaction with the ASA or views on its operations and conduct.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/4">The Minister for Sport and the Olympics has had no recent discussions about the conduct of the ASA.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/5">Where there are issues relating to NGBs performance or behaviour outside of governance or contracted outcomes, Sport England is not obliged to interfere.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/6">With regard to using public funds to run anti-competitive activity, the Community Swimming Limited (CSL) is the self-sustaining private company that has been set up with support from the ASA to deliver swimming in venues that would not normally be available for community use. The company is controlled by a board of independent trustees where the ASA has a limited minority right of representation. As CSL does not use funding from Sport England, Sport England has no jurisdiction over the way in which it operates and it is up to the discretion of leisure operators who they appoint to deliver classes.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/7">In terms of the issues the Swimming Teachers Association has with the ASA regarding recognition of swimming teaching as a separate qualification from coaching swimming, a meeting is due to take place in September 2011. The purpose of this is for the ASA and the STA, together with Skills Active and Sports Coach UK, to discuss the concerns of both parties and agree a way forward. The Minister for Sport and the Olympics will be kept informed of progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/8">Finally, Skills Active is the sector skills council for active leisure, learning and well-being licensed by the Government and driven by the needs of employers. A key aspect of its work is to develop a framework of occupational standards which meet the needs of employers and underpin job roles in the sector. Skills Active does have the power to intervene in disagreements between bodies regarding qualifications and training but its role is to represent the employer view on what they need for their staff.</p>

We immediately discussed the report with the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) officials and with other partners, including the US. We have also repeatedly called on the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Army to bring an end to the violence. We continue to work closely with the UN Resident Co-ordinator in Khartoum to seek urgent access for humanitarian agencies in order that human rights abuses can be fully investigated.

Around 30,000 intra-company transfer visas were issued in 2010. The number of visas will not match the number of applications as some applications will have been refused or withdrawn. Further statistics on the number of tier 2 visas can be found in the Home Office's control of immigration statistical releases available online at <a href="http://www">http://www</a>. homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/3">Information on the amount of NICs forgone due to this exemption is not available. The amount of NICs forgone will depend on the length of transfer and, importantly, their country of origin because many workers will be exempt under the terms of various reciprocal social security agreements. It would add unnecessarily to the burdens on businesses and be inconsistent with the current approach to other exemptions and disregards that apply to NICs, to require employers to send information to HM Revenue and Customs about this exemption.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/4">Whether employees covered by the exemption for NICs are liable to pay income tax will depend on their personal circumstances and the effects of any relevant double taxation treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.8/1">The tuberculin skin test is used throughout the world as the primary screening test for TB in cattle and is an effective test when correctly performed. It is the prescribed standard method laid down in both national and international legislation for determining the existence of disease in a cattle herd.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.8/2">Scientific research shows that, on average, the skin test used in the UK will detect approximately 80 per cent of all the infected cattle in a herd at any one test (at standard interpretation). There is only a 0.1 per cent probability of a non-infected animal being wrongly classified as a reactor.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.8/3">The TB testing programme in Great Britain has been enhanced by the use of the gamma interferon blood test since 2006. This diagnostic test is used alongside the tuberculin skin test in known infected herds to improve the sensitivity of the testing regime and to identify more infected animals more quickly. Using both tests in this way can help to speed up the resolution of confirmed TB breakdowns by identifying as many infected cattle as possible at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.0/1">There is a wealth of guidance and best practice available to health professionals on female genital mutilation (FGM), thus there is no one &quot;common code of conduct&quot; in relation to this specific issue. These include guidance produced by HM Government, <I>Multi-Agency Practice Guidelines: Female Genital Mutilation</I>, published in 2011. This includes a chapter on guidance for social workers and underlines the importance of applying child safeguarding procedures in order to minimise or prevent harm to the child or children. The guidance advises that when there is a referral to children's social care, a strategy meeting should be convened with relevant agencies, in order to agree a plan to protect the child. It is suggested that information should be provided to the family on the risks associated with FGM and that securing parental consent for any action plan is desirable. If a girl faces the immediate risk of undergoing FGM, then an emergency protection order can be obtained.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/2">The department produced a DVD on FGM in 2006 which gives a general introduction to the health implications of female genital mutilation. It includes interviews with women who have undergone FGM and outlines the appropriate response from healthcare professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/3">Clinical guidance has also been produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists-<I>Female Genital Mutilation and its </I><I>M</I><I>anagement</I><I>:</I><I> Green-top </I><I>G</I><I>uideline No. 53</I>; by the British Medical Association-<I>Child </I><I>P</I><I>rotection</I><I>:</I><I>A</I><I>T</I><I>oolkit for </I><I>D</I><I>octors</I>, 2009, and <I>Female Genital Mutilation: Caring for </I><I>P</I><I>atients and </I><I>S</I><I>afeguarding </I><I>C</I><I>hildren</I>, July 2011; and by the Royal College of Nursing-<I>Female Genital Mutilation: An RCN Educational Resource for Nursing </I><I>a</I><I>nd Midwifery Staff</I>, 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/4">Communications about FGM are key to bringing the issue to the attention of more people. More than 40,000 leaflets and 40,000 posters have been circulated to schools, health services, charities and community groups around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/5">The Department for Education has included advice on FGM in its guidance for schools, <I>Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education</I>, 2006. It has also included advice on FGM for the wider children's workforce and for all those involved in safeguarding children in <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children: A </I><I>G</I><I>uide to </I><I>I</I><I>nter-agency </I><I>W</I><I>orking to </I><I>S</I><I>afeguard and </I><I>P</I><I>romote the </I><I>W</I><I>elfare of </I><I>C</I><I>hildren</I>, 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/6">In addition, the Kids Taskforce was commissioned by the Home Office to develop a short film and accompanying teachers' resource pack to be available for use in secondary schools. The film will be aimed at young people and explain what FGM is, its illegality and lack of religious basis, its physical and mental health consequences and what steps young people should take if they are worried about themselves or someone else undergoing FGM. The accompanying teachers' resource pack is designed to support teachers to deliver a lesson on FGM. It will contain detailed lesson plans and relevant and applicable classroom materials, such as students' worksheets, quizzes, debate topics and small group-work activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.2/1">Female genital mutilation (FGM) is an illegal and unacceptable form of child abuse and a form of violence against girls and women that the Government are committed to eradicating. Our focus is prevention. In February 2011, the Government launched multi-agency practice guidelines for front-line professionals including police officers and social workers. The guidelines aim to raise awareness of FGM, highlight the risks that people should be aware of and set out clearly the steps that should be taken to safeguard children and women from this abuse. The guidelines are a key step in ensuring that professionals are able and confident to intervene to protect girls at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/2">The basic training provided to police officers already includes FGM and the National Policing Improvement Agency is currently working on enhancing and expanding this element.

Part B includes health and social care services and does not prescribe mandatory procedures and timescales. The requirements for Part B services are that procurement processes must be transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory. These requirements have been reflected in guidance to commissioners on procurement of health services, first published in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.2/1">Under our proposals to raise the participation age, 16 to 18 years-olds will have a duty to participate, but not necessarily in full-time education. Young people aged 16 to 18 will still be able to leave school and have a range of options, and many young people will also undertake part-time work while they are studying.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/2">Transport represents one of the main costs associated with participation post-16. That is why the &#163;180 million 16 to 19 bursary funding introduced from September 2011 will have the flexibility to help meet transport costs for individual students where those costs have been identified as a real barrier to their participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/3">This sits alongside the duty on local authorities to publish a statement each year that sets out the travel arrangements they consider necessary to enable young people of sixth form age to attend post-16 education.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.5/1">All primary teachers meet the qualified teacher status standards. The standards include the expectation that trainees know and understand the relevant curricula applicable to the age ranges that they are training to teach. All primary trainees are therefore expected to demonstrate that they can teach physical education lessons before they are awarded qualified teacher status. The delivery and cost of this training is embedded within initial teacher training (ITT) courses and will vary across programmes and ITT providers, as well as the needs of the individual trainee. It is therefore not possible to estimate a cost for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.5/2">Training of serving teachers is a matter for the employing school.

	<p pid="a.480.5/1">SkillsActive is the sector skills council for active leisure, learning and well-being, licensed by the Government and driven by the needs of employers. Sector skills councils are recognised by the Government as independent, employer-led organisations whose role is to ensure that the skills system is driven by the needs of employers. A key aspect of SkillsActive's work is to develop a framework of occupational standards that meet the needs of employers and underpin job roles in the sector. SkillsActive has the power to intervene in disagreements between bodies regarding qualifications and training, but its role is to represent the employer view on what they need for their staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.481.5/1">The Cultural Olympiad will produce dividends for young people aspiring to careers in the creative and cultural industries.

	<p pid="a.481.5/2">LOCOG is managing the Cultural Olympiad. To date, LOCOG has raised around &#163;97 million of investment for the Cultural Olympiad. The majority of this money is input directly by the funding partners to the projects and programmes they are supporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.5/3">The purpose of the Cultural Olympiad is to be a cultural festival that complements the sporting excellence of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. However, as with the 2012 Games themselves, we hope there will be community, social and economic spin-offs that will live beyond the Cultural Olympiad.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.5/4">A number of projects are encouraging young people to pursue careers in the creative industries-for example: Film Nation: Shorts, providing 14 to 25 year-olds with opportunities to learn film-making skills, with access to professional equipment and support; the Legacy Trust UK, funding programmes in various parts of the UK to enhance young people's skills, confidence and opportunities to interact with local creative and cultural industries; and CREATE Jobs, supported by Arts Council England, a scheme providing new ways into the creative and cultural industries, offering mentoring, traineeships, work experience, apprenticeships and careers fairs and focusing on hard-to- reach young people in the London 2012 host boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.5/5">The Arts Council-supported project CREATE Jobs will include mentoring, traineeships, work experience, apprenticeships and careers fairs. To date, some of the most innovative and interesting employers in the cultural and creative industries have signed up to be a part of the programme. Other ACE projects also enhance young people's employability, from basic through to vocational skills.</p>

In Ethiopia, where food price inflation is currently at 45.3 per cent, economic governance has a major impact on national food security. In Kenya, DfID considers that the lack of investment in long-term food security in the arid lands and lack of progress on related policy and institutional issues has compounded the food security situation in that region.</p>
